The attached document represents the most complete and accurate version available 
based on original copies culled from the files of the FOMC Secretariat at the Board 
of Governors of the Federal Reserve System.  This electronic document was created 
through a comprehensive digitization process which included identifying the best-
preserved paper copies, scanning those copies,1 and then making the scanned 
versions text-searchable.2   Though a stringent quality assurance process was 
employed, some imperfections may remain. 
 
Please note that some material may have been redacted from this document if that

format.  All scanned images were deskewed (to remove the effects of printer- and scanner-introduced 
tilting) and lightly cleaned (to remove dark spots caused by staple holes, hole punches, and other 
blemishes caused after initial printing). 
 
2 A two-step process was used.  An advanced optical character recognition computer program (OCR) 
first created electronic text from the document image.  Where the OCR results were inconclusive, 
staff checked and corrected the text as necessary.  Please note that the numbers and text in charts and

MONEY MARKET CONDITIONS

Recent developments

(1) Both RPD and M1 appear to be growing at annual rates below

the low ends of the Committee's March-April ranges of tolerance, as shown

in the table. Expansion in M2 also seems to be on the slow side, at the

low end of the range specified four weeks ago. Growth in the bank credit

proxy--at a 17 per cent annual rate for the March-April period--appears

to be somewhat faster than expected at the time of the last Committee

meeting.

* Raised to 7 per cent on April 11.

(2) The shortfalls in RPD and the money supply aggregates relative

to earlier expectations are attributable almost entirely to slower than

anticipated growth in private demand deposits. The reasons for this are



-2-

obscure as usual, but one factor may be that processing of Treasury refund

checks has been slower than we had anticipated, thus keeping Treasury tax

and loan balances higher and private demand balances lower than projected.

Also, the steepness of the rise in short-term interest rates since late

last year may be producing a dampening effect on money demands with a

somewhat shorter time lag than usual. In addition, the dramatic first

quarter upsurge in consumer spending and the accompanying sharp advances

in retail prices might have caused households to draw down money balances

below normal levels.

(3) Early in the inter-meeting period, RPD and the money

supply aggregates all appeared to be growing at rates within the Committee's

March-April ranges of tolerance. While the Desk in this period continued

to follow a reserve strategy expected to produce a Federal funds rate

averaging around 7 per cent, unexpected shortfalls in reserve availability

from other reserve factors produced an average funds rate closer to 7-1/8

per cent. When it became clear, in late March, that RPD and M1 were

running below their desired growth ranges and that M2 was at the bottom

of its range, the Desk adopted a reserve strategy expected to be consistent

with a Federal funds rate averaging around 7 per cent, but with doubts

resolved on the side of less tautness. By the statement week of April 11,

the average Federal funds rate had dropped to 6.84 per cent. Late on

Wednesday, April 11, a majority of Committee members concurred in the

Chairman's recommendation that the low end of the range of tolerance for

the funds rate be raised from 6-3/4 to 7 per cent for the remaining part

of the intermeeting period, and the Desk has since sought to keep reserve

availability correspondingly firm.



-3-

(4) Other short-term interest rates continued under general

upward pressure during the early weeks of the intermeeting period, but

after early April this trend was reversed, as the market came to expect

an early announcement of a stronger controls program and the view

developed that no further near-term tightening (and possibly some easing)

of monetary policy was likely. Over the full intermeeting period, short-

term rates showed mixed changes. Yields on both Treasury bills and

Federal agency issues with 6-month to 1-year maturities are down

significantly on balance. The 3-month Treasury bill--presently at

around 6.20 per cent--has shown little net change since the last meeting,

although it did at one point reach an intermeeting high of around 6-1/2

per cent. Rates on large CD's and commercial paper increased on balance

by 25 -- 35 basis points, reflecting the pressure of continued rapid net

issuance of CD's by large banks.

(5) Yields on longer-term securities showed little response

to the further rise of short-term rates early in the intermeeting period

and have generally experienced net declines over the period as a whole.

This relative strength was attributable partly to the rather moderate

volume of new longer-term debt offerings. In addition, following the

early April shift in market expectations, professionals moved to reduce

their short positions. Rates in secondary mortgage markets, on the other

hand, continued to edge higher over the period, and there were field reports

of some upward pressure on new mortgage commitment rates as well.

(6) The table on the following page shows (in percentage

annual rates of change) selected monetary and financial flows over

various time periods.

Prospective developments

(7) Longer-run targets and associated April-May ranges for

key variables are shown below in summary form for Committee consideration

(with figures for aggregates representing seasonally adjusted annual

rates of change). Of the alternatives shown, alternative B--which is

indexed by a long-run growth rate of 5-1/4 per cent for M 1--represents

essentially a continuation of longer-run monetary targets adopted by

the Committee at its last meeting (stipulated at the time as 5--5-1/2

per cent for M1). Alternative A represents an easing of policy, and

alternative C a tightening.

(8) The staff expects that the alternative B path for the

aggregates would be achieved with little change from recently prevailing

money market conditions. Given such conditions--centering on a Federal

funds rate of 7 per cent--growth in M1 is expected to be somewhat

greater than it has been on balance over the first three months of the

year. In April-May, a growth rate of 4--6 per cent for M1 is indicated.

During that period, income tax refunds are likely to add somewhat to

private demand balances. In addition, continued strong expansion in

economic activity will likely lead to a reassertion of the underlying

growth trend in transactions demands for cash. On the basis of historical

experience, the sharp drop in demand for money relative to GNP growth

that developed in the first quarter seems very unlikely to persist.

(9) With a Federal funds rate around 7 per cent, interest

rates generally are expected to show only minor changes on balance over

the next month. However, the recent stability in rates has been based

in part on expectations that a stiffer controls program is in the offing.

If this comes to seem less likely, upward rate adjustments might well

take place. Apart from attitudinal shifts, however, basic supply-demand

conditions do not suggest significant further upward pressure on rates in

the near-term. The Treasury will be announcing a refunding of $4.3 billion

of publicly-held issues on Wednesday, April 25. But this refunding will be

in a quarter when the Treasury will be repaying about $5 billion of debt on

balance. Some attrition in this refunding and the maturity of $2 billion

of mid-April tax bills could keep Treasury bill rates from rising signifi-

cantly from current levels.



-7-

(10) It is not clear, though, that long-term interest rates

have yet fully adjusted to earlier advances in short-term rates.

Mortgage interest rates seem likely to rise further in view of our

projection that savings inflows will continue to moderate, given the

current level of short-term market rates and assuming no rise in Q

ceilings. The development of a dual prime loan rate is likely over time

to push some bank borrowers back into the open market, with consequent

upward pressure on the commercial paper market and, to a lesser extent,

on corporate bond rates. Upward yield pressures in bond markets are

likely to be limited by the basically light calendar of corporate bond

offerings scheduled thus far, although increased Federal agency issues

and possible debt lengthening by the Treasury could be adding to the

supply of longer-maturity debt.

(11) The sensitivity of the current market is such that a

drop in the funds rate to the 6-1/2 per cent lower end of the alternative

B range is likely to be accompanied by a drop in the 3-month Treasury

bill rate to under 6 per cent and an accompanying decline in long-term

rates. On the other hand, a rise in the funds rate to the 7-1/2 per

cent top of the range would exert upward pressure on the whole interest

rate structure, including the discount rate.

(12) Bank credit growth in April-May, though expected to slow

from the exceptional pace of recent months, still is likely to be fairly

substantial by historical standards, reflecting continued strength in

business and consumer demands for bank credit. Given roughly the pre-

vailing structure of short-term market rates, growth in time deposits



-8-

other than large CD's probably will be quite moderate--at around a

6 per cent annual rate in April-May. Banks are expected to con-

tinue adding substantially to CD's outstanding, although the rate of

growth should decrease somewhat as businesses shift more of their borrowing

to the open narket.

(13) Under alternative A, the staff would expect a decline

in the Federal funds rate to accompany an effort to encourage more rapid

growth in the aggregates, and vice-versa for alternative C. However,

even-keel may constrain the Committee's willingness to adopt reserve

objectives that lead to changes in money narket conditions of the

dimensions of alternatives A and C. If the Committee were to choose

alternative A or C, but limit the downward or upward movement of the

funds rate to smaller dimensions than indicated, it would, of course,

extend the period needed to achieve the aggregate objectives of either

alternative.



Proposed directive

(14) Presented below are three alternative formulations

for the operational paragraph of the directive, which might be taken

to correspond to the similarly lettered policy alternatives discussed

in the preceding section. For all three alternatives it is proposed

to add a reference to Treasury financing because of the regular May

refinancing to be announced late this month, and to delete the reference

to international developments because only a moderate reflow into dollars

has developed in recent weeks and exchange markets have been relatively

quiet. Also, for the sake of clarity, it is proposed to describe the

conditions sought as those "consistent with" rather than those "that

will support" the aggregate objectives described. Retention of the

reference to credit market developments is proposed only for alternative

C, the one alternative that contemplates a significant tightening of

the money market.

Alternative A

To implement this policy, while taking account of [DEL: possible

domestic credit market and international developments] FORTHCOMING

TREASURY FINANCING, the Committee seeks to achieve bank reserve

and money market conditions CONSISTANT WITH [DEL: somewhat] FASTER [DEL: slower]

growth in monetary aggregates over the months ahead [DEL: than occurred

on growth in the past 6 months.



-10-

Alternative B

To implement this policy, while taking account of

[DEL: possible domestic credit market and international develop-

ments] FORTHCOMING TREASURY FINANCING, the Committee seeks

to achieve bank reserve and money market conditions

CONSISTENT WITH [DEL: that will support somewhat slower] MODERATE

growth in monetary aggregates over the months ahead [DEL: than

occurred on average in the past 6 months].

Alternative C

To implement this policy, while taking account of

FORTHCOMING TREASURY FINANCING AND possible [DEL: domestic] credit

market [DEL: and international] developments, the Committee seeks to

achieve bank reserve and money market conditions CONSISTENT

WITH MODEST [DEL: that will support somewhat slower] growth in

monetary aggregates over the months ahead [DEL: than occurred on

average in the past 6 months].
