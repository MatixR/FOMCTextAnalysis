The attached document represents the most complete and accurate version available 
based on original copies culled from the files of the FOMC Secretariat at the Board 
of Governors of the Federal Reserve System.  This electronic document was created 
through a comprehensive digitization process which included identifying the best-
preserved paper copies, scanning those copies,1 and then making the scanned 
versions text-searchable.2   Though a stringent quality assurance process was 
employed, some imperfections may remain.

format.  All scanned images were deskewed (to remove the effects of printer- and scanner-introduced 
tilting) and lightly cleaned (to remove dark spots caused by staple holes, hole punches, and other 
blemishes caused after initial printing). 
 
2 A two-step process was used.  An advanced optical character recognition computer program (OCR) 
first created electronic text from the document image.  Where the OCR results were inconclusive, 
staff checked and corrected the text as necessary.  Please note that the numbers and text in charts and

Recent developments

(1) During November, growth of M1 was more rapid than anticipated,

rising at an annual rate of nearly 11 per cent, but 11 has changed little

on balance in recent weeks. For the two-month target period as a whole,

the annual growth rate appears to be running at around 6-1/2 per cent,

close to the upper limit of the Committee's range of tolerance, as the

table shows. With recent expansion of time deposits other than large CD's

slowing a little more than expected, growth in M2 appears to be only a

little above the mid-point of its two-month range of tolerance. The

flattening of M1 in early December lends some credence to the view that the

November upsurge reflected essentially temporary influences, including a

rise in foreign commercial and central bank deposits and increased pre-

cautionary holdings by the public stemming from the energy crisis and the

associated stock market decline.

(2) RPD's appear to have contracted during the November-December

target period at about a 5.0 per cent annual rate. This shortfall was

greater than allowed for by the Committee's range of tolerance. As shown

in Table 2, most of the shortfall in RPD's was attributable to a weaker than

expected performance of large CD's (subject over most of the period to a

reserve requirement of 11 per cent). Relatively more reserves than

anticipated were absorbed by private demand deposits.

rate to rise toward the 10-1/2 per cent upper limit of its range of

tolerance. Because of the uncertainties in the economic outlook stemming

from the mid-East oil embargo and the sensitive state of financial market

psychology, however, the Committee directed the Account Manager to continue

aiming for a weekly average Federal funds rate around 10-1/4 per cent.

In the first two statement weeks of December the funds rate actually

averaged 10.17 and 10.04 per cent respectively, with the rate dropping

sharply on the last day of both weeks. Member bank borrowing at the

Federal Reserve amounted to $1.5 billion in the first week of December,

with excess reserves rising to $375 million, but in the following week

excess reserves were negative, by $244 million, and borrowing dropped back

to $1.3 billion.

(4) Since the last Committee meeting, most short- and long-term

market interest rates have fluctuated in response to changing expectations

with regard to monetary policy and the impact of the energy crisis on the

economy. On balance since the last Committee meeting, most short-term

rates have declined somewhat. For the most part, the decline in these

rates occurred following announcement of the reduction in marginal

reserve requirements on December 7. The declines ranged generally from

1/8 to 3/8 of a percentage point. Most recently the 3-month Treasury

bill rate was bid at 7.53 per cent. A few large banks have raised their

prime lending rate to 10 per cent, but the higher rate has shown no

tendency to spread through the banking system.

rates of change) selected monetary and financial flows over various recent

Prospective developments

(6) Of the three alternatives summarized below for Committee

consideration, alternative B includes a growth rate for M1 over the

first half of 1974 that is consistent with the extension to mid-year of

the 5 per cent growth path adopted by the Committee at its previous meeting.

This growth path starts from the revised September 1973 base (which is about

$2-1/2 billion above the old series, as was indicated in the previous bluebook).

In alternative B, M1 is targeted to increase at a 4-1/2 per cent annual rate

from December '73-to June '74. This growth rate is lower than 5 per cent to

compensate for the overshoot in M1 growth in the fourth quarter. As shown in

the chart on the next page, the estimated level of the money stock in December

is about $1 billion above the path level for that month. Alternatives A and C

involve more and less rapid growth in the aggregates, respectively. (Detailed

figures for the alternatives are shown on page 6a; all figures for the aggregates

are based on revised data, though revisions are still in a preliminary

stage).

(7) With regard to money market conditions, the staff would

expect some decline in the Federal funds rate between now and mid-January

if the Committee chooses to provide the reserves consistent with alternative B.

A funds rate range of 9--10-1/4 per cent is shown for that alternative. If

the rate were to drop toward the lower end of the range over the next few

weeks, the staff would not anticipate that any significant further reductions

would be needed in the first few months of 1974 to be consistent with the

targeted growth rates for money.

(8) The decline in the funds rate expected under alternative B

(and the greater decline expected under alternative A) essentially reflects

the substantial downward revision in the staff's projection of growth in

nominal GNP and the associated weakening in the demand for money and credit.

At the time of the last meeting the staff was projecting about a 9 and

8 per cent rate of growth in nominal GNP in the first and second quarters

of 1974 respectively; currently, the projected rates of growth are about

6 and 5 per cent for the two quarters.

(9) If the Committee wishes to maintain money market conditions

close to those currently prevailing, the staff would expect growth in the

aggregates to slow to alternative C dimensions. With the Federal funds

rate unchanged, it is likely that market interest rates--particularly

short-term rates--would adjust upward from current levels in the process

of re-establishing a more normal relationship to the funds rate. Current

levels of market rates are low relative to the funds rate--in part,

apparently, because market participants are anticipating an economic

slowdown and the money market easing that has accompanied slowdowns

in the past.



-8-

(10) Market interest rates, however, do not appear to have fully

discounted future declines in the funds rate. Thus, an actual drop in the

funds rate, such as would be likely to occur under alternative B, might

trigger sizable further declines in short-term interest rates and also

some decline in long rates. Expectational forces probably would carry market

rates down in the short run by more than is sustainable over the longer run,

however, assuming the funds rate in the early months of next year remained

in the 9 per cent plus range. On balance, over the next few weeks the

3-month bill rate is likely to decline into a 6-1/2--7 per cent if the

funds rate drops to 9-1/2 per cent or somewhat below. This assumes no

substantial central bank sales of Treasury securities as a result of reflows

of dollars from abroad.

(11) The greater decline in the funds rate under alternative A,

as compared with B, would intensify market expectations of declining

interest rates. If the funds rate were to drop rapidly and to fall below

9 per cent, the 3-month bill rate might well go to 6 per cent, and perhaps

a little lower, at least temporarily. Market expectations of a decline in

the discount rate would become much more prevalent.

(12) Among the assumptions we have made in working out the

various monetary and interest rate relationships are: (1) moderate growth

in large negotiable CD's, in some part reflecting the lower cost of those

funds resulting from the recent reduction in marginal reserve requirements;

(2) continued fairly strong short-term credit demands by business (at

least in the early part of next year when inventory accumulation is expected

to be strong), but only moderate business loan growth at banks unless the

prime loan rate drops relative to the commercial paper rate; (3) no Treasury



-9-

cash borrowing until March (unless foreign central banks find it necessary

to redeem sizable amounts of Treasury specials) and sharply diminished

Federal agency borrowing; and (4) moderate growth in consumer-type time

deposits at banks (under alternative C) and more rapid growth as market

interest rates decline (under alternatives B and A) as banks reduce time

deposit offering rates only with a lag.



-10-

Proposed directive language

(13) Presented below are three alternative formulations for

the operational paragraph of the directive, which are intended to

correspond to the similarly lettered policy alternatives discussed in

the preceding section. As will be noted, alternatives A and C refer to

growth rates in the aggregates "so far this year." For the period

through November, these are as follows in terms of the revised series:

M 1, 6.0 per cent; M2, 8.8 per cent; and the bank credit proxy, 11.1 per

cent.

Alternative A

To implement this policy, while taking account of inter-

national and domestic financial market developments, the Committee

seeks to achieve bank reserve and money market conditions con-

sistent with [DEL: moderate] growth in monetary aggregates over the

months ahead AT ABOUT THE RATES PREVAILING SO FAR THIS YEAR.

Alternative B

To implement this policy, while taking account of inter-

national and domestic financial market developments, the Committee

seeks to achieve bank reserve and money market conditions con-

sistent with SOMEWHAT SLOWER growth in monetary aggregates over

the months ahead THAN HAS OCCURRED SO FAR THIS YEAR.

Alternative C

To implement this policy, while taking account of inter-

national and domestic financial market developments, the Committee

seeks to achieve bank reserve and money market conditions con-

sistent with [DEL: moderate] SLOWER growth in monetary aggregates over

the months ahead THAN HAS OCCURRED SO FAR THS YEAR.
