The attached document represents the most complete and accurate version available 
based on original copies culled from the files of the FOMC Secretariat at the Board 
of Governors of the Federal Reserve System.  This electronic document was created 
through a comprehensive digitization process which included identifying the best-
preserved paper copies, scanning those copies,1 and then making the scanned 
versions text-searchable.2   Though a stringent quality assurance process was 
employed, some imperfections may remain.

MONEY MARKET CONDITIONS

Recent developments

(1) After expanding at a 13.7 per cent annual rate in

October, M1 remained unchanged on average during November. Available

data for December suggest a resumption of moderate growth, and for

the November-December period M1 is now projected to rise at a 2.1

per cent annual rate--somewhat below the Committee's operating range.

Despite the efforts of some institutions to slow inflows of high-cost

term funds by cutting rates or reducing advertising, growth of savings

and consumer-type time deposits at banks and thrift institutions has

continued at a rapid pace. Indeed, growth of time and savings deposits

(excluding CD's) at commercial banks is running somewhat stronger

than anticipated, and thus M2 is expected to increase at an 11.2 per

cent rate in the November-December period--near the midpoint of the

range specified by the Committee. With large CD's and interbank deposits

also rising unexpectedly and adding to the demand for reserves, nonbor-

rowed reserves appear to be increasing at a 7.5 per cent rate over the

two-month policy period.1/

1/ Appendix A contains a discussion of the actual behavior of non-
borrowed reserves in the weeks between the November and December
meetings relative to the behavior that was expected to be consis-
tent with the Committee's short-run ranges for monetary growth.

(2) Data available shortly after the November meeting indicated

that while M2 growth would be around the mid-point of the range set

by the Committee, M1 growth would be in the lower half of its range.

Consequently, the Desk proceeded to implement the Committee's directive

by seeking a reduction in the Federal funds rate from the prevailing

level of 5 per cent--first to 4-7/8 per cent and then to 4¾ per cent.

As December progressed, incoming data suggested a further weakening in

M1 growth, and the Desk became somewhat more accommodative in the pro-

vision of reserves. Most recently the Desk has been seeking reserve

conditions consistent with a Federal funds rate around 4-5/8 per cent.

(3) Market rates of interest have declined sharply since

the November Committee meeting, reaching lows for the current cycle.

Yields on most short-term instruments have dropped about 40 to 60

basis points, and bond yields have eased roughly 30 basis points.

Much of the impetus for the market rally was supplied by System actions:

the lowering of the Desk's funds rate objective and the quarter-point



cut in the discount rate announced on November 19. Expectations

of additional easing actions by the System, fostered by evidence of

sluggish growth in M1 and slow economic expansion, also contributed to

the rally. The prime lending rate at most commercial banks has declined

from 6½ to 6¼ per cent, and one major institution has posted a 6 per

cent rate. In the mortgage sector, secondary market rates have

fallen in sympathy with other yields, but rates on new home loans in

the primary market have been stable. Stock prices have risen signifi-

cantly since the November meeting.

(4) In November, total short-term business credit--that is,

business loans plus nonfinancial commercial paper--rose substantially

for the second consecutive month. At the same time, public bond offerings

by domestic corporations fell to the lowest level of the year. In

December, however, the volume of such offerings rebounded, partly

because of the decline in interest rates. Tax-exempt bond offerings

have remained at a high level, reflecting in part some acceleration of

planned borrowings. In the Government sector, the Treasury has borrowed

$6 billion, net, since the November meeting, primarily through an

addition to the November 2-year note and the sale of 4-year notes

and 132-day cash management bills.

percentage annual rates of change) related monetary and financial flows

Prospective developments

(6) Summarized below are three sets of short-run specifi-

cations for the monetary aggregates and the Federal funds rate. More

detailed data, including longer-run growth rates, are shown in the

tables on pp. 5a and 5b.

M2  9½-13½ 9-13 8½-12½

Federal funds rate 3¾-4½ 4¼-5 4¾-5½
(Intermeeting period)

(7) Alternative B assumes that prevailing money market

conditions--indexed by a Federal funds rate around 4-5/8 per cent--

would be maintained between now and the next Committee meeting. M1

in the December-January period would, in consequence, be expected to

expand in a 2½-6½ per cent annual rate range. The mid-point of that

growth range is close to the average rate of growth in M1 over the

past six months--a period when the rate of expansion in nominal GNP

had slowed. A faster growth in M1 is expected to develop later in the

winter in reflection of the pick-up in economic expansion that is

currently projected by the staff.

(8) A continued sizable increase in M2 would be expected

over the next few weeks, given prevailing money market conditions.

Growth in M2 for the December-January period is projected in a 9-13

per cent annual rate range. This reflects continued rapid expansion

in time and savings deposits other than money market CD's at banks.

The rate of growth in such deposits, however, is not expected to

accelerate from the pace of recent months despite recent declines in

market interest rates, as banks appear to be in process of lowering

offering rates on certain time certificates.

(9) Basically, credit demands over the next few weeks and

into early 1977 are likely to be generally moderate and will probably

have little net impact on the current level of market rates. Market

participants, however, remain quite sensitive to possible monetary

actions. For example, with the 3-month bill rate about 35 basis points

below the funds rate and dealer holdings of securities large,

it appears that the market is expecting a lower funds rate. Thus, if

the funds rate does not decline further, there could be a technical

re-adjustment in rate structure. Bill rates could rise somewhat. On

the other hand, the primary mortgage rate is likely to decline over the

next few weeks--even assuming no change in the funds rate--in lagged

response to earlier declines in market rates.

(10) As time goes on, and the pace of economic activity

picks up, private credit demands are likely to strengthen. Treasury

borrowing needs in the first quarter will be substantial and perhaps

more than the market is currently anticipating. Against this back-

ground, we would expect interest rates to begin rising by spring of

next year if growth in M1 is kept to around the mid-point of the



-7-

4½-6½ per cent range adopted by the FOMC for the QIII '76-QIII '77

period. If growth in GNP during the first three quarters of 1977 is

at about the 11 per cent annual rate projected by the staff on the

assumption that taxes are cut, we would anticipate that the funds rate

may rise to an average of around 6 per cent in the third quarter of

next year, as shown in appendix table II. On the other hand, if there

were no additional fiscal stimulus, we would expect a smaller rise

in interest rates from current levels--perhaps an increase in the

funds rate to 5¼ per cent or so by the third quarter. This would of

course,mainly reflect the weaker expansion in nominal GNP and

transactions demand for money.

(11) Alternative A involves an easing of the money market

between now and the next Committee meeting, with the funds rate

dropping to the mid-point of a 3¾-4½ per cent range. Further declines

in market rates are likely to be generated, though such declines will

be limited if incoming economic evidence continues to suggest a more

vigorous economy and therefore leads market participants to believe

that interest rates may soon rise. Banks, in such circumstances,

may seek to issue money market CD's more aggressively--particularly

longer maturities--in an effort to lock in favorable yields. And

corporate and municipal borrowers may continue to accelerate marketings

of new bond issues.

(12) An easing of the money market would generate only

slightly more growth in M1 and M2 over the December-January period

than under alternative B. However, the lower level of market rates



will, with a lag, tend to strengthen the demand for money further.

Thus, M1 growth over the longer-run would likely be higher than the

mid-point of the Committee's one-year range. As a result, to contain

growth within desired bounds interest rates under this alternative may

have to rise to somewhat higher levels than under alternative B and

the rise may begin sooner.

(13) Alternative C contemplates a tightening in the money

market over the next few weeks, with the funds rate rising to around

5-1/8 per cent. A substantial upward re-adjustment of market rates

would be likely to follow, since most market participants appear to have

adjusted their current positions to expectations that the funds rate

will either decline or remain about unchanged over the near-term.

The 3-month bill rate, for example, might move up to the area of 5-5¼

per cent. After the initial reaction, however, further rate increases

might be quite limited. Some rate increases, particularly in longer-

term markets, could be partly reversed as the funds rate tended to

level off at the new higher level. The staff would expect that little

further increase in the funds rate would, in practice, be required to

achieve the FOMC's longer-run monetary growth rates.



Proposed directive

(14) Given below is a proposed operational paragraph for the

directive if the Committee wishes to continue formulating its instruc-

tions in terms of desired growth in monetary aggregates over the months

ahead. No alternatives are presented for this formulation, in the

expectation that the reference to desired growth will be taken to apply

to the longer-term targets and that at this meeting the Committee will

not reconsider those targets.

"Monetary Aggregates" Proposal

To implement this policy, while taking account of develop-

ments in domestic and international financial markets, the Committee

seeks to achieve bank reserve and money market conditions consistent

with moderate growth in monetary aggregates over the period ahead.

(15) Should the Committee desire to place main emphasis on

bank reserve and money market conditions, the language needed would

depend on the specific conditions sought. Three alternative "money

market" directives intended to correspond to the similarly lettered

policy alternatives are given below.

funds purchases. Weekly data are daily averages for statement weeks, except for corporate and municipal issues in syndicate which are Friday figures.

NOTE: Weekly data for columns 1 to 4 are statement week averages of daily data. Columns 5 and 6 are 1-day Wednesday quotes (prior to 1976, figures shown
are for 60-89 day and 90-119 day ranges, respectively). For columns 7 and 10, the weekly date is the mid-point of the calendar week over which data are
averaged. Columns 8 and 9 are 1-day quotes for Friday and Thursday, respectively, following the end of the statement week. Column 11 gives FNMA auction
data for Monday preceding the end of the statement week. Column 12 is a 1-day quote for the Monday preceding the end of the statement week. The FNMA
auction yield is the average yield in bi-weekly auction for short-term forward commitments for Government underwritten mortgages. GNMA yields are average
net yields to investors on mortgage-backed securities for immediate delivery, assuming prepayment in 12 years on pools of 30-year FHA/VA mortgages
carrying the coupon rate 50 basis points below the current FHA/VA ceiling.
