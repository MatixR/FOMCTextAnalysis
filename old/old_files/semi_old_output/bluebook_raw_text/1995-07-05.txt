MONETARY POLICY ALTERNATIVES

Prepared for the Federal Open Market Committee

By the staff Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System

MONETARY POLICY ALTERNATIVES

Recent Developments

(1) The Committee's decision at the May 23 meeting to keep

reserve conditions steady came as no surprise to market participants,

and most interest rates showed little immediate change. In subsequent

weeks, federal funds generally traded close to the intended rate of

6 percent. Desk operations were complicated by large swings in the

Treasury's balance, mostly related to tax flows; by fluctuations in

required reserves, which partly reflected the implementation or exten-

sion of retail sweep programs by two large regional banks; and by an

unexpected slowdown in currency. Also, the desk continued to monitor

closely the demand for excess reserves, which has run on the lean

side.1

(2) Despite the stability of the federal funds rate, other

short-term rates fell 1/4 percentage point over the intermeeting

period, mostly owing to revisions to the prospects for the economy and

monetary policy. When the Committee met last month, market partici-

pants apparently viewed the weakish cast to real activity as raising

the odds of some policy easing later in the year. Futures quotes on

federal funds and Eurodollar rates, for example, tilted down slightly

1. In the three maintenance periods completed over the intermeeting
period, excess reserves averaged a shade under $900 million and banks
appeared to hold off meeting their reserve needs until late in those
periods. Over the last year, depositories have been reducing their
excess reserves, evidently as a response to the rising cost of over-
night funds. The domestic desk has retained the formal assumption of
$1 billion of excess reserves, but has been dealing with it very
flexibly. The allowance for adjustment plus seasonal borrowing, which
began the intermeeting period at $175 million, was raised $50 million
to accommodate the summer upswing in its seasonal component. Borrow-
ing averaged a touch below its allowance, except in the most recently
completed maintenance period, when a money-center bank experiencing
technical difficulties tapped the window in size over a weekend.



(chart). Many of the economic data releases that followed, parti-

cularly the decline in payroll employment posted for May, made easing

appear even more probable. In recent days, however, upticks in

several indicators have tempered the market's expectation regarding

policy ease. Nonetheless, money-market futures rates still point down

over the balance of 1995 and by more than they did in mid-May.

(3) In capital markets, the yield curve for Treasury coupon

securities shifted down 20 to 30 basis points on balance. The bond-

market rally, which lasted through most of the intermeeting period,

was helped along at times by evidence that major economies abroad were

weaker than had been anticipated and by a political dialogue at home

indicating that meaningful progress in narrowing future federal budget

deficits might be in the cards. A significant portion of the decline

in nominal yields would seem to embody a revision to real interest

rates; some trimming of inflation expectations cannot be ruled out,

but readings from surveys are ambiguous. Corporate and municipal

yields have not matched the decline in Treasury rates, and risk

spreads, particularly for junk bonds, have edged higher. Discussions

of a possible flat income tax, which would erode the benefits of tax-

exempt debt, may have contributed to the run-up in the ratio of tax-

exempt-to-taxable yields. The drop in interest rates helped to lift

the stock market, with most major equity indexes gaining at least

2-1/2 percent over the intermeeting period. With the fiscal outlook

uncertain and the sense prevalent in the marketplace that the stance

of monetary policy might shift over coming months, measures of price

volatility moved higher; however, volatility--both realized as mea-

sured from actual rate changes or expected as implied from options

prices--remains below the level posted in the spring of last year.

(4) The dollar's weighted average exchange value has declined

about 3-1/4 percent since the May meeting. Long-term interest rates

abroad were little changed, on balance, while short-term rates, on

average, edged lower. Essentially all of the dollar's net decline

over the intermeeting period was posted in the week following the FOMC

meeting, mainly in response to weak U.S. economic data. On May 31,

U.S. monetary authorities initiated concerted intervention purchases

of dollars against marks and yen, which caught market participants by

surprise and seemed to have a significant short-run effect of boosting

the dollar. The System purchased $250 million against marks and a

like amount against yen; the Treasury bought equal amounts. During

June, the dollar has traded in a fairly narrow range, despite substan-

tial further variations in U.S. interest rates and changing prospects

for an agreement (eventually reached) regarding U.S.-Japan auto trade.

(5) The decline in U.S. interest rates over most maturities

in recent months seems to have contributed to a surge in the expansion

of M2. This aggregate increased at rates of 5 percent and 11-3/4

percent in May and June, respectively.2 The performance of M2 over

the past two months has pushed the growth of this aggregate from the

fourth quarter of 1994 to June up to a 4 percent rate and placed it in

the upper portion of its annual range. Growth of M2 for the first

half of the year has been considerably stronger than anticipated in

2. M1 actually contracted over the two months, as the implementa-
tion of a retail sweep program and an extension of the
program already in place transferred $12 billion from
reservable transaction deposits to savings and MMDAs. Those trans-
fers, of course, are internal to M2. In the absence of these shifts,
Ml would have grown at a 3-1/4 percent rate over the two months.
Total reserves fell at a 6-1/2 percent annual rate over May and June.
It appears that net foreign currency shipments slowed significantly
and total currency grew at only a 3-1/4 percent rate over the two
months. The monetary base expanded at a 2-1/2 percent rate over that
period.



the January bluebook, especially under the tighter alternative se-

lected by the Committee in February, despite slower spending than was

forecast at the beginning of the year. Market rates, particularly at

intermediate- and long-term maturities, have been lower, on balance,

in the first half of 1995 than was expected by the staff. With rates

on M2 assets, as usual, lagging market rates, savers have reallocated

funds into deposits and money fund shares and out of market instru-

ments. The pronounced flattening of the yield curve also may have

encouraged demands for the shorter-term assets in M2. Growth in money

market funds has been particularly strong. Indicative of the sub-

stitutions out of capital market instruments, the staff's standard M2

demand model, which looks at competing rates only on short-term in-

struments, has underpredicted M2 growth in the second quarter. The

recent rapid growth in M2 should be sufficient to turn its velocity

downward in the second quarter, producing the first quarterly decline

in M2 velocity since early 1991.

(6) M3 has also expanded rapidly in May and June, at rates

of 7-3/4 percent and 13 percent, respectively. From the fourth

quarter of 1994 through June, M3 has increased at a 6-1/2 percent

rate, leaving it well above the upper bound of its 0-to-4 percent

annual range. The first-half outcome was about double the pace

anticipated by the staff in the January bluebook; in retrospect,

depositories have had larger funding needs--both bank and thrift

credit have been stronger over the first half of the year than the

staff had expected. Bank credit has expanded at a rate of 8-3/4

percent from the fourth quarter of 1994 to June, pulled along by

strength in business and consumer loans. Lower short- and inter-

mediate-term rates than in the January outlook have played some role



too: Institution-only money funds, like their retail brethren, pay

yields that lag movements in money-market rates. In the past two

months, the strong growth of M3-type money funds has provided a

powerful boost to M3.

(7) The growth of nonfederal sector debt in April and May

appears to have picked up from its first-quarter performance of 5-1/2

percent. While timely data on household-sector borrowing is scant,

rapid growth of consumer loans at banks, especially after adjusting

for securitizations, suggests that consumer credit has continued to

expand at a double-digit clip in recent months, even as spending on

durable goods has slowed. Judging by indexes of applications, mort-

gage activity has picked up a bit, although it is still too early to

say if there has been any effect on net mortgage debt. Many cor-

porations have rushed to borrow to take advantage of lower inter-

mediate- and long-term market rates; net corporate bond issuance is

estimated to have picked up substantially in May and appears to have

been stronger in June. Reflecting the shift to capital market financ-

ing, perhaps along with some decrease in inventory investment, bank

business lending has flagged of late. Net tax-exempt debt has ex-

tended its runoff in recent months, as advance-refunded issues con-

tinue to be retired. From the fourth quarter of 1994 through May,

total nonfinancial debt grew at about a 5-1/2 percent rate, a pace

about maintained by its private and federal components and up a bit

from its growth in the second half of last year. All told, this

performance, which was a shade faster than the staff had forecast in

January, placed the aggregate in the upper portion of its 3-to-7 per-

cent annual growth range.

Long-Run Scenarios

(8) This section addresses the long-run implications of vari-

ous monetary policy strategies and highlights several issues that pose

risks to the staff's assessment of output and inflation prospects.

The first set of scenarios examines three alternative strategies for

monetary policy. All three embody the same underlying assumptions

concerning macroeconomic forces and relationships; notably, they all

assume additional fiscal policy actions through the 6-year simulation

period to put the budget deficit along a path to balance early in the

next decade. The three strategies, however, embed different assump-

tions concerning the economic outcomes that the Committee pursues.

The baseline strategy begins with the Greenbook's projection for 1995

and 1996 and thereafter keeps inflation tilted down by maintaining a

small margin of economic slack. The easier and tighter strategies

extend the lower and higher funds rate scenarios in the Greenbook.

The easier strategy may be viewed as consistent with a desire to have

the unemployment rate average around its assumed natural rate over the

forecast interval, while the tighter strategy may be seen as giving

priority to approaching price stability over the next several years.

These simulations are summarized in the table and Chart 2 on the

following pages.

(9) The staff econometric model of the U.S. and foreign

economies was used to extend the baseline forecast beyond the Green-

book horizon and to derive the effects relative to the baseline of the

alternative policy strategies and of the different economic assump-

tions made below. The model includes neither forward-looking expecta-

tions nor any long-term gains in potential output from reducing infla-

tion. The projections are based on an assumed natural rate of

unemployment of 5.9 percent. Each year that the unemployment rate

exceeds its natural rate by 1 percentage point, the model predicts

that inflation will be reduced by around 1/2 percentage point. In

light of uncertainties about the relationships among economic vari-

ables and associated hazards of any forecasting exercise, the results

reported below should be read only as suggestive of the general

patterns likely to be engendered under each of the experiments.

(10) Under the baseline strategy, to effect a modest deceler-

ation of inflation, the nominal federal funds rate is held at its

current level through the first quarter of 1996 before falling to

4-3/4 percent in 1997 and drifting lower thereafter. The declines in

nominal rates reflect in part an ebbing of inflation, but also incor-

porate lower real interest rates. The real funds rate ends the decade

almost 1 percentage point below its current level, as monetary policy

responds to the influence of fiscal restraint on the equilibrium

federal funds rate. But under this strategy real rates are held

slightly above their declining equilibrium levels to maintain a margin

of slack in resource utilization and foster an ongoing deceleration in

prices. Long rates fall by half as much as the funds rate because the

anticipation of some budget deficit reduction has already been built

into long rates. Fiscal restraint and associated real rate reductions

raise gross investment (as a percent of GDP) relative to current

levels by almost 1 percentage point by the end of the decade.

(11) The 1-1/4 percent decline in the funds rate under the

easier strategy removes remaining monetary restraint and fully offsets

fiscal drag. Thus, the unemployment rate stays in the neighborhood of

3. We have made no adjustments to the assumed future level of the
NAIRU for the effects of oncoming demographic changes; nor have we
adjusted the GDP growth rates to take account of the increasing dis-
tortion associated with the decline in computer prices.



-10-

its natural rate through the 1990s. Inflation flattens out at around

3-1/4 percent, close to its current value. The drop in the federal

funds rate is concentrated at the beginning of the simulation period,

even though fiscal restraint is spread out over the entire period,

because spending reacts with longer lags to interest rates than to

fiscal policy. Moreover, in the model long-term rates do not antici-

pate the full measure of fiscal restraint and respond only sluggishly

to changes in short-term rates. (These elements are present in all

the simulations, but are illustrated most clearly under this

strategy.) If bond markets were more forward looking, policy easing

would have to be spread out over a longer period to get the same

outcome.

(12) To open an output gap sufficient to attain approximate

price stability early in the next decade, the tighter strategy in-

volves an appreciable increase in the federal funds rate by early next

year. The funds rate must fall thereafter, not only in line with

fiscal restraint and lower inflation, but also to limit overshooting

of price stability after the end of the simulation horizon. Of

course, the model does not incorporate any credibility effects from

following the tighter policy; inflation expectations move down in

lagged response to inflation itself, and the sacrifice ratio is

unaffected by the policy strategy.

(13) The recent behavior of labor compensation may be seen as

raising questions about the level of the NAIRU. Chart 3 shows the

effects on inflation of a NAIRU 1/2 percentage point lower or higher

than in the baseline, if the nominal federal funds rate were held to

its baseline path. With the predetermined path for nominal rates, the

difference in inflation begins small, but becomes larger and larger

over time as real rates deviate increasingly from their equilibrium

levels. To bring aggregate demand in line with the new level of

potential output, the real federal funds rate must adjust by about

half a percentage point in the same direction as the change in the

NAIRU. If, owing to recognition lags, the needed policy change is

delayed, or if the longer-term rate adjusts sluggishly to the funds

rate, the initial change in the nominal federal funds rate must be

appreciably larger than one-half percentage point to keep inflation

along the baseline path.

(14) Chart 4 shows the effects of shocks to the staff projec-

tion of aggregate demand. As in the previous exercise, the nominal

federal funds rate is held along its baseline path. The shocks were

designed as surprises of about half a percentage point in the personal

savings rate--well within its range of historic variation, and an

important uncertainty in the economic outlook. They could also proxy

for alternative fiscal policies. The shift in aggregate demand

creates an imbalance between it and potential output, which, in the

absence of a policy response, results in ever rising or falling infla-

tion. Even a shock of these modest proportions gives rise to a dif-

ference from the baseline in the unemployment rate of more than a half

percentage point in 1997. The equilibrium real federal funds rate

moves about one quarter of a percentage point in this example; once

again, given the lags in the effects of policy and, depending on the

dynamics of the financial markets, greater policy adjustments likely

would be needed initially to hold the inflation rate to its baseline

path.

Long-Run Ranges

Projections and Ranges for 1995

(15) As background for the Committee's discussion of its

money and credit ranges for 1995, the table below presents the staff's

projections for the aggregates under the three longer-run policy

strategies discussed in the previous section. The table also gives

two alternatives for the Committee's money and debt ranges for this

4
year. Money and debt growth rates under the baseline strategy are

the same as in the Greenbook. For the easier and tighter strategies,

the projections for M1 and M2 are based partly on adjustments derived

from the staff's standard econometric money demand models. The fore-

casts for M3 and debt under the alternatives are judgmental. Given

the timing and assumed sizes of the policy moves under the easier and

tighter strategies, monetary growth rates are affected relatively

little for 1995 as a whole.

(16) In assessing the prospects for M2 over the remainder of

the year, the staff has carried through only a part of the unusual

strength witnessed in May and June. The lagged effects of the de-

clines in interest rates in recent weeks should continue to induce

investors to shift funds into deposits in coming months, but the mag-

nitude of such flows in recent weeks has been surprising and seems

unlikely to persist. The modest backup in interest rates and narrow-

ing of the advantage of money fund yields over market rates antici-

pated in the staff forecast will also help to damp money growth.

However, nominal income is projected to expand a little faster over

the second half of the year, augmenting demands for money. Thus, M2

growth from June to December, at a 4-1/2 percent rate under the Green-

book baseline projection, is still expected to be a little higher than

its first-half pace. For 1995 as a whole, M2 is expected to rise 4

percent, placing this aggregate in the upper half of its current 1-to-

5 percent range.5 Its velocity would be flat over the year, an

outcome that would differ considerably from the substantial increases

over the past three years when M2 demand was restrained by, among

other factors, shifts into mutual funds and, in 1994, by substantial

increases in market interest rates. (The velocities of the aggregates

appear on charts 5 and 6.)

5. The staff expects M1 to be about flat over June to December and,
for the year as a whole, to fall 1/2 percent under the Greenbook base-
line projection. The weakness of this aggregate relative to nominal
GDP owes primarily to the lagged effects of higher yields on alterna-
tive short-term assets. In addition, NOW account sweeps are projected
to depress M1 about 1-1/4 percent over the year. Shipments of cur-
rency abroad are expected to lift the narrow aggregate about 1-1/2 to
2 percentage points--the same as in recent years. Mortgage refinanc-
ing activity should provide only a limited boost to demand deposits
and M1. Total reserves are likely to decline further over the balance
of the year, partly reflecting a little additional sweep activity,
while growth in the monetary base would be modest but positive.

(17) Over the second half of 1995, M3 growth is also expected

to moderate from its recent rapid pace, primarily reflecting a sharp

slowing in bank credit, as inventory financing abates, and in institu-

tion-only money funds. But, at a 4-1/2 percent rate from June to

December under the Greenbook baseline projection, the expansion of M3

should remain brisk compared with its performance of the past few

years. For 1995 as a whole, M3 is expected to rise 5-1/2 percent,

well above its current 0-to-4 percent annual range.

(18) The debt of domestic nonfinancial sectors is anticipated

by the staff to decelerate noticeably over the second half of the

year. Federal borrowing should tail off, partly in response to the

strong cash position of the Treasury resulting from unexpectedly heavy

tax receipts in the second quarter. Borrowing in the business sector

also is likely to flag a bit from its strong pace of the first half,

as the corporate financing gap shrinks in association with the slower

pace of inventory accumulation. On a fourth-quarter to fourth-quarter

basis, overall debt is projected to expand 4-3/4 percent this year

under all of the scenarios, a little above nominal income growth and

in the middle of its range.

(19) As noted, M2 and debt most likely will finish 1995 with-

in their current ranges (given as alternative I) under the Greenbook

baseline assumption of no change in the stance of monetary policy.

This outcome is likely as well under the easier and tighter policy

strategies. However, in view of the recent surge in M2 growth, there

is a distinct possibility that M2 could run above its current range

under the baseline forecast and especially under the easier strategy.

The extent of the recent surge in M2 growth suggests a significant



-15-

sensitivity of that aggregate to intermediate- and longer-term inter-

est rates, which is not captured by the standard econometric model.

M3 very likely will exceed its current range under any of the strate-

gies. In these circumstances, the Committee might choose to retain

the existing ranges for all of the aggregates and explain the expected

overshoot of the M3 range as the result of a temporary surge in inter-

mediation by depositories and money funds resulting from cyclical

swings in interest rates and inventories. The explanation could

emphasize that the FOMC does not believe that the predicted outcome

will interfere with achievement of its longer-run objectives.

(20) Alternative II would retain the current ranges for M2

and debt but raise the range for M3 by 2 percentage points, encompass-

ing expected growth of the aggregates under all three scenarios. An

increase in the M3 range likely would be needed eventually in any

case. Historically, the velocity of this aggregate tended to decline,

a result of growth of banks and thrift institutions that until the

late 1980s was usually faster than that of the economy as a whole.

From the late 1980s until recently, that tendency was reversed by

retrenchment of depository institutions, a stricter regime of supervi-

sion and regulation, and a shift toward open-market funding by bor-

rowers. Accordingly, the Committee has selected relatively low ranges

for M3 over the past few years. Looking forward, it is difficult to

predict how much spending will be financed through depository inter-

mediation, but it seems unlikely that the retrenchment of the early

1990s will be repeated. With this background, an increase in the

range for M3 could be seen as a technical adjustment to take account

of a return to more normal patterns of intermediation, with no sig-

nificance for the thrust of monetary policy. Although alternative II



-16-

would cover the staff projection for M3 in 1995 under the monetary

policy assumption in the Greenbook baseline forecast, considerable

risk would remain that it would run above even that range--a probabil-

ity that would increase if the Committee followed the easier policy

strategy.

Projections and Ranges for 1996

(21) Projections and alternative ranges for 1996 are pre-

sented in the table on the next page. During 1996, the pickup in

nominal income growth and fall-off of short-term interest rates under

the Greenbook baseline forecast should support M2 growth. The growth

of this aggregate, at 4-1/2 percent, is expected to match that of

nominal income, keeping its velocity unchanged for the second year in

a row. M3 is projected to rise 5 percent next year, a little more

slowly than in 1995. The funding needs of depository institutions

should increase less rapidly than this year, reflecting slower exten-

sions of credit by banks and thrifts; more credit demands are likely

to be met in the markets to take advantage of relatively low inter-

mediate- and long-term interest rates. Overall domestic nonfinancial

sector debt growth, at 4-1/2 percent, should be about in line with

that of nominal GDP.

(22) The effects of the alternative strategies on relative

growth rates of money and credit would be appreciably larger in 1996

than this year. M2 expansion, for example, would be about a percent-

6. In 1996, M1 is expected to be about flat. Demands for U.S.
currency from abroad are assumed to continue at about the average pace
of recent years. Other checkable deposits are projected to decrease
significantly, based partly on an expectation that banks will continue
to implement retail sweep accounts. With required reserves falling,
total reserves would decline about 3 percent during 1996, while the
monetary base, reflecting its larger currency component, would in-
crease 5 percent.



-17-

age point stronger or weaker, reflecting both the influence of shift-

ing opportunity costs as well as that of faster or slower nominal

income growth induced by the different stances of monetary policy.

(23) Under alternative I, the Committee would keep the cur-

rent 1995 ranges for M2 and debt in 1996 but would raise the limits

for M3 by 2 percentage points (as in the alternative II ranges for

1995). The Committee might explain this action in terms of the

evolving patterns of financial intermediation, noting that M3 growth

within this higher range still would likely be consistent with con-

taining inflation. Under the Greenbook baseline forecast, M2 would

likely finish 1996 close to the upper end of its range, and M3 would

be expected to be in the upper half of its range. Under the easier

policy strategy, M2 would probably run somewhat above this range.

(24) Alternative II involves increasing to 2 to 6 percent the

range for M2 as well as that for M3. The higher M2 range would more

comfortably bracket the staff projection under the Greenbook baseline

policy assumptions. The alternative II ranges also would more likely

accommodate the faster money growth that would accompany the easier



-18-

monetary policy strategy than would the first alternative. A poten-

tial disadvantage of alternative II is that it may be perceived as a

signal that the FOMC was placing less emphasis on achieving its price

stability objective; in past monetary policy reports, the Committee

has noted that the 1-to-5 percent range for M2 provided a benchmark

for longer-run growth that could be expected under conditions of

reasonable price stability if that aggregate's velocity resumes its

historical pattern of no long-term trend.



-19-

Short-Run Policy Alternatives

(25) Two policy alternatives are presented below for Commit-

tee consideration. Under alternative B, the intended federal funds

rate would be maintained at 6 percent. Under the easier policy stance

of alternative A, the intended federal funds rate would be reduced by

1/2 percentage point to 5-1/2 percent.

(26) The decision to leave reserve market conditions un-

changed, as under alternative B, might be favored if the staff

economic forecast, which assumes a constant federal funds rate through

early 1996, were viewed as both a reasonable and desirable outcome.

In that forecast, near-term weakness is limited--about sufficient to

bring the economy down to the level of its potential. An unemployment

rate in the vicinity of its natural rate is restored by the third

quarter, thereby nipping in the bud any tendency for inflationary

momentum to build. The declines in real longer-term rates and the

exchange rate that have already occurred, along with the rise in

equity prices, stimulate final sales sufficiently to return growth

close to the rate of its potential by late in 1995, holding the un-

employment rate about constant. However, monetary policy still is a

little to the restrictive side in the Greenbook forecast, leaving a

small amount of slack in the economy over time. Against this back-

drop, and with very recent indicators suggesting a limit to near-term

weakness, the Committee may wish to see macroeconomic data accumulate

that call the staff forecast into question before deciding to ease

policy.

(27) Over the past few days, markets have come to view policy

action at this meeting as much less likely, and interest and exchange

rates probably would change little with the choice of alternative B,



-20-

though a further small backup in yields cannot be ruled out with the

disappointment of some residual expectations of prompt easing. Mar-

kets are likely to view data over the intermeeting period consistent

with the staff forecast as mixed; broad measures of production and

employment would continue to the soft side, with the unemployment rate

moving higher and inflation lower than in the first half, but in-

dicators of sales should show some firming tendencies. In these cir-

cumstances, market participants likely would continue to see inflation

risks as more muted and an intermediate-term policy ease as still a

possibility.

(28) A reduction in the federal funds rate, perhaps of the

1/2 percentage point size embodied in alternative A, could be favored

as a form of insurance against the downside risks in the economic

outlook. The slowdown in consumer spending of late has been puzzling

and foreign growth has weakened unexpectedly, raising some question of

whether the recent weakness in the economy might persist and deepen.

In that event, waiting for clearcut evidence of a sustained slowdown

would be waiting too long to counter the weakness in spending. More-

over, even if the current slowdown were thought likely to be short-

lived and mild, the risks of rising inflation have been greatly re-

duced, given that the economy is moving back to its level of potential

output and pressures on prices at early stages of production have been

abating. If so, holding the real federal funds rate at its current

somewhat elevated level, especially when the long-run sustainable rate

may be depressed by fiscal restraint, might no longer be appropriate.

That is, the financial market conditions associated with the unchanged

policy of alternative B, including the backup in long-term rates in



-21-

the staff forecast, might be seen as unnecessarily risking weak spend-

ing. Even in the staff forecast, unemployment in the latter part of

1996 is slightly above its natural rate: if the Committee were willing

to see inflation level out at something over 3 percent rate--as in the

easier scenario--rather than aim to tilt it down, it might be more

disposed to consider a policy easing.

(29) Immediate implementation of the 1/2 percentage point

cut in the federal funds rate of alternative A would represent a

considerably more aggressive policy action than currently is priced

into financial markets. Thus, short-term interest rates initially

would decline further, with the rally probably showing through to some

degree in bond markets as well. The exchange value of the dollar is

likely to depreciate. At this point, market participants likely would

be somewhat puzzled by this action, and the response of market prices

would depend largely on their interpretation. A larger response in

fixed-income and foreign exchange markets would be elicited to the

degree that the 1/2 percentage point rate cut led the market to think

that the Federal Reserve was responding to significant underlying

weakness in the economic outlook. In this case, the policy action

might be seen by market participants as only the first in a series of

reductions in short-term rates. Such a perception could be mitigated

if the reserve market action were not accompanied by a cut in the

discount rate. Should the Committee instead decide on only a 1/4

percentage point reduction in the federal funds rate, the financial

market impact could be appreciably less, though further Federal Re-

serve action likely would be anticipated.

(30) The influences affecting money and credit growth with

and without a policy easing were discussed in general terms in the



-22-

previous section. In brief, growth of M2 and M3 from June to December

seems likely to remain substantially stronger than in recent years,

but down considerably from May and June. Were the Committee to ease

by 1/2 percentage point at this FOMC meeting, M2 would probably not be

boosted enough in coming months to exceed the 5 percent upper bound of

its current annual range, though, obviously, the risks of running

above the range would be significant. Under either alternative, M3 is

expected to remain above its current 0-to-4 percent range.



-23-

Directive Language

(31) Presented below for Committee consideration is draft

directive language relating to the ranges for 1995 and 1996 and the

operational paragraph for the intermeeting period. With regard to the

ranges for 1995, three alternatives are shown: (1) wording that might

be used if the Committee decides to retain the ranges for 1995 that

were adopted earlier this year; (2) wording to reflect a decision to

change the ranges; and (3) wording to indicate a decision to raise the

range for M3 while retaining the ranges for M2 and debt. The third

option includes a brief statement of the reason for raising the M3

range; if this option were to be adopted, a fuller explanation would

be provided in the Humphrey-Hawkins report and testimony and in the

minutes for the meeting.

Paragraphs for 1995 and 1996 Ranges

The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and

financial conditions that will foster price stability and

promote sustainable growth in output.

(1) In furtherance of these objectives, the Committee RE-

AFFIRMED at THIS its meeting THE RANGES IT HAD ESTABLISHED on

January 31-February 1 [DEL: established ranges] for growth of M2 and

M3 of 1 to 5 percent and 0 to 4 percent respectively, measured

from the fourth quarter of 1994 to the fourth quarter of 1995.

The Committee anticipated that money growth within these

ranges would be consistent with its broad policy objectives.

The monitoring range for growth of total domestic nonfinancial

debt was MAINTAINED AT [DEL: lowered to] 3 to 7 percent for the year.



-24-

(2) In furtherance of these objectives, the Committee at

this meeting LOWERED/RAISED the ranges it had established on

January 31-February 1 for growth of M2 and M3 to ranges of

to ____ and ____ to ____ percent respectively, measured from the

fourth quarter of 1994 to the fourth quarter of 1995. The

Committee anticipated that money growth within these ranges

would be consistent with its broad policy objectives. The

monitoring range for growth of total domestic nonfinancial

debt was MAINTAINED AT/lowered to/RAISED TO 3 to 7 percent

[____ TO ____ PERCENT] for the year.

(3) In furtherance of these objectives, the Committee

reaffirmed at this meeting the range it had established on

January 31-February 1 for growth of M2 of 1 to 5 percent,

measured from the fourth quarter of 1994 to the fourth quarter

of 1995. The Committee also retained the monitoring range of

3 to 7 percent for the year that it had set for growth of

total domestic nonfinancial debt. THE COMMITTEE RAISED THE

1995 RANGE FOR M3 TO ____ TO ___ PERCENT AS A TECHNICAL ADJUST-

MENT TO TAKE ACCOUNT OF CHANGING INTERMEDIATION PATTERNS. The

Committee anticipated that money growth within these ranges

would be consistent with its broad policy objectives.

For 1996 the Committee agreed on tentative ranges for

monetary growth, measured from the fourth quarter of 1995 to

the fourth quarter of 1996, of ____ to ____ percent for M2 and

____ to ____ percent for M3. The Committee provisionally set

the associated monitoring range for growth of domestic non-

financial debt at ____ to ____ percent for 1996. [For 1996, the

Committee established on a tentative basis the same ranges as



-25-

in 1995 for growth of the monetary aggregates and debt, mea-

sured from the fourth quarter of 1995 to the fourth quarter of

1996.] The behavior of the monetary aggregates will continue

to be evaluated in the light of progress toward price level

stability, movements in their velocities, and developments in

the economy and financial markets.

OPERATIONAL PARAGRAPH

In the implementation of policy for the immediate future,

the Committee seeks to DECREASE SOMEWHAT/maintain/INCREASE

SOMEWHAT the existing degree of pressure on reserve positions.

In the context of the Committee's long-run objectives for

price stability and sustainable economic growth, and giving

careful consideration to economic, financial, and monetary

developments, somewhat (SLIGHTLY) greater reserve restraint

WOULD/MIGHT or somewhat (SLIGHTLY) lesser reserve restraint

would/MIGHT be acceptable in the intermeeting period. The

contemplated reserve conditions are expected to be consistent

with moderate growth in M2 and M3 over coming months.

1. Targets are for bank credit until 1983; from 1983 onward targets are for domestic nonfinancial sector debt.

2. The figures shown reflect target and actual growth of M1-B in 1980 and shift-adjusted M1-B in 1981. M1-B was
relabelled M1 in January 1982. The targeted growth for M1-A was 3-1/2 to 6 percent in 1980 (actual growth was
5.0 percent); in 1981 targeted growth for shift-adjusted M1-A was 3 to 5-1/2 percent (actual growth was 1.3 percent).

3. When these ranges were set, shifts into other checkable deposits in 1980 were expected to have only a limited
effect on growth of M1-A and M1-B. As the year progressed, however, banks offered other checkable deposits more
actively, and more funds than expected were directed to these accounts. Such shifts are estimated to have decreased
M1-A growth and increased M1-B growth each by at least 1/2 percentage point more than had been anticipated.

4. Adjusted for the effects of shifts out of demand deposits and savings deposits. At the February FOMC meeting,
the target ranges for observed M1-A and M1-B in 1981 on an unadjusted basis, expected to be consistent with the
adjusted ranges, were -(4-1/2) to -2 and 6 to 8-1/2 percent, respectively. Actual M1-B growth (not shift adjusted)
was 5.0 percent.

5. Adjusted for shifts of assets from domestic banking offices to International Banking Facilities.

6. Range for bank credit is annualized growth from the December 1981 - January 1982 average level through the
fourth quarter of 1982.

7. Base period, adopted at the July 1983 FOMC meeting, is 1983 QII. At the February 1983 meeting, the FOMC
had adopted a 1982 QIV to 1983 QIV target range for M1 of 4 to 8 percent.

8. Base period is the February-March 1983 average.

9. Base period, adopted at the July 1985 FOMC meeting, is 1985 QII. At the February 1983 meeting, the FOMC
had adopted a 1984 QIV to 1985 QIV target range for M1 of 4 to 7 percent.

10. No range for M1 has been specified since the February 1987 FOMC meeting because of uncertainties about its
underlying relationship to the behavior of the economy and its sensitivitiy to economic and financial circumstances.

11. At the February 1990 meeting, the FOMC specified a range of 2-1/2 to 6-1/2 percent. This range was lowered
to 1 to 5 percent at the July 1990 meeting.

12. At the February 1993 meeting, the FOMC specified a range of 2 to 6 percent for M2, 1/2 to 4-1/2 percent for
M3, and 4-1/2 to 8-1/2 percent for domestic nonfinancial debt. These ranges were lowered to 1 to 5 percent for M2,
0 to 4 percent for M3, and 4 to 8 percent for domestic nonfinancial debt at the July 1993 meeting.

13. Growth rates in parentheses for the monetary aggregates are from 1994QIV to June 1995 and for nonfinancial
debt are from 1994QIV to May 1995.
