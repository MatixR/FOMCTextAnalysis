through a comprehensive digitization process which included identifying the best-
preserved paper copies, scanning those copies,1 and then making the scanned 
versions text-searchable.2   Though a stringent quality assurance process was 
employed, some imperfections may remain.

MONETARY AGGREGATES AND
MONEY MARKET CONDITIONS

(1) Growth of M1 accelerated to an 11.3 per cent annual rate

in May, and recent data suggest that growth may continue at around that pace

in June. For the two months combined, expansion in Ml thus appears to be

exceeding the high end of the Committee's 7-9½ per cent range of tolerance,

as the table shows. Likewise, with flows to bank time deposits other than

large CD's very strong in recent weeks, growth of M2 appears to be running

significantly above its two-month range of tolerance--at about a 13 per cent

annual rate. The rapid disbursement of tax rebates, amounting to about

$8 billion in May and June, is thought to be the key factor contributing

to the accelerated monetary growth. In addition, recent Congressional action

has cleared the way for disbursement in the second half of June of $1.7

billion in one-time payments to social security recipients.

(2) The bank credit proxy appears to be growing at only

about a 5 per cent annual rate in the May-June period. With loan

demands weak, banks have continued to run off large CD's and have

allocated the bulk of their net deposit growth to investments in Treasury

securities.

(3) Shortly after the May FOMC meeting, with the aggregates

strengthening, the Desk sought to achieve reserve conditions consistent

with a Federal funds rate trading in the upper half of the 5-5¼ per cent

range that represented prevailing money market conditions. As the

aggregates continued to strengthen--growing at rates close to or above

the upper limits of the Committee's ranges of tolerance--the Desk sought

to achieve an average funds rate of 5¼ per cent or a little higher.

In the statement week ending June, the funds rate did average about

5¼ per cent, but in the statement week just ended, it edged down to

5.15 per cent despite a very large absorption of reserves by the Desk.

(4) Private short-term market interest rates have shown

little change on balance during the intermeeting period, although bank

prime rates were reduced ¼ of a percentage point to 7 per cent at most

banks (and to 6¾ per cent at one major bank). Treasury bill rates also

showed little net change over most of the intermeeting period, but

during the past several days have posted net declines of 12-25 basis points

from the levels prevailing at the time of the last FOMC meeting. The 3-month

bill has traded most recently at around 4.95 per cent. The recent

downturn in bill yields reflects market adjustments to the prospective

seasonal shrinkage in bill supply over the latter half of June.



(5) In bond markets, yields showed little change during late

May, despite the continued heavy volume of corporate financing and the

general erosion of confidence in municipal issues stemming from the

problems of New York City. Since then, bond yields have dropped

considerably, with the decline especially sharp in the corporate bond

market. This rally appears to have reflected the more moderate volume

of Treasury financing in prospect through July, the growing conviction

in market circles that long-term rates may decline for some months

ahead, and most recently the respite for New York City arising from

creation of the Municipal Assistance Corporation.

(6) The table on the following page shows (in percentage annual

rates of change) selected monetary and financing flows over various

time periods. Appendix table III compares money supply growth rates

computed on a quarterly-average basis with those computed on a last-

month-of-quarter basis.

Prospective developments

(7) Alternative longer-run growth rates for the monetary

aggregates covering the 12-month period from June 1975 to June 1976

are summarized in the table below for Committee consideration.

Alternative B encompasses generally the same growth rates that had

been adopted by the Committee for the March '75--March '76 period at

its April meeting. The M1 growth range--at 5 to 7½ per cent--is exactly

the same, but minor downward adjustments have been made to growth ranges

for other monetary and credit aggregates. These adjustments take

account of changing relationships among the aggregates based on the

up-dated longer-run time period and re-assessment of the economic and

financial outlook.

M1  6-84 5-7½ 4-6½

M2  9-11 8-10 7-9

M3  10-12 9-11 8-10

Bank credit proxy 6-9 5½-8½ 4½-7

(8) The longer-run path for M1 in alternative B does imply

a somewhat more rapid rate of growth from March '75 to March '76 than

contemplated by the mid-point of the 5-7½ per cent range adopted by the

Committee at its previous meetings. This is because M1 growth in the

second quarter seems likely to be at about a 9 per cent annual rate,

as compared with the around 7 per cent rate earlier contemplated. The

growth rate from March '75 to March '76 implicit in the currently pro-

posed alternative B is around 7 per cent (based on mid-points). This is,

of course, within the adopted range, though toward the upper end.

(9) Shorter-run alternative operating guides for policy are

tabulated below, with an indication of the most likely 6-month monetary

growth rates that would be associated with each alternative. More detailed

figures on the aggregates are presented in the table on pp. 6a and 6b. And

alternative operating guides expressed in terms of nonborrowed reserves,

as well as other related reserve measures, are shown in appendix

table IV.

(10) As an operating guide for the intermeeting period under

alternative B, the short-run specifications include a rise in the Federal

funds rate to a range centered on 6 per cent. Given the substantial

12½ per cent annual rate of increase in nominal GNP projected for the

second half of calendar 1975, this alternative assumes that a tightening

up on bank reserve and money market conditions over the near-term would

be necessary if growth in the monetary aggregates is to be constrained

in an environment of rising incomes and transactions demands. Even if

the funds rate rises in the weeks ahead to around 6 per cent, staff

projections are that M1 growth over the second half of this year is

likely to be on the order of 7 per cent, annual rate, assuming no further

increases in the funds rate until late in the period.

(11) The relationship between alternative short-run operating

targets and longer-run objectives for the monetary aggregates is, of

course, a relatively loose one. Maintenance over the weeks immediately

ahead of prevailing money market conditions (as shown for the short-run

specifications of alternative A) would probably not be inconsistent with

the longer-run objectives of alternative B, but such an approach would

appear to entail the need for a more substantial constraint on monetary

growth later on, and hence a larger rise in the Federal funds rate later

in the summer. We have, therefore, assumed that maintenance of pre-

vailing money market conditions over the short-run would be more con-

sistent with adoption by the Committee of higher longer-run growth

objectives for the monetary aggregates, as shown under alternative A.

(12) Given prevailing money market conditions, M1 growth over

the June-July period is expected to be in an 8-10 per cent annual rate

range. Growth is expected to slow from the very rapid pace of May and

the first part of June as the effect of Treasury disbursement of tax

rebates wears off. However, disbursement of the $1.7 billion of one-

time payments to social security recipients in the second half of June,

as noted earlier, will tend to sustain private deposits. Thus, any



significant slowdown in M1 growth probably will be delayed until July.

Tightening of the money market over the intermeeting period, as con-

templated under alternative B, would work to lower these growth rates

slightly, but most of the effect of higher interest rates on the monetary

aggregates would develop later on.

(13) Over the next four weeks credit markets are not expected

to be subject to significant, additional demand pressures. In fact,

between now and mid-year the Treasury will repay a modest amount of

debt, on balance. However, the Treasury will need to raise new cash

again in early July, with the bulk of this financing probably taking the

form of additions to bill auctions. Longer-term credit demands from

corporations and state and local governments may remain quite large,

but private short-term credit demands will probably continue quite

weak for some while as businesses continue to liquidate inventories and

utilize the proceeds of capital market issues to repay short-term debt.

Thus, on the basis of demands for credit, interest rates are not likely

to be under any significant upward pressure over the weeks ahead, apart

from a potential seasonal rebound in bill rates after mid-year.

(14) Although the pace of expansion in time deposit funds

(other than large CD's) at banks and thrift institutions should diminish

with the ending of tax rebate and special social security benefit payments,

inflows of such funds are expected to remain generally large. Thus,

expansion of M2 and M3 is expected to continue sizable--under alternatives

A or B--over the next month or two. The continued availability of such

funds will permit banks to reduce outstanding large CD's further during



early summer, given weak loan demand at banks. Thrift institutions will

be encouraged to continue expanding mortgage loan commitments, and

mortgage interest rates could edge down somewhat further if conditions

in money and capital markets remain stable.

(15) A significant rise in the Federal funds rate--for example,

to the 6 per cent mid-point of the alternative B range--would, however,

alter market expectations and lead to upward adjustments in interest

rates. The adjustments would probably be most marked in short-term

rates, with the 3-month bill rate rising to perhaps 5¾-6 per cent by

mid-July. Adjustments in longer-term rates might be moderated by market

expectations of a continued slowing in the rate of inflation, a gradual

reduction in the prospective volume of new offerings, and by the

relatively substantial upward slope to the yield curve that now exists.

(16) Alternative C contemplates more tightening in money

market conditions over the near-term--with the funds rate range centered

on 6 per cent--than under alternative B. Such an approach appears

compatible with longer-run growth objectives that include holding

growth in M1 over the next year in the 4-6 per cent annual rate range,

as shown in the table in paragraph (7). Under this alternative, growth

in M1 over the March '75-March '76 period would be at the mid-point of

the 5-7 per cent long-run range earlier adopted by the Committee. But

this alternative implies enough further tightening in the money market

so that growth in the monetary aggregates would be below the bottom

of the 5-7 per cent range for M 1 in the first half of 1976.



-10-

(17) Near-term tightening in the money market of the magnitude

suggested for alternative C would almost certainly lead to a fairly

sharp reaction in other short-term markets and to an upward adjustment

in long-term rates. It could even engender expectations of a rise in

the discount rate from its current 6 per cent level. Some adverse impact

on savings flows to banks and intermediaries could be expected, but short-

term rates--typified perhaps by a 3-month bill rate around 6 3/2 per cent--

would not be likely to rise so high as to sharply curtail such inflows.

Proposed directive

(18) Presented below are three alternative formulations for

the operational paragraph of the directive, which are intended to

correspond to the similarly lettered policy alternatives discussed in

the preceding section.

Alternative A

To implement this policy, while taking account of developments

in domestic and international financial markets, the Committee seeks

to ACHIEVE BANK RESERVE AND MONEY MARKET CONDITIONS CONSISTENT WITH

SUBSTANTIAL GROWTH IN MONETARY AGGREGATES OVER THE MONTHS AHEAD

[DEL: maintain about the prevailing money market conditions over the

period immediately ahead, provided that monetary aggregates generally

appear to be growing within currently acceptable short run ranges

of tolerance].

Alternative B

To implement this policy, while taking account of developments

in domestic and international financial markets, the Committee

seeks to ACHIEVE BANK RESERVE AND MONEY MARKET CONDITIONS CONSISTENT

WITH MODERATE GROWTH IN MONETARY AGGREGATES OVER THE MONTHS AHEAD

[DEL: maintain about the prevailing money market conditions over the

period immediately ahead, provided that monetary aggregates

generally appear to be growing within currently acceptable short run

ranges of tolerance].



-12-

Alternative C

To implement this policy, while taking account of developments

in domestic and international financial markets, the Committee seeks

to ACHIEVE BANK RESERVE AND MONEY MARKET CONDITIONS CONSISTENT WITH

A SLOWING OF GROWTH IN MONETARY AGGREGATES OVER THE MONTHS AHEAD

[DEL: maintain about the prevailing money market conditions over the

period immediately ahead, provided that monetary aggregates generally

appear to be growing within currently acceptable short run ranges

of tolerance].

** Monthly averages for excess reserves and borrowings are weighted averages of statement week figures.

Government security dealer trading positions are on a commitment basis. Trading positions, which exclude Treasury bills financed by repurchase
agreements maturing in 16 days or more, are indicators of dealer holdings available for sale over the near-term. Other security dealer positions
issues still in syndicate, excluding trading positions. The basic reserve deficit is excess reserves less borrowing at Federal Reserves less net
Federal funds purchases. Weekly data are daily averages for statement weeks, except for corporate and municipal issues in syndicate which are
Friday figures.
