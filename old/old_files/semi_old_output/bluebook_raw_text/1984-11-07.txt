Prefatory Note 

 
 

The attached document represents the most complete and accurate version 
available based on original copies culled from the files of the FOMC Secretariat at the 
Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System.  This electronic document was 
created through a comprehensive digitization process which included identifying the best-
preserved paper copies, scanning those copies,1 and then making the scanned versions 
text-searchable.2  Though a stringent quality assurance process was employed, some 
imperfections may remain. 
 

Please note that this document may contain occasional gaps in the text.  These 
gaps are the result of a redaction process that removed information obtained on a 
confidential basis.  All redacted passages are exempt from disclosure under applicable 
provisions of the Freedom of Information Act.    

 

                                                 
1 In some cases, original copies needed to be photocopied before being scanned into electronic format.  All 
scanned images were deskewed (to remove the effects of printer- and scanner-introduced tilting) and lightly 
cleaned (to remove dark spots caused by staple holes, hole punches, and other blemishes caused after initial 
printing). 
2 A two-step process was used.  An advanced optimal character recognition computer program (OCR) first 
created electronic text from the document image.  Where the OCR results were inconclusive, staff checked 
and corrected the text as necessary.   Please note that the numbers and text in charts and tables were not 
reliably recognized by the OCR process and were not checked or corrected by staff.

MONETARY POLICY ALTERNATIVES

Recent developments

(1) Preliminary data for October indicate that M1 declined last

month at an annual rate of around 6-1/2 percent, following growth in September

that turned out to be 4-3/4 percent (or about 2 percentage points less than

expected at the time of the previous FOMC meeting). The estimated level

of M1 in October was well below the growth path adopted at the last FOMC

meeting for the September-December period and in the lower half of its

longer-run target range. Both demand deposits and other checkable deposits

were drawn down last month, while currency continued to grow at a slower

pace than in the first half of the year.

(2) The nontransactions component of M2 grew a bit faster in

October than the advanced September pace, boosted particularly by strength-

ened inflows to MMDAs and money market funds, whose yields lagged declines

in short-term market rates. But with the drop in M1, growth of M2 for

October is estimated to have been around 6 percent, somewhat below the

Committee's three-month objective of 7-1/2 percent. M3 growth, on the

other hand, appears to have picked up in October to a 10-1/2 percent

annual rate, somewhat above the Committee's short-run path. CD issuance

strengthened considerably in October, as the runoff at the thrift subsi-

diary of FCA stopped and as banks stepped up sales of CDs in part to off-

set declining Treasury deposits; in addition, institution-only money mar-

ket funds expanded by a very substantial amount.

(3) Expansion of the debt of private domestic sectors moderated

further in September to an estimated annual rate of 11-1/2 percent, and with

borrowing by the federal sector temporarily slowing at the same time, growth

in total nonfinancial debt fell to 11-1/4 percent from over 13 percent in

the previous two months. At banks, a slackening in the pace of consumer

lending and slower growth in business borrowing, as merger financing dropped

off and declines in bond yields encouraged greater reliance on long-term

finance, contributed to a moderation in credit growth. Partial data for

October suggest some additional slowing in bank credit, but with bond

issuance by business and state and local governments strengthening con-

siderably further and Treasury borrowing rebounding, total credit growth

probably was at least as rapid as in September.

(4) Total reserves fell at about a 13 percent annual rate in

October, reflecting a decline in required reserves mainly in response to

the weakness in transactions deposits in October and the runoff of CDs in

September. Nonborrowed reserves plus extended credit also declined

sharply. Use of the discount window was especially heavy early in each

of the two maintenance periods ending in October, particularly by large

banks, which appear to have become more willing to borrow after the

increasingly cautious approach that had developed since last spring.

Adjustment plus seasonal borrowing averaged $762 million over the four

Wednesday-ending weeks since the last Committee meeting. A level of

borrowing of $700 million most recently has been assumed in constructing

the reserve paths.

(5) The greater willingness of banks to use discount window

credit, market expectations of monetary easing as M1 weakened, and a drop

in other short-term rates contributed to a decline in the federal funds



rate from around 11 percent just before the October FOMC meeting to the

neighborhood of 10 percent most recently; funds traded below that level on a

number of days in the latter part of October. Rates on Treasury bills have

dropped about 120 basis points and on short-term private instruments by 125

to 150 basis points during the intermeeting period, bringing the 3-month bank

CD rate to about 9-1/2 percent; most major banks reduced their prime rates to

12 percent late in October. Treasury and corporate bond yields have declined

by about 80 basis points, responding as well to the apparently improved out-

look for inflation from the weakness in oil prices and to information suggest-

ing a more moderate pace of economic activity.

(6) Exchange market conditions were fairly volatile over the

period since the last Committee meeting. The dollar has dropped about 2-1/2

percent on balance, after first rising to a new record high in mid-October.

The Desk intervened on one day in the period, selling $95 million.



Prospective developments

(7) The table below gives two alternative specifications for

growth in the monetary aggregates over the period from September to December,

along with associated federal funds rate ranges. (More detailed data, in-

cluding implied growth for the QIV 1983-to-QIV 1984 period and for October

through December, can be found on the table and charts on the following

pages.) Given the substantial weakness of M1 in October, both alternatives

contemplate growth in this aggregate over the three-month September-to-December

period well below the short-run objective specified by the Committee at its

last meeting, but growth of M2 and M3 would be expected to be near their

short-run objectives. Alternative A involves an initial easing in bank

reserve positions, while no substantial change is contemplated by alternative

B. No alternative that would initially tighten bank reserve positions is

presented in view of the size of recent shortfalls in M1 and M2, with both

aggregates now in the lower halves of their ranges for 1984.

might have otherwise gone into transactions balances and possible shifts

out of cash into longer-term market instruments as expectations of

declining rates became more widespread--are expected to abate. Moreover,

demand for this aggregate will be boosted over coming months by increases

in nominal income and spending and by the usual lagged effects of the

sizable declines in short-term interest rates since early September. The

expected pickup in M1 growth in November and December would yield only

about a 2-1/2 percent annual growth rate over the last three months of the

year and only 1-1/2 percent on a quarterly average basis. For the year

as a whole (QIV to QIV), M1 growth would be around 5 percent.

(9) Assuming GNP grows as projected in the Green Book for the

fourth quarter, the velocity of M1 would rise by about 5-3/4 percent at an

annual rate in that period. Such a relatively rapid rise in velocity

appears unusual, looking back over previous experience for periods when

interest rates have dropped. In part, it reflects the shifts out of

cash that have already occurred. But still, such a large implied velocity

growth does raise questions about whether the actual outcome might instead

involve more money growth and/or less GNP expansion, given the interest

rates contemplated in this alternative.

(10) The pickup in M1 growth is expected to lead to more rapid

expansion in M2 over the balance of the quarter. For the quarter as a whole,

M2 should grow about in line with nominal GNP, bringing its growth for

the year to around 7 percent, somewhat below the mid-point of its longer-term

range. M3 is expected to increase in November and December at somewhat

less than its October pace, in part as yields on institution-only money

funds adjust to market rates; growth for the year would be a bit above the

upper end of the Comittee's longer-run range. Outstanding CDs at banks



are expected to grow at a moderate rate over the balance of the year,

with expansion restrained in part by efforts of a number of larger banks

to manage their balance sheets more conservatively in the wake of the

summer's banking difficulties and issuance of proposed new capital guide-

lines.

(11) Credit is projected to expand more slowly in the fourth

quarter than in the third, owing entirely to a drop-off in private borrow-

ing, while federal government borrowing is expected to be substantially

stronger in the current quarter than during the summer. Business borrowing

for mergers and the like is expected to continue to decline, and needs for

credit to fund outlays may edge lower from the third quarter pace as

inventory accumulation slows. In the household sector mortgage takedowns

should continue to slow, as housing expenditures weaken a little further

in reflection of the increase in interest rates earlier this year. Consumer

credit will probably continue to expand at a pace well below the extra-

ordinary rate of earlier this year.

(12) The aggregate specifications of alternative B are thought

to involve pressures on bank reserve positions indexed by discount window

borrowing of around $700 million. This is expected to be associated with

a federal funds rate averaging around 10 percent, given the apparent

considerable diminution in banks' reluctance to borrow over recent weeks

and also assuming that the "frictional " level of borrowing is, at $300

to $400 million, somewhat higher than usual. Such an assumption for

"frictional" borrowing appears consistent with the recent sustained level

of seasonal borrowing at an unusually large $300 million. After declining

sharply in October, nonborrowed and total reserves would be expected to



expand at annual rates of around 9 and 6 percent, respectively, over the

last two months of the year.

(13) Interest rates are not likely to change substantially

under this alternative, although they could back up somewhat from current

levels, given apparent expectations in the market of a further easing in

pressures on bank reserve positions. The 3-month bill rate may be in a

8-7/8 to 9-3/8 percent range, probably moving into the upper part of that

range if funds trade persistently around 10 percent. Long-term markets,

too, remain sensitive to expectations about the near-term stance of

monetary policy, as well as to incoming data on inflation and economic

activity. The pressure of credit demands on longer-term markets may

moderate, though, as the effects of the previous relatively steep declines

in rates on corporate and state and local issuance wear off.

(14) Alternative A contemplates a more expansive reserve posture

that would encourage more rapid growth in M1 and M2. Growth of M1 over

the last two months of the year would be anticipated to be around 8-1/2

percent, encouraged by growth of nonborrowed reserves at a 15 percent annual

rate. Over the three-month September-to-December period, M1 would expand

at a 3-1/2 percent annual rate and M2 at a 7-1/2 percent rate-still below

objectives set at the last meeting for M1 but on target for M2. Growth

of M3 may turn out to be somewhat further above the currently specified

3-month growth rate, as an additional easing of market conditions encourages

credit expansion.

(15) The behavior of monetary aggregates and aggregate re-

serves under alternative A is expected to be consistent with borrowing

at the discount window of around $400 million, near the currently esti-

mated "frictional" level. The federal funds rate would decline to close



-10-

to the 9 percent discount rate, probably just above it. Other interest

rates, both short- and long-term, would decline sharply, with the 3-month

Treasury bill rate falling to the 8-1/4 to 8-3/4 percent area; the dollar

would probably decline substantially further on exchange markets. Expecta-

tions of a discount rate cut would become widespread. In credit markets,

bond issuance would be enlarged, and mortgage commitments and borrowing

could begin to pick up in late fall and winter in response to the lower

rates and the greater willingness of thrifts to supply credit aggressively

as their financial condition improved. The decline in rates in November

and December would tend to boost money demand in 1985 both through its

direct effect on opportunity costs and indirectly by fostering somewhat

faster growth of income and credit demands than currently projected.

This would increase the odds of some backup in rates in the first part of

next year in the process of restraining money growth to around the mid-

points of the Committee's tentative long-run ranges for 1985.

Directive language

(16) Two alternative operational paragraphs for the directive

are given below. Alternative I represents the current paragraph, with

updating modifications (shown in the usual way). This approach involves

a potential drawback that, based on the staff's current estimates of

relationships, the directive would specify an M1 growth for the fourth

quarter that is well below the previously adopted target. That drawback

might be avoided by showing M1 as a range, possibly encompassing the

previous decision. A second possibility would be to show a growth rate

for M1 near that of the earlier decision-which, however, would tilt the

directive toward ease over the intermeeting period (if staff estimates

are near correct). The language under alternative II partially restructures

the existing directive as another approach to resolving the difficulties.

ALTERNATIVE I

In the implementation of policy in the short run, the Committee

seeks to DECREASE SOMEWHAT (alt. A) /maintain (alt. B) EXISTING PRESSURES

[DEL: the lesser degree of restraint] on reserve positions [DEL: sought in recent]

weeks. This action is expected to be consistent with growth of M1, M2,

and M3 at annual rates of around [DEL: 6] ____, [DEL: 7-1/2], ____ and [DEL: 9] ____ percent during

the period from September to December. [DEL: A somewhat further lessening of]

LESSER restraint on reserve positions would be acceptable in the event of

significantly slower growth in the monetary aggregates, evaluated in

relation to the strength of the business expansion and inflationary

pressures, domestic and international financial market conditions, and



-12-

the rate of credit growth. Conversely, greater restraint might be acceptable

in the event of substantially more rapid monetary growth and indications

of significant strengthening of economic activity and inflationary pressures.

The Chairman may call for Committee consultation if it appears to the

Manager for Domestic Operations that pursuit of the monetary objectives

and related reserve paths during the period before the next meeting is

likely to be associated with a federal funds rate persistently outside a

range of [DEL: 8 to 12] ____ TO ____ percent.

ALTERNATIVE II

In the implementation of policy in the short-run, the Committee

seeks to decrease somewhat (alt. A) /maintain (alt. B) existing pressures

on reserve positions. This action is expected to be consistent with

growth of M1 at around ____ percent at an annual rate over the last two

months of the year; more rapid growth would be acceptable in view of the

substantial decline of M1 in October which brought that aggregate into

the bottom half of its long-run range. Growth of M2 and M3 is expected

to be generally consistent with the 7-1/2 and 9 percent growth paths for

the September-to-December period set at the last Committee meeting.

Lesser restraint on reserve positions would be acceptable in the event of

significantly slower growth in the monetary aggregates, evaluated in

relation to the strength of the business expansion and inflationary

pressures, domestic and international financial market conditions, and

the rate of credit growth. Conversely, greater restraint might be acceptable

in the event of substantially more rapid monetary growth and indications

of significant strengthening of economic activity and inflationary pressures.

The Chairman may call for Committee consultation if it appears to the



-13-

Manager for Domestic Operations that pursuit of the monetary objectives

and related reserve paths during the period before the next meeting is

likely to be associated with a federal funds rate persistently outside

a range of [DEL: 8 to 12] ____ TO ____ percent.
