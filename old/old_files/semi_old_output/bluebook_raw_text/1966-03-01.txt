format.  All scanned images were deskewed (to remove the effects of printer- and scanner-introduced 
tilting) and lightly cleaned (to remove dark spots caused by staple holes, hole punches, and other 
blemishes caused after initial printing). 
 
2 A two-step process was used.  An advanced optical character recognition computer program (OCR) 
first created electronic text from the document image.  Where the OCR results were inconclusive, 
staff checked and corrected the text as necessary.  Please note that the numbers and text in charts and

MONEY MARKET AND RESERVE RELATIONSHIPS

Money markets

Recent developments. Since early February, short-term

interest rates have moved somewhat higher. In the bill market, the

largest increases have occurred in the longest maturities. Demand

for Treasury bills has been seasonally strong, but mostly concentrated

in the shortest maturities.

The reserve position of central money market banks has been

relatively comfortable during recent weeks -- in contrast to January --

partly because of a sizable drop in funds absorbed in dealer operations.

Dealers have had relatively light financing needs because of their

reduced positions in bills and their net short positions in inter-

mediate- and long-term coupon issues.

Despite the easier position of major money market banks

the banking system as a whole has been under greater reserve pressure.

In the three statement weeks ending February 23 net borrowed reserves

averaged about $120 million, and member bank borrowings close to $500

million -- each up about $70 million from their January average. And

the Federal funds market has been somewhat tauter, with trading

generally at 4-5/8 per cent and some at 4-3/4 per cent.

Prospective developments. Assuming net borrowed reserves

work somewhat deeper so as to average around $150 million over the

next three weeks, the 3-month bill rate is likely to average within

a 4.65-4.75 per cent range. While bill demand from the System and

continuing demand from liquidity-seeking investors may serve to hold

bill rates down in the early part of the period, short-term markets

probably will be strained over the March tax and dividend date, and

it is possible that the pressure will be greater and more extended

than usual. Bank and corporate liquidity remains low, with banks

faced by sizable CD maturities in the weeks immediately ahead. In

addition, by the end of March or early April the Treasury is likely

to be raising a small amount of cash in the short-term area and by

mid-April corporations are likely to need extra cash to meet accelerated

tax payments.

To some extent, however, the money market has begun to pre-

pare for a sizable increase in the demand for funds. Dealers have

maintained bill positions at relatively low levels, and the more

comfortable reserve position of some major money market banks was

partly developed in anticipation of an expansion in loan demand. The

maturing March tax bill, amounting to $3 billion, is larger relative

to tax liabilities than was the case a year ago, which will tend to

moderate some portion of market pressures.

Even so, banks will have to bid for sizable blocks of CD

money over the coming weeks simply in order to keep from losing ground.

And this raises the possibility of repercussions on the bill market,

the long-term sector of which may already have been affected by

recent increases in CD offering rates.



CONFIDENTIAL (FR) -4-

Interest rates in bond markets are likely to be subject

to further upward pressure in the weeks ahead. Corporate and

municipal sectors will be absorbing a large volume of new issues.

Pressure in the municipal market may also be compounded by lessened

bank participation. But the sharp recent adjustments in bond yields

may to some extent have already discounted prospective credit demands.

Neither is it clear to what degree anticipatory borrowing has been a

factor in the long-term rate adjustment.

While some further shift in monetary policy may also have

been discounted in recent market rate movements, a further lessening

of reserve availability in the period ahead to net borrowed reserves

staying around $200 million or somewhat above would likely lead to

greater upward yield movements in both short- and long-term markets.

Partly these would reflect the coincidence of lessened reserve avail-

ability with seasonal money market pressures, which would likely lead

to immediate effects particularly on Federal funds and CD rates.

Moreover, a consistently deeper net borrowed level and tauter money

market conditions might lead to more pervasive expectations of rises

in the prime loan rate and the discount rate.

Reserve flows, bank credit, and money

Recent developments. Growth in total and nonborrowed

reserves slowed substantially further in February on a monthly

average basis. And expansion in total member bank deposits is



CONFIDENTIAL (FR) -5-

estimated at about 4.5 per cent (annual rate), as compared with

9 per cent in January and 11 per cent in December.

The small increases in reserve aggregates and member bank

deposits for February in part belatedly reflect the reversal of the

extremely large reserve expansion that peaked during the first week

of January (as judged by weekly figures for reserves against private

deposits). Aggregate required reserves against private deposits

declined through January after the first week and have shown only

a relatively small expansion thus far in February.

Prospective developments. Some supply of reserves from

System open market operations is projected the statement week ending

March 9. But an about offsetting reserve absorption will be required

after midmonth because an increase in float and inflow of currency

are projected to more than offset a tax period expansion in required

reserves.

In March, U.S. Government deposits are projected to decline

on average, reaching very low levels by around midmonth prior to the

tax date and then recovering. This pattern suggests that money supply

will be expanding early in March. Its continued growth as spring

progresses will depend in large part on the extent of bank loan

demands. With such demands expected to be strong, the growth in

the private demand deposit component of the money supply is very

likely to accelerate from its recent reduced pace perhaps to an annual

rate averaging 5 per cent over the next few months.



CONFIDENTIAL (FR) -6-

Growth in time and savings deposits thus far in 1966 has

remained at a considerably reduced pace (8 per cent annual rate).

In the months immediately ahead, there is little reason to expect

growth to accelerate. Expansion of total time and savings deposits

has been relatively strong at country banks, and this may continue.

City banks, however, are likely to find it difficult.to obtain CD

funds in the coming March-April period. And this may be a period

when their need for CD money will rise if they find loan demand very

strong and asset liquidation more difficult.

Deposit movements such as those described above would add

up to only a moderate expansion in bank credit over the months ahead,

perhaps in the order of 5-6 per cent on average. This would also

imply only moderate growth in total and nonborrowed reserves.

Explanation of Projections in Table B-1

1. Changes in Federal Reserve credit indicate reserves needed to offset projected changes in
required reserves and factors affecting the supply of reserves.

2. Projected changes in currency outside banks reflect seasonal movements plus an allowance
for growth of about $30 million per week.

3. Projected effects of Treasury operations, included in "technical factors," reflect scheduled
and assumed calls in current two weeks and thereafter, maintenance of Treasury balances with
Federal Reserve at $500 million.

4. Projected changes in gold stock reflect assumed outflow after March at the rate of about
$50 million per month.

5. Projected changes in required reserves reflect estimated seasonal movements in private
deposits, except as indicated in projections in Table B-2, and projected movements in U.S.
Government demand deposits. Government deposit projections are based on anticipated Treasury
receipts and expenditures and the following assumed financing operations: a $100 million
increase in the weekly Treasury bill auction from March 3 to March 31; $0.1 billion,
March 10; $0.4 billion, April 4.
