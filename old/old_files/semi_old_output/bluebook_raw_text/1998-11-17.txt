Prefatory Note 

 
 

The attached document represents the most complete and accurate version 
available based on original copies culled from the files of the FOMC Secretariat at the 
Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System.  This electronic document was 
created through a comprehensive digitization process which included identifying the best-
preserved paper copies, scanning those copies,1 and then making the scanned versions 
text-searchable.2  Though a stringent quality assurance process was employed, some 
imperfections may remain. 
 

Please note that this document may contain occasional gaps in the text.  These 
gaps are the result of a redaction process that removed information obtained on a

MONETARY POLICY ALTERNATIVES

Recent Developments

(1) The Committee's quarter-point easing in the intended federal funds rate at its

September meeting was smaller than many market participants anticipated but elicited only a

muted immediate response in financial markets (chart 1). In the days that followed, the

announcement by several major banks of large trading losses and the expected unwinding of

positions by hedge funds and other leveraged investors combined to weigh on market sentiment.

Market liquidity, which had already begun to worsen, deteriorated sharply, as evidenced by rising

premiums for on-the-run Treasury securities (chart 2) and widening bid-asked spreads. The

demand for on-the-run Treasury securities was heightened further by flight-to-quality flows out

of private and emerging market securities. Credit spreads on private instruments moved still

higher, and major equity indexes suffered additional losses, as market participants' perceptions

of, and aversion to, risk intensified. Many borrowers responded to the continued tightening of

credit terms in open markets by drawing down prearranged lines at banks. Banks, meanwhile,

encountered increasing difficulty in syndicating large loans, with some deals completed only

after an upward repricing of rates while others were canceled altogether. Owing in large part to

deteriorating financial conditions, expectations of further System easing mounted in the two

weeks following the September meeting. Nevertheless, the announcement on October 15 of a

second quarter-point reduction in the intended level of the federal funds rate, along with a like

change in the discount rate, came sooner than market participants had expected. On the

afternoon of the announcement, Treasury securities again rallied, with rates on bills out to a year

shedding 25 basis points and those further out the curve declining somewhat less.

(2) Over the rest of the intermeeting period, financial strains gradually moderated,

and security issuance resumed in a number of key markets, although investors remain highly

selective and conditions in securities markets are still abnormally illiquid. As investors became

somewhat more willing to take on risks, as market expectations of additional near-term System

easing waned, and as issuance by the Treasury and the private sector picked up, Treasury rates

backed up appreciably. Bid-asked spreads in that market and premiums for on-the-run issues

both narrowed, albeit to levels that are above normal. Interest rates on private instruments

showed mixed changes after the second easing. In the commercial paper market, yields on

higher-rated paper edged down, but rates on lower-grade paper were little changed. In the

corporate bond market, investment-grade yields generally rose somewhat, in part owing to supply

pressures related to the recovery of issuance. For junk bonds, both rates and spreads declined,

rolling back a portion of their outsized increases of September and early October; while offerings

of high-yield bonds have resumed of late, investors have continued to favor better-known issuers.

Equity markets also rallied substantially after the second policy easing, with notable rebounds for

shares of money-center and investment banks. On balance over the intermeeting period, nominal

Treasury interest rates rose as much as 20 basis points, many private rates were about unchanged

at the short end but increased 18 to 40 basis points at the long end, and major equity indexes

gained 6 to 10 percent. Against the backdrop of the significant improvement in market

conditions, federal funds futures rates now suggest about even odds of no action or a 25 basis



-3-

point cut at the November FOMC meeting (although they point to a near certainty of such a move

by year end).

(3) Variations in the federal funds rate around target levels were somewhat larger than

usual over the intermeeting period. Although aggregate balances held to meet reserve and

clearing requirements continued to edge down as a result of the ongoing spread of retail sweep

arrangements, other factors probably were much more important in exacerbating fluctuations in

the funds rate in recent weeks. Heightened perceptions of counterparty risk in the interbank

market led borrowing banks to lock in their funding earlier in the morning (so as to minimize the

risk of having to borrow at the discount window) and induced lending banks to shift more of

their placements from term to overnight maturity. Commercial banks pared or more tightly

administered their counterparty credit limits in the interbank market. These forces on net boosted

the need for additional reserve balances and put upward pressure on the funds rate at the usual

Desk intervention time. The Desk responded by using the level of the funds rate at the time of

operations as a guide.1 Often, the funds rate fell late in the day when banks attempted to shed

unneeded balances as reserve positions became clearer. In the event, the effective federal funds

rate averaged very close to the intended level, but there were several instances of atypically large

and persistent daily deviations from that level.

1 To meet projected permanent needs to add reserves, the Desk arranged $4.6 billion of
outright purchases of Treasury coupons in several tranches. In light of the illiquidity in the
Treasury market, the Desk gave dealers extra time to afford them more opportunity to line up
clients willing to sell Treasury securities. The Desk also split its outright operations into eight,
rather than the usual four, tranches to reduce the number of issues in each purchase so as to keep
processing time between submission and acceptance of offers to a minimum. In addition, for the
first time, the Desk announced the specific securities it was not willing to purchase because the
SOMA already had sufficient holdings relative to the total outstanding supply.



-4-

(4) The dollar declined around 1 percent on balance against the major currencies

during the intermeeting period, paced by a net depreciation of 8-1/2 percent against the yen. On

October 7 and 8, the dollar-yen rate dropped by as much as 15 percent to an intraday trough of

111.58 amid especially volatile and illiquid trading conditions. Market sources attributed much

of the downward pressure to the efforts of hedge funds and other investors to reduce leverage and

exchange-rate exposure embodied in speculative positions involving the funding of non-yen

assets with low-interest yen borrowing (the so-called yen-carry trade). Over the most recent two

weeks, the dollar has risen steadily, reversing about 7 percent of its losses against the yen,

bolstered in part by mounting disappointment about Japanese fiscal and banking system

measures. On balance, the realignment of the dollar-yen exchange rate contributed to an

improved financial climate in some of the economies in the Asian-Pacific region, especially

those with currencies tied to the dollar. The dollar appreciated slightly on balance against the

mark, despite the easing of U.S. monetary policy, which contrasted with the unchanged stance of

the Bundesbank. Other euro-area central banks did lower official interest rates during the period,

bringing their short-term market interest rates closer to the corresponding German rates, but these

moves were expected as part of the convergence process ahead of the launch of the euro in

January. The dollar rose 3 percent against sterling, as the Bank of England lowered its official

RP rate 1/2 percentage point, somewhat more than expected, in response to signs of weakening

economic growth. The U.S. dollar appreciated 2-1/2 percent against the Canadian dollar, even

though the Bank of Canada moved in tandem with Federal Reserve policy actions. The Desk did

not intervene in foreign exchange markets for U.S. accounts over the period.



-5-

(5) Declines in official short-term interest rates in several industrial countries

contributed to the lessening of financial strains around the world over the intermeeting period.

As in the United States, the flight to both quality and liquidity moderated in other industrial

countries. Yields on ten-year German government securities rose 22 basis points over the

intermeeting period, somewhat more than those on comparable government securities in other

euro-area countries. Major equity indexes in industrial countries rose as much as 11 percent on

balance during the intermeeting period. Internationally coordinated efforts to contain a possible

financial crisis in Brazil, combined with statements by the G-7 on October 30, apparently

reassured investors in emerging market assets. Equity prices in emerging economies also rose

substantially, with indexes in many economies turning in double-digit percentage gains over the

intermeeting period. In addition, yield spreads on dollar-denominated bonds of Asian and Latin

American governments declined on net over the period.

(6) Turmoil in financial markets spurred expansion of the monetary aggregates in

October. M2 posted its second consecutive month of double-digit growth, with continued

strength in its liquid components, especially retail money market mutual funds (MMMFs). The

advance in M2 probably was boosted as well by the decline in its opportunity cost resulting from

the System's two easings and, for much of October, the unusual softness in Treasury bill rates.

Gains in M3 were even larger, as the easings stimulated inflows to institution-only MMMFs and

as banks sought to fund heavy demands for loans. Bank lending was supported in part by credit

demands deflected from securities markets, where bond issuance, particularly of high-yield

instruments, slowed sharply in September and into October, and where commercial paper ran off

in October and early November. Borrowers evidently made use of preestablished lines of credit



-6-

at banks, but new borrowers and those attempting to renegotiate existing credit lines faced less

favorable terms and conditions. According to the Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey in

November, a large share of respondent banks have tightened standards and terms for business

loans since September, while distinct signs emerged for the first time in recent years of a

tightening for smaller firms. Overall business borrowing apparently has softened in recent

months. By contrast, household debt growth has been strong of late; home mortgage borrowing

continued to respond to the relatively low level of mortgage rates, and consumer credit expanded

briskly in September along with associated consumer spending. Federal debt, on a seasonally

adjusted basis, has run off a little more rapidly in recent months, but, on net, overall domestic

nonfinancial debt growth appears to have slowed only a bit.

Policy Alternatives

(7) Although the staff forecast now foresees a somewhat less pronounced slowdown

in output than in the September Greenbook, aggregate demand growth still is projected to

weaken appreciably in coming quarters, helping to contain inflation. The current projection

assumes that the Federal Reserve will take one more small easing step by year end, with the total

decline in the funds rate thereby cumulating to the same 3/4 percentage point assumed in

September but more frontloaded to the end of this year. International influences are expected to

remain a drag on U.S. economic growth, albeit a diminishing one. Domestic credit spreads and

liquidity premiums, while narrowing further as investor confidence continues to recover, are seen

as staying somewhat elevated relative to levels earlier this year. Corporate earnings reports are

expected to prove disappointing to investors, pushing equity prices down noticeably by next

spring. With financial conditions on balance restraining aggregate demand, real GDP growth is

projected to slow considerably next year, to just over 1-1/2 percent, before strengthening

somewhat to 2-1/4 percent over the year 2000. The labor market remains tight, with the

unemployment rate edging up to about 5-1/4 percent by the middle of 2000. Overall inflation

picks up somewhat, boosted by a reversal in petroleum and other import prices.

(8) The Committee may find such a pattern to be relatively attractive if it believes that

the economy is operating beyond a sustainable level, but wishes to reduce the pressures on

resources only gradually; inflation still stays fairly quiescent, and financial markets strike a better

balance between the frothy conditions of recent years and the extreme risk aversion evident in

recent months. A slight additional easing at this meeting, as in the 25 basis point reduction in the

federal funds rate of alternative A, could be considered broadly in line with the policy



-9-

assumption underlying the staff forecast.2 The case for an immediate easing would be

strengthened if the Committee thought that the risks to the staffs economic outlook were

distinctly skewed to the downside, perhaps owing to the possibility of more adverse

developments in Latin America. In addition, a prompt policy easing would be more likely than

would standing pat to lessen the odds on a reemergence of anything like the earlier extreme

reluctance to take on risk that had caused rates on private securities to back up and had

threatened to retard economic activity. Indeed, such an easing action might be expected to foster

continued normalization of financial conditions here and abroad. An easing also might reduce

the chances, or at least lessen the effects, of possible funding problems at some financial

institutions, particularly around year end, that could interfere with credit intermediation. Finally,

an easing would help to offset some of the effects of both the tightening in lending terms and

standards at commercial banks that has been under way and the softness in global economic

activity that has been exacerbated by further weakness in Japan.

(9) The 25 basis point easing of policy under alternative A would tend to boost most

financial markets, given that the federal funds futures market evidently now has built in only

about even odds of such an action at this meeting. Consequently, rates on short-term private

market instruments, such as commercial paper, likely would move a little lower following

implementation of alternative A. With the easing perhaps fostering additional attenuation of

concerns about private credit risks, the unusual recent safe-harbor demands for Treasuries would

2 Alternative A could be implemented either through a 1/4 percentage point reduction in
the discount rate to 4-1/2 percent, or through a slightly more generous provision of nonborrowed
reserves, with no discount rate change, that eliminates the spread between the two rates.



-10-

abate further, and Treasury bill yields probably would fall less than those on private instruments.

Similarly, in longer-term markets, private rates also likely would decline, as would those on

older, less-liquid Treasury notes and bonds, while yields for on-the-run Treasuries might be little

changed as more of the recent flight-to-liquidity is unwound. Falling rates and improving

liquidity in markets for private securities probably would augment the recent tendency for some

rebound in trading volumes, and the better market conditions could help spur issuance, including

some deals previously postponed because of market turbulence. The value of the dollar on

foreign exchange markets likely would decline somewhat, and financial strains in foreign

markets probably would moderate further.

(10) If the Committee finds the Greenbook forecast plausible and acceptable, with the

risks of upside and downside surprises reasonably balanced, it may wish to defer consideration of

an easing action to later in the year (the point at which the staff forecast assumes such an action

will occur) to allow more time to assess the effects on financial markets and the real economy of

the easing that it has already put in place. Leaving policy unchanged at this meeting, as under

alternative B, would seem even more advisable if the Committee were skeptical that aggregate

demand will slow to the extent forecast by the staff. There is some reason to be cautious in

predicting much adverse effect on spending from financial developments. As noted, a number of

indicators of market performance suggest that, at a minimum, the decline in asset prices and

worsening of trading conditions have ceased and, in many markets, notably including that for

equities, a partial reversal has occurred. Indeed, the Committee could well be concerned that

further monetary easing would add fuel to the rebound in stock valuations, which arguably has

already gone beyond fundamentals. Changes to date in private financing rates may not have



- 11 -

imposed strong restraint on planned investment spending and, although the increased cost of

raising funds in private securities markets has shifted borrowing toward commercial banks, the

growth of aggregate debt in nonfederal sectors appears to have been well maintained.

(11) With many market participants likely to be disappointed by policy inaction, yields

on private securities could well back up some under alternative B. The increase in rates on

Treasury securities likely would be somewhat less, and spreads on private securities over

Treasuries probably would widen. Although the initial effects of this alternative on financial

markets could be somewhat negative, they would be muted and short-lived to the extent that the

public believes the Federal Reserve is staying especially watchful of financial market strains and

has not closed the door on further policy easing. While some risk of unusual year-end pressures

cannot be ruled out, chances are that any curtailment of liquidity and trading volumes across a

variety of markets would prove limited and essentially temporary. Equity prices likely would

decline somewhat. The value of the dollar on foreign exchange markets should firm, and credit

spreads for emerging market securities might rise.

(12) In response to the greater awareness of credit risks as well as the prospective

slowdown in economic growth, lenders are anticipated to remain cautious in extending credit in

the forecast period. Nonetheless, growth of C&I loans is likely to remain brisk through year end,

as lower-rated borrowers find the commercial paper market somewhat inhospitable and tap bank

lines. In corporate bond markets, conditions should continue to improve in coming months, but

investors are still likely to be selective, especially with regard to high-yield borrowers, and

spreads should stay wider than the very narrow levels of earlier this year. In the aggregate,

business borrowing will tend to drift down over coming quarters, owing to reduced net equity



-12-

retirements and, to a lesser extent, a trending lower of growth in fixed investment expenditures

and a more modest pace of inventory investment. Most households are expected to experience

little change in credit market terms, although marginal borrowers may see the availability of

credit trimmed a little. Still, the rate of expansion of consumer and mortgage credit will probably

edge lower, as personal consumption and housing expenditures decelerate over the next two

years along with personal income. On balance, growth in overall domestic nonfinancial debt is

expected to moderate in coming months. For 1998 as a whole, such debt is projected to expand 6

percent, in the upper half of the Committee's 3 to 7 percent annual range, but by March, this

aggregate is forecast to stand near the center of its comparable provisional range for 1999.

(13) M2 and M3 are predicted to continue to grow rapidly through the end of the year,

reflecting strong demands for liquidity in the aftermath of the volatile market climate, as well as

in response to the recent policy easings and the expectation in markets of more to come, which

have reduced the opportunity cost of holding monetary assets.3 Over 1998 as a whole, M2 and

M3 are projected to expand 9 and 10-3/4 percent, respectively, far overshooting their annual

ranges. In early 1999, however, M2 growth is projected to slow considerably as unusual

demands for liquid assets abate and households redeploy liquid assets previously parked in

money market mutual funds awaiting longer-term investment opportunities. M2 growth,

however, is expected to exceed that of nominal GDP. M3 is forecast to outpace M2 as banks

seek funding through instruments included in the broader aggregate to finance bank credit

3 The projections of money growth under alternative B assume, consistent with the
Greenbook forecast, that the stance of policy is left unchanged at the November meeting and
eased 25 basis points at the December meeting.



-13-

expansion and as institution-only money market funds remain attractive investments for

corporate cash managers. Under alternative B, M2 and M3 are projected to expand over the

October-to-March period at annual rates of 8 and 9-1/2 percent, respectively, leaving both

aggregates by March well above the ranges established provisionally for 1999.

Directive Language

(14) Shown below are the two versions of the operational paragraph that were

circulated in Mr. Lindsey's memo on November 5, 1998, and a third option proposed by

President Minehan.

Traditional Wording of the Operating Paragraph

(Option 1)

In the implementation of policy for the immediate future, the Committee seeks

conditions in reserve markets consistent with MAINTAINING/INCREASING/decreasing the

federal funds rate AT/to an average of around ____ [DEL: 5] percent. In the context of the Committee's

long-run objectives for price stability and sustainable economic growth, and giving careful

consideration to economic, financial, and monetary developments, a slightly/SOMEWHAT

higher federal funds rate WOULD/might or a SLIGHTLY/somewhat lower federal funds rate

would/MIGHT be acceptable in the intermeeting period. The contemplated reserve conditions

are expected to be consistent with some moderation in the growth in M2 and M3 over coming

months.

Alternative Language for the Operating Paragraph

(Option 2)

To promote the Committee's long-run objectives of price stability and sustainable

economic growth, the Committee in the immediate future seeks conditions in reserve markets

consistent with maintaining/increasing/decreasing the federal funds rate at/to an average of

around ____ percent. In view of the evidence currently available, the Committee believes that

prospective developments are [equally likely to warrant an increase or a decrease (NO TILT)];



-16-

[more likely to warrant [a further] increase/decrease than a decrease/an increase (TILT)] in the

federal funds rate in coming months. Any potential changes in the federal funds rate operating

objective during the intermeeting period should be considered in that context. The contemplated

reserve conditions are expected to be consistent with some moderation in the growth in M2 and

M3 over coming months.

NOTE: Presidents Boehne and Parry and Governor Kelley have indicated a preference for

dropping the next to last sentence ["Any potential changes...."]. President Parry also would insert

the phrase "federal funds rate operating objective" in place of "federal funds rate" in the prior

sentence. President Hoenig would prefer to include the next to last sentence in the operating

paragraph only with asymmetric directives.

Alternative Language Proposed by President Minehan

(Option 3)

To promote the Committee's long-run objectives of price stability and sustainable

economic growth, the Committee in the immediate future seeks conditions in reserve markets

consistent with maintaining/increasing/decreasing the federal funds rate at/to an average of

around ____ percent.

(1) (NO TILT) In that regard, the Committee views risks to the economic outlook

as evenly balanced for the intermeeting period, and believes changes in economic, financial, and

monetary conditions over that period could call for no change or for a slight [further] increase or

[further] decrease in the federal funds rate.

(2) (TILT) [However] [In addition], in view of the evidence currently available, the

Committee believes that economic, financial, and monetary developments over the intermeeting

period might require a slight [further] increase/decrease in the federal funds rate.



-17-

The contemplated reserve conditions are expected to be consistent with some moderation in the

growth in M2 and M3 over coming months.
