Prefatory Note 
 
 
The attached document represents the most complete and accurate version available 
based on original copies culled from the files of the FOMC Secretariat at the Board 
of Governors of the Federal Reserve System.  This electronic document was created 
through a comprehensive digitization process which included identifying the best-
preserved paper copies, scanning those copies,1 and then making the scanned 
versions text-searchable.2   Though a stringent quality assurance process was 
employed, some imperfections may remain. 
 
Please note that some material may have been redacted from this document if that

Recent developments

(1) New revised data for monetary aggregates, scheduled for

publication on January 31, 1/ show that M 1 increased at an annual rate

of about 8-1/2 per cent in December, substantially more rapidly than

anticipated at the time of the December FOMC meeting. But there has

been little change in M1, on balance, since mid-December, and as shown

in Table 1 below, for the December-January target period M1 growth now

appears to be near the middle of the Committee's range of tolerance.

Growth in M2 appears to be close to the top of its range, as net inflows

of consumer-type time deposits to banks have been well sustained. The

sharp December rise in M1 appears partly attributable to a late month

bulge in foreign commercial bank deposit balances with U.S. banks.

Without the increase in deposits held by foreign banks, the M 1 growth

rate in December would have been about 6-1/2 per cent.

1/ The new revised data for M1 indicate that its level for recent months is
about $1 billion below the level of the preliminary revised series (and
about $2 billion above the old published series). The new series
incorporates nonmember bank figures based on the October call report;
this is the first year since the early 1960's that useable deposit
data from the spring and fall surprise calls have been available to
us. Rates of growth for the currently published, preliminary revised,
and new revised series are shown in appendix Table IV.

1/ These figures are based on the new revised series. December-January rates
of growth for the preliminary revised series would be little different.

(2) RPD's have been expanding at about a 9 per cent annual rate

in the December-January target period, well within the growth range desired

by the Committee. As indicated in Table 2, however, there were minor

deviations from projections made at the time of the December FOMC meeting in

the use of RPD to support various types of deposits and excess reserves.

1/ Change from November 1973 to January 1974 level consistent with mid-
point of Committee's range of tolerance for RPD growth on basis of
new estimates of deposit data.

(3) The Federal funds rate declined to around an average of 9-3/4 per

cent soon after the last Committee meeting--and the level of member bank

borrowings has dropped to an average of about $1 billion during the past

four statement weeks--as the Desk took actions to ease conditions of reserve

availability somewhat, in accordance with the Committee's policy instructions.

Deposit data available in the early part of January, however, suggested that

both M1 and M2, partly influenced by increases in foreign deposits at U.S.

banks, were expanding at rates somewhat in excess of the upper limits of the

growth range established by the Committee, while RPD was estimated to be

increasing at a rate just below the upper limit of its range. In view of

the sensitive state of financial markets and the general economic situation,



-4-

a majority of Committee members concurred on January 11 in the Chairman's

recommendation that the Desk should continue to maintain prevailing money

market conditions, aiming at a Federal funds rate of 9-3/4 per cent.

(4) Bond market yields have generally moved up about 10 to 30

basis points since the last Committee meeting, responding first to the

potential and then to the actual weight of a heavy calendar of new

corporate and municipal issues. Meanwhile, short-term interest rates

have moved on divergent paths. Treasury bill rates have increased from

20 basis points (in the longer maturity area) to 50 basis points (in the

shorter maturity areas). In the private market--with business short-term

credit demands slackening in December--rates on commercial paper and

short-term bank CD's have declined 1/8 to 1/4 of a point, and banks with

prime rates of 10 per cent have dropped the rate to 9-3/4 per cent.

(5) The advance in bill rates appears attributable mainly to

the dispelling of expectations held by many market participants that

monetary policy would ease significantly over the near-term future. The

fact that the Federal funds rate failed to move down from the 9-3/4 per

cent level achieved early in the inter-meeting period appears to have

been mainly responsible for this reassessment of expectations. The

process was reinforced, however, by the sharp rise in M1 reported for

December. And bill rates also responded to ongoing and expected sales of

Treasury issues by foreign central banks. Most of the net foreign sales

in December and early January were absorbed by the System in the course of

normal seasonal reserve supplying operations. But this in turn meant that

seasonal demand for bills from the dealer market was commensurately reduced.



-5-

(6) The table on the next page shows (in percentage annual rates

of change) selected monetary and financial flows over various recent time

periods on the new revised basis. Appendix Table III compares money supply

growth rates computed on a quarterly-average basis with those computed on a

last-month-of-quarter basis. This blue book does not contain the usual

charts 1-3 on the monetary aggregates because of time pressure in converting

to the new revised money supply series.

Prospective developments

(7) Three alternative sets of specifications for growth rates in

the aggregates and money market conditions are summarized below for Committee

consideration. (More detailed figures are shown in the table on p. 7a).

(8) Alternative C encompasses the 5-1/4 per cent growth rate

for M1 between December and June adopted by the Committee at its last

meeting. (This and other alternative growth rates are shown in the chart

on the following page in relation to the rate of increase for M1 over the

past year). The money market specifications for alternative C indicate

that continuation of the path for the aggregates adopted at the last

meeting would likely be associated with some upward movement in the

Federal funds rate from the prevailing level of around 9-3/4 per cent.

This now seems probable because we expect somewhat greater demand for

money in the first half of 1974 than we did at the time of the last

FOMC meeting, reflecting the larger increase in prices and in nominal

GNP now projected.

(9) The specifications for alternative B include a 6 per

cent annual rate for M1 over the first half of 1974. The staff believes

that such a growth rate would probably entail little change in the funds

rate from current levels. Thus, the range for the funds rate in that

alternative centers on 9-3/4 per cent. Alternative A includes moderately

higher growth rates for the monetary aggregates and a consequent easing

in money market conditions.

(10) No matter which of these alternatives might be chosen,

the rates of growth for M1 are expected to be higher in the second quarter

than in the first quarter of 1974, and to be quite moderate for the two

month January-February period. For example, under alternative B, the

annual rate of M1 growth over the first quarter is indicated to be around

5-1/4 per cent--and in a 3-1/2 to 5-1/2 per cent range for January-February--

but to rise to 7 per cent in the second quarter. The greater growth in

the second quarter reflects the temporary impact of large tax refunds--

estimated at $2-$3 billion above last year--and initial consumer adjustments

to higher social security benefit payments. We would expect M1 growth in

the third quarter, assuming little change in interest rates from those

prevailing, to be on the order of one percentage point lower than in the

second quarter as these temporary factors disappear.

(11) The outlook for interest rates in general is uncertain

partly because market attitudes are so sensitive to the course of military

and oil developments in the Middle East and their implications for domestic

inflation, international capital flows, and foreign official sales of U.S.

Government securities. Also, of course, market participants are quite



-9-

sensitive at this time to monetary policy. In long-term markets, the

recent enlarged flow of bond offerings has moved relatively well, but a

continued heavy calendar is likely to lead to a further updrift in long-

term yields--assuming no significant change in the Federal funds rate, and

no dramatic change in the outlook for oil prices and supplies. In the

short-term sector, rates could also back up somewhat further, given the

prevailing Federal funds rate, as dealer financing costs remain high and

market participants come to believe that further monetary ease is not in

prospect. However, Federal Government financing requirements appear light

enough over the next few weeks to moderate upward rate pressures. Housing

agencies will be repaying debt, and the Treasury has little or no net cash

need between now and late March or early April (assuming no sizable further

liquidation of Treasury specials by foreign central banks).

(12) Given the sensitivity of markets, a rise in the funds rate

from current levels would probably lead to an increase of interest rates

generally--adjustments that could be fairly large if the funds rate

increase were sizable, say on the order of 1/4--1/2 percentage points,

and gave signs of persisting. A drop in the funds rate from prevailing

levels, on the other hand, would be accompanied by declines in market

interest rates, particularly short-term rates. The likely strength of any

ensuing market rally is unclear. Since the market over-anticipated the

extent and speed of the easing in policy late last year, reactions to

further declines in the funds rate might be on the cautious side.



-10-

(13) The Treasury will be announcing mid-February refunding

terms on January 30. About $4-1/2 billion of maturing debt is publicly

held. Under current market circumstances, it does not appear likely

that the Treasury would seek to pre-refund additional issues or to

offer longer-term securities in volume. Thus, the refunding may be a

relatively uncomplicated operation, although somewhat larger in size than

the mid-November refunding.

(14) Net inflows of consumer-type time and savings deposits

are expected to continue at about the November-December pace at banks

and thrift institutions under alternative B, which does not contemplate

significant changes in market rates. Somewhat greater growth would be

likely to evolve under alternative A. There is risk of an appreciable

reduction in savings flows under alternative C if the money market does

in fact tighten as much as shown in paragraph (7).

(15) The various alternatives include more rapid expansion

in bank credit in the winter and spring of 1974 than occurred in the

fourth quarter of last year, when growth was quite slow. Since mid-

December, banks have once again begun to increase offerings of CD's.

We have assumed a modest continuing expansion in CD's, in contrast

to the sharp decline that occurred over the fourth quarter--a decline

that was equivalent to a reduction in bank credit growth by about

4 percentage points (at an annual rate). However, demands for bank credit

may be relatively modest in the first quarter, given recent emphasis on

capital market financing by businesses, slower consumer credit growth, and

less mortgage credit demand. Thus, banks may be reluctant to issue CD's in



-11-

any significant volume at current relatively high interest rates. We

have not assumed availability of relatively low cost funds to banks

through oil revenues in the Euro-dollar market; the means and channels

by which oil revenues will be recycled through world money and capital

markets are still unclear. If banks were to obtain more funds in the

Euro-dollar market, however, they would mainly substitute for domestic

CD sales rather than add to the over-all bank credit expansion that would

otherwise occur.



-12-

Proposed directive language

(16) Presented below are three alternative formulations

for the operational paragraph of the directive, which are intended to

correspond to the similarly lettered policy alternatives discussed in

the preceding section. For all three alternatives, it is proposed to

add a reference to Treasury financing because of the regular February

refinancing to be announced later this month. As will be noted, the

three alternatives refer to growth rates in the aggregates "over the

past 12 months." For the 12 months through December 1973, these are as

follows in terms of the revised series: M1, 5.9 per cent; M2, 8.6 per

cent; and the bank credit proxy, 10.7 per cent.

Alternative A

To implement this policy, while taking account of THE

FORTHCOMING TREASURY FINANCING AND OF internationl and domestic

financial market developments, the Committee seeks to achieve

[DEL: some easing in] bank reserve and money market conditions [DEL: provided

that the] CONSISTENT WITH SOMEWHAT FASTER GROWTH IN monetary

aggregates [DEL: do not appear to be growing excessively] OVER THE MONTHS

AHEAD THAN HAS OCCURRED OVER THE PAST 12 MONTHS.



-13-

Alternative B

To implement this policy, while taking account of THE

FORTHCOMING TREASURY FINANCING AND OF international and domestic

financial market developments, the Committee seeks to achieve

[DEL: some easing in] bank reserve and money market conditions [DEL: provided

that the] CONSISTENT WITH GROWTH IN monetary aggregates [DEL: do not

appear to be growing excessively] OVER THE MONTHS AHEAD AT ABOUT

THE RATES THAT PREVAILED OVER THE PAST 12 MONTHS.

Alternative C

To implement this policy, while taking account of THE

FORTHCOMING TREASURY FINANCING AND OF international and domestic

financial market developments, the Committee seeks to achieve

[DEL: some easing in] bank reserve and money market condition [DEL: provided

that the] CONSISTENT WITH SOMEWHAT SLOWER GROWTH IN monetary aggregates

[DEL: do not appear to be growing excessively] OVER THE MONTHS AHEAD

THAN HAS OCCURRED OVER THE PAST 12 MONTHS.

(17) In the event that the Committee again wishes to couch

the operational paragraph of the directive in terms of money market

conditions, the specifications of alternative A might be associated

with the language adopted at the December meeting (". . .the Committee

seeks to achieve some easing in bank reserve and money market conditions,

provided that the monetary aggregates do not appear to be growing

excessively." The specifications of alternative B might be associated

with language indicating that ". . . the Committee seeks to maintain

about the prevailing money market conditions, provided that the monetary

aggregates appear to be growing at rates within the specified ranges

of tolerance."
