of Governors of the Federal Reserve System.  This electronic document was created 
through a comprehensive digitization process which included identifying the best-
preserved paper copies, scanning those copies,1 and then making the scanned 
versions text-searchable.2   Though a stringent quality assurance process was 
employed, some imperfections may remain.

MONEY MARKET CONDITIONS

Recent developments

(1) Since the last meeting of the Committee, money supply measures

have grown at annual rates well above the upper limits of the Committee's

May-June ranges of tolerance, and RPD appears to be at the upper end of its

range. The overshoot is particularly large for M1, as the table shows.

(2) In May alone, M1 grew at an annual rate of 11.2 per cent,

while M2 rose at a 9.8 per cent rate. Strength in M1 continued into early

June. Some of the unanticipated acceleration of M1 growth in May and



-2-

early June may be attributable to the unusually large volume of personal

income tax refunds. At the time of the last Committee meeting tax refunds

in May were projected to exceed those of a year ago by about $1.5 billion.

Nearly complete data now available indicate that the excess was closer to

$3.5 billion. While total refunds for the fiscal year--at $22 billion--are

only about $1 billion larger than projected at the time of the last meeting,

the issuance of final refund checks was largely completed in May instead of

spilling over into June to the extent we expected.

(3) With the aggregates exceeding their ranges of tolerance by

increasing margins as the inter-meeting period progressed, the Committee

agreed to raise the ceiling on the federal funds rate. An initial adjustment

from 7-7/8 per cent to 8-1/4 per cent was made on May 24 and another increase

to 8-1/2 per cent was approved on June 8. Desk operations most recently have

been geared to a reserve strategy expected to result in a funds rate around

8-1/2 per cent. Member bank borrowings generally averaged $1.7 billion in

the four statement weeks since the last Committee meeting, though bulging

to $2.4 billion in the holiday week of May 30.

(4) Tightening of the money market was accompanied by substantial

upward adjustments in short-term interest rates, and the discount rate was

raised to 6-1/2 per cent in early June. In short-term markets, the largest

advances--of 100 basis points--occurred in rates on 3-month Treasury bills and

90-180 day bank CD's, both of which had been depressed earlier relative to

other short-term rates. Other short-term market rates were increased by

50-75 basis points, and the prime rate at major banks was increased by

50 basis points to 7-1/2 per cent. Virtually all of these increases had



-3-

taken place before the 1/2 percentage point increase in Reserve Bank discount

rates on June 8. Market reaction to the discount rate advance was limited

because market participants were expecting some early Administration action

on price controls. When the temporary price freeze and other measure were

finally announced on June 13, the initial interest rate response was slightly

upward.

(5) In long-term markets, rate responses to the further tightening

of money market conditions were quite moderate. Yield advances on long-term

securities ranged generally from 5 to 15 basis points. Published series on

mortgage rates also showed advances within this same range, and there

were reports from some areas of somewhat larger increases in offering rates

on new mortgages.

(6) Growth in the bank credit proxy during the May-June target

period appears to have been somewhat slower than in earlier months and

little different from what was expected at the time of the last Committee

meeting. Business loan demand has remained strong. However, bank net

issuance of large CD's dropped off markedly in June. The new marginal

reserve requirement became applicable to such deposits outstanding in the

week beginning June 7.

(7) The table on the following page shows (in percentage annual

rates of change) selected monetary and financial flows over various time

periods.

Prospective developments

(8) The alternatives suggested for Committee consideration have

been framed to be consistent with those to be discussed in the chart show

on Monday. The chart on the following page shows movements in M1, which

is taken to index a collection of aggregates. It traces the actual

growth from September 1972 to June 1973 (with the June figure partly a projec-

tion)and shows alternative growth rates for the June-December period. The

slope of the middle dashed line represents continuation of the 5-1/4 per cent

long-term growth path adopted by the Committee at its March meeting and

reaffirmed in April and May. The steeper dashed line reflects a more rapid

growth rate for M1 of 6-1/2 per cent and the flatter dashed line a less

rapid rate of 4 per cent.

(9) The three alternative dashed lines take as a base, or

starting point, the average level of M1 in June that would be consistent

with the mid-point of the 5--5-1/2 per cent growth rate adopted by the

Committee in March (which in turn starts from the March level then expected).

Because of the recent rapid growth in M1, the actual level of M1 expected

for June (the circled point on the chart) is $1.2 billion in excess of the

level consistent with the previously adopted 5-1/4 per cent path. Accordingly,

a Committee decision to adhere to that longer-term growth path would require

a correction in the rate of expansion over the period ahead. If the correction

were to be completed within the next two quarters, growth from the indicated

June level to December would have to be at a 4-1/2 per cent rate (alternative B).

Similarly, as a result of the recent overshoot, a Committee decision to move

onto a higher 6-1/2 per cent long-run target growth path (alternative A) or

onto a lower 4 per cent path (alternative C) would imply growth from the

indicated June level to December at rates somewhat slower than those path rates.

(10) The combined third and fourth quarter rates of growth required

to hit the longer-run targets specified for M1 amount to 5-1/2 per cent for

alternative A; 4-1/2 per cent for alternative B; and 3 per cent for alter-

native C. These are the rates of growth which would attain a December level

that is on the desired long-run growth path after correcting for the recent

overshoot. If the June level of M1 turns out to be lower or higher than

presently projected, the growth rates to reach the desired path level of M1

in December would, of course, be revised commensurately. Targets for the

other monetary aggregates consistent with those for M1, and associated

short-run ranges of tolerance for June-July, are summarized in the table

below. (More detailed figures are shown in the table on page 6a.

(11) In the weeks immediately ahead, a Federal funds rate in

the general neighborhood of the currently prevailing 8-1/2 per cent rate

may be consistent with the specifications for the aggregates shown below for

alternative B. Under B, M1 in June-July is indicated to rise in a 6--8 per cent

annual rate, range with growth at a 9 per cent rate in June, but slowing

to about a 5 per cent rate in July. The slowing in July and the quite

modest rate of growth indicated for the third quarter in part reflect the

unwinding of the presumably temporary surge in privately held cash balances

engendered by the heavy income tax refunds. More basically, the longer-run

demand for M 1 is likely to be well below the second-quarter pace in lagged

reaction to the sharp recent rise in short-term interest rates and in reflec-

tion of the more moderate rate of growth in nominal GNP projected for the

second half of 1973.

(12) The high degree of economic uncertainty now prevailing,

including the Administration's recently announced price freeze, make pro-

jections of money demand more than usually difficult. While prices will

stablilize during the period of the freeze, the makeup of the phase IV

program and its implications for longer-term price movements are total

unknowns. The money supply paths presented in this blue book do not assume

an appreciable longer-run reduction in demand for money as a result of the

freeze and Phase IV. Nor have we made an explicit allowance in the short-

run for any temporary downward shift in transactions demand for money, such

as conceivably could result from a temporary stabilization of prices, or



from shifts into market securities if expectations of declining interest

rates become more prevalent. Because of these various uncertainties, and

their possible effects on the demand for money and hence on RPD, the Federal

funds rate ranges suggested are wider than in recent meetings (for example,

7-1/2--9-1/2 per cent for alternative B). However, the Committee may wish

to allow for the possibility that the freeze itself may lead to a temporary

lessening of money demand, by permitting growth rates below the ranges speci-

fied or by lifting the lower end of the funds rate range.

(13) Even with a continuation of current money market conditions,

short- and long-term interest rates over the next few weeks may be under

some further upward pressure. Short rates do not appear to have adjusted

fully to the higher day-to-day rates now prevailing, and the yield spread

between short- and long-term markets is abnormally small and in some cases

negative. Interest rates would, of course, come under greater upward

pressure if money market conditions should tighten, as they might under

either alternative B or C. However, market expectations concerning the

likely content and effectiveness of Phase IV will be critical for interest

rate behavior.

(14) In view of the recent upsurge in short-term interest rates,

growth in time deposits other than large CD's is expected to slow in the

second half of the year to around a 5--6 per cent rate under alternative B.

This does not allow for any increase in existing Regulation Q ceilings; if

ceilings were raised across the board by one-half per cent, as is assumed



in the analysis to be presented in Monday's chart show, growth rates would

average about 2 percentage points higher. A sharper slowing in time deposit

inflows, is contemplated under alternative C and less of a slowing under

alternative A.

(15) Bank credit demands are expected to remain generally strong.

Should expectations of rising interest rates strengthen, though, some cor-

porate borrowers might shift out of banks into the capital market. In any

case, reduced inflows of both private demand and consumer-type time deposits

suggest that banks are likely to remain aggressive bidders for CD's. But

CD growth will probably be slower than in the first few months of the year

in reflection of the higher cost of CD's. On balance, taking all deposit

flows into account, growth in the bank credit proxy is expected to slow

further in the second half of the year under all three alternatives, with

the slowing greatest under alternative C.

Proposed directive

(16) Presented below are three alternative formulations for the

operational paragraph of the directive, which might be taken to correspond

to the similarly lettered policy alternatives discussed in the preceding

section. For all three alternatives it is proposed to delete the reference

to international developments because the speculative pressures in exchange

markets since shortly before the last meeting have not caused special

operating problems for the Desk. Retention of the reference to domestic

financial market developments is proposed in both alternatives B and C,

because both involve the possibility of a significant tightening of the

money market. As will be noted, both alternatives B and C refer to the

aggregate growth rates "indicated for the first half of the year." Including

current estimates for June, these are as follows: M1, 5.5 per cent;

M2, 7.5 per cent; and the bank credit proxy, 13.5 per cent.

Alternative A

To implement this policy, [DEL: while taking account of

international and domestic financial market developments,] the

Committee seeks to achieve bank reserve and money market con-

ditions consistent with MODERATE [DEL: somewhat slower] growth in

monetary aggregates over the months immediately ahead [DEL: than

occurred on average in the past 6 months].
