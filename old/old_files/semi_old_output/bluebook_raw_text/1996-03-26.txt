MONETARY POLICY ALTERNATIVES

Class I - FOMC

MONETARY POLICY ALTERNATIVES

Recent Developments

(1) Following the January 30-31 meeting, the Federal Reserve

announced that it was easing money market conditions a bit further;

the discount rate was cut 1/4 percentage point to 5 percent and the

federal funds rate was lowered a like amount to 5-1/4 percent. The

effective federal funds rate has averaged close to that rate over the

intermeeting period, but has shown a bit more variation than usual

around the intended rate, perhaps partly reflecting the effects of low

levels of required operating balances stemming from the spread of

sweep programs.

(2) The easing move had been mostly anticipated, and short-

term market rates dropped slightly in its wake, while long-term rates

were about unchanged. Since then, most rates have moved higher, and

by substantial amounts, as incoming data have contradicted market

expectations that the economy would be quite soft for a time and mone-

tary policy consequently would be eased further. Rates on federal

funds futures contracts, which in late January suggested a high prob-

ability of further ease not only at the January meeting but thereafter

as well, are now essentially flat through the summer (chart).

Longer-term Treasury rates are up around 60 basis points over the

intermeeting period, returning yields to their levels of late last

summer. By far, the largest increases in forward one-year interest

rates have occurred in the intermediate range, tending to support the

1. Rates on three-month Eurodollar futures actually tilt up after
June, but this pattern probably reflects liquidity premiums more than
firm expectations of policy tightening.

view that much of the rise in rates owed to evidence of unanticipated

cyclical strength. Likely adding to the upward revision to expected

future short-term rates was the dimming prospect for long-term deficit

reduction. Given that both of these factors would tend to boost real

interest rates over time, and given little in the way of surprising

inflation news over the intermeeting period, it seems likely that the

upward movement in nominal interest rates primarily reflected a rise

in real rates. Despite the apparent increase in real interest rates,

equity prices on net are up considerably since the last meeting, after

having moved more or less in concert with bond prices for more than a

year. The recent disparate movements may reflect a shift in inves-

tors' appetites for stocks or a more optimistic outlook for earnings--

though professional stock analysts have been trimming their profit

forecasts of late.

(3) The dollar's weighted average foreign exchange value

declined over the first part of the intermeeting period, but has risen

since late February, partly in association with increases in U.S.

interest rates. On balance, the dollar is down about 1 percent since

the last meeting. From one perspective, the lack of net dollar ap-

preciation despite higher U.S. interest rates is not surprising, as

ten-year bond rates in major foreign countries other than Japan are up

40 to 65 basis points over the intermeeting period, roughly in line

with the increase in U.S. rates. From another, however, the reasons

for the rise in foreign interest rates are not entirely clear, since

they appeared to respond unusually strongly to movements in U.S inter-

est rates after the March 8 employment report. To be sure, an im-

proved economic outlook in a few countries, notably excepting Germany,

and growing doubts that the fiscal discipline associated with the

budget goals currently in the Maastricht treaty will ever be realized



may have contributed to rate increases abroad.

The Desk did not intervene.

(4) Private credit flows continue at a moderate pace, but

there are some hints that underlying demands for credit have slowed a

bit. Bank lending has fallen off in February and March, even taking

into account increased securitizations of bank loans. Business loans

decelerated in February and declined in early March despite a sharply

reduced pace of corporate bond issuance associated with the back-up in

long-term interest rates. Although nonfinancial business borrowing in

money and capital markets has been supported by financing requirements

associated with elevated merger and corporate restructuring activity,

credit needs to bridge the gap between internal funds and capital

expenditures are estimated to have become quite small as inventory

investment has declined. The weakness in bank business lending likely

does not reflect a reduced availability of credit. For example, the

Survey of Terms of Bank Lending showed that spreads on business loans

continued to narrow in early February. Consumer credit growth re-

mained fairly robust in January, but more recent bank data adjusted

for securitizations suggest that consumer borrowing has downshifted a

bit. Bank Call Report data from late 1995 show that delinquency rates

on household loans, particularly credit cards, have deteriorated

further, possibly restraining growth of consumer debt by damping both

demand and supply.

(5) Both of the broad monetary aggregates have strengthened

in recent months and have moved above their growth cones. To some

extent, the pickup in growth mirrors the decline in short-term inter-

est rates in late 1995 and early 1996. Money market mutual funds,



whose rates adjust with a lag to market rates, have been particularly

strong. M2 has been supported as well in the past three months by an

unusual surge in demand deposits, which is only partly attributable to

increases in mortgage refinancings. The brisk advance in M2 has come

in the face of strong inflows to stock and bond mutual funds, which

appear to have paused only briefly in reaction to recent market

volatility. 2 M2 is estimated to have grown faster than nominal

income in the first quarter, extending the recent string of velocity

declines. As in the previous few quarters, the growth of M2 was some-

what faster than that predicted by the standard money demand model.

(6) The surge in demand deposits has pushed M1 growth well

into positive territory in March, its first monthly advance since July

1995. Currency growth also picked up in March, to an 8 percent pace,

reportedly reflecting strong foreign demand associated with uncer-

tainties in Taiwan and Russia.3 The introduction of additional

sweep programs, however, caused balances in other checkable deposits

to continue to contract. Adjusted for retail sweeps, M1 has expanded

at an 8-3/4 percent rate since the fourth quarter, while the base has

risen 5 percent.

2. M2 plus stock and bond funds is estimated to have expanded at a
7 percent rate in February and apparently strengthened sharply in
March along with M2.

3. The monetary base contracted at a 4 percent rate in February and
rebounded to a 8-1/4 percent rate in March, reflecting additional
required reserves against demand deposits in that month and the pickup
in currency growth. Total reserves declined at a 14-1/2 percent rate
in February and expanded at a 17 percent rate in March.

Policy Alternatives

(7) Sorting through the estimated effects of bad weather,

government shutdowns, and strikes, the economic data released since

the January FOMC meeting suggest that the economy is now operating

about where the staff had anticipated, albeit with a little more final

demand and correspondingly less inventory stocking. While longer-term

interest rates have moved sharply higher in recent weeks, the rise has

been only a little larger and sooner than had been built into the last

staff forecast. On balance, financial conditions still seem conducive

to moderate expansion of spending, and the staff forecast anticipates

that output growth will settle around its potential rate over the next

two years with the federal funds rate maintained at 5-1/4 percent.

This pace of economic activity should keep the unemployment rate

steady, in the vicinity of 5-1/2 to 5-3/4 percent. With employment

and production a touch above their long-run potential levels, in-

creases in labor compensation and prices edge higher. The outcomes

for real GDP growth and CPI inflation envisioned by the staff for 1996

are at the high end of the central tendencies of the forecasts pro-

vided by Board members and Reserve Bank presidents at the time of the

last meeting.

(8) An unchanged policy stance, as in alternative B, would

probably be preferred if the Committee concurred with the staff's as-

sessment of the economy, viewed potential risks as about evenly

balanced, and was willing to accept the possibility of a slight inten-

sification of price pressures. Of course, this alternative might be

even more attractive if the Committee saw smaller odds of rising in-

flation, as it did in January judging from the CPI forecasts submitted

by the members. Moreover, in light of the unusual number of temporary



disruptions and distortions to economic activity in the last few

months and the difficulties in understanding the implications of the

recent movements of stock and bond prices, a pause might be favored to

allow sufficient time to establish a firmer bearing on the likely

course of spending and inflation, even if the Committee saw the risks

to the outlook as possibly tilted to one side or the other.

(9) With market participants apparently expecting no policy

action over the next few months, maintenance of current reserve condi-

tions, as under alternative B, would elicit little reaction in credit

markets. Capital market prices could remain volatile as incoming

information continues to be difficult to interpret in the wake of the

winter's economic disruptions. Although the anticipated softening of

many indicators in March, such as payroll employment and industrial

production, might boost markets for a time, data consistent with the

staff forecast would seem, on balance, to imply little net change in

longer-term yields. Market participants have largely discounted any

chance of a multi-year budget agreement before the elections, so a

renewal of meaningful negotiations on long-term deficit reduction has

the potential to raise bond and stock prices. Absent such a develop-

ment or unanticipated changes in policy abroad, the foreign exchange

value of the dollar probably would remain around its current level.

(10) Given the staff's assessment of the economy, the 1/2

percentage point easing in reserve market conditions offered under

alternative A would boost the economy marginally further beyond its

potential and tilt the inflation rate up a bit more noticeably. With

the latter outcome apparently inconsistent with the Committee's

strategy for achieving its long-run goals, adopting alternative A

would seem to require that, relative to the staff, Committee members



expect somewhat weaker spending or better inflation. For example,

policy relaxation might be seen as buying further insurance against

the risk that the recent rise in bond yields would truncate the ap-

parent strengthening in activity this year or as attaching weight to

the possibility that the NAIRU is lower.

(11) In light of the uncertainty about the current economic

situation and the widespread expectation that System policy is on

hold, it is difficult to gauge how market participants would react to

the 1/2 percentage point of policy ease envisioned under alternative

A. It is safe to say that most of the decline in the federal funds

rate would carry through to other shorter-term market rates. Market

participants might read the action, coming on the heels of 1/4 point

moves at two successive meetings, as revealing the judgment of policy

makers either that the economy could work with a thinner margin of

unused capacity without higher inflation or that aggregate demand is

weaker than most analysts are now expecting. With market participants

particularly uncertain about the economy, they might give the Commit-

tee the benefit of the doubt, at least for a while, and infer from the

policy action that the economic situation had changed. In that cir-

cumstance, intermediate- and long-term rates could fall significantly.

Alternatively, this policy easing might be seen to reflect a misread-

ing of the economic situation or evidence that the Committee was will-

ing to tolerate upside risks to inflation in the interest of stimulat-

ing growth for a time. Should this interpretation predominate, infla-

tion expectations would rise; although real interest rates probably

would fall, the prices of debt instruments could come under downward

pressure. Under all these scenarios, the foreign exchange value of



the dollar would weaken, and especially so if inflation expectations

deteriorated.

(12) A 1/2 percentage point tightening in reserve conditions,

as under alternative C, might be favored if the Committee agreed with

the staff forecast but viewed its outcome for inflation as undesir-

able, particularly if the Committee wanted to make some progress to-

ward price stability. Indeed, given that the economy is already

operating at or beyond many estimates of its potential, the Committee

might see significant upside risks to the inflation forecast. In this

regard, the recent behavior of asset prices and some financial ag-

gregates could potentially be signalling inflationary pressures. Part

of the rise in bond yields might be associated with higher inflation

expectations, and the gains in equity markets have the potential to

provide excessive stimulus to spending. Moreover, the broad monetary

aggregates have been growing rapidly of late, suggesting ample li-

quidity in household balance sheets and readily available funds for

depositories. Relative to the staff forecast, a 1/2 percentage point

firming in reserve conditions would take a little pressure off re-

source markets, raising the odds that the inflation rate would not

tend to drift higher.

(13) The 50 basis point tightening of alternative C would

catch market participants unawares and show through to instruments at

the shortest maturities. The response further along the term struc-

ture of interest rates could also be substantial, as the action would

likely be interpreted as suggesting that the Federal Reserve saw con-

siderable inflation risks. Even so, the rise in longer-term rates

likely would reflect a significant real component and the dollar would

tend to increase on exchange markets and stock prices to weaken.



-10-

(14) As shown in the table below, over the next six months

the staff expects some rebound in the growth of nonfederal sector debt

to around the pace of earlier in the year, but a modest slowing in

broad money growth. In the staff outlook, credit conditions are an-

ticipated to remain favorable, although banks may adopt a little addi-

tional caution, particularly with regard to their consumer lending.

Consumer debt growth is expected to slow some, but should still be

fairly robust, while the expansion of home mortgage debt stays near

its recent pace. As long-term yields stabilize in the staff forecast,

bond offerings should pick up, in part to finance the ongoing wave of

merger activity. Bank business lending is likely to recover, but,

reflecting the lessened need to finance inventory accumulation, to a

moderate growth pace. On net, domestic nonfinancial sector debt

should expand at a 5 percent annual rate over the March-to-September

period, remaining comfortably within its 3-to-7 percent annual range.

(15) The waning impetus imparted by past policy easings is

expected to damp growth in the broad monetary aggregates relative to

their recent rapid pace. Still, both M2 and M3 should expand faster

than nominal income for the next two quarters. The staff is antici-

pating M2 to grow at a 5 percent rate from March to September, leaving

the aggregate somewhat above its 1-to-5 percent annual range. With

bank credit remaining sluggish, M3 is expected to slow to a 5 percent

rate over the next six months and thus edge back toward the upper end

of its 2-to-6 percent annual range. The continued spread of retail

sweep programs is likely to pull down M1 further, although a pickup in

currency shipments abroad associated with the introduction of the

redesigned $100 bill next week should provide some offset in coming

months. 4

4. The staff assumes that about $6 billion of new sweep arrange-
ments will be implemented each month of the forecast period. As a
result, total reserves are projected to fall about $2-1/2 billion over
the next six months, or 9-1/4 percent at an annual rate; in not sea-
sonally adjusted terms, the projected decline is $2 billion. With
currency growth projected to increase, the monetary base is expected
to pick up some, and over the March-to-September period its expansion
is projected at a 9-3/4 percent annual rate.
