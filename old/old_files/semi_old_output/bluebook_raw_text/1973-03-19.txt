of Governors of the Federal Reserve System.  This electronic document was created 
through a comprehensive digitization process which included identifying the best-
preserved paper copies, scanning those copies,1 and then making the scanned 
versions text-searchable.2   Though a stringent quality assurance process was 
employed, some imperfections may remain.

format.  All scanned images were deskewed (to remove the effects of printer- and scanner-introduced 
tilting) and lightly cleaned (to remove dark spots caused by staple holes, hole punches, and other 
blemishes caused after initial printing). 
 
2 A two-step process was used.  An advanced optical character recognition computer program (OCR) 
first created electronic text from the document image.  Where the OCR results were inconclusive,

MONEY MARKET CONDITIONS

Recent developments

(1) M1 now appears to be growing at an annual rate within the

Committee's February-March range of tolerance, as shown in the table.

Growth of M2 is near the high end of its February-March target range.

RPD is growing above the upper limit of its range, chiefly because heavy

loan demands have led banks to expand large CD's much more rapidly than

anticipated. The combination of very rapid acceleration in CD growth and

the maintenance of Treasury tax and loan balances at unexpectedly high

levels (as a result of foreign central bank purchases of special Treasury

certificates) has ballooned growth in the credit proxy to an estimated

February-March annual rate of 18 per cent, far in excess of what was

indicated at the last Committee meeting.

(2) Early in the inter-meeting period, incoming data suggested

that RPD and M2 were both running above their February-March ranges of

tolerance; by the end of February, M1 also seemed to be moving to the

upper limit of its range. In these circumstances, since the Federal funds

rate had already been averaging around the 6-3/4 per cent maximum contem-

plated at the mid-February meeting, the Committee members concurred in

the Manager's recommendation of March 1 that the upper limit be raised to

7 per cent to provide a little more elbow room for open market operations

in case of need. This permitted the Manager to restrain somewhat further

the provision of nonborrowed reserves. At the same time the pressure of

loan demand on commercial banks caused spirited bidding for funds. Des-

pite resistance by the Desk, the funds rate tended to persist above 7 per

cent, and in the most recent statement week averaged 7.13 per cent. Over

the full inter-meeting period, the funds rate has risen about 55 basis

points, on top of the roughly 150 basis points rise that occurred during

the preceding three months.

(3) Rate increases on short-term market instruments have

generally matched or exceeded the rise in the Federal funds rate since the

last meeting, although the spread of the funds rate over the 3-month bill

rate remains relatively wide. Rates on large CD's with maturities just

under 90 days have advanced as much as 100 basis points during the inter-

meeting period; Treasury bill rates are up 75-100 basis points--with the

3-month issue most recently bid close to 6.20 per cent; and even the

interest rates on commercial paper--the issuance of which has been reduced



by borrower shifts to the alternative use of bank credit--have risen

75-85 basis points. The Federal Reserve discount rate was raised one-

half per cent to 5-1/2 per cent, effective February 26, and a rise in

the bank prime rate from 6 to 6-1/4 per cent occurred at about the same

time. Market rate increases in recent days have been fueled partly by

expectations that a further discount rate hike is impending.

(4) In markets for longer maturity securities, upward

pressures on yields have been relatively less intense than in short

markets, with advances ranging generally from 10 to 30 basis points.

Special factors have tended to limit the extent of the rise on corpor-

ate, U. S. Treasury, and Federal agency securities; in the case of

corporates, the calendar of new utility and industrial bond offerings

has been unusually light, while in the case of Treasury coupon and

Federal agency issues a foreign central bank--shifting out of bills--

has been a persistent large buyer. Municipal bond yields, on the other

hand, have been under increasing pressure from sizable current offer-

ings and a large forward calendar as well as from a falling off in bank

portfolio acquisitions.

(5) The table on the following page shows (in percentage

annual rate of change) selected monetary and financial flows over

various time periods. The slowing of growth in M1 and M2 over the first

two months of 1973 has helped offset the surge in December 1972. Over

the 3 months ending in February, M1 has grown at a 6.3 per cent annual

rate and M2 at an 8.2 per cent rate. Growth rates over the past 6 months

are slightly higher, and over the past 12 months are higher still.

Prospective developments

(6) Presented below in summary form (with figures for

aggregates representing seasonally adjusted annual rates of change)

are March-April ranges for monetary aggregates and money market con-

1/
ditions associated with three alternative longer-run targets.1/ The

longer-run targets are indexed by growth rates for M 1 of 7, 5-1/2,

and 4 per cent over the next two quarters for alternatives A B, and

C, respectively. These policy options tie in with the economic

analysis of longer-run alternatives to be presented for FOMC considera-

tion at the forthcoming meeting. For purposes of the Blue Book dis-

cussion, Regulation Q ceilings are assumed to remain unchanged.

(7) Given the cumulative impact of monetary restraint, the

staff believes that growth in the monetary aggregates at the rates shown for

alternative B would involve little further change in money market conditions.

Growth in M 1 for the March-April period is indicated at 5-1/2--7-1/2

per cent in this alternative, ranging a little above the longer-run

target. This is due primarily to the assumed effect of larger-than-

usual income tax refunds this year, which will also bolster time and savings

deposits. RPD growth in the March-April period consistent with these

aggregates is projected to be relatively large, however, partly because it

reflects a further sharp increase in large CD's, and also because of the

effects of lagged reserve accounting.

(8) Assuming adoption of the somewhat larger growth rates for

the aggregates as a longer-run target under alternative A, money market

conditions would be likely to ease down through the range shown for that

option over the next few weeks. On the other hand, an effort to secure a

slowing in rates of growth in the monetary aggregates of the dimensions

shown under alternative C would be likely to entail a further rise in the

Federal funds rate from current levels. The pattern for this alternative

shown in the detailed table on p. 6a assumes that the funds rate would

rise to near the upper end of the 7--8-1/4 per cent range before the next

Committee meeting. If the Committee wished to undertake a more gradual

tightening--for example, constraining the rise in the funds rate to

around 8 per cent over a two-month period--the staff would still expect a

significant slowing in growth of the aggregates over time. The slowing,

however, would probably be somewhat delayed with M 1 expected to expand

at a 5 per cent annual rate in the second quarter and 4 per cent in the

third.

(9) Even assuming little change in the Federal funds rate

from current levels, the 3-month bill rate is likely to continue to

rise over the next few weeks, perhaps moving up in a 6-1/4--6-1/2 per

cent range. In addition to the continued pull on the bill rate from

a funds rate of around 7 per cent, the Desk is likely to be a sizable

seller of bills during the first half of April because of an expected

substantial decline in the Treasury balance at the Fed prior to mid-

April tax collections. The Treasury balance at the Fed has recently

risen to an exceptionally large $4 billion as the bulk of the recent

outflows of funds to abroad was reinvested by official institutions in

Treasury specials. If a sizable reflow of these funds should develop,

upward interest rate pressures in the Treasury bill market would be

particularly strong, assuming that foreign central banks dispose of

Treasury issues as demand for dollars increases, and the bill rate

could well rise above the indicated range.

(10) Short-term rates outside the Treasury bill area appear

to have already adjusted more fully than short-term bills to prevailing

money market conditions, but nevertheless some of these rates could rise

somewhat further. Rates on negotiable CD's maturing in over 90 days

offered by large banks are apparently at or near ceilings. With these

banks crowding CD borrowing even more into the short-term area, short-

term CD rates are likely to rise. As costs of bank funds rise, there

will be further pressure on bank lending rates and policies. With

pressure continuing on the short-term rate structure, long-term rates



-8-

are likely to increase further as investors become more reluctant to make

long-term commitments at current rates and as borrowers begin to seek to

nail down funds in the bond market.

(11) A tightening of the money market from currently prevailing

conditions would lead to rather substantial further upward adjustments in

short- and long-term interest rates. For instance, if the funds rate

were in a 7-1/2--8 per cent range, we would expect increases of about

1/2--3/4 percentage point in short-term market rates (other than longer-

term CD's which are at ceiling rates), and sizable accompanying rises in

long-term rates.

(12) Upward pressures on short- and long-term interest rates

partly reflect the necessity for banks and other savings institutions to

adjust to a significant slowing in the rate of inflow of consumer-type

time and savings deposits. Such a slowing would be expected under alter-

native B, and would be even more marked under alternative C; however, this

does not allow for any change in Regulation Q ceilings on consumer-type

time and savings deposits. Banks and other institutions would have to

adjust to smaller inflows by adopting more stringent commitment policies,

reducing liquidity, and reducing their participation in bond markets. In

addition, large banks would remain aggressive issuers of CD's, and savings

and loan associations would begin borrowing actively from Federal Home

Loan Banks.



Proposed directives

(13) Presented below are three alternative formulations

for the operational paragraph of the directive, which might be taken

to correspond to the similarly lettered policy alternatives discuss-

ed in the preceding section. The reference to credit markets is pro-

posed for elimination only in alternative A, the only alternative

that contemplates a significant easing of the money market. In view

of uncertainties as to how the current international exchange crisis

will be unwound, a reference to international developments is suggested

for all three alternatives.

Alternative A

To implement this policy, while taking account of

[DEL: possible domestic credit market and]international develop-

ments, the Committee seeks to achieve bank reserve and

money market conditions that will support [DEL: somewhat-slower]

growth in monetary aggregates over the months ahead [DEL: than

occurred on] AT ABOUT THE average RATES OF in the past 12

months.

Alternative B

To implement this policy, while taking account of

possible domestic credit market and international develop-

ments, the Committee seeks to achieve bank reserve and money

market conditions that will support somewhat slower growth

in monetary aggregates over the months ahead than occurred

on average in the past 6 months.



-10-

Alternative C

To implement this policy, while taking account of

possible domestic credit market and international developments,

the Committee seeks to achieve bank reserve and money market

conditions that will support [DEL: somewhat] SUBSTANTIALLY slower

growth in monetary aggregates over the months ahead than

occurred on average in the past 6 months.

Government Security dealer trading positions are on a commitment basis. Trading positions, which exclude Treasury bills financed by repurchase
agreements maturing in 16 days or more, are indicators of dealer holdings available for sale over the near-term. Other security dealer positions

are debt issues still in syndicate, excluding trading positions. The basic reserve deficit is excess reserves less borrowing at Federal Reserve
less net Federal funds purchases. Weekly data are daily averages for statement weeks, except for corporate and municipal issues in syndicate which
are Friday figures.
