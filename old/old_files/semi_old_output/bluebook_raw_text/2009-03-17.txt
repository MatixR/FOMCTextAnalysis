CLASS I FOMC - RESTRICTED CONTROLLED (FR) 

MONETARY POLICY ALTERNATIVES 

PREPARED FOR THE FEDERAL OPEN MARKET COMMITTEE 
BY THE STAFF OF THE BOARD OF GOVERNORS OF THE FEDERAL RESERVE SYSTEM 

MARCH 13, 2009 



Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR)                           March 13, 2009 

MONETARY POLICY ALTERNATIVES 

Recent Developments 

Summary 

(1) Although the functioning of a few financial markets showed some limited 

signs of improvement over the intermeeting period, financial conditions overall 

appeared to become even less supportive of economic activity.  Despite having paired 

some of their earlier losses in recent days, broad equity price indexes dropped 

significantly, on balance, amid continued concerns about the health of the financial 

sector, uncertainty around the efficacy of government support to the sector, and a 

sharp further weakening of the economic outlook.  Banks’ stock prices were 

particularly hard hit, and their credit default swap (CDS) spreads rose above the peaks 

recorded last fall, on anxieties about the financial conditions of the largest banks.  

Unsecured short-term bank funding markets, which had improved notably late last 

year, showed some renewed signs of deterioration.   

(2) Yields on long-term Treasury securities increased, on net, likely pressured in 

part by expectations of heavy issuance.  Long-term TIPS-based measures of inflation 

compensation, which have been distorted by strained liquidity conditions in recent 

months, declined over the intermeeting period.  In contrast, survey measures of long-

term inflation expectations have changed little since the end of January.  Market- and 

survey-based measures of policy expectations indicate that investors anticipate federal 

funds to trade within the current target range at least through the third quarter of this 

year.   

(3)   Federal Reserve purchases of agency debt and MBS continued during the 

intermeeting period.  Spreads of agency debt and agency MBS narrowed, on net.  

Gross issuance of investment-grade corporate bonds by nonfinancial firms remained

1 On February 25, federal bank regulatory agencies announced that they would start 
conducting forward-looking stress tests on U.S. bank holding companies with assets 
exceeding $100 billion under two alternative scenarios.  Under the first scenario, economic 
activity is assumed to progress in line with consensus forecasts, and under the second 
scenario the economic outlook is more adverse.  The tests will be completed by the end of 
April. 

strong in February, while shorter-term business credit appears to have contracted over 

the same period.  Spreads on AAA-rated consumer asset-backed securities (ABS) have 

continued to decline since late January, reportedly in anticipation of improved 

conditions in securitization markets due to the upcoming launch of the Term Asset-

Backed Securities Loan Facility (TALF).   

(4) Major foreign central banks cut their policy rates aggressively in response to 

the rapidly deteriorating global economic outlook.  The Bank of England, the Bank of 

Japan, and the Swiss National Bank announced new programs to purchase assets in 

financial markets.  The U.S. dollar appreciated broadly against major and emerging 

market currencies.  Foreign equity prices declined sharply.              

Financial Institutions 

(5) Investors’ concerns about the condition of several major financial 

institutions intensified over the intermeeting period.  Despite having retraced some of 

the initial moves in recent days, banks’ stock prices dropped to new lows and CDS 

spreads on subordinated and senior debt reached very high levels, reportedly as a 

result of investor disappointment regarding the outline of the Financial Stability Plan 

(FSP) announced by the U.S. government on February 10 and growing concerns that 

Citigroup and Bank of America would require additional government support 

(Chart 1). 1 Preferred stocks of the largest banks have generally continued to decline, 

on net, since the end of January.  

(6) On February 27, Citigroup disclosed a plan to strengthen its capital 

structure through a conversion of a significant portion of its preferred securities to

2 The conditions announced by the Treasury are as follows: (1) The Treasury will convert its 
preferred securities to match dollar for dollar private preferred exchanges. (2) The Treasury 
will convert up to the $25 billion of preferred stock issued under the Capital Purchase 
Program. Remaining Treasury- and FDIC-owned preferred stock issued under the Targeted 
Investment Program and Asset Guarantee Program would be converted into a trust 
preferred security of greater structural seniority that would carry the same 8 percent cash 
dividend rate as the existing issue. (3) The Treasury will receive the most favorable terms and 
price offered to any other preferred holder through the exchange.  
3 The Treasury will exchange its existing $40 billion cumulative perpetual preferred shares 
for new preferred shares with revised terms that more closely resemble those of common 
equity.  In addition, the Treasury will create a new equity capital facility allowing AIG to 
draw up to $30 billion as needed over time, in exchange for non-cumulative preferred stock 
issued to the Treasury.  The Federal Reserve will reduce the size of the $60 billion Revolving 
Credit Facility for AIG established in September 2008 to no less than $25 billion.  In 
addition, the interest rate on the Facility, which is three-month Libor plus 300 basis points, 
will be modified by removing the existing floor (3½ percent) on the Libor rate.  The 
Revolving Credit Facility will be reduced in exchange for preferred interests—up to 
approximately $26 billion—in two SPVs created to hold all of the outstanding common 
stock of American Life Insurance Company and American International Assurance

common equity with exchange offers, and the Treasury announced that it would be 

willing to convert a portion of its preferred security interest in the holding company 

to common equity to the extent that Citigroup reaches an agreement with its other 

preferred holders and that a set of conditions are met.2  Citigroup’s stock price 

remained under significant stress after the announcement, reaching a record low level 

of $1, although it has recovered somewhat in recent days. 

(7) Stock prices of insurance companies dropped sharply, on net, reflecting 

concerns about their capitalization sparked by expectations of increased losses on 

their investment portfolios.  Announcements of significant dividend cuts by insurance 

companies also reportedly weighed on market sentiment toward the sector.  CDS 

spreads of insurance firms reached new highs during the intermeeting period, 

although they have retraced their earlier increases in recent days.    On March 2, AIG 

posted a record loss of more than $60 billion for the fourth quarter of last year, and 

the Treasury and the Federal Reserve announced a restructuring of the company’s 

assistance program to enhance its capital and liquidity position.3      



                                                                                                                                        
Company, two life insurance holding company subsidiaries of AIG.  In addition, the Federal 
Reserve Bank of New York will make new loans of up to approximately $8.5 billion to SPVs 
established by domestic life insurance subsidiaries of AIG. The SPVs will repay the loans 
from the cash flows received from designated blocks of existing life insurance policies held 
by the parent insurance companies. The proceeds of the loans will pay down an equivalent 
amount of outstanding debt under the Revolving Credit Facility. 

Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) 5 of 60

(8) Developments at some other financial institutions were also negative during 

the intermeeting period.  Equity prices of the largest private providers of government-

guaranteed student loans tumbled following the release of the 2010 federal budget 

proposal on February 17.  Under the proposal, Congress would eliminate all 

government subsidies for financial institutions that lend to students under the Federal 

Family Education Loan Program (FFELP), and require that all government-

guaranteed student loans be originated through the federal government’s Direct Loan 

Program.  In addition, CDS spreads for GE Capital widened sharply, on net, and the 

equity price of its parent company General Electric dropped, on balance, as investors’ 

concerns about the quality of assets on GE Capital’s balance sheet intensified during 

the intermeeting period.  On March 12, Standard & Poor’s downgraded General 

Electric's long term debt AAA rating to AA+.    

(9) Financial institutions issued about $75 billion of debt under the FDIC’s 

Temporary Liquidity Guarantee Program (TLGP) over the intermeeting period, 

bringing the total amount outstanding under the program to $200 billion.  Spreads of 

yields on FDIC-guaranteed debt over those on comparable-maturity Treasury 

securities changed little, on net, over the intermeeting period, remaining in the 50 to 

100 basis points range.  

Market Functioning 

(10) There were mixed changes in the functioning of financial markets over the 

intermeeting period.  Although some signs of improvement were visible in certain 



Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) 6 of 60

areas, particularly in the commercial paper (CP) and repo markets, many other 

markets remained under considerable stress.   

(11) Partly reflecting pressures resulting from a large supply of newly issued 

Treasury securities, the overnight general collateral repo rate increased to slightly 

above 25 basis points over the intermeeting period from about 10 basis points in 

January, exerting upward pressure on the federal funds rate, which increased to the 

upper end of its target range.  Trading volumes in overnight repos for Treasury 

collateral inched higher, but stayed at depressed levels, and volumes traded in the 

overnight federal funds market were little changed at levels well below those seen 

prior to the significant increase in reserve balances in the fall of last year.  Despite the 

low level of interest rates, delivery fails on Treasury securities have remained moderate 

since late January.  Conditions in repo markets for agency debt and CMBS showed 

some signs of improvement over the intermeeting period, as bid-asked spreads 

narrowed and haircuts fell.  In contrast, conditions in the repo market for private-label 

residential mortgage-backed securities (RMBS) were mixed, and trading volumes of 

repos for all collateral types remained low. 

(12) In unsecured interbank funding markets, Libor fixings (and spreads over 

OIS) trended higher, on net, over the intermeeting period, especially at longer 

maturities, and forward spreads increased, owing to renewed concerns about the 

financial condition of some large banks (Chart 2).  Consistent with some deterioration 

in interbank funding markets, credit outstanding under the Term Auction Facility 

(TAF) increased over the period as the more recent auctions have experienced higher 

demand than the previous ones.   Nonetheless, one-month Libor changed little as it 

passed quarter-end on February 27, pointing to limited market concerns regarding 

pressures over the upcoming quarter-end.   The auction results of the Term Securities 

Lending Facility Options Program (TOP), covering quarter-end, also pointed to 

limited market expectations of quarter-end pressures, as, for the first time, bids fell

4 On March 3, the Treasury and the Federal Reserve announced that they will seek legislation 
to give the Federal Reserve additional tools to manage the level of reserves while providing 
the funding necessary for the TALF and other key credit-easing programs.  For additional 
detail, please refer to the memorandum entitled “Legislative Initiative for Additional Federal 
Reserve Balance Sheet Management Tools,” to the Federal Open Market Committee by 
Brian Madigan, James Clouse, Scott Alvarez and Sophia Allison.

short of the total offered amount, despite a reduction of the loan rate fee to 25 basis 

points from 50 basis points in the most recent auction (see the box “Federal Reserve 

balance sheet developments over the intermeeting period”). 

(13) Conditions in the CP market continued to improve, on balance, over the 

intermeeting period.  Spreads on A2/P2-rated CP trended down further, and those on 

AA-rated asset-backed commercial paper (ABCP) remained at the lower end of the 

range recorded over the past year.  During the week of January 26, about $240 billion 

of CP purchased in late October under the Commercial Paper Funding Facility 

(CPFF) matured and a large portion was not renewed, as several financial issuers 

reportedly paid down paper from the program using longer-term funding alternatives, 

including FDIC-guaranteed debt.  Overall, the reduction in credit extended under the 

CPFF accounted for most of the decline in total commercial paper outstanding over 

the same period.   

(14) The 3-month Treasury bill rate was slightly above the effective federal funds 

rate for most of the intermeeting period, likely reflecting the large scale of bill 

issuance.  Net par issuance of Treasury bills through March 12 totaled $238 billion, of 

which $25 billion were issued under the Supplementary Financing Program (SFP), 

leaving the total amount outstanding issued under the program at about $200 billion.4 

(15) Trading conditions in the secondary market for nominal Treasury coupon 

securities showed some limited signs of improvement.  Average bid-asked spreads for 

on-the-run nominal Treasury notes were relatively stable near their pre-crisis levels, 

and the average magnitude of fitting errors from nominal yield curve estimates 

decreased notably, suggesting an increase in arbitrage activity.  Daily trading volumes

Federal Reserve Balance Sheet Developments over the Intermeeting Period 

Since the last FOMC meeting, total assets on the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet 
have contracted by about $60 billion to around $1,900 billion.1  More than accounting for 
the decline was a sharp contraction in foreign central bank liquidity swaps.  Reportedly, 
some foreign banks sought less expensive funding sources, while others pared their need 
for dollar funding by trimming their stocks of dollar-denominated assets.  Credit 
extended by the Commercial Paper Funding Facility edged down as 90-day paper 
purchased in the early weeks of the program continued to mature.  Only about 60 percent 
of the maturing paper issued during the early days of the program was rolled over, as 
some institutions apparently turned toward longer-term funding alternatives, including 
debt issued under the FDIC’s Temporary Liquidity Guarantee Program.  Credit extended 
under the Asset-Backed Commercial Paper Money Market Mutual Fund Liquidity Facility 
(AMLF), not shown separately, declined to about $7 billion, and the Money Market 
Investor Funding Facility (MMIFF) continued to register no activity.  Offsetting the 
downward movements, credit extended under the Term Auction Facility (TAF) and 
holdings of agency debt and mortgage-backed securities increased by about $80 billion 
each.  The expansion in TAF borrowing, which contrasted with the fall in central bank 
liquidity swaps, likely reflects in part the modestly heightened pressures in bank funding 
markets evident in the increase in term Libor over the intermeeting period.   

On the liability side of the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet, there was a steep decline 
in deposits of depository institutions, which fell by about $130 billion.  Deposits of other 
institutions, however, rose over the period.  U.S. Treasury deposits were a bit higher, on 
net.  The Treasury has essentially suspended investing excess cash in the commercial 
banking system.  Still, the Treasury General Account, which has fluctuated around a 
relatively high level, ended the period $14 billion lower.  The Supplementary Financing 
Account increased by $25 billion, on net, over the intermeeting period.  Deposits of 
GSEs (included in “other deposits”) increased $46 billion; these balances have been 
rather volatile in recent months and in particular have risen recently in anticipation of an 
upcoming principal and interest payment date.

5 On March 9, ICE US Trust LLC (ICE Trust), a subsidiary of the Intercontinental 
Exchange Inc., began clearing credit-default swaps, following the approval by the Federal 
Reserve of its application to become a member of the Federal Reserve System on March 4, 
and of conditional exemptions by the Securities Exchange Commission (SEC) on March 6, 
which allow ICE Trust to operate as a central counterparty for clearing credit default swaps.

for on-the-run securities, however, inched lower, and spreads between the yields of 

on- and off-the-run ten-year Treasury notes remained very high.     

(16) Measures of liquidity in the secondary market for speculative-grade 

corporate bonds worsened somewhat over the period, but remained significantly 

better than in the fall of 2008.  The basis between the spread on the CDX Investment 

Grade index and measures of investment-grade corporate bond spreads—a rough 

measure of unexploited arbitrage opportunities in the corporate bond market—

remained at high levels.  Trading conditions in the leveraged syndicated loan market 

improved slightly, although implied spreads on the LCDX index widened sharply, on 

net, over the intermeeting period.  Price discovery in the CDS market continued to be 

impaired, as evidenced by the wide range of CDS dealer quotes for the same reference 

entities.5  The market for commercial mortgage-backed securities (CMBS) also 

remained under heavy stress.  Indexes of CDS spreads on AAA-rated CMBS (CMBX) 

widened to record levels, as Moody’s downgraded a large portion of the 2006 and 

2007 vintages following a re-evaluation of its rating criteria.  

Monetary Policy Expectations and Treasury Yields 

(17) The Committee’s decision at the January meeting to leave the target range 

for the federal funds rate unchanged and the wording of the accompanying statement 

were widely anticipated by investors and had little impact on money markets.  The 

path for the federal funds rate implied by futures rates shifted down somewhat, on 

net, mostly on incoming news about the financial sector and the economic outlook 

(Chart 3).  Based on our standard term premium adjustment of 1 basis point per 

month, market quotes currently suggest that market participants anticipate that the

first increase in the federal funds rate will occur in the fourth quarter of 2009, and that 

the federal funds rate will reach about 1.1 percent by the end of 2010.  Six months 

ahead, the option-implied distribution indicates that investors place about 45 percent 

odds on the funds rate trading above the current target range.  However, term 

premiums could well be higher than usual, implying a flatter path for the federal funds 

rate.  Indeed, none of the respondents to the Desk’s survey of primary dealers expects 

the federal funds rate to increase before the first half of 2010, and the majority of 

respondents anticipate the first rate increase to occur on or after the first half of 2011.    

(18) Yields on two- and ten-year nominal Treasury securities rose about 30 and 

15 basis points, respectively, over the intermeeting period, reflecting in part 

expectations for additional supply of these securities.  Option-implied measures of 

uncertainty about longer-term Treasury yields increased over the period.     

(19) Changes in market- and survey-implied measures of inflation expectations 

were mixed.  Yields on longer-horizon inflation-indexed securities increased more 

than those on their nominal counterparts, leaving five-year, five-year-ahead inflation 

compensation about 30 basis points lower over the period.  Five-year inflation 

compensation was, instead, little changed.  Poor liquidity in the TIPS market 

continues to make these readings difficult to interpret.  Meanwhile, measures of 

inflation compensation from inflation swaps, which have also poor liquidity, moved 

up across different maturities.  Changes in longer-term inflation expectations from the 

Philadelphia Fed and Michigan surveys were mixed but relatively small, while short-

term inflation expectations from both surveys declined modestly.  An analysis of the 

deflation floor embedded in TIPS suggests that market participants see considerable 

risks of cumulative deflation over the next few years (see the box “Extracting 

Inflation Probabilities from TIPS”).

Extracting Deflation Probabilities from TIPS  

Interest payments on TIPS are calculated based on the inflation-adjusted principal 
amount of the security, where the inflation adjustment reflects the cumulative change 
in the CPI since the bond was issued.  However, if the inflation-adjusted principal 
amount is below par at maturity, the bondholder receives a payment equal to par 
rather than the actual inflation-adjusted principal, a guarantee that is commonly 
referred to as the “deflation floor.”  Therefore, the price of TIPS comprises two 
parts:  the discounted value of the fully inflation-indexed principal and interest 
payments plus the value of an embedded put option on an inflation-adjusted discount 
bond with a strike price of par.   

In the case of the most recently issued five-year TIPS (which has about four years left 
to maturity), the inflation-adjusted principal is currently slightly below par, so holders 
are fully protected against any further deflation occurring over the remaining life of 
the security.  In contrast, the protection against deflation offered by the TIPS security 
with the next closest remaining maturity—the ten year security issued on July 15, 
2003—is much less because inflation accrual over the past five years has driven up its 
inflation-adjusted principal to well above par, so that a substantial amount of 
deflation has to occur before the deflation floor is reached.  This difference means 
that the value of the embedded put option on the new five-year issue should be 
positive while that for the old ten-year will be close to zero, since it is unlikely that 
the embedded put option on the older issue will be “in the money” at maturity.  
Thus, assuming that the liquidity of the two issues is roughly similar, the difference in 
the market price of the two securities adjusted for differences in coupon payments, 
should be essentially equal to the value of the deflation floor on the recently issued 
five-year TIPS.  Performing this calculation yields a value for the embedded put in 
the 5-year TIPS of approximately $3.40 per $100 of face value.   

Using this valuation, we can then back out the probability of deflation as equal to the 
likelihood that the future inflation-adjusted principal falls below par over the next 
four years, using the Black-Scholes put option formula with an assumption for the 
mean rate of inflation.  Assuming a mean rate of inflation obtained from inflation 
caps contracts (equal to 0.89 percent), we estimate a risk-neutral probability of 
cumulative deflation over the next four years of about 43 percent, and conditional on 
being in a state of deflation we also obtain an expected cumulative deflation rate of    
-4.7 percent.  Note, however, that this procedure may overestimate the probability of 
deflation and conditional expected deflation, because most investors are probably not 
risk neutral and because investors may well use different distributional assumptions 
in valuing the put option.  The average probability of deflation over the next year 
reported  in the desk’s primary dealer survey is 30 percent; the two probabilities, 
however, are not directly comparable because they are measured for different time 
horizons. 
 



                                           
6In the last week of February, as part of the agency MBS purchase program, the Federal 
Reserve began conducting transactions in the dollar roll market to improve market 
functioning.  A dollar roll transaction involves the purchase (or sale) of a mortgage-backed 
security paired with a forward sale (or purchase) of an equivalent security.  Dollar rolls are 
often used by market participants as means of short-term borrowing and lending.  Partly as a 
result of the Federal Reserve transactions, implied financing rates in the dollar roll market 
dropped during the intermeeting period.

Capital Markets 

(20) Broad equity price indexes declined roughly 10 percent, on net, on increased 

concerns about the economic outlook and the health of the financial sector (Chart 4).   

Forward-trend earnings estimates for S&P 500 firms fell by similar amounts, resulting 

in little change in the ratio of forward-trend earnings to the estimated real long-term 

Treasury yield—a rough measure of the equity premium—from the high level 

recorded over the past few months.  Option-implied volatility on the S&P 500 index 

was little changed, on net, over the intermeeting period. 

(21) In the corporate bond market, spreads of yields on BBB-rated bonds 

relative to those on comparable-maturity Treasuries were little changed, while spreads 

on speculative-grade bonds increased about 80 basis points.  The investment- and 

speculative-grade CDX indexes widened significantly, on net, over the intermeeting 

period.  Gross bond issuance by nonfinancial firms was very strong in January and 

February, as investment-grade issuance more than doubled from its already solid pace 

in the fourth quarter; speculative-grade issuance, however, remained sluggish.       

(22) The System Open Market Account (SOMA) purchased $17.7 billion par 

value of debt of the housing-related government-sponsored enterprises (GSEs) over 

the intermeeting period.  The Federal Reserve also purchased a net amount of $147.6 

billion of agency-backed MBS between January 29 and March 11 (not all of which 

have yet settled).6  Spreads on 10-year agency debt over swap rates narrowed about 20 

basis points over the intermeeting period and those on agency MBS declined about 5 

basis points, on net.  The interest rate on 30-year fixed-rate conforming mortgages

was little changed over the intermeeting period, remaining slightly above 5 percent, 

and its spread to the 10-year off-the-run Treasury yield narrowed about 25 basis 

points.  On March 4, the Treasury announced additional details regarding the 

Homeowner Affordability and Stability Plan, which sets guidelines to enable servicers 

to begin modifications of eligible mortgage loans, and should help counter the 

ongoing rise in foreclosures.  

(23) The market for asset-backed securities (ABS) showed some tentative signs 

of improvement.  The launch of the Term Asset-Backed Securities Loan Facility 

(TALF) was officially announced on March 3.  In the initial phase of the program, the 

Federal Reserve will provide up to $200 billion of 3-year loans, on a non-recourse 

basis, against AAA-rated ABS backed by newly and recently originated auto loans, 

credit card loans, student loans, and SBA-guaranteed small business loans, and 

potentially certain other closely related types of ABS.  Reportedly supported in part by 

the upcoming launch of the TALF, indicative spreads on AAA-rated tranches of ABS 

in the secondary market narrowed further during the intermeeting period; however, 

issuance of student and auto loan ABS continues to be limited.  Market reports 

indicate that several TALF-eligible auto transactions are currently in the pipeline and 

ready to be brought to the facility at the first subscription for funding in mid-March.  

(24) Conditions in the municipal bond market continued to show signs of 

improvement for top-rated issuers over the intermeeting period, although issuance of 

long-term municipal bonds in February remained at relatively low levels, and lower-

rated entities continued to report difficulties in raising funds.  Yields on long-term 

municipal bonds decreased sharply with the passage of the fiscal stimulus bill, which 

appeared to ease concerns about the credit quality of municipal bond issuers.  Despite 



                                           
7 On February 18, the monoline insurer MBIA announced a corporate restructuring plan 
under which it would split into two companies, one for wrapping municipal obligations and 
the other for structured credit. 
8 The Bank of England announced immediate plans to purchase £75 billion in debt.  Of the 
full amount of £150 billion, the Bank of England may use up to £50 billion for the purchase 
of corporate bonds and commercial paper, although it is unclear whether it will use all of 
those funds to do so, and any funds not spent for that purpose may be used to purchase 
government bonds.  The Bank has stated that it intends to limit its purchases of government 
bonds to nominal gilts with remaining maturities of 5 to 25 years.  For purposes of 
comparison, were the Bank to purchase £75 billion in government debt, this would 
represent 14 percent of the entire nominal gilt market and 30 percent of nominal gilts with 
remaining maturities between 5 and 25 years.

the yield decline, the ratio of municipal bond rates to those on comparable maturity 

Treasury securities remained at elevated levels.7   

Foreign Developments 

(25) The deteriorating economic outlook led many central banks to cut their 

policy rates over the period.  The European Central Bank and the Bank of Canada 

both cut policy rates 50 basis points in March.  The Bank of England cut its target by 

a cumulative 100 basis points and secured permission to purchase up to £150 billion 

of government and corporate debt.  Ten-year sovereign yields in the United Kingdom 

fell nearly 60 basis points following the announcement that the Bank of England 

would purchase government bonds (Chart 5).8  The British government also initiated 

its Asset Protection Scheme, insuring £325 billion of assets placed by Royal Bank of 

Scotland and £260 billion placed by Lloyds while taking larger ownership shares in 

both banks.  The Bank of Japan left its policy target unchanged, but announced plans 

to purchase equities held on banks’ balance sheets as well as up to ¥1 trillion in 

corporate bonds.  The Swiss National Bank cut its target for the 3-month Swiss franc 

Libor rate by 25 basis points and announced that it would purchase both domestic 

corporate debt and foreign currency to increase liquidity.

(26) The dollar has broadly appreciated since the January FOMC meeting as 

foreign economic activity appears to be weakening much more than market 

participants had anticipated.  The major currencies index of the dollar rose 5¾   

percent on net as the dollar appreciated 3 to 10 percent against the euro, Canadian 

dollar, and yen.  Foreign equity price indexes once again declined sharply, particularly 

those for financial stocks.  Weak earnings reports and mounting concerns about losses 

on loans to Eastern Europe led bank shares in the euro area to decline by a third of 

their value.  Despite this, conditions in foreign currency interbank funding markets 

were little changed on net, perhaps bolstered by the numerous government actions 

taken over the past year to help support liquidity in those markets.   

(27) The dollar appreciated 3 percent against the currencies of our other 

important trading partners, rising nearly 6 percent against the Mexican peso and 

9 percent against the Korean won.  Mexican authorities continued to intervene to 

support the peso, and South Korean officials also acknowledged selling dollars against 

the won.  Equity indexes rose more than 7 percent in China as the government’s 

stimulus package helped boost spending in key segments of the economy, and rose 

modestly in Brazil and Korea, but stock prices declined 2 to 12 percent in the other 

major emerging Asian and Latin American countries.  EMBI spreads for countries in 

emerging Europe have risen in recent weeks as concerns about the economic outlook 

in these countries have grown.  Foreign investment in emerging European equity 

funds has declined more than 10 percent. The World Bank, European Bank for 

Reconstruction and Development (EBRD), and European Investment Bank (EIB) 

announced plans to provide up to €24.5 billion in aid to help central and eastern 

European banks weather the financial crisis, but further attempts to coordinate a 

larger aid package from western European nations have thus far failed. 



Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) 21 of 60

Debt, Bank Credit, and Money 

(28) Private sector debt growth has been quite weak.  The debt of the domestic 

private nonfinancial sector was about flat in the fourth quarter of last year and is 

projected to have remained so in the current quarter (Chart 6).  Household debt is 

estimated to have contracted for the second quarter in a row, owing to declines in 

both consumer and home mortgage debt that stem from very weak household 

spending, the continued drop in house prices, and tighter terms and standards for 

loans.  Business debt is projected to have expanded at a moderate pace in the current 

quarter, largely owing to the burst of corporate bond issuance.  However, we do not 

expect that the recent pace of issuance will be sustained.  Reflecting heavy borrowing 

by the Treasury, total debt of the domestic nonfinancial sector is projected to have 

expanded at a roughly 4½ percent annual rate in the first quarter, a deceleration from 

the pace recorded in the fourth quarter of last year.   

(29) Bank credit fell at an average annual rate of 4 percent in January and 

February, and has now declined for four consecutive months (the first such 

occurrence since 1948).  C&I loans have decreased at an annual rate of 7¾ percent 

since the beginning of the year.  The February Survey of Terms of Business Lending 

indicated that C&I loan rate spreads over comparable-maturity market instruments 

rose modestly overall from the November survey, although spreads increased sharply 

for lower-risk loans, especially those not made under previous commitment, a 

category that reflects recent pricing.   Commercial real estate loans outstanding have 

also declined thus far in 2009.  By contrast, consumer loans on banks' books jumped 

over the first two months of the year, reflecting sizable increases at a few banks that 

purchased loans from their affiliated finance companies.  In addition, some banks 

brought consumer loans back onto their books that had previously been securitized.  

After twelve consecutive months of contraction, residential mortgage loans on banks’ 

books increased in February, likely reflecting the pickup in refinancing activity.  In

contrast, the growth of home equity loans slowed noticeably in January and February.  

According to Call Report data, unused loan commitments for the major loan 

categories—consumer, business, and real estate loans—plunged in the fourth quarter 

of last year, as banks cut new and existing loan commitments. 

(30) M2 grew at an annual rate of about 4½ percent in February, a sharp 

deceleration from the very rapid pace recorded over the past few months.  Liquid 

deposits, while slowing considerably, continued to expand fairly briskly.  Savings 

deposits surged while demand deposits decreased, owing in part to one large 

institution’s resumption of its sweep program when it was clarified that swept funds 

would be covered under the FDIC’s guarantee program.  Retail money funds fell 

sharply in February, reflecting sizable outflows from Treasury-only funds, which have 

very low yields.  Small time deposits also contracted noticeably, as the institutions that 

had been bidding aggressively for these retail funds stopped doing so.  Currency 

growth remained robust in February, with much of the strength reflecting foreign 

demand, according to staff estimates.  



Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) 24 of 60

Economic Outlook 

(31) Information received since the January Greenbook has confirmed that  

the economy is undergoing a severe recession.  Real GDP is now estimated to have 

contracted during the final quarter of 2008 at an annual rate of 6¾ percent—a 

downward revision of nearly 2 percentage points since January—and is projected  

to contract at a similar pace during the current quarter.  Over the intermeeting period, 

broad equity price indexes fell about 14 percent, house prices continued to drop, and 

measures of consumer confidence reached historical lows.  Incoming data on foreign 

economies indicated that major U.S. trading partners have also fallen into recession. 

(32) Looking ahead, the staff projection assumes that the fiscal stimulus package 

approved last month will boost real GDP growth by about 1 percentage point this 

year and by a similar amount in 2010.  The staff outlook assumes that the Federal 

Reserve will not be implementing any further liquidity or credit programs beyond 

those that have already been announced.  Because market participants now appear  

to place significant odds on an eventual expansion of Federal Reserve acquisitions  

of agency debt, agency-backed MBS, and possibly long-term Treasury securities,  

this assumption implies that over time investors will be surprised by the lack of 

further policy action—a factor that helps explain the gradual rise in Treasury yields 

and mortgage rates anticipated in the staff forecast.  Risk premiums on private 

securities are projected to decline gradually in response to lessened financial market 

strains and diminished investor uncertainty; as a result, investment-grade corporate 

bond spreads narrow by about 130 basis points over the projection period while 

equity prices rebound at an annual rate of about 11 percent.  The real foreign 

exchange value of the dollar—which rose about 3 percent over the intermeeting 

period—is expected to start moving down later this year and to decline about  

3 percent next year.  The spot price of WTI crude oil has remained roughly 



Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) 25 of 60

unchanged at around $42 per barrel since late January but is projected to increase  

to about $55 per barrel by the end of next year.   

(33) Against this backdrop, real GDP is projected to contract at an annual rate 

of about 1 percent over the next three quarters, reaching a trough at the end of this 

year.  Subsequently, real GDP accelerates gradually but growth remains below that of 

potential through 2010.  As a result, the output gap widens to more than 8 percent by 

the end of next year, nearly 3 percentage points more than in the January Greenbook; 

this gap is projected to narrow thereafter but remains substantial through 2013.   

The unemployment rate is projected to rise to 9¼ percent by the end of the year,  

edge up a bit further next year, and decline gradually towards the NAIRU over the 

subsequent few years.  With such large and persistent slack in resource utilization,  

core PCE inflation drops from about 1 percent this year to about ½ percent  

in 2010—about ¼ percentage point lower than in the January Greenbook—and 

remains below 1 percent for several years thereafter.  In light of these projections  

for economic activity and inflation, the federal funds rate is assumed to stay very close 

to zero over the next five years. 

Monetary Policy Strategies  

(34) Reflecting the severe deterioration in the staff outlook for aggregate 

demand, all the estimates of short-run r* are significantly lower than those shown in 

the January Bluebook (Chart 7).  The Greenbook-consistent measure now stands at -

5.2 percent, a decline of about 2¼ percentage points since late January.  This 

downward revision mainly reflects recent weak readings on the labor market and 

many spending and production indicators, the significant reduction in broad equity 

price indexes, the appreciation of the dollar against major and emerging-market 

currencies, and much weaker foreign demand.  Model-based estimates of short-run r* 

span a wide interval, but all now fall substantially below zero.  The estimate from the

9 In these simulations, policymakers place equal weight on keeping core PCE inflation close 
to a specified goal, on keeping unemployment close to the NAIRU, and on avoiding changes 
in the nominal federal funds rate.  

Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) 28 of 60

small structural model is -10.0 percent, about 3¾ percentage points lower than in the 

last Bluebook; this revision reflects the recent widening of the output gap as well as 

the sharp drop in equity prices.  The FRB/US model estimate of r* is now -8.6 

percent, down 1¾ percentage point from January; that drop mainly reflects the lower 

equity prices, the higher dollar, and weaker near-term domestic and foreign real 

activity.  The estimate of the single-equation model—which does not depend on 

equity prices—is not as low as the other estimates; it now stands at -2.0 percent, about 

2 percentage points lower than in the previous Bluebook.  This reduction reflects the 

recent weakening in real activity, which translates into a larger negative output gap.  

All these measures of short-run r* are well below the current level of the actual real 

federal funds rate. 

(35) To provide another perspective on the economic outlook and possible 

monetary policy strategies, optimal control simulations of the FRB/US model were 

conducted using the long-run staff forecast as a starting point.9  Chart 8 shows the 

simulation results for an inflation goal of 2 percent—a level that is broadly consistent 

with the longer-run inflation projection in the February Summary of Economic 

Projections.  As in recent Bluebooks, optimal monetary policy is severely constrained 

by the zero lower bound and holds the nominal funds rate close to zero through 2013 

(black solid lines); an almost identical path was shown in the January Bluebook (red 

dashed lines).  In fact, the severity of the zero bound constraint is even worse now 

because of the deterioration in the economic outlook, and as a result the period of 

very low policy rates now extends well beyond 2013, unlike the case in January (not 

shown).  In the simulation, financial market participants recognize this downward 

revision to the long-run path of the funds rate—an expectation that provides some 

modest support to real activity and inflation over the next few years through lower 



                                           
10 In the version of the FRB/US model used for these simulations, wage and price setters 
update their estimate of the Committee’s inflation target—and thus their expectations for 
long-run inflation—in response to two factors: recent changes in actual inflation, and 
monetary policy surprises, where the latter are gauged (in essence) by the deviation of the 
federal funds rate from the prescriptions of an estimated Taylor rule.  The large persistent 
fall in the nominal funds rate in the unconstrained optimal policy simulation comes as a 
surprise to these agents, leading them over time to mark up substantially their expectations 
for long-run inflation.  This revision in expectations in turn causes actual inflation to rise 
appreciably in the simulation. 

Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) 29 of 60

long-term interest rates.  However, the additional stimulus is not enough to offset the 

more pronounced underlying weakness of spending in the current staff projection, as 

evidenced by the downward revisions to the estimates of r*.  Thus, the civilian 

unemployment rate is about 1½ to 2 percentage points higher from 2010 onwards 

than in the January simulations, and core PCE inflation is somewhat lower.   

(36) To illustrate the severity of the zero lower bound constraint, Chart 8 also 

displays results without imposing the zero bound on the nominal interest rate (blue 

dotted lines).  Under this unconstrained policy, the optimal funds rate path would fall 

to -6½ percent late next year, rising back above zero only in 2013.  In the 

unconstrained optimal policy scenario, the additional stimulus that can be achieved in 

the absence of the zero bound shows through to the real federal funds rate.  In the 

case where the zero lower bound holds, the real federal funds rate hovers around -1 

percent through the entire simulation period.  But in the hypothetical case in which 

nominal interest rates are free to turn negative, the real funds rate decreases to -7¾ 

percent by the end of 2010.  Relative to the constrained case, such a policy would 

allow the civilian unemployment rate to run about 1 percentage point lower over the 

next few years, and would put core PCE inflation on a steep upward trajectory from 

about 1¼ percent in mid-2010 to 2½ percent by the end of 2013.10  This 

overshooting of the inflation target—which is only temporary—is desirable from the 

standpoint of optimal policy, because it leads to more favorable financial conditions 

early in the simulation period, thereby providing more initial support to real activity. 



                                           
11 Given the uncertainty about the economic and financial outlook, reading policy 
expectations from federal funds futures and options is not straightforward; in particular, the 
term premium may be larger than usual.  The most recent dealer survey shows that the 
majority of respondents do not expect the first rate increase to occur until the first quarter of 
2011 or later.  

Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) 30 of 60

(37) The additional monetary easing associated with the counterfactual 

unconstrained optimal policy can provide a useful benchmark in judging the stimulus 

provided by nontraditional policy actions.  The extra monetary stimulus resulting 

from removing the zero bound constraint reduces the ten-year Treasury yield, the 

conventional mortgage rate, and the yield on investment-grade bonds by about 1½ 

percentage point relative to their trajectories under the constrained policy (not 

shown).  As presented in the box entitled “Large-Scale Asset Purchases and 

Unconstrained Optimal Policy,” some of the benefits of such an unconstrained policy 

can likely be attained by a policy of large-scale purchases of long-term Treasury 

securities and agency MBS. 

(38) As depicted in Chart 9, the outcome-based policy rule prescribes a funds 

rate at its effective lower bound through mid-2012—about a year longer than shown 

in the January Bluebook.  In contrast, the trajectory of the funds rate that appears to 

be anticipated by financial market participants is significantly higher; it rises above 1 

percent by the end of 2010 before reaching a plateau of about 2¾ percent in 2012.11  

Compared with the January Bluebook, medium-term uncertainty regarding the path 

for policy has decreased, and the confidence intervals are now tighter for 2009 and 

2010.  Consistent with the deterioration in the staff’s economic projections, all the 

simple policy rules prescribe setting the nominal funds rate at the lower bound.

Large-Scale Asset Purchases and Unconstrained Optimal Policy 

This box analyzes the extent to which a combination of a conventional optimal policy 
and nontraditional policy measures could generate unemployment and inflation outcomes 
similar to those associated with the unconstrained optimal policy discussed in the text.  In the 
charts below, we use simulations of the FRB/US model to show the implications for the 
outlook of different scenarios for expanding the Federal Reserve’s current program of large-
scale asset purchases.1 

The first scenario (dotted red lines) considers additional MBS purchases of $500 billion.  
The second scenario (dash-dotted green) assumes purchases of $500 billion of long-term 
Treasury securities as well as an additional $500 billion of MBS.  The third program (dash-
dotted magenta) considers an even larger package, totaling $2.0 trillion, evenly split between 
purchases of MBS and long-term Treasury securities; this program would involve purchases 
equivalent to about 30 percent of the current publicly held stock of nominal coupon Treasury 
securities and about 80 percent of the stock with terms greater than five years.  Given the 
current configuration of market interest rates and the staff’s estimates of the relative 
macroeconomic effects of operations across assets, tilting the composition of asset purchases 
toward a larger share of MBS may be viewed as a desirable option.  On the other hand, in light 
of the considerable uncertainty about the quantitative effects of these policies, it may be 
prudent to include a significant share of Treasury securities.2  

The efficacy of any asset purchase program is quite uncertain and hinges on the extent 
to which the program directly affects the yields of the asset purchased as well as whether those

3 Under the unconstrained optimal policy, the significant reduction in nominal interest rates causes agents to mark up 
substantially their long-run inflation expectations – this raises inflation appreciably in the simulation. 

Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) 32 of 60

effects spill over to other asset markets. In the simulations, it is assumed that the full effects of 
the programs on Treasury, mortgage, and corporate bond rates are felt in the second quarter 
of 2009 when the programs are first announced; these shifts persist through 2011 and then 
begin to fade in 2012 as the Federal Reserve’s positions in MBS and Treasury debt are 
assumed to be gradually unwound.    

As shown in the chart on the previous page, depending on the size of the program, the 
unemployment rate is reduced on average by ½, ¾, or 1¼ percentage points, respectively.  
The largest program comes close to replicating the counterfactual outlook shown for the 
unconstrained optimal policy.  As shown in the chart above, these unconventional programs 
boost inflation somewhat over coming years but fail to bring inflation to the assumed 2 
percent target by the end of 2013.  Nonetheless, inflation returns to about 1¾ percent under 
the most aggressive program by the end of the forecast period.3  

Although these simulations suggest that sufficiently large asset purchases can generate 
unemployment paths similar to those under the unconstrained policy, there is substantial 
uncertainty about this analysis.  Given that financial market participants currently put 
substantial odds on an expansion of the current program of large-scale asset purchases, the 
announcement of such an extension may not have as large an effect on the near-term 
economic outlook as suggested in the simulations.  Moreover, the currently heightened level 
of uncertainty could make firms and households reluctant to invest even if credit conditions 
improve substantially.  Nonetheless, lower real long-term interest rates might increase house 
prices as well as mortgage refinancings by more than in the FRB/US analysis, thereby 
providing a greater stimulus to aggregate demand.

Policy Alternatives 

(39) This Bluebook presents three policy alternatives for the Committee’s 

consideration, summarized by the draft statements on the following pages.   

The draft statements for Alternatives A and B incorporate a new organizational 

structure in which the statement begins not by referring to the federal funds rate 

target but by characterizing the Committee’s outlook and then goes on to describe  

the Federal Reserve’s policy strategy.  The draft statement for Alternative C uses  

the same structure as in the January FOMC statement.   A somewhat different 

approach to structuring these statements is discussed at the end of this section. 

(40) All three alternatives maintain an unchanged target range of 0 to ¼ percent 

for the federal funds rate and provide forward policy guidance; as in January, 

Alternatives B and C indicate that the funds rate is likely to remain exceptionally  

low “for some time” whereas Alternative A signals a somewhat longer duration  

by substituting the phrase “for an extended period.”  All of the alternatives refer  

to the recent launching of the TALF and note that the range of eligible collateral  

for that program is likely to be expanded to include other financial assets.  As in the 

January statement, each alternative indicates that the Committee will continue to 

monitor the size and composition of the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet and will 

assess whether lending facilities should be expanded or modified.   

(41) In characterizing the outlook for economic activity, Alternatives A and B 

indicate that the economy is undergoing “a severe contraction” and that financial 

conditions “have generally worsened.”  Both alternatives state that policy measures  

to stabilize financial markets and institutions, along with stimulus from fiscal and 

monetary policy, will contribute to “a gradual resumption of sustainable economic 

growth,” but neither alternative makes any specific reference to the timing of 

economic recovery or to the balance of risks to the economic outlook.  In contrast, 

Alternative C characterizes the incoming information as indicating that economic 



                                           
12 These alternatives do not include any expansion in Federal Reserve purchases of agency 
debt, because the benefits from further purchases of such securities seem limited.  For 
further discussion, see the note on “Expanding Large-Scale Asset Purchases: Effectiveness, 
Benefits, Risks, and Strategies” by Joseph Gagnon, David Lucca, Jonathan McCarthy,  
Julie Remache, and Jennifer Roush that was distributed to the FOMC on March 11.  

Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) 35 of 60

activity “has slowed further” but follows the language of the January FOMC 

statement in pointing to a gradual economic recovery starting later this year and  

in noting significant downside risks to that outlook.   

(42) Alternatives A and B indicate that inflation is likely to remain subdued  

in light of “the growing margin of economic slack here and abroad,” and both 

alternatives make note of the risk that inflation could remain persistently below rates 

consistent with the dual mandate.  As in January, Alternative C refers to last fall’s  

drop in energy and commodity prices and to “prospects for considerable economic 

slack” as factors explaining the outlook for inflation, which is expected to remain 

subdued “in coming quarters” before returning to rates consistent with the dual 

mandate; this alternative does not give an assessment of risks to the inflation outlook. 

(43) All three alternatives emphasize that the Federal Reserve will employ  

“all available tools” for promoting economic recovery and preserving price stability, 

but the alternatives differ regarding which new policy measures, if any, should be 

initiated at this meeting.  Alternative A indicates that the Federal Reserve’s balance 

sheet will be expanded further this year by the purchase of $500 billion in longer-term 

Treasury securities and by the acquisition of an additional $500 billion of agency 

mortgage-backed securities (MBS), bringing total MBS purchases to $1 trillion.12  

Alternative B expands agency MBS purchases by $500 billion but does not initiate any 

acquisition of Treasury notes or bonds; as in the January statement, this alternative 

indicates that the Committee is prepared to purchase longer-term Treasury securities 

“if evolving circumstances indicate that such transactions would be particularly 

effective in improving conditions in private credit markets.”  Under Alternative C,  

no new policy actions would be taken at this meeting; instead, as in January, this 



Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) 36 of 60

alternative states that the Federal Reserve stands ready to expand its purchases of 

agency debt and MBS and is prepared to purchase longer-term Treasury securities  

in light of evolving circumstances. 



Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) 37 of 60

January FOMC Statement 

The Federal Open Market Committee decided today to keep its target range for the federal funds 
rate at 0 to ¼ percent.  The Committee continues to anticipate that economic conditions are likely 
to warrant exceptionally low levels of the federal funds rate for some time. 

Information received since the Committee met in December suggests that the economy has 
weakened further.  Industrial production, housing starts, and employment have continued to 
decline steeply, as consumers and businesses have cut back spending.  Furthermore, global 
demand appears to be slowing significantly.  Conditions in some financial markets have 
improved, in part reflecting government efforts to provide liquidity and strengthen financial 
institutions; nevertheless, credit conditions for households and firms remain extremely tight.  The 
Committee anticipates that a gradual recovery in economic activity will begin later this year, but 
the downside risks to that outlook are significant. 

In light of the declines in the prices of energy and other commodities in recent months and the 
prospects for considerable economic slack, the Committee expects that inflation pressures will 
remain subdued in coming quarters.  Moreover, the Committee sees some risk that inflation 
could persist for a time below rates that best foster economic growth and price stability in the 
longer term. 

The Federal Reserve will employ all available tools to promote the resumption of sustainable 
economic growth and to preserve price stability.  The focus of the Committee's policy is to 
support the functioning of financial markets and stimulate the economy through open market 
operations and other measures that are likely to keep the size of the Federal Reserve's balance 
sheet at a high level.  The Federal Reserve continues to purchase large quantities of agency debt 
and mortgage-backed securities to provide support to the mortgage and housing markets, and it 
stands ready to expand the quantity of such purchases and the duration of the purchase program 
as conditions warrant.  The Committee also is prepared to purchase longer-term Treasury 
securities if evolving circumstances indicate that such transactions would be particularly 
effective in improving conditions in private credit markets.  The Federal Reserve will be 
implementing the Term Asset-Backed Securities Loan Facility to facilitate the extension of credit 
to households and small businesses.   
 

The Committee will continue to monitor carefully the size and composition of the Federal 
Reserve's balance sheet in light of evolving financial market developments and to assess whether 
expansions of or modifications to lending facilities would serve to further support credit markets 
and economic activity and help to preserve price stability.

Alternative A 

1.  Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in January indicates  
that the economy is undergoing a severe contraction and that the outlook for the next several 
quarters has worsened.  Job losses, declining equity and housing wealth, and tight credit 
conditions have weighed on consumer sentiment and spending.  Weaker sales prospects and 
difficulties in obtaining credit have led businesses to cut back on inventories and fixed 
investment.  U.S. exports have slumped as a number of major trading partners have also fallen 
into recession.  Although the near-term economic outlook is weak, the Committee anticipates 
that policy actions to stabilize financial markets and institutions, together with fiscal and 
monetary stimulus, will contribute to a gradual resumption of sustainable economic growth. 

2.  In light of increasing economic slack here and abroad, the Committee expects that inflation  
will remain subdued.  Moreover, the Committee sees some risk that inflation could persist for  
a time below rates that best foster economic growth and price stability in the longer term. 

3.  In these circumstances, the Federal Reserve will employ all available tools to promote 
economic recovery and to preserve price stability.  The Committee will maintain the target range 
for the federal funds rate at 0 to ¼ percent and anticipates that economic conditions are likely to 
warrant exceptionally low levels of the federal funds rate for an extended period.  To provide 
greater support to mortgage lending and housing markets, the Committee decided today to 
increase the size of the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet further by purchasing an additional $500 
billion of agency mortgage-backed securities, bringing its total purchases of these securities to $1 
trillion this year; at least half of this total will be acquired by June.  Moreover, to help reduce 
longer-term interest rates in private credit markets, the Committee decided to purchase $500 
billion of longer-term Treasury securities this year.  The Federal Reserve has launched the Term 
Asset-Backed Securities Loan Facility to facilitate the extension of credit to households and 
small businesses and anticipates that the range of eligible collateral for this facility is likely to be 
expanded to include other financial assets.  The Committee will continue to monitor carefully the 
size and composition of the Federal Reserve's balance sheet in light of evolving financial market 
developments and to assess whether lending facilities should be expanded or modified to provide 
further support to credit markets and economic activity and to help preserve price stability.

will remain subdued.  Moreover, the Committee sees some risk that inflation could persist for  
a time below rates that best foster economic growth and price stability in the longer term. 

3.  In these circumstances, the Federal Reserve will employ all available tools to promote 
economic recovery and to preserve price stability.  The Committee will maintain the target range 
for the federal funds rate at 0 to ¼ percent and anticipates that economic conditions are likely to 
warrant exceptionally low levels of the federal funds rate for some time.  To provide greater 
support to mortgage lending and housing markets, the Committee decided today to increase the 
size of the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet further by purchasing an additional $500 billion of 
agency mortgage-backed securities, bringing its total purchases of these securities to $1 trillion 
this year; at least half of this total will be acquired by June.  The Committee also is prepared to 
purchase longer-term Treasury securities if evolving circumstances indicate that such 
transactions would be particularly effective in improving conditions in private credit markets.  
The Federal Reserve has launched the Term Asset-Backed Securities Loan Facility to facilitate 
the extension of credit to households and small businesses and anticipates that the range of 
eligible collateral for this facility is likely to be expanded to include other financial assets.  The 
Committee will continue to monitor carefully the size and composition of the Federal Reserve's 
balance sheet in light of evolving financial market developments and to assess whether lending 
facilities should be expanded or modified to provide further support to credit markets and 
economic activity and to help preserve price stability.

Alternative C 

1.  The Federal Open Market Committee decided today to keep its target range for the federal 
funds rate at 0 to ¼ percent.  The Committee continues to anticipate that economic conditions are 
likely to warrant exceptionally low levels of the federal funds rate for some time. 

2.  Information received since the Committee met in January indicates that the economy has  
slowed further.  Job losses, declining equity and housing wealth, and tight credit conditions have 
weighed on consumer sentiment and spending.  Weaker sales prospects and difficulties in 
obtaining credit have led businesses to cut back on inventories and fixed investment.  
Furthermore, global demand appears to be slowing significantly.  Conditions in some financial 
markets have improved, in part reflecting government efforts to provide liquidity and strengthen 
financial institutions.  The Committee anticipates that a gradual recovery in economic activity 
will begin later this year, but the downside risks to that outlook are significant. 

3.  In light of the declines in the prices of energy and other commodities that occurred last fall  
and the prospects for considerable economic slack, the Committee expects that inflation will  
remain subdued in coming quarters before returning to rates that best foster economic growth  
and price stability in the longer term. 

4.  The Federal Reserve will employ all available tools to promote the resumption of sustainable 
economic growth and to preserve price stability.  The Federal Reserve continues to purchase  
large quantities of agency debt and mortgage-backed securities to provide support to the 
mortgage and housing markets, and it stands ready to expand the quantity of such purchases and 
the duration of the purchase program as conditions warrant.  The Committee also is prepared to 
purchase longer-term Treasury securities if evolving circumstances indicate that such 
transactions would be particularly effective in improving conditions in private credit markets.  
The Federal Reserve has launched the Term Asset-Backed Securities Loan Facility to facilitate

The Case for Alternative B 

(44) If policymakers judge that the economy is undergoing a severe economic 

contraction and that the subsequent recovery is likely to be feeble, and if they believe 

that a further increase in the size of the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet would  

provide additional monetary stimulus and thereby improve the economic outlook,  

the Committee could decide at this meeting to expand its purchases of agency  

MBS and to reiterate the possibility of purchasing longer-term Treasury securities 

depending on evolving circumstances, as in Alternative B.  Incoming information 

over the intermeeting period may have led policymakers to mark down their 

projections for economic activity and inflation and hence to anticipate a deeper 

recession and a weaker recovery—perhaps lasting five years or more—in the absence 

of any additional policy stimulus.  For example, the Greenbook-consistent measure of 

short-run r* has fallen sharply since January and is now almost 4 percentage points 

below the actual real federal funds rate, indicating that a substantial further increase  

in the degree of policy stimulus would be required to close the output gap over  

a three-year period.  This policy alternative might also be appealing to members  

who already considered the economic outlook to be quite bleak in late January but 

preferred at that time to postpone consideration of further monetary policy easing 

until after Congress had approved the fiscal stimulus package and the administration 

had announced its plans for stabilizing the financial system and the housing sector.  

Even members whose modal forecast is more optimistic than that of the staff  

might nonetheless believe that additional monetary stimulus would be appropriate  

to provide impetus to the economy and to help alleviate the risk of an accelerating 

feedback loop between financial conditions and economic activity that might lead to 

even more severe macroeconomic outcomes.

Securities and Agency Debt and MBS” by Eileen Mauskopf and David Reifschneider  
that was distributed to the FOMC on March 9.   

Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) 42 of 60

(45) While predictions of the stimulative effects of expanded agency MBS 

purchases are subject to considerable uncertainty, especially under present economic 

and financial circumstances, event studies and model simulations may be helpful  

in providing a very rough gauge.  For example, yields on agency MBS fell nearly  

45 basis points on November 25, 2008—the day that the Federal Reserve announced 

that it would purchase up to $100 billion in agency debt and up to $500 billion in 

agency MBS—while yields on longer-term Treasury securities and investment-grade 

corporate debt declined by about 20 basis points.  Since then, agency MBS yields  

have fallen further, on net, to rates more than 100 basis points below those prevailing 

in mid-November, while conventional mortgage rates have declined nearly 100 basis 

points.  In light of that event study and other evidence, the staff currently estimates 

that expanding agency MBS purchases by an additional $500 billion over the course  

of this year could push down agency MBS yields and conventional mortgage rates  

by about ¾ percentage point, while spillover effects might tend to reduce yields  

on corporate bonds and longer-term Treasury securities by about ½ percentage point 

and ¼ percentage point, respectively.13  Assuming that the policy measure has these 

direct effects on longer-term interest rates, simulations of the FRB/US model indicate 

that the unemployment rate in late 2012 would decline by nearly ½ percentage point 

relative to baseline.14  Of course, the magnitude of that impact is subject to numerous 

uncertainties, in part because the FRB/US model abstracts from some specific 

characteristics of the transmission mechanism—including house prices, distributional 

effects of mortgage refinancing, and credit market frictions—that might well magnify 

or dampen the actual stimulus from this policy measure.   



                                           
15  As discussed in the note on “Long-Run Balance Sheet Prospects and Exit Strategy 
Issues” by Chris Burke, Spence Hilton, and Warren Hrung that was distributed to the 
FOMC on March 12, the Desk anticipates that developing the capability to arrange large-
scale reverse repos of agency MBS—which have not been conducted to date—could require 
several quarters; moreover, it is difficult at this stage to assess the extent of the market 
capacity for such transactions. 

Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) 43 of 60

(46) A significant consideration in deciding whether to move ahead with  

a $500 billion expansion of agency MBS purchases would be the extent to which 

policymakers are comfortable that this policy measure would not be likely to constrain 

the future conduct of monetary policy.  Substantial balance sheet adjustments may 

well be needed once the Committee judges that the funds rate should be raised above 

its current target range—an eventuality that does not take place until after 2013  

in the Greenbook projection but that might arise sooner if the economy recovers 

more briskly or inflation picks up more quickly than expected by the staff.  Last fall’s 

developments in the federal funds market showed that paying interest on reserve 

balances held by depository institutions may not be sufficient to provide a firm  

floor for the funds rate in an environment with a very high level of excess reserves 

and with some major market participants—such as the GSEs—ineligible to receive 

interest on reserves.  If a reduction in reserve balances was needed to attain a specific 

value of the federal funds rate, the staff currently anticipates that the Desk would  

be able to absorb some reserve balances by selling agency MBS or Treasury securities  

or by engaging in reverse repos using those securities as collateral; such operations  

can be conducted under the Federal Reserve’s existing authority.15  However, selling  

large quantities of longer-term securities might induce strains in debt markets and 

could result in substantial capital losses for the Federal Reserve, while large reverse 

repo operations would avoid the realization of capital losses but might severely strain  

the capacity of the repo market; in any case, the overall scale of these operations could 

not exceed the market value of Federal Reserve holdings of longer-term securities.   

Of course, the size of the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet may not pose any 



                                           
16 See the note on “Legislative Initiatives for Additional Federal Reserve Balance Sheet 
Management Tools” by Scott Alvarez and Brian Madigan that was sent to the Committee  
on March 9. 

Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) 44 of 60

substantial constraints on the conduct of monetary policy if statutory authority  

is obtained for the Federal Reserve to issue its own interest-earning obligations  

(“Fed bills”) or for the Treasury, at the request of the Federal Reserve, to issue 

Supplementary Financing Bills; in either case, these securities would be exempted 

from the federal debt ceiling.16 

(47) A number of distinct factors might motivate a decision not to initiate 

purchases of longer-term Treasury securities at this meeting but to preserve  

the option of pursuing such purchases at a later date.  Policymakers may be skeptical 

that large-scale purchases of Treasury notes and bonds would be the most efficient 

means of improving private sector credit conditions, especially in an environment of 

elevated credit frictions and incomplete arbitrage across different financial markets.  

Indeed, the Committee may see a substantial risk that purchases of longer-term 

Treasury securities could have detrimental effects on financial market functioning, 

perhaps by diminishing the value of Treasury notes and bonds as hedging vehicles.  

Moreover, the Committee may be concerned that the Federal Reserve’s credibility 

could be undermined if investors perceived this program as oriented towards 

monetizing the federal debt rather than as a tool for preserving price stability and 

promoting the resumption of sustainable economic growth; such a weakening of 

Federal Reserve credibility could push up inflation risk premiums and thereby raise 

the cost of longer-term credit for households and businesses.  Finally, the recently 

announced expansion of the TALF is likely to increase the size of the Federal 

Reserve’s balance sheet, and expanded purchases of agency MBS would generate a 

substantial further increase in the size of the balance sheet that at some stage would 

need to be reversed; thus, even if policymakers conclude that large-scale purchases  

of Treasury notes and bonds would be helpful in providing additional economic 



Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) 45 of 60

stimulus, they may prefer to hold off on initiating an even larger balance sheet 

expansion at the current juncture. 

The Case for Alternative A 

(48) If policymakers judge that a substantially greater degree of monetary 

stimulus is warranted to help promote a resumption of sustainable economic growth, 

the Committee could decide at this meeting to initiate large-scale purchases of  

$500 billion in longer-term Treasury securities and to expand purchases of  

agency MBS, as in Alternative A.  Committee participants may concur that the 

Federal Reserve’s current liquidity and credit facilities are crucial for stabilizing  

the financial system and providing the prerequisites for economic recovery, but  

they may nonetheless view the monetary and fiscal policy measures currently in train  

as unlikely to foster an acceptably rapid pace for that recovery.  Indeed, in the absence 

of any further macroeconomic stimulus, the Greenbook projects that in mid-2012  

the unemployment rate will still be above 7 percent and the core inflation rate will be 

less than ¾ percent.  As noted above, a $500 billion expansion in purchases of agency 

MBS could be helpful in improving that outlook but still would not be likely to bring 

the economy to its potential even after five years.  Moreover, participants’ projections 

for economic activity and inflation might be considerably worse than that of the 

Greenbook if they anticipate that credit market frictions are likely to generate  

further sharp declines in spending and employment in coming quarters, as in the 

Greenbook’s “Intensifying Financial Strains” scenario, and hence they might see an 

even stronger rationale for providing additional monetary stimulus to the economy.   

(49) The stimulative impact of large-scale purchases of Treasury notes and 

bonds is very difficult to predict because such a monetary policy measure would be 

unprecedented for the United States.  Nevertheless, various sources of evidence shed 

some light on the likely response of longer-term Treasury yields and other longer-term 



                                           
17 See the note on “Expanding Large-Scale Asset Purchases: Effectiveness, Benefits, Risks, 
and Strategies” by Joseph Gagnon, David Lucca, Jonathan McCarthy, Julie Remache, and 
Jennifer Roush that was distributed to the FOMC on March 11. 

Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) 46 of 60

interest rates.17  A staff review of the empirical literature indicates that a Federal 

Reserve program to purchase $500 billion in longer-term Treasury securities would  

be likely to push down the 10-year Treasury yield by about 20 to 100 basis points; 

staff analysis of Treasury issuance surprises over the past decade suggests that the 

impact could be near the upper end of this range, whereas analysis of high-frequency 

order book data implies that the response could be near the bottom of this range.  

Earlier this month, yields on U.K. long-term government securities declined nearly  

60 basis points in response to the Bank of England’s announcement that it would  

be purchasing a substantial amount of those securities; adjusting for the size of  

the announced purchases relative to the outstanding stock, this event suggests that  

a Federal Reserve program to purchase $500 billion in U.S. government notes and 

bonds would reduce longer-term yields by a similar amount.  Of course, predicting  

the magnitude of spillovers to private interest rates is subject to a great deal of 

additional uncertainty.  During times of normal financial market functioning, weekly 

changes in longer-term Treasury yields and in private interest rates exhibit correlations 

exceeding 90 percent, suggesting that a decline in Treasury yields would be matched 

by a roughly similar decline in yields on private debt instruments of comparable 

maturity.  In contrast, the linkages across financial markets appear to be much weaker 

under present market conditions.  For example, since the onset of the financial crisis, 

weekly changes in the 10-year Treasury yield have exhibited correlations of about  

50 to 70 percent with changes in yields on investment-grade corporate debt.   

(50) Given specific assumptions about the impact of large-scale purchases  

of Treasury notes and bonds on a range of longer-term yields, FRB/US model 

simulations can be employed to gauge the impact of such purchases on the broader 



                                           
18 See the note on “Economic Effects of Large-Scale Purchases of Long-term Treasury 
Securities and Agency Debt and MBS” by Eileen Mauskopf and David Reifschneider  
that was distributed to the FOMC on March 9. 

Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) 47 of 60

economy.18  In light of the available empirical evidence, it seems plausible that a 

Federal Reserve program to purchase $500 billion in Treasury notes and bonds  

would push down longer-term Treasury yields by about 50 basis points and that 

spillover effects would lead to a 30 basis point decline in conventional mortgage  

rates and longer-term corporate bond yields.  Assuming that the program has  

those effects on longer-term interest rates, simulations of the FRB/US model  

indicate that this program would reduce the unemployment rate in late 2012 by  

nearly ½ percentage point relative to the Greenbook baseline.  Thus, as shown in the 

box on “Large-Scale Asset Purchases and Unconstrained Optimal Control Policies,”  

if this initiative is combined with a $500 billion expansion in purchases of agency 

MBS, the model implies that the unemployment rate would be close to 5 percent  

by 2013 while core inflation would be about 1¼ percent and heading towards rates 

consistent with the dual mandate. 

(51) In an environment of exceptionally high uncertainty, policymakers may  

judge that Alternative A provides the most appropriate balance between downside 

risks to the economic outlook over the next several years and the risk that excessive 

expansion of the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet could hamper the conduct of 

monetary policy at longer horizons.  Members may interpret recent data as providing 

a strengthened rationale for taking further action to alleviate downside risks to 

economic activity and price stability.  For example, with the trajectory for core 

inflation now expected to be even lower over the next few years, participants  

may perceive a greater risk that the longer-run inflation expectations of households  

and businesses could drift downward over time, as in the Greenbook’s “Deflation” 

scenario.  Indeed, as discussed in the box on “Extracting Deflation Probabilities  

from TIPS,” investors evidently perceive a significant probability that the price level 



Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) 48 of 60

will decline over the next five years; a substantial increase in monetary stimulus  

might help ameliorate those concerns.  Moreover, to the extent that the 

extraordinarily high level of corporate bond spreads reflects investors’ worries  

about an even steeper macroeconomic downturn, participants may conclude that 

expanding agency MBS purchases and initiating purchases of longer-term Treasury 

securities could reduce these spreads by reassuring investors about the economic 

outlook.  Finally, policymakers may be reasonably optimistic about the prospects  

for receiving new tools for managing the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet and hence 

they may be comfortable that a further sizable expansion in the balance sheet would 

not pose significant risks in terms of imposing constraints on the future conduct of 

monetary policy. 

The Case for Alternative C 

(52) If policymakers anticipate a more robust economic recovery than in the 

staff outlook and perceive that further expansion in the size of the Federal Reserve’s 

balance sheet would be associated with substantial risks to the future conduct of 

monetary policy, they may prefer not to initiate any new policy measures at this 

meeting, as in Alternative C.  Committee participants may foresee that government 

actions to stabilize the financial system, together with the monetary and fiscal policies 

already in train, are likely to foster a stronger pace of economic activity later this year 

and in 2010, as in the Greenbook’s “Faster Recovery” scenario.  Participants may also 

judge that some portion of the current economic downturn reflects a falloff in trend 

productivity growth, perhaps reflecting the costs of adjustment associated with 

sectoral reallocation of capital and labor, as in the Greenbook’s “More Adverse 

Supply Conditions” scenario; in that case, the extent of economic slack would be 

substantially smaller than in the staff projection, and inflation could stay much closer 

to rates judged to be consistent with the dual mandate.  Even if policymakers see the 



Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) 49 of 60

economy as likely to follow a trajectory similar to that of the staff projection, they  

may see fiscal policy as the most appropriate tool for providing additional stimulus.  

Finally, policymakers may be particularly concerned about the risk that constraints 

arising from the size of the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet could constrain the  

future conduct of monetary policy; if so, they may be reluctant to adopt measures  

that would further expand its assets and liabilities, at least until the Federal Reserve 

receives new tools for managing the size and composition of its balance sheet. 

An Alternative Structure for the FOMC Statement 

(53) The draft statements for Alternatives A and B begin by characterizing  

the outlook for economic activity and inflation, and the draft statement for 

Alternative C starts by indicating the Committee’s decision to maintain the target 

range for the federal funds rate.  However, participants may instead prefer that  

the FOMC statement begin by pointing to new policy measures that the Committee 

has approved, as illustrated in Alternatives A' and B' below, or to reaffirm the existing 

policy strategy, as in Alternative C'.  The substance of these three alternatives is 

identical to those of Alternatives A, B, and C, respectively. 



 
 
 

Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) 50 of 60

Alternative A' 

1.  The Federal Open Market Committee decided today to increase the size of the Federal 
Reserve’s balance sheet further by purchasing $500 billion of longer-term Treasury securities 
this year and by acquiring an additional $500 billion of agency mortgage-backed securities 
(MBS), bringing its total purchases of agency MBS this year to $1 trillion, at least half of which 
will be acquired by June.  The Committee anticipates that these actions will help reduce longer-
term interest rates in private credit markets and will provide greater support to mortgage lending 
and housing markets.  The Federal Reserve has launched the Term Asset-Backed Securities Loan 
Facility to facilitate the extension of credit to households and small businesses and anticipates 
that the range of eligible collateral for this facility is likely to be expanded to include other 
financial assets.  The Committee will maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to ¼ 
percent and anticipates that economic conditions are likely to warrant exceptionally low levels of 
the federal funds rate for some time.   

2.  This decision reflects information received since the Committee met in January that indicates  
that the economy is undergoing a severe contraction and that the outlook for the next several 
quarters has worsened.  Job losses, declining equity and housing wealth, and tight credit 
conditions have weighed on consumer sentiment and spending.  Weaker sales prospects and 
difficulties in obtaining credit have led businesses to cut back on inventories and fixed 
investment.  U.S. exports have slumped as a number of major trading partners have also fallen 
into recession.  Although the near-term economic outlook is weak, the Committee anticipates 
that policy actions to stabilize financial markets and institutions, together with fiscal and 
monetary stimulus, will contribute to a gradual resumption of sustainable economic growth. 

3.  In light of increasing economic slack here and abroad, the Committee expects that inflation  
will remain subdued.  Moreover, the Committee sees some risk that inflation could persist  
for a time below rates that best foster economic growth and price stability in the longer term. 

4.  The Federal Reserve will continue to employ all available tools to promote economic 
recovery and to preserve price stability.  The Committee will monitor carefully the size and 
composition of the Federal Reserve's balance sheet in light of evolving financial market 
developments and will assess whether lending facilities should be expanded or modified to 
provide further support to credit markets and economic activity and to help preserve price 
stability.

Furthermore, global demand appears to be slowing significantly.  Conditions in some financial 
markets have improved, in part reflecting government efforts to provide liquidity and strengthen

Bank Credit, Debt, and Money Forecasts 

(54) Bank credit is expected to remain flat in 2009 amid weak loan demand  

from both businesses and households and tight credit standards and terms at banks.  

Core loans—the sum of commercial and industrial, real estate, and consumer  

loans—are forecasted to contract modestly, as continued paydowns more than  

offset new originations.  In contrast, securities holdings are expected to grow 

moderately this year, as banks continue to park deposits and other sources of funds  

in safe and liquid investments.  In 2010, with positive nominal GDP growth and 

waning effects from tighter lending standards and terms, bank credit is projected  

to expand at a rate of around 4¼ percent, led by continued expansion of securities, 

reduced runoffs of C&I loans, and a modest pickup in loans to households.     

(55) In the Greenbook outlook, the debt of the private domestic nonfinancial 

sector is projected to contract slightly in 2009; if realized, this would be the first 

annual contraction since data were first compiled in 1945.  A significant drop in home 

mortgages contributes to the reduced debt of the household sector, while nonfinancial 

business debt expands at a weak pace that reflects subdued capital expenditures.  

Private sector debt is expected to increase next year at a rate of about 1 percent, 

reflecting some improvement in credit conditions and the resumption of growth  

in nominal GDP.  Federal debt is projected to bulge—growing about 27 percent  

this year and about 15 percent in 2010, reflecting the need to finance the fiscal 

stimulus package and government programs aimed at reducing financial market 

strains.  Overall, total domestic nonfinancial debt is projected to expand 5 percent  

this year and 4½ percent in 2010.    

(56) Despite the anticipated contraction in nominal GDP over the course of  

this year, M2 is projected to expand nearly 3 percent, boosted by heightened demands 

for safety and liquidity in response to the ongoing turmoil in financial markets as well 

as the lagged effects of the previous decline in the opportunity costs of holding M2 



Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) 54 of 60

assets.  M2 growth is expected to moderate next year to a rate of about 2¼ percent, 

roughly in line with the projected growth of nominal GDP, reflecting the gradual 

recovery of financial markets and waning effects of lower opportunity costs.

Directive 

(57) Draft language for the directive is provided below. 

Directive Wording 

Alternative A:  The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and financial 

conditions that will foster price stability and promote sustainable growth in output.  

To further its long-run objectives, the Committee seeks conditions in reserve markets 

consistent with federal funds trading in a range from 0 to ¼ percent.  The Committee 

directs the Desk to purchase GSE debt and agency-guaranteed MBS during the 

intermeeting period with the aim of providing support to the mortgage and housing 

markets.  The timing and pace of these purchases should depend on conditions in the 

markets for such securities and on a broader assessment of conditions in primary 

mortgage markets and the housing sector.  The Desk is expected to purchase up to  

$100 billion in housing-related GSE debt by the end of the second quarter  

of this year.  The Desk is expected to purchase at least $500 billion in  

agency-guaranteed MBS by the end of the second quarter of this year and is expected 

to purchase up to $1 trillion of these securities by the end of this year.  The 

Committee also directs the Desk to purchase long-term Treasury securities during the 

intermeeting period.  By the end of this year, the Desk is expected  

to purchase up to $500 billion of long-term Treasury securities, with the aim  

of improving conditions in private credit markets.  The System Open Market Account 

Manager and the Secretary will keep the Committee informed of ongoing 

developments regarding the System’s balance sheet that could affect the attainment 

over time of the Committee’s objectives of maximum employment and price stability.

Measure Description 

Single-equation 
Model  

The measure of the equilibrium real rate in the single-equation model is based on an 
estimated aggregate-demand relationship between the current value of the output gap and 
its lagged values as well as the lagged values of the real federal funds rate. 

Small Structural 
Model 

The small-scale model of the economy consists of equations for six variables: the output 
gap, the equity premium, the federal budget surplus, the trend growth rate of output, the 
real bond yield, and the real federal funds rate. 

Large Model 
(FRB/US) 

Estimates of the equilibrium real rate using FRB/US—the staff’s large-scale econometric 
model of the U.S. economy—depend on a very broad array of economic factors, some of 
which take the form of projected values of the model’s exogenous variables. 

Greenbook-
consistent  

The FRB/US model is used in conjunction with an extended version of the Greenbook 
forecast to derive a Greenbook-consistent measure.  FRB/US is first add-factored so that 
its simulation matches the extended Greenbook forecast, and then a second simulation is 
run off this baseline to determine the value of the real federal funds rate that closes the 
output gap. 

TIPS-based 
Factor Model 

Yields on TIPS (Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities) reflect investors’ expectations of 
the future path of real interest rates, but also include term and liquidity premiums.  The 
TIPS-based measure of the equilibrium real rate is constructed using the seven-year-ahead 
instantaneous real forward rate derived from TIPS yields as of the Bluebook publication 
date.  This forward rate is adjusted to remove estimates of the term and liquidity 
premiums based on a three-factor arbitrage-free term-structure model applied to TIPS 
yields, nominal yields, and inflation.  Because TIPS indexation is based on the total CPI, 
this measure is also adjusted for the medium-term difference—projected at 40 basis 
points—between total CPI inflation and core PCE inflation.

Appendix A: Measures of the Equilibrium Real Rate 

The equilibrium real rate is the real federal funds rate that, if maintained, would be projected to return 
output to its potential level over time.  The short-run equilibrium rate is defined as the rate that would 
close the output gap in twelve quarters given the corresponding model’s projection of the economy.   
The medium-run concept is the value of the real federal funds rate projected to keep output at potential 
in seven years, under the assumption that monetary policy acts to bring actual and potential output into 
line in the short run and then keeps them equal thereafter.  The TIPS-based factor model measure 
provides an estimate of market expectations for the real federal funds rate seven years ahead.  

The actual real federal funds rate is constructed as the difference between the nominal rate and realized 
inflation, where the nominal rate is measured as the quarterly average of the observed federal funds rate, 
and realized inflation is given by the log difference between the core PCE price index and its lagged 
value four quarters earlier.  For the current quarter, the nominal rate is specified as the target federal 
funds rate on the Bluebook publication date.  For the current quarter and the previous quarter, the 
inflation rate is computed using the staff’s estimate of the core PCE price index. If the upcoming FOMC 
meeting falls early in the quarter, the lagged inflation measure ends in the last quarter.   

Confidence intervals reflect uncertainties about model specification, coefficients, and the level of 
potential output.  The final column of the table indicates the values published in the previous Bluebook.

Estimates of the real federal funds rate depend on the proxies for expected inflation used.  The table 
below shows estimated real federal funds rates based on lagged core PCE inflation, the definition used 
in the Equilibrium Real Federal Funds Rate chart; lagged four-quarter headline PCE inflation; and 
projected four-quarter headline PCE inflation beginning with the next quarter.  For each estimate of the 
real rate, the table also provides the Greenbook-consistent measure of the short-run equilibrium real rate 
and the average actual real federal funds rate over the next twelve quarters. 



 
  For the following rules, it denotes the federal funds rate for quarter t, while  

the explanatory variables include the staff’s projection of trailing four-quarter core PCE inflation (πt), 
inflation two and three quarters ahead (πt+2|t and πt+3|t), the output gap in the current period and one 
quarter ahead ( t  and ), and the three-quarter-ahead forecast of annual average GDP 
growth relative to potential ( 3|t t t t+ + ), and

long-run inflation objective.  The outcome-based and forecast-based rules were estimated using real-
time data over the sample 1988:1-2006:4; each specification was chosen using the Bayesian information 
criterion. Each rule incorporates a 75 basis point shift in the intercept, specified as a sequence of  
25 basis point increments during the first three quarters of 1998.  The first two simple rules were 
proposed by Taylor (1993, 1999).  The prescriptions of the first-difference rule do not depend on 
assumptions regarding r* or the level of the output gap; see Orphanides (2003).

FRB/US Model Simulations:  Prescriptions from the two empirical rules are computed using dynamic 
simulations of the FRB/US model, implemented as though the rule were followed starting at this FOMC 
meeting.  The dotted line labeled “Previous Bluebook” is based on the current specification of the policy 
rule, applied to the previous Greenbook projection.  Confidence intervals are based on stochastic 
simulations of the FRB/US model with shocks drawn from the estimated residuals over 1986-2005.  
Information from Financial Markets:  The expected funds rate path is based on forward rate 
agreements, and the confidence intervals for this path are constructed using prices of interest rate caps. 
Near-Term Prescriptions of Simple Policy Rules:  These prescriptions are calculated using Greenbook 
projections for inflation and the output gap. Because the first-difference rule involves the lagged funds 
rate, the value labeled “Previous Bluebook” for the current quarter is computed using the actual value  
of the lagged funds rate, and the one-quarter-ahead prescriptions are based on this rule’s prescription for 
the current quarter.
