Prefatory Note 

 
 

The attached document represents the most complete and accurate version 
available based on original copies culled from the files of the FOMC Secretariat at the 
Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System.  This electronic document was 
created through a comprehensive digitization process which included identifying the best-
preserved paper copies, scanning those copies,1 and then making the scanned versions 
text-searchable.2  Though a stringent quality assurance process was employed, some 
imperfections may remain. 
 

Please note that this document may contain occasional gaps in the text.  These 
gaps are the result of a redaction process that removed information obtained on a 
confidential basis.  All redacted passages are exempt from disclosure under applicable 
provisions of the Freedom of Information Act.    

 

                                                 
1 In some cases, original copies needed to be photocopied before being scanned into electronic format.  All 
scanned images were deskewed (to remove the effects of printer- and scanner-introduced tilting) and lightly 
cleaned (to remove dark spots caused by staple holes, hole punches, and other blemishes caused after initial 
printing). 
2 A two-step process was used.  An advanced optimal character recognition computer program (OCR) first 
created electronic text from the document image.  Where the OCR results were inconclusive, staff checked 
and corrected the text as necessary.   Please note that the numbers and text in charts and tables were not 
reliably recognized by the OCR process and were not checked or corrected by staff.

MONETARY POLICY ALTERNATIVES

Recent Developments

(1) After essentially no growth in January, M1 subsequently

accelerated, expanding at annual rates of 7-1/4 percent in February and an

estimated 14-1/2 percent in March. As a result, M1 grew from November to

March above its 7 percent short-run objective--leaving this aggregate

somewhat over the upper bound of its 3 to 8 percent long-run target cone.

Given the staff's first-quarter GNP forecast, M1 velocity is estimated to

have declined at around a 1-3/4 percent annual rate this quarter, compared

with its drop of 6 percent over all of 1985. Expansion in M2 also picked up

in February and March, but on balance growth was quite modest and the aggre-

gate remained below both the Committee's short-run path and long-run cone.

Growth of M3, meanwhile, remained moderate throughout the quarter, with the

aggregate essentially on the Committee's short-run path and ending the

quarter around the middle of its long-run range.

(2) The recent strength of M1 reflected mainly a sharp acceler-

ation in demand deposits following their runoff in January. OCDs so far in

1986 have grown at about the relatively substantial pace of the last few

months of 1985. Available information continues to suggest that the January

deregulation of NOW accounts has had little overall impact on M1, with

depositories to date generally not posting more liberal contract terms on

these accounts. M2 growth was held down by sluggishness in its nontrans-

actions component through most of the quarter. Inflows to retail deposits

again appear to have been depressed by household investments in bond and

stock mutual funds; in the early months of the year, bond and stock funds

continued to increase at about the elevated 50 percent annual rate that

has prevailed since the spring of last year. Within the non-M2 component

of M3, large time deposits decelerated over the past two months; while there

was a sharp pickup at thrifts, outstanding CDs at commercial banks declined

a little.

(3) The expansion in total debt of domestic nonfinancial sectors

slowed appreciably over the first quarter following its extraordinary

growth late last year. Tax-exempt borrowing was virtually nil, on net,

and federal government borrowing dropped off as the Treasury drew down

its cash balance to meet a substantial portion of the first-quarter

deficit. Although businesses borrowed unusually heavily in long-term

bond markets, much of this borrowing substituted for shorter-term sources

of credit such as bank loans and commercial paper or served to refund

existing long-term debt; on a net basis, credit market borrowing by

businesses slowed as the financing gap remained moderate and merger

activity abated. Equity issuance, spurred by soaring stock prices, also

lessened business needs for borrowed funds. Falling interest rates

stimulated mortgage activity, including refinancings, as interest rates

in this market reached the lowest level in seven and a half years.

(4) Total and nonborrowed reserves grew at about a 14 percent

annual rate on average in February and March, mirroring the strength in

transactions deposits. Throughout the intermeeting period the nonborrowed

reserves path was constructed on the assumption of $300 million of adjust-

ment plus seasonal borrowing. The allowance for excess reserves was

raised to $900 million about midway through the period in view of the

recent high levels of excess reserves; in part, this might reflect needs

for larger balances related to an expanded volume of clearings associated



-4-

with very heavy financial transactions. In the three complete maintenance

periods since the last FOMC meeting borrowing averaged $353 million.

(5) The federal funds rate remained mainly between 7-3/4 and 8

percent during the first half of the intermeeting period, but fell to around

7-3/8 percent following the reduction in the discount rate to 7 percent on

March 7. Other short-term market rates have declined about 50 to 80 basis

points since the last FOMC meeting and the prime rate was reduced from

9-1/2 to 9 percent. Long-term rates have dropped more sharply, reacting

to further weakness in oil prices, against a backdrop of mixed economic

news and declines in some aggregate price indexes. Corporate and Treasury

bond yields have dropped 100 to 150 basis points, while rates for fixed-

rate mortgages have declined around 75 basis points. Broad stock price

indexes surged over the intermeeting period, increasing about 10 percent.

(6) The trade-weighted average value of the dollar, though

firming somewhat in recent days, dropped about 2 percent further on balance

since the last FOMC, bringing its total decline since the September G-5

meeting to about 15 percent. It is now nearly 30 percent below its

February 1985 peak. During the intermeeting period the dollar reached a

postwar low against the yen, prompting

statements of concern and hints of action by Japanese

officials. These developments contributed to the recent more general

appreciation in the dollar.



Policy alternatives

(7) The table below gives three alternative specifications for

growth in the monetary aggregates from March to June, along with associated

federal funds rate ranges. More detailed data, including growth rates implied

by each alternative from the fourth-quarter base of the Committee's long-run

ranges to June, can be found on the table and charts on the following pages.

March to June

M3 7-1/4 6-1/2 5-3/4

Associated federal
funds rate range 5 to 9 5-1/2 to 6 to 10

9-1/2

(8) Under alternative B, which assumes maintenance of about

the current degree of pressure on bank reserve positions as indexed by $300

million in borrowing, M1 would be expected to grow at about a 7-1/2 percent

annual rate from March to June. This would leave it a little above the

upper end of its 3 to 8 percent longer-run range in June. M2 growth at 7

percent over the three months would lift this aggregate to around the lower

end of its long-run range. M3 would be somewhat below the midpoint of its

range.

(9) With reserve conditions unchanged under alternative B,

federal funds would be expected generally to trade in the 7-1/4 to 7-3/8

percent area. Other interest rates may change little, although some reversal

of recent declines cannot be ruled out, and on foreign exchange markets the

dollar may remain around current levels for a time. To some degree, a

further easing in monetary policy over coming months may be built into the

existing interest rate structure. Thus, should the market come to view

such an easing as unlikely, the 3-month bill rate could back up into the

6-1/2 to 6-3/4 percent area. Bond yields may come under upward pressure

as well, though they are likely to continue to be influenced importantly by

movements in oil prices. On the supply side of the bond market, offerings

are expected to remain relatively heavy. Though corporate issuance may

ease back from recent record levels reached in response to the decline in

rates so far this year, Treasury bond issuance will pick up now that the

Congressional ceiling on high coupon bonds has been lifted.

(10) M1 growth in the March to June period under this alternative

is expected to remain at about the same rate on average as over the first

three months of the year. The transactions demand for M1 is projected to

slacken, given the slowing in nominal GNP growth expected by the staff in

the second quarter and probably also a drop-off in the heavy volume of

financial transactions that accompanied the surge in stock and bond

prices of recent months. On the other hand, demands for M1 are likely to

be boosted somewhat over the next few months by the recent declines in

short-term interest rates. The accompanying flattening of the yield

curve, by working to reduce offering rates on small time deposits, would

also seem to add to demands for interest-bearing M1 balances.1 On a

quarterly average basis, M1 would be expected to expand at a 9 percent

annual rate in the second quarter under alternative B, implying a drop in

velocity at around a 4 percent annual rate, given the staff GNP forecast.

1. M1 is not expected to be affected by limits on daylight overdrafts
that went into effect on March 27. Only a small number of institutions
are constrained by the initial caps. Moreover, results of a survey of
large institutions indicate that, in adapting to the new regulation, banks
are not looking to higher demand deposits but are emphasizing other
approaches, such as restructuring federal funds transactions and adjusting
the timing of payments.



(11) M2 under alternative B would be expected to increase

considerably more rapidly from March to June than its relatively sluggish

rate of growth in the first quarter, partly as shifts to bond and stock

investment vehicles moderate as portfolio adjustments to the recent surge

in securities prices abate. 1 The continued moderate M3 growth under this

alternative presumes that bank credit growth will remain relatively sub-

dued.

(12) The debt of domestic nonfinancial sectors is likely to

grow over the second quarter at around the much reduced pace of the first

quarter, although the level of debt in June would still be somewhat above

the upper limit of the FOMC's monitoring range. Federal borrowing is

projected to be larger on a seasonally adjusted basis in the spring than

in winter, when a sharp drop in the Treasury cash balance had financed a

substantial portion of the deficit. Municipal security issuance also is

likely to pick up a bit from the early months of the year. On the other

hand, households, while apt to maintain a relatively steady pace of

fixed-rate mortgage borrowing in response to recent rate declines, are

expected to ease demands for consumer credit in light of their already

heavy debt burden. Businesses will continue to focus on longer-term

markets as sources of funds, but overall net borrowing should be kept

subdued by a continued modest financing gap and diminishing merger and

acquisition activity.

1. The final phase-out of savings deposit rate ceilings on April 1 is
not expected to have a perceptible impact on money growth, given the wide
variety of deregulated accounts already available and the likelihood that
funds shifted into newly deregulated accounts will come predominantly
from other M2 components.



(13) Alternative A encompasses some easing of reserve conditions,

with discount window borrowing dropping to minimum levels of $100 to $150

million, and the federal funds rate averaging around, or a little below,

the 7 percent discount rate. While some monetary easing may be anticipated

in the current structure of market rates, those interest rates probably

would decline further under this approach, partly on more widespread expecta-

tions of another reduction in the discount rate. Depending on the pervasive-

ness of such expectations, the 3-month Treasury bill rate may fluctuate

around a 6 to 6-1/4 percent area. Long-term rates are not likely to

decline by more than short-term rates, and probably by less, assuming no

further change in inflation expectations. The dollar would probably

again come under donward pressure, particularly if other leading central

banks did not also ease monetary conditions.

(14) M1 growth would be expected to strengthen under alternative

A to around 9 percent over March to June, noving this aggregate further

above the upper end of its long-run range, though within its parallel band.

Even more rapid growth could occur, given the very narrow spread that

could develop between rates on market instruments, MMDAs and time deposits

and those on NOW accounts--especially if institutions are reluctant to

reduce the latter in the fluid competitive environment following full

deregulation. Strong demands for money may well continue later in the

year partly in lagged response to the rate declines associated with this

alternative. Under those circumstances, and particularly if transactions-

related demands were also on the strong side, greater restraint on reserve

positions and an increase in interest rates might be needed at some point

later in the year if M1 were to be constrained within its longer-run

range for 1986.



-10-

(15) Under alternative A, the stronger growth of M2--bolstered

by inflows from market instruments mainly into MMMFs and MMDAs--would move

this aggregate up into its longer-run range by June. The acceleration

of M3 would probably be less. Bank credit growth through the second

quarter would be further restrained by softness in business loans as

corporations rely more heavily on bond financing in response to a further

drop in long-term rates.

(16) Alternative C entails a firming of reserve conditions

characterized by discount window borrowing rising to around $500 million.

The federal funds rate would probably move up to the 7-3/4 to 8 percent

area. Such a tightening is not anticipated by market participants, and

substantial upward rate movements would probably occur. The 3-month bill

rate would rise to above 7 percent. Long-term rates would also back up

considerably for a time, but upward pressures should abate as corporate

bond issuance drops off and as incoming data continue to suggest low

inflation. The foreign exchange value of the dollar would tend to firm

over the short run.

(17) M1 growth under the money market and reserve conditions

of alternative C would be expected to slow over the March to June period,

bringing this aggregate to within its long-run range by June. However,

M2 would remain noticeably below the lower end of its long-run range,

though within its parallel band. Moreover, if growth of M2 within its

longer-run range for the year is to be attained, the higher level of

rates is likely to prove unsustainable, particularly if it worked to

restrain economic expansion significantly.

Directive language

(18) Draft language for the operational paragraph, with the usual

alternatives, is shown below with suggested deletions from the current direc-

tive indicated in strike-through form and proposed additions in caps. The

proposed format follows that used at the December and February meetings in

highlighting the uncertainties surrounding the behavior of M1. With regard

to the issue of intermeeting adjustments in the degree of reserve pressure,

the draft retains the symmetrical language of the last directive. An asym-

metric approach could of course be indicated by insertion of "might" or

"would" as appropriate.

OPERATIONAL PARAGRAPH

In the implementation of policy for the immediate future, the

Committee seeks to DECREASE SOMEWHAT (Alt. A)/maintain (Alt. B)/

INCREASE SOMEWHAT (Alt. C) the existing degree of pressure on

reserve positions. This action is expected to be consistent with

growth in M2 and M3 over the period from [DEL: November to] March TO

JUNE at annual rates of about [DEL: 6] ____ percent and [DEL: 7] ____ percent,

respectively; while the behavior of M1 continues to be subject to

unusual uncertainty, growth at an annual rate of about [DEL: 7] ____ percent

over the period is anticipated. Somewhat greater reserve restraint

or somewhat lesser reserve restraint might be acceptable depending on

behavior of the aggregates, the strength of the business expansion,

developments in foreign exchange markets, progress against inflation,

and conditions in domestic and international credit markets. The

Chairman may call for Committee consultation if it appears to the



-12-

Manager for Domestic Operations that reserve conditions during the

period before the next meeting are likely to be associated with a

federal funds rate persistently outside a range of [DEL: 6 to 10] ____ TO

____ percent.
