Prefatory Note 

 
 

The attached document represents the most complete and accurate version 
available based on original copies culled from the files of the FOMC Secretariat at the 
Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System.  This electronic document was 
created through a comprehensive digitization process which included identifying the best-
preserved paper copies, scanning those copies,1 and then making the scanned versions 
text-searchable.2  Though a stringent quality assurance process was employed, some 
imperfections may remain. 
 

Please note that this document may contain occasional gaps in the text.  These 
gaps are the result of a redaction process that removed information obtained on a 
confidential basis.  All redacted passages are exempt from disclosure under applicable 
provisions of the Freedom of Information Act.    

 

                                                 
1 In some cases, original copies needed to be photocopied before being scanned into electronic format.  All 
scanned images were deskewed (to remove the effects of printer- and scanner-introduced tilting) and lightly 
cleaned (to remove dark spots caused by staple holes, hole punches, and other blemishes caused after initial 
printing). 
2 A two-step process was used.  An advanced optimal character recognition computer program (OCR) first 
created electronic text from the document image.  Where the OCR results were inconclusive, staff checked 
and corrected the text as necessary.   Please note that the numbers and text in charts and tables were not 
reliably recognized by the OCR process and were not checked or corrected by staff.

Recent developments

(1) Over the August-September period growth of M-1 is projected

to be above the upper end of the Committee's 4 to 8 percent range, while

M-2 growth is expected to be close to the upper bound of its 7 to 11 percent

FOMC range. M-1 growth slowed to a 6¾ percent annual rate in August, but

available data suggest a more rapid expansion in September. Savings

deposits at banks increased in August for the third consecutive

month, though not as rapidly as in July, and the rate of expansion

appears to be slowing further in September. Small time deposits posted

another strong gain last month; large time deposits included in

M-2 advanced at about the same pace in August as in July, after the out-

standing level had declined sharply over the second quarter. Deposit inflows

to thrift institutions are estimated to have picked up a bit in August on a

month-end basis.

1/ On August 30, the FOMC voted to raise the upper limit of the intermeeting
range for the Federal funds rate from 11¼ percent to 11½ percent.



(2) Bank credit expansion slowed to about a 10 percent annual

rate in August, as holdings of Treasury securities were reduced and growth

in total loans dropped off somewhat. Growth in business loans was down

from July but in line with that for the second quarter, while expansion

in real estate loans picked up for the third consecutive month. To help

finance their credit expansion, banks sold $2¼ billion of large time

deposits and raised about $4 billion from domestic nondeposit sources.

They also raised about $3 billion net through their foreign affiliates,

a significant part of which likely reflected recycling of U.S. resident

deposits in offshore banks.

(3) Following the August 14 FOMC meeting, the Account Manager

began aiming for a Federal funds rate of 11 percent, up from the 10-5/8 to

10 percent area, and on August 17 the discount rate was raised percentage

point to 10 percent. In the latter part of August, with projections for

the monetary aggregates suggesting that M-1 growth would be above the

upper end of its range and M-2 growth just below the upper bound of its

range, the Account Manager began to seek an 11¼ percent funds rate, the

top of the range specified by the Committee. On August 30, as projections

for the aggregates strengthened, the FOMC moved the upper end of the inter-

meeting range to 11 percent with the understanding that the Account Manager

would not raise the objective for the weekly average funds rate to the new

upper limit immediately but would be guided by the subsequent behavior of the

monetary aggregates and by developments in foreign exchange markets. The

Desk has since been aiming for a funds rate in the 11-3/8 percent area.

(4) Over the August-September period, total member bank reserves

are expected to grow at about an 8¾ percent annual rate. September will be



-3-

the third straight month in which total reserves have expanded, after having

declined over the first half of the year. The monetary base--reflecting

the rapid growth of currency--is projected to expand at about a 13 percent

annual rate over the two-month policy period. Member bank borrowing has

been fairly stable in the neighborhood of $1 1/4 billion since the August

Committee meeting.

(5) In response to the System's tightening actions, short-term

interest rates have generally advanced about 3/4 to 1 1/2 percentage points over

the intermeeting period, and long-term bond yields have moved up 25 to 45

basis points. The relatively sharp response of market interest rates

appeared to reflect anticipations of further tightening by the System

in the face of continued rapid inflation and monetary growth. Strong

credit demands by businesses contributed to pressures in short-term markets

with nonfinancial firms issuing a near record volume of commercial paper as

well as borrowing heavily at banks. Over the intermeeting period, the

Treasury sold $2 billion of cash management bills and added $200 million to

each weekly bill auction; it also offered $2.5 billion 4-year 8-month notes.

Conventional mortgage rates have also risen in recent weeks, reflecting

the continued slow growth of deposits at thrift institutions and rising

costs of funds.

(6) The dollar's weighted average exchange value has changed little

since the August FOMC meeting, with a rise against the yen and sterling

about offsetting declines against other major currencies.

Prospective developments

(8) Three alternative specifications for the monetary aggregates

and the Federal funds rate for the September-October period are shown below

for Committee consideration. The Federal funds rate specifications of

alternative B are centered on the currently prevailing 11¼ to 11½ percent

range. Money market conditions would be respectively eased or tightened

under alternatives A and C. (More detailed and longer-term data are

contained in the tables on pages 7 and 8.)

M-2 8 to 12 7½ to 11½ 7 to 11

Federal funds rate
(Intermeeting period) 10½ to 11¼ 11 to l1¾ 11½ to 12¼

(9) Under alternative B, M-1 would be expected to expand in a 5 to

9 percent annual rate range over the September-October period, down from the

10 percent average pace of the preceding five months. Growth is expected to

be slower in October than in September.and continued relatively moderate

growth is projected over the balance of the year. The expected deceleration

reflects the lagged effects of the tightening of money market conditions this

summer and the reduction in transactions demand for money associated with the

projected slowing of nominal GNP growth in the months ahead.

(10) Under alternative B, M-1 in October would be considerably

above the level implied by the upper end of the Committee's stated 1½ to 4½

percent growth range for the QIV '78 to QIV '79 period, as shown in the upper

panel of the chart on page 10. However, as is indicated in the lower

panel of the chart, when the Committee's longer-run range is adjusted to

reflect the downward revision in the staff's estimate of ATS/NOW effects on

M-1, the projected October level of M-1 under alternative B is within, though

1/
in the upper half of, its adjusted 3 to 6 percent longer-run range. The

same would be true for alternatives A and C.

(11) M-1 growth is expected to remain within its adjusted longer-run

range over the balance of the year. Expansion of M-1 in the fourth quarter is

projected to be at about a 6 percent annual rate, even assuming some slight

decline in interest rates later in the year. Growth in M-1 over the one

year QIV '78-QIV '79 period would then be about 5¼ percent, in the upper half

2/
of the adjusted range.-

(12) M-2 growth also is projected to decelerate under alternative

B, expanding at a 7 to 11 percent annual rate during the September-October

period. Most of the slowdown reflects the moderation of M-1 growth, but,

in light of the current higher level of market interest rates, the rate of

expansion of savings and small time deposits subject to fixed rate ceilings

is expected to moderate. However, commercial banks should continue to

capture a relatively large proportion of flows into 6-month MMCs. With

loan demands likely to moderate only slightly in the near term, banks

are also expected to continue to issue large time deposits and borrow from

1/ The FOMC's long-run M-1 growth range of 1½ to 4½ percent for 1979
assumed, when originally set in February, that ATS effects would reduce

M-1 growth by 3 percentage points. In July, when the range was re-

adopted, it was estimated that ATS effects for the year would be about

half as large. At present, we estimate that such ATS effects will

reduce measured M-1 growth by a little less than 1½ percentage points.

On this basis, an adjusted range of 3 to 6 percent, or even a little

higher, would be comparable with 1½ to 4¼ percent.

2/ If M-1 expanded at an 8¾ percent annual rate in the fourth quarter, the

growth in this aggregate in 1979 would be at the upper end of its

adjusted longer-run range.

abroad. S&L and MSB deposit inflows are projected to continue sluggish,

despite their likely further use of large time deposits.

(13) As shown in the upper panel of the chart on page 11, growth

in M-2 under alternative B would place that aggregate in October around the

upper end of its 5 to 8 percent longer-run range for the QIV '78 to QIV '7 9

period. And for the one-year period, staff projections indicate that M-2

will grow at a rate about equal to the upper limit. Largely reflecting

the slow deposit growth at thrifts because of the absence of the MMC inter-

institutional ceiling rate differential at current and projected rates of

interest, M-3 growth is expected to remain within its longer-run range, though

in the upper half.

(14) There may still be some expectation in the market that the

Federal funds rate will rise over the near term. Thus, if funds continue

to trade around the prevailing 11-3/8 percent--the midpoint of the alternative B

range--both short- and long-term market rates could decline. However, any

such movement is likely to be limited since aggregate credit demands are

expected to remain strong in the weeks ahead, before edging off later in

the year as economic activity weakens. Business credit demands are likely

to continue to be substantial in the very near term, mainly in short-term

markets. In addition, the amount of cash raised by the Treasury in the

market over the next month is expected to remain near recent levels, with

the sale of $1 to $2 billion of 15-year bonds and $200 million add-ons to

weekly bill auctions. In the near term, new issues of municipal bonds are

likely to continue sizable, given the large volume of mortgage revenue bonds

still in the pipeline. With the Federal funds rate unchanged and no

significant decline expected in other money market rates, adoption of



-13-

Alternative B should in itself have no substantial impact on the value of

the dollar in exchange markets.

(15) Alternative A calls for a decline in the Federal funds rate

to the midpoint of a 10 to 11 percent range, and would be associated with

ranges for M-1 and M-2 of 5 to 9 and 8 to 12 percent, respectively. In

the current environment, an easing in policy would take the market by surprise,

and the initial reaction to such a development would likely be a rather

sharp drop in both short- and long-term interest rates, particularly if

market participants were to interpret the easing as the cyclical turning

point in interest rates. In foreign exchange markets, the dollar would

very probably come under strong downward pressure. The rally in bond markets

might be constrained by a buildup of the corporate bond calendar, as firms

accelerated offerings, and by continuing investor concern about the outlook

for inflation. The anticipated decline in interest rates under alternative A

is likely to be associated with only a slight easing of mortgage markets,

especially since short-term interest rates would not be expected to decline

sufficiently to restore the differential on MMC's favoring thrift institutions.

(16) Alternative C involves an increase in the Federal funds rate

to the midpoint of an 11½ to 12¼ percent range and would tend to exert

more restraint on the monetary aggregates over the months ahead than

alternative B. While some tightening in the System's funds rate objective

may still be built into the current level of rates, a rise in the funds rate

of the dimensions contemplated by alternative C would be expected to trigger

further increasesin market rates. Such interest rate adjustments would

likely be associated with a modest strengthening of the dollar in foreign

exchange markets. Domestically, a further rise in the funds rate might



-14-

prompt thrift institutions to make vigorous efforts to reduce outstanding

mortgage commitments, which are now high relative to cash flows. Pressures

on banks would be increased not only as their cost of funds rose but also

as businesses shifted even more borrowing to short-term maturities in

anticipation that a cyclical peak in rates was being approached.

Directive language

(17) Given below are suggested operational paragraphs for the

directive in the customary form, with alternative language related to

the short-run specifications presented in the preceding section. Alternative

language is also provided for placing main emphasis either on monetary

aggregates or on money market conditions. The specifications adopted last

month are shown in strike-through form.

In the short run, the Committee seeks to achieve bank

reserve and money market conditions that are broadly consistent

with the longer-run ranges for monetary aggregates cited above,

while giving due regard to developing conditions in foreign

exchange and domestic financial markets. Early in the period

before the next regular meeting, System open market operations

are to be directed at attaining a (OR MAINTAINING THE) weekly

average Federal funds rate

(A) SLIGHTLY BELOW THE CURRENT LEVEL.
(B) AT ABOUT THE CURRENT LEVEL.
(C) slightly above the current level.

Subsequently, operations shall be directed at maintaining the

weekly average Federal funds rate within the range of [DEL: 10¾ to

11½] ____ TO ____ percent. In deciding on the specific objective

for the Federal funds rate the Manager shall be guided mainly by

the relationship between the latest estimates of annual rates of

growth in the [DEL: August-September] SEPTEMBER-OCTOBER period of M-

and M-2 and the following ranges of tolerance: [DEL: 4-to-8] ____ TO

____ percent for M-1 and [DEL: 7 to 11] ____ TO ____ percent for M-2.

1/ On August 30, the Committee voted to raise the upper limit of the range

from 11¼ percent to 11½ percent.

If rates of growth of M-1 and M-2, given approximately equal

the objective for the funds rate has already been moved to the
