Prefatory Note 
 
 
The attached document represents the most complete and accurate version available 
based on original copies culled from the files of the FOMC Secretariat at the Board 
of Governors of the Federal Reserve System.  This electronic document was created 
through a comprehensive digitization process which included identifying the best-
preserved paper copies, scanning those copies,1 and then making the scanned 
versions text-searchable.2   Though a stringent quality assurance process was 
employed, some imperfections may remain. 
 
Please note that some material may have been redacted from this document if that 
material was received on a confidential basis.  Redacted material is indicated by

1  In some cases, original copies needed to be photocopied before being scanned into electronic 
format.  All scanned images were deskewed (to remove the effects of printer- and scanner-introduced 
tilting) and lightly cleaned (to remove dark spots caused by staple holes, hole punches, and other 
blemishes caused after initial printing). 
 
2 A two-step process was used.  An advanced optical character recognition computer program (OCR) 
first created electronic text from the document image.  Where the OCR results were inconclusive, 
staff checked and corrected the text as necessary.  Please note that the numbers and text in charts and 
tables were not reliably recognized by the OCR process and were not checked or corrected by staff.

Recent developments

(1) For both M1 and M2 , current projections of February-

March growth rates are in the lower half of the Committee's operating

ranges. M1 expanded at an annual rate a little below 1 per cent in

February. Growth is expected to pick up in March and expansion for the

2 months combined is projected at about a 3 per cent rate. Growth of

M2 has been affected by a sharp deceleration of flows into savings

deposits, and for February-March it appears to be running at about a 7¼

per cent rate. At thrift institutions, there was also an appreciable

slackening of deposit inflows during February--the latest period for

which data are available. Nonborrowed reserves fell in February and

are projected to decline in March, reflecting the weakness in member

bank deposits that had developed in January and persisted through the

end of February.1/

of 6-month growth rates in nonborrowed reserves and related measures
believed consistent with longer-run growth ranges for the aggregates
in appendix I.

(2) In the weeks immediately following the February FOMC

meeting, incoming data suggested that February-March growth rates in

both M1 and M2 would be close to the midpoints of their respective ranges.

Consequently, the Desk continued to aim for a Federal funds rate in the

area of 4-5/8--4¾ per cent. When subsequent information indicated that

both aggregates were expanding at rates in the lower halves of their

ranges, the Desk shaded its funds rate objective toward 4-5/8 per cent.

(3) Short-term interest rates changed little on balance over

the inter-meeting period, but long-term rates rose 10 to 15 basis points.

The modest rise in long rates apparently reflected the effects on market

expectations of strengthening economic news. Yields in secondary mortgage

markets rose in sympathy with bond rates, but rates on primary mortgages

were virtually unchanged.

(4) With yields in long-term markets up after the turn of

the year, offerings of new corporate bonds fell substantially in February.

Partly in consequence, business demands for short-term credit expanded

rapidly. Bond offerings by State and local governments were maintained

at a very rapid pace in February, and during the inter-meeting period

the Treasury raised about $4.1 billion through new issues of 2- and 4-year

notes.

(5) The table on the following page shows (in terms of

percentage annual rates of change) related monetary and financial flows

over various time periods.

Prospective developments

(6) Short-run specifications for the monetary aggregates

and the Federal funds rate are summarized below, with more detailed

short-run and longer-run figures shown in the tables on pp. 5 and 6.

M2 7½-11½ 7-11 6½-10½

Federal funds rate 3¾-4½ 4¼-5 4¾-5½
(inter-meeting period)

(7) Assuming the Federal funds rate remains around 4-5/8 per

cent--the midpoint of the alternative B range--we expect M1 growth

in the March-April period to accelerate and be at an annual rate in a

5 to 9 per cent range. This pick-up in monetary growth is expected in

view of the strengthening in economic activity that appears to be in

process. Tax rebates are not likely to be disbursed until May, and thus

will not directly influence monetary growth rates in March and April. The

rebates will have a substantial effect on growth in money in the following

months; alternative projections of their impact on M1 and M2 over the

spring and summer will be shown in next month's blue book. At the moment

the staff is tentatively estimating that the rebates will raise the

second-quarter growth rate in M1 (relative to what it otherwise would be)

by about 2 percentage points, and lower the third-quarter rate by about

the same amount. (Such estimated impacts are included in the tables on

pages 5 and 6.)

(8) Growth in time deposits other than large CD's is expected

to continue at about the recent reduced pace. The rise in yields on

intermediate-term Treasury issues has increased the attractiveness of

market instruments relative to time deposits, especially in view of

earlier rate-cutting by some commercial banks. Growth in M2 over the

March-April period under current money market conditions is expected

to move up in a 7-11 per cent annual rate range, however, because

of the strengthening anticipated in M1 growth.

(9) Credit demands over the next few weeks are likely to

be sizable. The forward calendars suggest that new corporate bond

offerings in March will be substantially above the reduced February

pace and that municipal bond offerings will continue large. In addition,

the Treasury is expected to raise about $6 to 9 billion in new cash

between now and the mid-April tax date, although over half of these funds

will probably be raised through short-term cash management bills. Business

loan demands at banks are expected to remain moderately strong, but the

net increase in loans outstanding may be held down in the next few weeks

as proceeds of capital market financing are used to pay off earlier bank

loans associated with advance refundings.

(10) Given stability in the funds rate, the large near-term

credit demands are likely to be financed with only slight, if any,

upward pressure on other interest rates over the next few weeks. Stronger

upward rate pressures might emerge if favorable economic news and sharply

rising money supply figures turned bond market participants bearish. Over

the longer run, in any event, the staff expects that interest rates,

particularly short-term rates, would have to rise significantly further

if growth in the monetary aggregates over the QIV '76-QIV '77 period is



-8-

to be kept within the ranges adopted by the Committee. Appendix tables

II and III show longer-run projections for the Federal funds rate and

the velocity of money under each of the three alternatives.

(11) Alternatives A and C contemplate an easing and tightening

of the money market, respectively. A decline in the funds rate to the

midpoint of the 3 to 4 per cent alternative A range could be accompanied

by relatively modest reductions in other interest rates, if market

participants were to view such a decline as temporary in light of the

recent indications of strengthening economic activity. Rate declines would

be most pronounced in the very short-term area. A rise in the funds rate,

as under alternative C, could be accompanied by fairly substantial upward

adjustments in short-term rates--of about 50 basis points or so. Increases

in intermediate- and longer-term rates might be more modest, in view of

rate increases that have already occurred in that area and the current

relatively light dealer positions.

(12) The decline in the funds rate under alternative A would

probably have to be reversed shortly if the Committee is to attain growth

rates in the aggregates within its longer-run ranges. The easing of the

money market would generate more rapid growth in the aggregates over the

next few months than under alternative B, and higher interest rates would

be required later in the year to restrain growth. The tightening of the

money market under alternative C would introduce monetary restraint earlier

in the year and hence would require less of a rise in interest rates by

year-end than either alternative A or B.



Directive language

(13) Given below are alternatives for the operational

paragraphs of the directive. The first formulation, like the directive

adopted at the last meeting, places main emphasis on near-term rates

of growth in monetary aggregates; it shows--in strike-through form--the

specifications adopted at the last meeting. The second formulation

places main emphasis on money market conditions. As suggested below,

the particular language needed in the opening lines would depend on the

specific conditions sought; the three alternatives shown--calling,

respectively, for somewhat easier, prevailing, and somewhat firmer

money market conditions--are intended to be associated with the specifi-

cations discussed in the preceding section under alternatives A, B, and

C.

"Monetary Aggregates" formulation

The Committee seeks to encourage near-term rates of growth in

M1 and M2 on a path believed to be reasonably consistent with the longer-run

ranges for monetary aggregates cited in the preceding paragraph. Specifi-

cally, at present, it expects the annual growth rates over the [DEL: February-

March] MARCH-APRIL period to be within the ranges of [DEL: 3 to 7] ____ to ____

per cent for M1 and [DEL: 6½ to 10½] ____ to ____ per cent for M2. In the

judgment of the Committee such growth rates are likely to be associated

with a weekly average Federal funds rate of about [DEL: 4-5/8-to-4¾] ____ to

____ per cent. If, giving approximately equal weight to M1 and M2 , it

appears that growth rates over the 2-month period will deviate significantly



-10-

from the midpoints of the indicated ranges, the operational objective

for the Federal funds rate shall be modified in an orderly fashion

within a range of ____ to ____ per cent.

If it appears during the period before the next meeting that

the operating constraints specified above are proving to be significantly

inconsistent, the Manager is promptly to notify the Chairman who will

then decide whether the situation calls for supplementary instructions

from the Committee.

"Money Market" formulation

At this time, the Committee seeks to maintain about the prevailing

money market conditions (or to achieve somewhat easier or somewhat firmer

money market conditions) during the period immediately ahead, provided

that monetary aggregates appear to be growing at approximately the rates

currently expected, which are believed to be on a path reasonably con-

sistent with the longer-run ranges for monetary aggregates cited in the

preceding paragraph. Specifically, the Committee seeks to maintain the

weekly average Federal funds rate at about ____ per cent, so long as M1

and M 2 appear to be growing over the March-April period at annual rates

within ranges of ____ to ____ per cent and ____ to ____ per cent,

respectively. If, giving approximately equal weight to M1 and M2 , it

appears that growth rates over the 2-month period are approaching or

moving beyond the limits of the indicated ranges, the operational

objective for the weekly average Federal funds rate shall be modified in

an orderly fashion within a range of ____ to ____ per cent.



-11-

If it appears during the period before the next meeting

that the operating constraints specified above are proving to be

significantly inconsistent, the Manager is promptly to notify the

Chairman who will then decide whether the situation calls for

supplementary instructions from the Committee.

Growth in both nonborrowed and total reserves from the fourth

a 2.5 per cent annual rate, below the longer-run growth rates for reserve

aggregates shown in the table above. Over the same period, the monetary

base grew at a 7.0 per cent annual rate, near the longer-run growth rate

expected for this measure. Reserves are expected to grow more rapidly

in the second quarter. In that period, required reserves will increase

sharply because of a temporary increase in the public's holdings

of reservable deposits resulting from the proposed tax rebates and social

security payments.

NOTE: Weekly data for columns 1 to 4 are statement week averages of daily data. Columns 5 and 6 are 1-day Wednesday quotes (prior to 1976, figures shown
are for 60-89 day and 90-119 day ranges, respectively). For columns 7 through 10, the weekly date is the mid-point of the calendar week over which data are
averaged. Columns 11 and 12 are 1-day quotes for Friday and Thursday, respectively, following the end of the statement week. Column 13 is an average of
contract interest rates on commitments for conventional first mortgages with 80 per cent loan-to-value ratios made by a sample of insured savings and loan
associations on the Friday following the end of the statement week. Column 14 gives FNMA auction data for Monday preceding the end of the statement week.
Column 15 is a 1-day quote for Monday preceding the end of the statement week. The FNMA auction yield is the average yield in bi-weekly auction for short-
term forward commitments for Government underwritten mortgages. GNMA yields are average net yields to investors on mortgage-backed securities for immediate
delivery, assuming prepayment in 12 years on pools of 30-year FHA/VA mortgages carrying the coupon rate 50 basis points below the current FHA/VA ceiling.
