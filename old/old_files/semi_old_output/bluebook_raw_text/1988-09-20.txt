Prefatory Note 

 
 

The attached document represents the most complete and accurate version 
available based on original copies culled from the files of the FOMC Secretariat at the 
Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System.  This electronic document was 
created through a comprehensive digitization process which included identifying the best-
preserved paper copies, scanning those copies,1 and then making the scanned versions 
text-searchable.2  Though a stringent quality assurance process was employed, some 
imperfections may remain. 
 

Please note that this document may contain occasional gaps in the text.  These 
gaps are the result of a redaction process that removed information obtained on a

1 In some cases, original copies needed to be photocopied before being scanned into electronic format.  All 
scanned images were deskewed (to remove the effects of printer- and scanner-introduced tilting) and lightly 
cleaned (to remove dark spots caused by staple holes, hole punches, and other blemishes caused after initial 
printing). 
2 A two-step process was used.  An advanced optimal character recognition computer program (OCR) first 
created electronic text from the document image.  Where the OCR results were inconclusive, staff checked 
and corrected the text as necessary.   Please note that the numbers and text in charts and tables were not 
reliably recognized by the OCR process and were not checked or corrected by staff.

MONETARY POLICY ALTERNATIVES

Recent developments

(1) Since the August FOMC meeting, reserve paths have continued

to specify adjustment plus seasonal borrowing of $600 million. After the

1/2 percentage point increase in the discount rate announced in the week

preceding the meeting, this level of borrowing was expected to be associ-

ated with federal funds trading in a range of 8 to 8-1/4 percent. Over the

two complete maintenance periods since the discount rate hike, adjustment

plus seasonal borrowing averaged $592 million and the federal funds rate

averaged 8.13 percent. Thus far in the current period, borrowing is run-

ning at close to $590 million and the federal funds rate is averaging 8-1/8

percent. Reflecting declines in both required and excess reserves, total

reserves fell in August. However, because currency continued to grow--

albeit at a reduced pace--the monetary base increased at a 2-1/2 percent

rate.

(2) While federal funds have continued to trade near their level

at the time of the last FOMC meeting, most other market rates have declined

since then. Data suggesting a more moderate pace of economic expansion and

weaker oil prices apparently were interpreted as pointing to some reduction

in potential inflation pressures and to a lesser likelihood of a near-term

1. Seasonal borrowing has remained unusually heavy, averaging about
$430 million in the last two complete periods. The Midwest has been the
primary locus of the demands for seasonal credit, but there is little
evidence that the increased borrowing has been related to this summer's
drought. In conformance with its usual pattern, seasonal borrowing has
retreated since the end of August to $395 million so far in this main-
tenance period.

tightening of monetary policy. Bond yields have dropped as much as 3/8 of

a percentage point; rates on fixed-rate mortgages in the primary market,

though falling most recently, have lagged other rates and are down only

about half that amount on balance over the intermeeting period. The de-

cline in bond rates contributed to higher stock prices, which are up an

average of about 3 percent over the period. Most short-term rates are down

roughly 1/4 to 3/8 of a percentage point since the August meeting, with the

exception of the 3-month Treasury bill rate which has moved up slightly,

buoyed in part by an enlarged supply.

(3) The upward pressure on the dollar that had prevailed before

the August FOMC meeting continued until late in the month, when hikes in

European official lending rates arrested the dollar's climb. The dollar

moved lower along with U.S. interest rates following the employment report

for August. As the mark recovered against the dollar, it also moved to the

top of the EMS parity grid, and with tensions emerging in the EMS, German

short-term market interest rates eased back somewhat. Even so, the spread

of short-term U.S. rates over the average of foreign rates is now narrower

than it was prior to the U.S. discount rate increase. More recently, the

dollar has firmed in response to publication of favorable trade data for

July, leaving the exchange rate little changed on balance for the entire

intermeeting period.



-4-

(4) The monetary aggregates slowed further in August, and early

data suggest that this trend has continued into September. M2 was re-

strained to a 2-1/2 percent annual rate last month mainly by the earlier

rise in market interest rates, which substantially increased the oppor-

tunity costs of most monetary assets. In addition, M3 growth slowed in

August to a 4 percent pace. For July and August combined, growth of M2 and

M3 averaged just below the 3-1/2 and 5-1/2 percent rates specified by the

Committee for the June-to-September period. Since the fourth quarter of

1987, M2 has grown at 6-1/4 percent and M3 at 7 percent.

(5) The deceleration in M2 last month was concentrated in its

liquid deposit components: demand deposits, OCDs, and MMDAs all ran off,

and savings deposits slowed. (Indeed, M1 was flat in August, after expand-

ing at more than a 9 percent rate in the previous two months.) By con-

trast, small time deposits picked up, buoyed by a deposit yield curve that

has steepened since the spring. Overnight RPs rebounded from their July

decline, along with a turnaround in bank holdings of government securities.

As a result of that turnaround, bank credit growth strengthened somewhat

last month despite a sharp slowdown in business lending. Managed liabili-

ties in the non-M2 portion of M3 continued to expand rapidly in August, but

on balance instruments outside M3--such as borrowings from banks' own

foreign offices--funded the pickup in bank credit growth and also offset

some of the weakness in core deposits. Growth of both M2 and M3 may have

been damped a bit by regulators' efforts to moderate thrift deposit pricing

behavior and to restrain asset growth; both retail time deposits and large

CDs at thrift institutions have been relatively weak in recent months.



(6) The debt of domestic nonfinancial sectors appears to have

grown at a slightly faster pace in August. The pickup was most evident in

its federal component, especially in an increase of bill issuance in

advance of seasonally larger deficits and in light of uncertainty about

authority to issue long-term bonds. Business borrowing apparently remained

subdued as a rebound in commercial paper issuance and an increase in bond

offerings about offset the marked slowdown in bank loans. To a degree, the

reduced pace of business borrowing thus far in the third quarter may

reflect some slowing of equity retirements. Bank data suggest that con-

sumer borrowing may have increased in August from a relatively sluggish

pace in July. In response to the high level of rates, residential mortgage

lending seems to have moderated in July. Since the fourth quarter of 1987,

overall domestic nonfinancial debt has grown at an 8-1/2 percent rate, a

little below the midpoint of its 7 to 11 percent monitoring range.



Policy alternatives

(7) Three policy alternatives are presented below. Under alter-

native B, reserve paths would continue to be drawn with adjustment plus

seasonal borrowing of $600 million, while under alternatives A and C

reserve paths would embody borrowing levels of $400 million and $800 mil-

lion, respectively. Under alternative B, the federal funds rate would be

expected to continue to trade generally in the 8 to 8-1/4 percent area. In

the next few days, however, a tax-related surge in the Treasury balance

could push the funds rate briefly to or even above 8-1/4 percent, and

temporary pressures could resurface around quarter end. The funds rate

would fall to the 7-1/2 to 7-3/4 percent area under alternative A and rise

to the 8-1/2 to 8-3/4 percent area under alternative C.

(8) The table below presents growth rates of the monetary aggre-

gates for the August-to-December period expected under the three alterna-

tives. Under all the alternatives, money growth is expected to remain

relatively slow over coming months. This reflects, in part, continued

adjustment by money holders to previous increases in interest rates and

opportunity costs. In addition, regulators are assumed to maintain

pressures on thrifts to hold down costs and asset growth, continuing to

damp expansion of retail time deposits and large CDs. Finally, the climb

in market interest rates over the spring and summer may have an especially

pronounced effect on demand deposits as year-end approaches. If, given the

rise in rates, business demand deposits exceed the lower levels needed to

meet compensating balance requirements, businesses would reduce these

base period is used for the monetary aggregates specifications.

deposits late this year, as they did in late 1987, with effects on M2 as

well as M1. All the alternatives would leave M2 in the fourth quarter

somewhat below and M3 somewhat above the midpoints of their annual ranges

for 1988, and M1 around 4 percent above its level in the fourth quarter of

1987. The different reserve pressures under each alternative, however, do

imply divergent trajectories in the aggregates by the turn of the year.

(9) With markets now expecting no change in policy over the near

term, short-term rates likely would remain near current levels under alter-

native B; the 3-month Treasury bill rate should stay around 7-1/4 percent.

The dollar will probably trade around recent levels for a while under this

alternative especially if, as seems likely, foreign monetary policies are

also unchanged over coming weeks. In this environment, the behavior of

bond yields will depend importantly on the strength of incoming data on the

economy and prices. If such data confirm market perceptions of moderate

growth and little additional pressure on prices, these yields probably

would hold at recent lower levels. But bond yields would retrace some of

their recent declines if incoming information shows less moderation in

demands and more strength in oil prices than now seems built into market

expectations. In addition, bond yields may have been held down by a

paucity of supply, which could be reversed by congressional passage of

long-bond authorization for the Treasury or by decisions by corporations or

state and local governments to take advantage of recently reduced long-term

rates.

(10) M2 is expected to continue to grow at a 3 percent annual rate

from August to December under alternative B, with particular weakness in

liquid deposits; M1 is projected to increase at only a 1/2 percent annual

rate over this period. Although offering rates should move closer to cur-

rent levels of market interest rates, growth of M1 and M2 relative to

income will be restrained by the earlier widening of opportunity costs and

the other factors discussed above. M2 velocity would rise at a 3 percent

rate in the fourth quarter, somewhat faster than in the current quarter,

and M1 velocity at a 5-1/2 percent rate.

(11) M3 likely would continue to grow at a 5 percent rate under

alternative B, and its velocity would edge up again in the fourth quarter.

A further moderation in credit growth at thrifts, and associated funding

needs, is likely to be offset by some pickup in bank credit, as lending to

businesses and securities acquisitions rebound following weakness over July



-10-

and August. Total borrowing by businesses is expected to strengthen some-

what over the balance of the year, reflecting larger external financing

needs and substantial further share retirements, with credit demands still

focused to a large extent on the short- and intermediate-term markets.

Domestic nonfinancial debt is expected to rise at a 8-1/2 percent rate over

the last four months of the year and for the year as a whole, leaving it

somewhat below the midpoint of its 7 to 11 percent monitoring range.

(12) With markets not now expecting a near-term tightening of

policy, the rise in the federal funds rate under the firmer reserve condi-

tions of alternative C would be about matched by increases in other short-

term rates--perhaps including the prime rate. Bond yields and the dollar

also would back up; the amounts would depend on surrounding circumstances,

but could be considerable if market participants extrapolated a renewed

tightening trend for policy in the context of incoming data suggesting

continued momentum in the economy. Foreign monetary authorities might

follow suit to temper the rise in the dollar. The further rise in oppor-

tunity costs under alternative C would likely damp M2 growth to only a 2

percent rate over the August-to-December period, and its M1 component would

be expected to decline a little. By the end of the year, M2 would be

growing at only a 1 percent rate. M3 growth also would slow from its pace

of recent months, mainly reflecting further weakness in institution-only

money market mutual funds.

(13) Under alternative A, M2 and M3 would strengthen over the

August-to-December period. Partly owing to some narrowing of opportunity



-11-

costs, M2 by December would likely be growing at a rate around the 5 per-

cent midpoint of its provisional range for next year, and M3 at 7 percent.

An immediate easing would come as a surprise to market participants, given

the recent policies and statements of the Federal Reserve and current per-

ceptions that inflationary pressures, though perhaps less certain to mount,

are not likely to moderate substantially. Short-term market rates would

drop immediately by about the full extent of the easing in the funds rate,

and bond yields would also decline. The initial bond market response could

be substantial, but if data failed to confirm some further moderation in

the economy and price pressures, bond yields could retrace much of these

declines, especially if downward pressure on the dollar persisted.



-12-

Directive language

(14) Draft language for the operational paragraph, with the usual

alternatives for varying degrees of reserve pressure, is presented below.

The draft language on possible intermeeting adjustments also has the usual

options for symmetry and asymmetry and retains the ordering of the factors

to be considered in making such adjustments that was adopted at the August

meeting.

OPERATIONAL PARAGRAPH

In the implementation of policy for the immediate

future, the Committee seeks to DECREASE SOMEWHAT (Alt.

A)/maintain (Alt. B)/INCREASE SOMEWHAT (Alt. C) the

existing degree of pressure on reserve positions. Taking

account of indications of inflationary pressures, the

strength of the business expansion, the behavior of the

monetary aggregates, and developments in foreign exchange

and domestic financial markets, somewhat (SLIGHTLY)

greater reserve restraint would (MIGHT), or (SOMEWHAT)

slightly lesser reserve restraint (WOULD) might, be

acceptable in the intermeeting period. The contemplated

reserve conditions are expected to be consistent with

growth in M2 and M3 over the period from [DEL: June] AUGUST

through [DEL: September] DECEMBER at annual rates of about

[DEL: 3-1/2-and- 5-1/2] ____ AND ____ percent, respectively.

The Chairman may call for Committee consultation if it



-13-

appears to the Manager for Domestic Operations that

reserve conditions during the period before the next

meeting are likely to be associated with a federal funds

rate persistently outside a range of [DEL: 6 to 10] ____ TO ____

percent.
