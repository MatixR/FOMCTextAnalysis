format.  All scanned images were deskewed (to remove the effects of printer- and scanner-introduced 
tilting) and lightly cleaned (to remove dark spots caused by staple holes, hole punches, and other 
blemishes caused after initial printing). 
 
2 A two-step process was used.  An advanced optical character recognition computer program (OCR) 
first created electronic text from the document image.  Where the OCR results were inconclusive, 
staff checked and corrected the text as necessary.  Please note that the numbers and text in charts and

Recent developments

(1) The money supply aggregates now appear to be growing at

annual rates about 1-1/2 and 1 percentage points in excess of the

Committee's November-December ranges of tolerance, as shown in the table

below. However, during most of the interval, growth rates appeared to be

running at or only slightly above their acceptable ranges. During

November, growth in M1 was at about a 6-1/2 per cent annual rate--nearly

double the low October rate. While growth in M2 was at about the same

rate as in October, it too was at a faster pace than desired. 1/ It is

possible that the recent strength in the money supply partly reflects

Appendix 1.



technical problems of measurement and seasonal adjustments flowing from the

change in Regulation J, although our adjustments made for the effects of

this change: appear to us to be reasonably accurate. The most likely

explanation of the overshoot would seem to be that money growth is again

beginning to respond in a more nearly usual relationship to the rapid

rate of economic expansion.

(2) Intermeeting estimates of the growth in RPD's during

the November-December target period have been substantially above the

Committee's 6-10 per cent range of tolerance, with the most recent estimate

close to a 13 per cent annual rate. However, about 3 percentage points

of this overshoot reflects an increase in the reserve multiplier, as

deposit growth has been greater than anticipated at large banks subject

to high marginal reserve requirements and less than anticipated at smaller

banks (including our estimates for non-member banks). The recent regula-

tory changes have made the multiplier unusually difficult to predict.

(3) As evidence developed that the monetary aggregates were

tending to run near the top or above the Committee's ranges of tolerance,

the Desk provided RPD's more reluctantly. As a result, member bank

borrowing rose substantially over the intermeeting period, and bank

bidding for Federal funds intensified. From the 5 per cent level pre-

vailing at the time of the last Committee meeting, the average Federal

funds rate rose in successive statement weeks to 5.03, 5.17, and 5.29 per

cent. Most recently, funds have traded around 5-1/2 per cent, the upper

limit of the Committee's range of tolerance.



(4) The advance in the Federal funds rate was accompanied by

rate increases ranging generally from 10 to 30 basis points in short-term

markets and from 5 to 20 basis points in longer-term markets. The rate

on the 3-month Treasury bill reached a high of around 5.10 per cent in

the most recent auction held today--roughly 30 basis points above the

level prevailing at the time of the last meeting. The Treasury has just

announced the offering of a $2 billion, 2-year, 5-7/8 per cent note to be

auctioned December 20 and paid for December 28. In addition, it reveal-

ed plans to offer $500-$750 million of 20-30 year bonds in early

January.

(5) The table on the following page compares recent changes

in the money and credit aggregates (at seasonally adjusted annual rates)

with those for selected earlier periods.

(7) The December-January ranges of tolerance for the aggregates

range above the associated longer-run targets. Accordingly, the Committee

may wish to specify that shortfalls of some dimension should not be taken

as indicating a need to provide reserves more actively to ease money market

conditions. The 2-month ranges are high mainly because of the substantial

increase of the monetary aggregates that seems already in train for December;

the January growth rates for M1 are indicated to be closer to longer-run

targets. Also, in both December and January the $5. 4billion of revenue

sharing payments may have a transitory effect in increasing growth in M1

for any given level of interest rates.

(8) The three alternatives shown for longer-run targets include

annual rates of growth in M1 for the first half of 1973 of 7, 6, and 5 per

cent. This is the same range of targets as presented to the FOMC at its

previous meeting. At that meeting, the Committee adopted a longer-run target

path for the aggregates (for the fourth quarter of '72 and first quarter of

'73 combined) as indexed by M1 growth of 6 per cent. Recent figures, as

noted earlier, have indicated that M growth is strong relative to Committee

desires. We expect that growth in M1 for the fourth quarter of 1972 will be

about 7 per cent, give or take 1/2 of one percentage point.

(9) None of the paths presented indicates a first quarter growth

rate for M1 consistent with a 6 per cent average growth rate for the fourth

and first quarters combined. To achieve that objective the required first

quarter growth would have to be at around a 5 per cent annual rate. The

staff believes that efforts to obtain such a growth rate would lead to a



-8-

very sharp rise in the funds rate during the winter, followed by a drop in

the funds rate during the spring unless the Committee were willing to tolerate

considerably slower growth rates in the aggregates as the year progressed.

(10) Of the alternatives presented, alternative C--which encompasses

a 5 per cent M1 target for the first half of 1973--does involve a slowing of

M1 growth that eventually compensates for recent overshoots. Because of

factors affecting money demand, the slowing of M1 growth is indicated to be

most marked in the second quarter. In that period, money demand is expected

to be moderated by disappearance of the transitory upward effect on M 1 of

unusually large tax refunds in late winter and early spring. In addition,

demand for money would be reduced,with a lag, by the substantial rise of

interest rates indicated for that alternative. It is thought that attainment

of the alternative C aggregate targets would be accompanied by a rise in the

Federal funds rate to around 6 per cent over the next few weeks, with perhaps

some modest further increase developing later in the winter.

(11) Alternative B encompasses a 6 per cent M1 growth rate over

the first half of 1973, while alternative A involves a 7 per cent rate.

The 6 per cent target appears consistent with little further change in money

market conditions, but the higher target would seem to involve some easing.

In any event, money demand is likely to be weaker in the second quarter than

the first, partly because of the effect of the tax refunds noted in the

previous paragraph. In addition, under alternative B, Treasury bill and other

short-term market rates are likely to rise a bit over the first quarter, even

given prevailing money market conditions, and thereby work to retard money

demand later.



-9-

(12) Over the next few weeks, because the market has not yet

adjusted to a 5-1/2 per cent Federal funds rate, persistence of the rate

around that level could lead to a rise in the 3-month bill to around 5-1/4

per cent. However, bill purchases by the public in recent days, partly

related to revenue sharing, have improved the technical position of the bill

market and may moderate very near-term rate adjustments. A movement of

the Federal funds rate above 5-1/2 per cent--as would be contemplated under

alternative C and is possible under alternative B--would set off larger

short-term market rate adjustments. Questions about the discount rate would

become more pressing. And if the funds rate were to penetrate the 6 per cent

level, the accompanying rise in short-term market rates could bring into

question the substainability of ceiling rates on consumer-type time deposits

as net inflows of such deposits decelerated markedly.

(13) Long-term interest rates may show only little, if any,

increase under alternative B in view of the moderate size of long-term

credit demands. The more substantial rise in short rates anticipated under

alternative C, however, probably would exert considerable pressure on

longer-term markets. This would be expected on anticipatory grounds alone,

but would be reinforced as unfavorable rate relationships put savings inflows

to banks and other institutions increasingly under downward pressure.



-10-

Proposed directives

(14) Presented below are three alternative formulations for

the operational paragraph of the directive, which might be taken to

correspond to the similarly lettered policy alternatives discussed in

the preceding section. In all three alternatives a reference to

Treasury financing operations is proposed in light of the forthcoming

auction of $2 billion in notes and the announced plans for a 20-30

year bond offering in early January. Deletion of the reference to

bank regulatory changes is suggested on the grounds that banks have

adjusted to the new regulations. For alternatives B and C, a reference

to credit market developments is suggested should the Committee wish to

take account of the possible reaction to a further rise in the funds

rate while the market is still adjusting to the rise that has already

occurred.

Alternative A

To implement this policy, while taking account of TREASURY

FINANCING OPERATIONS [DEL: the effects of recent bank regulatory changes],

the Committee seeks to achieve bank reserve and money market con-

ditions that will support [DEL: more moderate] growth in monetary aggre-

gates over the months ahead [DEL: than recorded in the third quarter] AT

ABOUT THE RATES THAT APPEAR INDICATED FOR THE SECOND HALF OF THIS

YEAR.

Alternative B

To implement this policy, while taking account of TREASURY

AND POSSIBLE CREDIT MARKET DEVELOPMENTS, the Committee seeks

to achieve bank reserve and money market conditions that will

support [DEL: more] moderate growth in monetary aggregates over the

months ahead [DEL: than recorded in the third quarter].

Alternative C

To implement this policy, while taking account of TREASURY

FINANCING OPERATIONS [DEL: the effects of recent bank regulatory

changes] AND POSSIBLE CREDIT MARKET DEVELOPMENTS, the Committee

seeks to achieve bank reserve and money market conditions that

will support [DEL: more moderate] SLOWER growth in monetary aggregates

over the months ahead than [DEL: recorded in the third quarter] APPEARS
