MONETARY POLICY ALTERNATIVES 

Recent Developments 

(1) The FOMC’s decision at its January meeting to leave the federal funds rate 

target unchanged at 5¼ percent accorded with market expectations, but the 

accompanying statement was reportedly read as a sign that the Committee was more 

sanguine about inflation prospects than in December, and the expected path for 

monetary policy later this year and beyond edged lower that day.1  Policy expectations 

declined a bit more in the wake of the Chairman’s semiannual monetary policy 

testimony, which apparently reinforced investors’ beliefs that the FOMC anticipated 

contained inflation pressures as well as subdued GDP growth.  The subsequent 

release of the minutes of the January meeting elicited little reaction.  Economic data 

releases were somewhat weaker than expected on balance over the first few weeks of 

the intermeeting period and, by mid-February, policy expectations had moved 

appreciably lower (Chart 1). 

(2) Financial market volatility increased sharply in the second half of the 

intermeeting period amid an apparent pullback from risk-taking that was reportedly 

spurred by mixed news on domestic economic activity, mounting concerns about the 

subprime mortgage sector, and significant declines in foreign equity prices.  The first 

downdraft in U.S. stock prices occurred on February 27, kicked off by a sharp 

correction in the Chinese equity market.  U.S. equity markets fell sharply from recent 

highs, Treasury yields dropped, credit spreads widened, and the expected path of the 

federal funds rate rotated down (Chart 2).  Despite sharp increases in volatility on a 

                                           
1 The effective federal funds rate averaged 5.26 percent over the intermeeting period.  
During the period, the Desk purchased $1.9 billion of Treasury coupon securities in the 
market.  The volume of outstanding long-term RPs increased by $6 billion, to $21 billion, 
reflecting a temporary increase in the foreign RP pool.

range of financial assets, markets operated smoothly, apart from some capacity-related 

technical difficulties that day at Dow Jones and the NYSE.  In the Treasury market, 

bid-asked spreads remained in their recent ranges, and premiums for on-the-run two- 

and ten-year nominal Treasury securities relative to their off-the-run counterparts 

widened only modestly.  Subsequently, some positive economic data releases and 

comments by Federal Reserve officials that were viewed as reassuring prompted a 

partial recovery in some financial asset prices, but, in recent days, stock prices, yields, 

and policy expectations took another step down as news of strains in the subprime 

mortgage market accumulated and investors pondered their implications for economic 

growth.   

(3) On net over the intermeeting period, investors tilted their anticipated path 

for monetary policy down substantially.  For the upcoming FOMC meeting, however, 

federal funds futures quotes and the Desk’s survey of dealers indicate that the 

Committee is expected to remain on hold.  Most dealers expect only modest changes 

to the rationale portion of the statement.  Just a few noted a possibility that, in the risk 

assessment, the Committee would cite the emergence of downside risks to growth.  

According to options prices, the probability of at least 25 basis points of easing by 

June now stands at almost one-third.  Over the longer term, Eurodollar futures point 

to an expectation of about 100 basis points of cumulative easing by the end of 2008, 

about 50 basis points more than had been anticipated prior to the January meeting 

and markedly more than foreseen by respondents to the most recent Desk survey.  

The distribution of short-term interest rate expectations shows considerably more 

skew to the downside than at the time of the January meeting. 

(4) Two- and ten-year nominal Treasury yields fell around 35 basis points on 

balance over the intermeeting period.  Most of the decline in yields was concentrated 

in one-year forward rates ending in two to three years, consistent with market reports 

pointing to a reappraisal of the robustness of aggregate spending.  TIPS yields

generally declined somewhat less than their nominal counterparts, leaving inflation 

compensation 5 to 10 basis points lower across the term structure.   

(5) Broad stock price indexes were off about 2 percent on net.  Concern about 

deteriorating conditions in the subprime mortgage market weighed on the valuations 

of firms with significant exposures to that segment of the housing sector, and some 

subprime lenders curtailed or ceased operations (see box, “Developments in the 

Subprime Mortgage Market”).  However, the handful of large financial firms reporting 

with a February first-quarter end—some of which were perceived to have substantial 

exposure to subprime mortgages—posted solid earnings.  Yields on investment-grade 

corporate bonds fell about in line with those on Treasury securities of comparable 

maturity.  In contrast, yields on speculative-grade bonds declined only modestly, 

leaving risk spreads nearly 40 basis points wider, but still low by historical standards.  

Corporate credit quality remained strong, with default rates staying low. 

(6) The foreign exchange value of the dollar dropped 1¼ percent against a 

trade-weighted index of major foreign currencies but was little changed against an 

index of currencies of other important U.S. trading partners (Chart 3).  Market 

participants reportedly reacted to indications of somewhat softer growth in the United 

States and continued firmer expansion in key foreign countries.  Both the Bank of 

Japan and the European Central Bank raised their policy rates 25 basis points during 

the period.2  Since the January FOMC meeting, the dollar has dropped more than 

3 percent versus the yen, about 2 percent against the euro, and only slightly against the 

Canadian dollar.  Currencies linked to the funding leg of the carry trade, particularly 

the yen and the Swiss franc, appeared to be most affected by the market turbulence in 

the week of February 27, and volatilities in yen-dollar trading remained somewhat 

above the low levels that prevailed earlier in the period (see box, “Risk and Return on

ExtenExad fall Developments in the Subprime Mortgage Market
 
Despite generally benign macroeconomic conditions, delinquencies on subprime variable-rate 
mortgages—shown in the left panel below—rose sharply in 2006 as some borrowers faced large 
upward adjustments to their monthly payments and house prices stalled or, in some areas, declined.  
Subprime mortgages originated in 2006 are performing especially poorly this year, consistent with 
reports that lenders loosened underwriting standards last year amid strong competition.  Originators 
who had sold subprime mortgages to securitizers have in many cases been contractually obligated to 
buy back the loans that became delinquent shortly after origination.  Difficulties in funding these 
repurchases, as well as generally weaker mortgage demand, have led a number of monoline 
subprime lenders to file for bankruptcy in recent months and others to withdraw from the market.  
Stock prices of major subprime lenders have dropped markedly in recent weeks. 
 
Reflecting these events as well as fears that the recent trend will continue or even worsen, spreads 
on indexes of credit default swaps (CDS) written on pools of subprime mortgages have widened 
dramatically since last November.  These indexes started trading in January of last year, and a new 
index vintage is created every six months to track the performance of CDS written on subprime 
mortgages originated in the previous six months.  Thus, for example, the January 2007 vintage of 
the index references CDS on mortgages originated in the second half of 2006.  Each index is divided 
into five segments (AAA, AA, A, BBB, and BBB-) that are designed to mimic the performance of 
corresponding tranches of subprime residential mortgage-backed securities (RMBS).  As shown in 
the panel at the right, index spreads for CDS on mortgages originated in 2006—the July 2006 and 
the January 2007 vintages—have widened much more than index spreads for CDS on mortgages 
originated in the second half of 2005—the January 2006 vintage.  Bid-asked spreads on these index 
products have reportedly jumped in recent weeks, as demand has been predominantly on the 
protection-buying side.   
 
Issuance of subprime RMBS continued to slow in the first two months of 2007, and spreads on 
newly issued BBB- tranches have risen this year from about 300 to about 700 basis points.  Buyers 
of subprime RMBS have increased their scrutiny of the underlying loans, and investment banks are 
finding it more difficult to securitize some of the riskiest mortgages.  In early March, bank 
supervisors issued for comment expanded guidance to address safety and soundness and consumer 
protection issues that stem from some types of subprime mortgage lending.  In response to this 
pressure from buyers and regulators alike, originators are reportedly tightening their standards for 
subprime loans.

ExtenExad fall Risk and Return on Japanese Yen Carry Trades 
 
Even before the recent period of heightened financial market volatility, the business press and Wall 
Street commentators had focused considerable attention on “carry trades” as a source of potential 
risk in global financial markets.  In the generic example of such a trade, funds borrowed in a low-
interest-rate currency, such as the Japanese yen or the Swiss franc, are invested in a high-interest-rate 
currency, such as the Australian, New Zealand, or U.S. dollars, or various emerging market 
currencies.  Note that a carry trade exposes the investor to exchange rate fluctuations and is 
therefore not a riskless arbitrage. 
 
Indeed, some market participants who had engaged in yen-funded carry trades the week of 
February 27 sustained substantial losses.  That week’s return from one popular trade—borrowing 
Japanese yen at one-week LIBOR denominated in yen and lending Australian dollars at the 
corresponding one-week rate for Australian dollars—was about -4.5 percent, the ninth worst weekly 
return over a sample beginning in mid-December 1997.  Borrowing yen and lending other 
currencies against which the yen appreciated more sharply would have produced even less favorable 
results, and to compound some investors’ difficulties, global stock indexes and the prices of many 
other risky assets tumbled that week.   
 
Nonetheless, analyses of historical returns over a longer term suggest that, on average at least, the 
strategy generally appears to have favorable risk, return, and covariance characteristics.  The 
distribution of returns on a very simple application of the strategy—the yen/Australian dollar 
example discussed previously—has been fairly symmetric rather than particularly negatively skewed, 
as shown to the lower left.  Over this sample, the average carry-trade return is roughly equal to the 
mean interest rate differential, and the Sharpe ratio of the strategy (the mean return divided by the 
standard deviation) compares favorably with other broad asset classes.  In addition, although the 
week of February 27 was an exception, carry-trade returns have had a very low correlation with 
most other asset returns, which suggests that the strategy might actually enhance portfolio 
diversification.  Indeed, investors likely conduct carry trades within a broader set of strategies.

Japanese Yen Carry Trades”).  The Australian dollar, the New Zealand dollar, and 

some emerging-market currencies, which have been prominent lately in the 

investment leg of the carry trade, registered sharp downdrafts during the recent spate 

of volatility.   

(7) The announcement in late February by Chinese authorities of steps to 

curtail illegal stock trading and subsequent rumors of additional measures to control 

speculation provoked a sharp decline in Chinese equity prices in the week of February 

27.  Stock prices in many other foreign markets also dropped abruptly.  Although 

global stock prices steadied briefly thereafter, they have declined further on balance in 

recent days, and most headline stock price indexes are down 1 to 5 percent over the 

intermeeting period.  The global shift away from risky assets likely also contributed to 

the widening of spreads on emerging-market bonds and to declines of about 10 to 

20 basis points in yields on long-term government bonds in industrial countries. 

(8) Borrowing by businesses, households, and state and local governments 

appears to be slowing somewhat in the current quarter (Chart 4).  Nonfinancial 

corporate debt, which expanded at an 11 percent annual rate in the fourth quarter of 

2006, is projected to moderate to an 8 percent pace this quarter as merger and 

acquisition financing steps down.  Business debt growth slowed in January, but picked 

back up in February; on average, business borrowing remained solid by historical 

standards.  Despite the recent turmoil in financial markets, funding in the corporate 

bond and syndicated loan markets appears to have remained ample.  In the household 

sector, mortgage debt growth dropped to a 6½ percent rate in the fourth quarter and 

is expected to edge down a bit further to a 6 percent pace in the first quarter, with the 

slowing in large part associated with the cooling in home price appreciation.  

Consumer credit growth in the first quarter is projected to remain at a moderate rate 

of 4¾ percent, the same as its average in 2006.  In contrast to the slower expansion of 

debt in the private sector, federal debt is estimated to be accelerating, putting total

debt of the domestic nonfinancial sectors on track for a 7¾ percent annual growth 

pace this quarter, about the same as last quarter. 

(9) M2 growth slowed in February after four months of very strong advances.  

The growth of liquid deposits, by far the largest portion of M2, moderated to 

4 percent from its outsized fourth-quarter pace.  Retail money funds and small time 

deposits also had been expanding rapidly through the end of last year, but have 

decelerated as their rates of return became relatively less attractive.  The currency 

component of M2 was essentially flat over the past two months.  Domestic demand 

for currency has likely expanded at a modest pace, while international demand for 

U.S. currency has continued to fall off in light of improving economic and political 

stability abroad as well as an apparent expansion of the use of euro banknotes as a 

store of value.  Taken as a whole, the level of M2 remains significantly higher than 

would be indicated by the long-run relationship between velocity and the opportunity 

cost of M2.

Economic Outlook through 2008 

(10) The staff has read weaker-than-expected incoming data, higher spot and 

futures prices for oil, lower equity prices, and increasing strains in the subprime 

mortgage sector as reasons to mark down its projection for real growth.  Real GDP is 

projected to grow at a 1½ percent rate during the current quarter; the sluggish growth 

primarily reflects the ongoing adjustment in the housing sector and a partial reversal 

of last quarter’s large improvement in net exports.  The staff expects that real GDP 

growth will pick up to 2¼ percent during the remainder of the forecast period as the 

housing adjustment moves toward completion.  This pace of expansion would be 

somewhat below the staff’s estimate of potential growth, which averages a bit above 

2½ percent, so the unemployment rate is projected to climb above 5 percent by the 

end of 2008.  The increase in energy prices since January led the staff to revise up its 

forecast for headline PCE inflation during the first half of this year.  As in January, 

however, the staff sees core PCE inflation edging down from just under 2¼ percent 

in 2007 to 2 percent during 2008.  Against this backdrop, the forecast assumes that 

the Committee will cut the target federal funds rate to 5 percent in the middle of 

2008, whereas no such easing was assumed in January.  The Greenbook forecast is 

again predicated on broad U.S. equity price indexes rising at a rate of 6½ percent, 

albeit from a somewhat lower level than at the time of the January FOMC meeting.  

Long-term Treasury yields are assumed to rise about 25 basis points as market 

participants gradually conclude that policy will not be eased as quickly as they 

currently expect.  The dollar is projected to depreciate very slightly against foreign 

currencies.  The path of oil prices has been raised about $5 per barrel relative to the 

previous Greenbook.   

Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) Page 12 of 41



 

Medium-Term Strategies 

(11) To shed additional light on the economic outlook and possible monetary 

policy strategies at a longer horizon, the FRB/US model was used to construct  

an illustrative extension of the Greenbook forecast beyond 2008, based on a set of 

medium-term assumptions together with some judgmental adjustments.  Important 

influences on the outlook include the assumptions of trend multifactor productivity 

growth at about 1¾ percent per year, approximately flat energy prices, and a pickup  

in the pace of depreciation of the real foreign exchange value of the dollar to an 

average rate of 3 percent per year.  Given the impetus to inflation from dollar 

depreciation, the unemployment rate would need to be a bit above the staff’s assumed 

long-run NAIRU of 5 percent to keep core PCE inflation stable at around 

2 percent—the inflation rate consistent, in the staff’s estimation, with recent survey 

measures of long-run inflation expectations.  The contours of aggregate demand are 

influenced by the unified federal budget deficit, which rises from 1¾ percent of GDP 

next year to about 2½ percent by 2012, and by the current account deficit, which 

widens slightly to nearly 7 percent of GDP in 2012 despite depreciation of the dollar 

and steady growth abroad.  Further assuming that term, credit, and equity risk 

premiums gradually revert to historical norms, the real federal funds rate would need 

to move below 2 percent by 2012 to keep output expanding along the path of its 

potential. 

(12) As shown in Chart 5, the current level of the real funds rate, 3 percent, is  

a touch higher than the Greenbook-consistent estimate of short-run r*—the value  

of the real federal funds rate that would put the level of real GDP at its potential 

twelve quarters ahead—and about 50 basis points higher than the three model-based

of residential expenditures due to the recent rise in energy prices, the decline  

in stock market wealth, and problems in the subprime mortgage sector.  The model-

based estimates of medium-run r*—the value of the real funds rate consistent with 

keeping output at potential at a seven-year horizon—are both close to 2¼ percent, 

just above the TIPS-based measure of about 2 percent.   

(13) Outcomes obtained from optimal control simulations of the FRB/US 

model, shown in Chart 6, are importantly influenced by the somewhat weaker outlook 

for aggregate demand and slightly greater inflation pressures anticipated through the 

end of the decade.  In these simulations, policymakers are assumed to place equal 

weight on three stabilization objectives:  keeping core PCE inflation close to a 

specified goal of either 1½ or 2 percent, keeping unemployment close to the long-run 

NAIRU, and avoiding changes in the nominal funds rate.3  With policy aiming at  

an inflation goal of 2 percent (the right-hand set of charts), the optimal path of the 

federal funds rate over the next few years is about ¼ percentage point lower than  

in the January Bluebook—reflecting the softer near-term outlook for aggregate 

demand—but levels off at the same plateau of about 4 percent.  Given the slight 

increase in inflation pressures, the optimal policy does not completely offset the 

decline in aggregate demand; as a result, the unemployment rate and core inflation 

over the next few years are both a touch higher than in January.  Similarly, with  

an inflation goal of 1½ percent (the left-hand set of charts), the optimal funds rate 

follows a trajectory over the next several years that is roughly ¼ percentage point 

lower than in the previous Bluebook.  In this case, the unemployment rate peaks at 

about 5½ percent early in the next decade while core inflation declines very slowly  

to about 1.8 percent by 2012.  The pace of this disinflation primarily reflects the slow 

adjustment of wage and price setters’ long-run inflation expectations, which in turn 
                                           
3 It is also assumed that policymakers and participants in financial markets understand fully 
the forces shaping the economic outlook whereas the expectations of households and firms 
are formed using more limited information.

owes to the gradual evolution of their perceptions of policymakers’ inflation goal  

(see box on “Inflation Expectations and Optimal Control Policies”).   

(14) The upper panels of Chart 7 depict model- and market-based assessments 

of the policy outlook through the end of 2012.  In the absence of shocks, the 

outcome-based rule prescribes a funds rate path that declines gradually—though 

slightly faster than in the January Bluebook—to about 4 percent by the end of 2012.  

Stochastic simulations of the FRB/US model indicate a 70 percent probability that  

the prescriptions of the outcome-based rule will fall in a range of 2½ to 6¼ percent 

during 2012.  Information from at-the-money interest rate caps also indicates 

considerable uncertainty in financial markets regarding the prospective path of  

policy at longer horizons.   

(15) The lower portion of Chart 7 reports near-term prescriptions of simple 

policy rules embedding an inflation goal of either 1½ or 2 percent.  The rule proposed 

by Taylor (1999) calls for a funds rate of about 4½ to 5 percent for the current 

quarter, whereas a funds rate of about 5½ percent is stipulated by a variant of that 

rule incorporating a higher value of r*.  In each of these cases, the rule is consistent 

with a downward-sloping path of the federal funds rate going forward, with a cut  

next quarter of about 25 basis points.  In contrast to the Taylor rules, the first-

difference rule—which does not require estimates of the levels of the output gap  

or the equilibrium real interest rate—prescribes setting the nominal federal funds  

rate at about 5½ percent if the inflation goal is 1½ percent or at about 5 percent if  

the inflation goal is 2 percent.

Inflation Expectations and Optimal Control Policies1

For an inflation goal of 1½ percent, the optimal control policy  
shown in Chart 6 is associated with glacial convergence of actual 
inflation toward the goal.  This feature does not primarily reflect  
the specification of short-run wage and price dynamics in the 
FRB/US model, but rather the slow adjustment of the long-run 
inflation expectations of wage and price setters.  Those agents’ 
expectations—which are determined by their understanding of the 
inflation goal specified by policymakers—decline from a current  
level of around 2 percent toward the true goal at a pace calibrated  
to approximate the empirical behavior of survey measures of  
long-run inflation expectations.  To highlight the role of this  
aspect of inflation expectations in shaping optimal policy, this  
box compares the benchmark specification with two alternative 
assumptions regarding the evolution of public perceptions of 
policymakers’ inflation goal. 
 
In the benchmark specification of the FRB/US model (the solid line  
in each panel to the right), it is assumed that wage and price setters 
gradually update their beliefs about the inflation goal in response to 
actual inflation outcomes.  As a result, policymakers need to tighten 
policy substantially in order to elevate the unemployment rate and 
generate sufficient downward pressure on actual inflation.  In this 
scenario, long-run inflation expectations (not shown) decline by 
only about ¼ percentage point through 2012.  
 
In contrast, in the case of immediate recognition, wage and price setters 
are assumed to perceive the 1½ percent inflation goal starting in  
the current quarter (dashed red lines).  In this scenario, core inflation 
declines rapidly and approaches the goal by the end of 2008, while  
the unemployment rate remains close to its natural rate over the  
next few years.2  
 
In the final scenario—learning from policy actions—wage and price  
setters infer the inflation goal from surprises in policymakers’ 
setting of the federal funds rate (dotted blue lines).  In this case, 
policymakers signal their commitment to a disinflation through  
a substantial initial increase in the funds rate, which pushes the 
unemployment rate about ¼ percentage point above its natural rate  
later this decade.  As a result, long-run inflation expectations  
decline more rapidly than in the benchmark specification, and  
core inflation converges to the 1½ percent goal by 2012.  ______________________________ 
1 This box draws on the analysis provided in the memo to the  
Committee by David Reifschneider and Robert Tetlow, “FRB/US Inflation 
Dynamics, Policy Credibility, and Bluebook Optimal Control Simulations,” 
March 8, 2007. 
2 In principle, the speed of disinflation could be influenced by the baseline 
assumption that agents do not form model-consistent expectations but 
instead generate forecasts based on a small-scale VAR. However, the memo 
reports roughly identical simulation paths under these two alternative 
approaches, conditional on the same credibility of monetary policy.

Monetary Policy Alternatives 

(16) This Bluebook presents three policy alternatives, summarized in Table 1, as 

a starting point for the Committee’s deliberations.  Under Alternative A, the 

Committee would lower the intended federal funds rate 25 basis points, to 5 percent.  

Alternative B would leave the target for the federal funds rate unchanged.  Under 

Alternative C, the Committee would tighten policy 25 basis points, bringing the target 

to 5½ percent.  The statement associated with Alternative A mentions factors that 

suggest upside risks to inflation and retains the phrase “some inflation risks remain;” 

it also mentions factors that suggest downside risks to growth and offers an explicit 

assessment that the risks to growth are tilted to the downside.  In addition, Alternative 

A replaces the phrase “the extent and timing of any additional firming” with the more 

general “future policy adjustments.”  Alternative B, too, notes factors that suggest 

downside risks to growth as well as factors that suggest upside risks to inflation, but 

states explicitly that the risk that inflation will fail to moderate remains the 

Committee’s principal concern.  Alternative B also adopts more symmetric language 

regarding future policy adjustments.  Language for Alternative C not only states that 

the risk that inflation will fail to moderate remains the Committee’s predominant 

concern, it does not mention downside risks to growth and retains directional 

language referring to “the extent and timing of any additional firming.”  With the 

report on consumer prices in February to be released on Friday, after the Bluebook 

closes, the rationale portion of Alternative B includes language in brackets that may be 

appropriate if inflation is disappointingly high. 

(17) In the staff’s analysis, the real federal funds rate is essentially equal to the 

Greenbook-consistent estimate of its equilibrium value (Chart 5), suggesting that the 

current stance of policy likely would be consistent with closing the small estimated 

output gap over the next several years.  Moreover, the current target for the funds rate 

is very close to prescriptions for near-term policy from the optimal policy path

Core inflation remains somewhat

likely to moderate over time, but 
considerable uncertainty surrounds 
that judgment.  Moreover, the high 
level of resource utilization has the 
potential to sustain inflation pressures.  

Assessment of 
Risk 

4.  The Committee judges that some 
inflation risks remain.  The extent and 
timing of any additional firming that 
may be needed to address these risks 
will depend on the evolution of the 
outlook for both inflation and 
economic growth, as implied by 
incoming information. 

The Committee judges that the risks to 
growth are tilted to the downside, even 
after this policy action.  However, 
upside risks to inflation remain. Future 
policy adjustments will depend on the 
evolution of the outlook for both 
inflation and economic growth, as 
implied by incoming information. 

In these circumstances, the Committee’s 
principal policy concern remains the 
risk that inflation will fail to moderate as 
expected.  Future policy adjustments 
will depend on the evolution of the 
outlook for both inflation and 
economic growth, as implied by 
incoming information. 

In these circumstances, the

of the outlook for both inflation and 
economic growth, as implied by

simulations of the FRB/US model for a 2 percent inflation goal (Chart 6).  If the 

Committee sees the combination of gradual convergence to potential output and a 

2 percent inflation rate by the end of 2008 as a reasonable and desirable outcome, 

given current conditions, it might favor no change in policy, as in Alternative B.  In 

that regard, the central tendency of the forecasts submitted by the Governors and 

Reserve Bank presidents around the time of the January FOMC meeting suggested 

that the Committee was more optimistic than the staff about potential output, 

perhaps implying that keeping the funds rate constant is likely to generate both brisker 

growth and a larger decline in core inflation than the staff projects.  Although 

members may think that dislocations in the subprime mortgage market will reduce 

funding for home purchases in that sector, tending to deepen the slide in housing 

construction, they may also be of the view that the drop in market yields in recent 

weeks will mean lower mortgage rates for prime borrowers going forward, perhaps 

spurring an earlier recovery in construction and sales of new homes.  Given these 

potentially offsetting forces, the Committee may be inclined to wait for more 

information on consumer spending and housing demand before adjusting the stance 

of policy.   

(18) The language associated with Alternative B could point to gains in personal 

income and consumer spending as helping to sustain output in the face of weakness 

in housing and business investment.  If the Committee’s view on inflation has not 

changed appreciably of late, it could choose to repeat the backward-looking language 

that “readings on core inflation have improved modestly in recent months” along 

with the forward-looking language that “inflation pressures seem likely to moderate 

over time” and the qualification that high resource utilization could sustain inflation 

pressures.   The assessment of risk language for Alternative B contains no explicit 

judgment about the balance of risks.  However, by stating that the risk that inflation 

will fail to moderate as expected remains its principal policy concern, the Committee 

Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) Page 22 of 41



 

would implicitly acknowledge risks to growth.  The proposed wording in Alternative 

B replaces the reference to “additional firming” that was in the January statement with 

a balanced characterization of “future policy adjustments,” thereby removing the 

presumption that the next change in policy will be a tightening and providing greater 

policy flexibility going forward.  

(19) Although economic and financial news during the intermeeting period 

increased the perceived probability of a cut in the funds rate later this year, market 

participants continue to see no chance of easing at this meeting.  Market commentary 

and surveys also suggest that participants would not be surprised if the statement were 

to recognize downside risks to growth, but they see a lesser chance of a change in the 

“tilt” in the assessment of risks.  Thus, pointing to a “principal concern” might be 

read as a more forceful assertion than the wording in January’s statement.  Dropping 

the reference to “additional firming” from the risk assessment should convey more 

balanced odds on the direction of future policy changes and thus weigh against that 

reading.  On balance, the language for Alternative B seems likely to elicit little 

reaction, but with markets apparently skittish, this judgment should be viewed as 

more tentative than usual.  

(20) In contrast to the fairly benign scenario described in the staff forecast, the 

Committee might be concerned that widening disruptions in the subprime market 

point to greater weakness in housing and that lower equity prices will slow the growth 

of consumer spending.  The Committee also might see recent economic data as 

indicating that weakness has spread from housing and motor vehicles to other goods-

producing sectors, perhaps along the lines of the “weak investment” alternative in the 

Greenbook.  If so, members might prefer the quarter-point policy easing in 

Alternative A.  This alternative offers an explicit judgment that risks to growth would 

remain tilted to the downside even after this policy action, thereby conveying greater 

concern about those risks than Alternative B.  At the same time, it would continue to 

Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) Page 23 of 41



 

point to upside risks to inflation.  Members who consider 2 percent inflation an 

appropriate goal might note that most of the policy rules shown in Chart 7 point to a 

reduction in the target funds rate in the second quarter.          

(21) The rationale for Alternative A points to sluggish business investment and 

ongoing weakness in housing as likely to exert a drag on growth, thus supporting a 

judgment that risks to growth remain tilted to the downside even after a quarter- 

point rate cut.  By also pointing to remaining inflation risks and adopting a symmetric 

characterization of possible future adjustments in the policy rate, the assessment of 

risk in Alternative A is meant to convey that this policy action will not necessarily 

commence a sequence of rate cuts.   

(22) Although investors apparently expect the Committee to begin easing by 

mid-year, the immediate quarter-point rate cut envisioned in Alternative A would be a 

considerable surprise and likely would lead to a significant easing of financial 

conditions.  Long-term yields might follow short-term rates down if markets conclude 

that the Committee believes that prospects for growth have weakened appreciably, 

reducing the equilibrium real interest rate consistent with sustainable growth.  The 

drop in longer-term yields could be small if markets conclude that the Committee is 

easing sooner than expected but will not cut rates more over the next few years than 

is already incorporated in financial quotes.  But markets might read an announcement 

along the lines of Alternative A as an indication that the Committee is willing to 

forego a medium-term moderation in inflation in order to sustain economic growth.  

In that case, measures of inflation compensation might rise.  

(23) Though much of the market commentary during the intermeeting period 

focused on developments pointing to weaker-than-expected growth, the Committee 

might see the recent data releases as only a bit weaker than expected and judge that 

the fallout from developments in the subprime mortgage sector will be limited, 

perhaps for the reasons given in Part I of the Greenbook.  If so, the Committee might 

Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) Page 24 of 41



 

place greater weight on the step-up in core inflation in January and the recent 

depreciation of the dollar.  Especially if Friday’s inflation report proves markedly 

higher than expected, the Committee may be less confident than the staff that core 

inflation will decline from its uncomfortably high level with no further increase in the 

federal funds rate, inclining members toward the quarter-point policy firming of 

Alternative C.  A judgment that tighter policy is appropriate might be buttressed by 

concerns about the extent to which the labor market currently is stretched thin and 

the slow pace at which those pressures lessen in the staff forecast. 

(24) The rationale for Alternative C could indicate the Committee’s 

fundamentally unchanged outlook for growth by stating that the economy “appears to 

be expanding at a moderate pace and likely will continue to do so in coming quarters, 

supported by solid growth in consumer spending” without mentioning areas of 

weakness.  The rationale could emphasize the Committee’s discomfort with inflation 

by stating not only that “core inflation remains somewhat elevated,” but also that 

“considerable uncertainty surrounds” the judgment that inflation will moderate and 

that “the high level of resource utilization has the potential to sustain inflation 

pressures.”  If the Committee wished to make clear that the 25 basis point increase in 

the funds rate did not entirely assuage its concern about inflation risks, the Committee 

could replace the first sentence of January’s assessment of risk with language stating 

that “the Committee’s predominant policy concern remains the risk that inflation will 

fail to moderate as expected” while retaining the second sentence.   

(25) A decision to adopt Alternative C would come as a complete surprise to the 

financial markets, likely leading to a sharp upward revision of investors’ expectations 

for the federal funds rate over the next few quarters and thus an increase in short-

term interest rates.  Longer-term rates might also jump if market participants were to 

conclude that the inflation outlook is less benign than they had thought and that 

short-term real rates will have to be persistently higher to keep inflation contained.  

Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) Page 25 of 41



 

Upward pressure on long-term rates would be lessened if investors conclude that the 

FOMC’s focus on reducing inflation will mean faster progress toward price stability.   

Money and Debt Forecasts 

(26) Under the Greenbook baseline, M2 is expected to grow about 5¼ percent 

in 2007 and 5 percent in 2008, a touch slower on average than in the January forecast, 

consistent with the modest downward revision in nominal GDP growth in the staff 

forecast.  The opportunity cost of holding M2 edges down this year as deposit rates 

continue to catch up to earlier increases in short-term interest rates.  As a result, M2 is 

projected to grow a bit faster than nominal income.  In the forecast, liquid deposits 

expand moderately and rapid growth in retail money funds offsets more sluggish 

growth in small time deposits.  Currency growth, however, continues to be restrained 

by weak foreign demand.   

(27) The growth of domestic nonfinancial sector debt is projected to fall from 

nearly 8 percent last year to 6½ percent in 2007 and 6 percent in 2008.  In the 

household sector, nearly flat housing prices likely will dampen mortgage borrowing 

over the forecast horizon.  Corporate debt is also projected to slow somewhat, as the 

recent strong pace of merger-related debt issuance ebbs.  With the unified budget

Directive and Balance of  Risks Statement 

(28) Draft language for the directive and draft risk assessments identical to those 

presented in Table 1 are provided below. 

Directive Wording 
The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and financial 

conditions that will foster price stability and promote sustainable growth 

in output.  To further its long-run objectives, the Committee in the 

immediate future seeks conditions in reserve markets consistent with 

maintaining/INCREASING/REDUCING the federal funds rate at/TO 

an average of around _______________ 5¼ percent. 

Risk Assessments  

A. The Committee judges that the risks to growth are tilted to the 

downside, even after this policy action.  However, upside risks to 

inflation remain.  Future policy adjustments will depend on the evolution 

of the outlook for both inflation and economic growth, as implied by 

incoming information.  

B. In these circumstances, the Committee’s principal policy concern 

remains the risk that inflation will fail to moderate as expected.  Future 

policy adjustments will depend on the evolution of the outlook for both 

inflation and economic growth, as implied by incoming information.  

C. In these circumstances, the Committee’s predominant policy concern 

remains the risk that inflation will fail to moderate as expected.  The 

extent and timing of any additional firming that may be needed to 

address this risk will depend on the evolution of the outlook for both 

inflation and economic growth, as implied by incoming information.

Appendix A: Measures of the Equilibrium Real Rate 
 

The equilibrium real rate is the real federal funds rate that, if maintained, would be projected to return 
output to its potential level over time.  The short-run equilibrium rate is defined as the rate that would 
close the output gap in twelve quarters given the corresponding model’s projection of the economy.   
The medium-run concept is the value of the real federal funds rate projected to keep output at potential 
in seven years, under the assumption that monetary policy acts to bring actual and potential output into 
line in the short run and then keeps them equal thereafter.  The TIPS-based factor model measure 
provides an estimate of market expectations for the real federal funds rate seven years ahead.  
 
The actual real federal funds rate is constructed as the difference between the nominal rate and realized 
inflation, where the nominal rate is measured as the quarterly average of the observed federal funds rate, 
and realized inflation is given by the log difference between the staff’s estimate of the core PCE price 
index and its lagged value four quarters earlier.  For the current quarter, the nominal rate is specified as 
the target federal funds rate on the Bluebook publication date.  
 
Confidence intervals reflect uncertainties about model specification, coefficients, and the level of 
potential output.  The final column of the table indicates the values for the current quarter based on  
the estimation for the previous Bluebook, except that the TIPS-based measure and the actual real funds 
rate are the values published in the previous Bluebook. 
  

Measure Description 

Single-equation 
Model  

The measure of the equilibrium real rate in the single-equation model is based on an 
estimated aggregate-demand relationship between the current value of the output gap and 
its lagged values as well as the lagged values of the real federal funds rate. 

Small Structural 
Model 

The small-scale model of the economy consists of equations for five variables: the output 
gap, the equity premium, the federal budget surplus, the trend growth rate of output, and 
the real bond yield. 

Large Model 
(FRB/US) 

Estimates of the equilibrium real rate using FRB/US—the staff’s large-scale econometric 
model of the U.S. economy—depend on a very broad array of economic factors, some of 
which take the form of projected values of the model’s exogenous variables. 

Greenbook-
consistent  

The FRB/US model is used in conjunction with an extended version of the Greenbook 
forecast to derive a Greenbook-consistent measure.  FRB/US is first add-factored so that 
its simulation matches the extended Greenbook forecast, and then a second simulation is 
run off this baseline to determine the value of the real federal funds rate that closes the 
output gap. 

TIPS-based 
Factor Model 

Yields on TIPS (Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities) reflect investors’ expectations of 
the future path of real interest rates, but also include term and liquidity premiums.  The 
TIPS-based measure of the equilibrium real rate is constructed using the seven-year-ahead 
instantaneous real forward rate derived from TIPS yields as of the Bluebook publication 
date.  This forward rate is adjusted to remove estimates of the term and liquidity 
premiums based on a three-factor arbitrage-free term-structure model applied to TIPS 
yields, nominal yields, and inflation.  Because TIPS indexation is based on the total CPI, 
this measure is also adjusted for the medium-term difference—projected at 40 basis 
points—between total CPI inflation and core PCE inflation.

Appendix B: Analysis of Policy Paths and Confidence Intervals 
 

Rule Specifications:  For the following rules, it denotes the federal funds rate for quarter t, while  
the explanatory variables include the staff’s projection of trailing four-quarter core PCE inflation (πt), 
inflation two and three quarters ahead (πt+2|t and πt+3|t), the output gap in the current period and one 
quarter ahead ( *t ty y−  and *1| 1|t t t ty y+ +− ), and the three-quarter-ahead forecast of annual average GDP 
growth relative to potential ( 4 4 *3| 3|t t t ty y+ +Δ − Δ ), and *π  denotes an assumed value of policymakers’ 
long-run inflation objective.  The outcome-based and forecast-based rules were estimated using real-
time data over the sample 1988:1-2006:4; each specification was chosen using the Bayesian information 
criterion. Each rule incorporates a 75 basis point shift in the intercept, specified as a sequence of  
25 basis point increments during the first three quarters of 1998.  The first two simple rules were 
proposed by Taylor (1993, 1999), while the third is a variant of the Taylor (1999) rule—introduced  
in the August Bluebook—with a higher value of r*.  The prescriptions of the first-difference rule do  
not depend on assumptions regarding r* or the level of the output gap; see Orphanides (2003). 
 

Outcome-based rule it =  1.20it-1–0.39it-2+0.19[1.17  + 1.73 πt  + 3.66( *t ty y− )  – 2.72( *1 1t ty y− −− )]

Forecast-based rule it =  1.18it-1–0.38it-2+0.20[0.98 +1.72 πt+2|t+2.29( *1| 1|t t t ty y+ +− )–1.37( *1 1t ty y− −− )]

Taylor (1993) rule it = 2 + πt + 0.5(πt – *π ) + 0.5( *t ty y− ) 

Taylor (1999) rule it = 2 + πt + 0.5(πt – *π ) + ( *t ty y− ) 

Taylor (1999) rule     
with higher r* 

it = 2.75 + πt + 0.5(πt – *π ) + ( *t ty y− )  

First-difference rule it = it-1 + 0.5(πt+3|t – *π ) + 0.5( 4 4 *3| 3|t t t ty y+ +Δ − Δ ) 
 
FRB/US Model Simulations:  Prescriptions from the two empirical rules are computed using dynamic 
simulations of the FRB/US model, implemented as though the rule is followed starting at this FOMC 
meeting.  The dotted line labeled “Previous Bluebook” is based on the current specification of the policy 
rule, applied to the previous Greenbook projection.  Confidence intervals are based on stochastic 
simulations of the FRB/US model with shocks drawn from the estimated residuals over 1986-2005.  
Information from Financial Markets:  The expected funds rate path is based on forward rate 
agreements, and the confidence intervals for this path are constructed using prices of interest rate caps. 
Near-Term Prescriptions of Simple Policy Rules:  These prescriptions are calculated using Greenbook 
projections for inflation and the output gap. Because the first-difference rule involves the lagged funds 
rate, the value labeled “Previous Bluebook” for the current quarter is computed using the actual value  
of the lagged funds rate, and the one-quarter-ahead prescriptions are based on this rule’s prescription for 
the current quarter.

Inflation Indicator Based on M2

Note: P* is defined to equal M2 times V* divided by potential GDP. V*, or long-run velocity, is estimated
using average velocity over the 1959:Q1-to-1989:Q4 period and then, after a break, over the interval from
1993:Q1 to the present. For the forecast period, P* is based on the staff M2 forecast and P is simulated using a
short-run dynamic model relating P to P*. Blue areas indicate periods in which P* is notably less than P.
Gray areas denote the projection period.
