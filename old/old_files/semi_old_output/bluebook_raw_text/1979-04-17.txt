Prefatory Note 

 
 

The attached document represents the most complete and accurate version 
available based on original copies culled from the files of the FOMC Secretariat at the 
Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System.  This electronic document was 
created through a comprehensive digitization process which included identifying the best-
preserved paper copies, scanning those copies,1 and then making the scanned versions 
text-searchable.2  Though a stringent quality assurance process was employed, some 
imperfections may remain. 
 

Please note that this document may contain occasional gaps in the text.  These 
gaps are the result of a redaction process that removed information obtained on a 
confidential basis.  All redacted passages are exempt from disclosure under applicable 
provisions of the Freedom of Information Act.    

 

                                                 
1 In some cases, original copies needed to be photocopied before being scanned into electronic format.  All 
scanned images were deskewed (to remove the effects of printer- and scanner-introduced tilting) and lightly 
cleaned (to remove dark spots caused by staple holes, hole punches, and other blemishes caused after initial 
printing). 
2 A two-step process was used.  An advanced optimal character recognition computer program (OCR) first 
created electronic text from the document image.  Where the OCR results were inconclusive, staff checked 
and corrected the text as necessary.   Please note that the numbers and text in charts and tables were not 
reliably recognized by the OCR process and were not checked or corrected by staff.

Recent developments

(1) M-1 grew in March at a ¾ per cent annual rate, but data

for early April suggest an acceleration in growth. For the March-April

period, M-1 is expected to increase at a 3¾ per cent annual rate, just

below the low end of the range adopted by the FOMC. On the other hand,

M-2 over the two months appears to be growing at around the midpoint of

the range adopted by the FOMC. Recent growth of the interest-bearing

component of this aggregate has been associated with a marked slowing of

outflows of savings deposits and continued rapid expansion in Money Market

Certificates (MMCs). At S&L's and MSB's, combined deposit growth remained

at about the 9 per cent rate of the preceding four months.

(2) Growth of commercial bank credit decelerated sharply to a

3 per cent annual rate in March, as real estate and business lending

expanded at much reduced rates. With loan expansion weakening and

inflows to deposits subject to ceilings improving, managed liabilities

rose by less than one-third of the $7 billion average increase during



-2-

the first two months of the year. Banks permitted outstanding CD's to

decline in March, while continuing to rely on Eurodollars and RP's to

supplement their loanable funds.

(3) The Manager of the System Open Market Account has continued

to aim for a weekly average Federal funds rate of 10 per cent or a bit

higher. In early April, projections for the monetary aggregates indicated

growth of M-1 at the bottom of its range over the March-April period and of

M-2 at slightly below the midpoint of its range. On April 6, the FOMC

concurred in the Chairman's view that projections at that time were not

sufficiently weak to call for a change in the System's funds rate

objective.

(4) Despite the modest strengthening of the monetary aggregates,

required reserves are expected to decline at a 3 per cent annual rate

over the March-April period, reflecting the fact that deposit growth was

mostly at nonmember banks and that reserves were released by a decline

in outstanding negotiable CD's. Both nonborrowed and total reserves

also are expected to decline--by annual rates of 1 and 3 per cent,

respectively. With currency expected to grow at a 9 per cent annual

rate over the March-April period, however, the monetary base is expected

to expand at a 5 per cent rate, continuing this year's much reduced rate

of expansion.

(5) Short-term interest rates have fluctuated fairly widely

since the March FOMC meeting, and on balance have risen somewhat. Rates on

short-dated Treasury bills increased 15 to 20 basis points as foreign

official accounts sold more than $5 billion of Treasury bills in late

March and early April. CD and long maturity bill rates, in contrast,



declined considerably in late March but have risen more recently, and

are now 10 to 25 basis points above their levels at the time of the

Committee meeting. The fluctuations of short-term interest rates appeared

to be associated with shifts in market opinion on the likely response

of monetary policy to incoming data on the economy. Bond and primary

mortgage market yields have edged up since the March FOMC meeting.

(6) The dollar has shown considerable strength in the exchange

markets since the last FOMC meeting. The dollar's weighted average

exchange value rose by more than 1 per cent at a time when there were

also sales of

$2 3/4 billion by the United States. Since the first of the year,

foreign official holdings of Treasury securities have contracted by over

$15 billion.

(7) The table on the next page shows percentage annual rates

of change in related monetary and financial flows over various time periods.

Prospective developments

(8) The table below presents for Committee consideration three

alternative specifications for the monetary aggregates and the Federal

funds rate for the April-May period. Alternative B would maintain the

Federal funds rate at about the 10 per cent level that has prevailed

since late last year, while alternatives A and C, respectively, would

ease and tighten money market conditions in coming weeks. (More detailed

and longer-term data are contained in the tables on pp. 6 and 7.)

M-2 5 to 9 4½ to 8½ 4 to 8

Federal funds rate

(9) As noted in the last Bluebook, the staff is assuming that

the downward shift of money demand that became apparent late last year

will not last as long or be as large as that which began in late 1974.

Thus, we have projected some strengthening of M-1 growth for the policy

period immediately ahead. Under alternative B, with the funds rate

remaining at the prevailing level of about 10 per cent, we expect M-1

to increase over the April-May period in a 3 to 7 per cent annual rate

range. For the second quarter as a whole, staff projections call for M-1

expansion under alternative B at about a 3¼ per cent annual rate, following

the 2½ per cent rate of decline in the first quarter. With nominal GNP

expected to expand at an 11 per cent annual rate, the implied growth of

V-1 in the second quarter, as shown in the Appendix, would be around a 7½

per cent annual rate, as compared with a 13 per cent rate in the first

quarter. About 2 to 2 percentage points of the projected second quarter

increase in V-1 reflects the prospective continued shift of demand deposits

to ATS and NOW accounts. The remaining increase in velocity is still quite

large and assumes a continued downward drift of money demand, though at a

sharply decelerated pace.

M-1 and M-2 under alternative B, would be unlikely by May to reach levels

alternatives A and C. The shortfall of growth in these aggregates since

late last year requires that M-1 would have to expand at about an 8 per

cent annual rate from March, and M-2 at an 11 per cent rate, to reach

levels by May that are on the low end paths of the longer-run QIV '78 to

QIV '79 ranges. Over a period as long as six months (March to September) the

-11-

shortfall could be made up, and the level implied by the midpoint path of

the longer-run ranges could be achieved, by M-1 growth at a 6 per cent annual

rate and M-2 growth at a 9 per cent rate. Unless the downward shift in

money demand continues to be very strong, or the economy weakens much

more than projected, the staff believes that M-1 is likely to move into the

Committee's longer-run range by late summer, given the current Federal

funds rate.

(11) Under alternative B, M-2 is expected to accelerate into

a 4 to 8 per cent annual rate range in April-May. This reflects the

expected strengthening of M-1, as well as continuation of the recent

pick-up in growth of the interest-bearing component of M-2. The

decline in outstanding savings deposits appears to be abating. And banks

are expected to continue to be more active in the MMC market, as seems

to be the case since the mid-March elimination of the rate ceiling

differential on these deposits. Thrift institutions' deposit inflows,

on the other hand, are expected to moderate in the months ahead, largely

reflecting the mid-March regulatory actions.1/ Thus, their commitment

activity is likely to remain limited over the near term, and in order to

finance mortgage takedowns thrifts will likely reduce their liquidity

and continue to borrow. Primary mortgage rates may continue to edge

upward as deposit inflows to thrift institutions diminish.

(12) Financial markets in the weeks ahead may be subject to

some of the same conflicting pressures as in recent weeks--continued high

1/ Our projections have not taken into account any offsetting boost to
deposit flows that might result from changes in deposit rate ceilings
that have been proposed for public comment.



-12-

inflation, a strengthened dollar, and increased uncertainty about the

future course of economic activity. In such an environment, even

stability in the funds rate, as contemplated under alternative B, could

be associated with relatively wide fluctuations in interest rates arising

from changing expectations. Apart from expectational factors, underlying

demand-supply forces appear in reasonable balance. A large paydown of

Treasury cash management bills in the latter part of April may exert

downward pressures on very short-term interest rates, but this could

be offset by continued sales of bills by foreign official institutions

should the dollar continue strong.

(13) Despite a seasonal budgetary surplus, the Treasury's

marketable coupon borrowing in the current quarter is expected to be

moderately higher than in the first quarter as the Treasury builds up its

cash balance and finances redemptions of nonmarketable issues by foreign

accounts. On April 25, the Treasury will announce terms on its mid-May

refunding--a routine operation to refund only $1.7 billion of maturing

publicly held debt and probably also to raise about $2 to 3 billion of

new cash. Borrowing by Federally-sponsored credit agencies this quarter

is projected to recede from the high levels of the first quarter, and the

slate of new corporate security offerings likely will remain moderate.

(14) Alternative C contemplates a rise in the Federal funds

rate to the midpoint of a 10¼ to 11 per cent range. Growth in M-1 and M-2

would likely be in an annual rate range of 2 to 6 and 4 to 8 per cent,

respectively. Short-term interest rates probably would increase in line

with the rise in the funds rate. It is less clear what might happen

to long-term rates. They may rise some in sympathy with the increase in



-13-

short rates. But it is equally likely that they may show little net change,

or perhaps even decline some, if the market comes to believe that interest

rates may peak sooner than otherwise.

(15) Alternative A calls for a decline in the funds rate over

the intermeeting period to the midpoint of a 9¼ to 10 per cent range.

Growth in M-1 and M-2 would likely be in annual rate ranges of 3 to 7

and 5 to 9 per cent, respectively. An easing action might tend to reinforce

views that a considerable weakening in economic activity is in prospect.

As a result, short-term interest rates could decline sharply. Bond yields

would be expected to decline in the short-run, as investors might feel that

interest rates had peaked. However, such strength could be short-lived

because many market participants would question the System's resolve to

restrain inflationary pressures. Reflecting this latter concern, the

dollar probably would lose strength in exchange markets.

(16) The staff would expect that maintenance of the Federal

funds rate at about 10 per cent over the remainder of the year would be

consistent with M-1 growth for the QIV '78 to QIV '79 policy period at

about the midpoint of the Committee's 1½ to 4½ per cent range.- A near-

term increase in the funds rate,as under alternative C,likely would

necessitate some decline of interest rates in the second half of the

year in order to induce strength in the aggregates as the rate of

growth of nominal GNP decelerates further. Under alternative A, however,

1/ On the basis of recent evidence, the staff has lowered somewhat its
assumption regarding the impact of ATS shifts on M-1 growth, and now
believes that such shifts will reduce M-1 by about 2½ percentage points
over the QIV '78 to QI '79 period. In addition to ATS effects, we have
assumed a downward shift of money demand for the entire year of 2
percentage points, most of which has already occurred, as indicated
by the Board's quarterly econometric model.



-14-

we would expect interest rates to rise later in the year to offset the

stimulative effect on the aggregates of the near-term easing of money market

conditions, if M-1 growth over the longer-run policy period is to be near

the midpoint of its 1½ to 4 per cent range.



-15-

Directive language

(17) Given below are suggested operational paragraphs for

the directive in the customary form. Alternative language consistent

with the short-run specifications of the alternatives discussed in the

preceding section is shown for the Committee's objective for the Federal

funds rate early in the period. At a later point, alternative language

is also provided for placing main emphasis either on monetary aggregates

or on money market conditions. The specifications adopted last month are

shown in strike-through form.

In the short run, the Committee seeks to achieve bank reserve

and money market conditions that are broadly consistent with the

longer-run ranges for monetary aggregates cited above, while giving

due regard to the program for supporting the foreign exchange value

of the dollar and to developing conditions in domestic financial

markets. Early in the period before the next regular meeting,

System open market operations are to be directed at maintaining

the (or ATTAINING A) weekly average Federal funds rate

(A) SLIGHTLY BELOW THE CURRENT LEVEL.

(B) at about the current level,

(C) SLIGHTLY ABOVE THE CURRENT LEVEL.

Subsequently, operations shall be directed at maintaining the

weekly average Federal funds rate within the range of [DEL: 9¾ to 10½]

____ TO ____ per cent. In deciding on the specific objective for

the Federal funds rate the Manager shall be guided mainly by the

relationship between the latest estimates of annual rates of growth

in the [DEL: March-April] APRIL-MAY period of M-1 and M-2 and the following

ranges of tolerance: [DEL: 4 to 8] ____ TO ____ per cent for M-1 and



-16-

[DEL: 3½ to 7½] ____ TO ____ per cent for M-2. If, with approximately

equal weight given to M-1 and M-2, their rates of growth appear

to be

Monetary aggregates emphasis

significantly above or below the midpoints

Money market emphasis

CLOSE TO OR BEYOND THE UPPER OR LOWER LIMITS

of the indicated ranges, the objective for the funds rate is

to be raised or lowered in an orderly fashion within its range.

If the rates of growth in the aggregates appear to be above

the upper limit or below the lower limit of the indicated ranges

at a time when the objective for the funds rate has already been

moved to the corresponding limit of its range, the Manager will

promptly notify the Chairman, who will then decide whether the

situation calls for supplementary instructions from the Committee.
