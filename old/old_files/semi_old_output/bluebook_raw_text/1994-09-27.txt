MONETARY POLICY ALTERNATIVES

By the staff Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System

MONETARY POLICY ALTERNATIVES

Recent Developments1

(1) The System tightened the stance of monetary policy on

August 16 through Board approval of an increase in the discount rate

of 1/2 percentage point, to 4 percent, and a decision by the Committee

to allow the entire increase in the discount rate to show through to

interest rates in reserve markets. The latter was implemented by

leaving the borrowing assumption unchanged at $450 million.

Short-term rates, which had incorporated an anticipation of a somewhat

less aggressive policy move, backed up on the announcement of these

actions that day. Commercial banks increased their prime rates 1/2

percentage point, to 7-3/4 percent, maintaining the 300 basis point

spread over the federal funds rate that has prevailed since late 1992.

However, expectations of the level of short-term rates likely to pre-

vail beyond the next few months were revised down in response to the

accompanying announcement suggesting that the Federal Reserve would

take no further action for a time, and perhaps also to a sense that

less tightening might ultimately be required following the unexpect-

edly aggressive action. This shift in expectations was reflected in

federal funds futures rates after October, shown in the upper left

panel of Chart 1, and in declines in note and bond yields.

(2) Short-term rates remained steady in the weeks after the

policy move. In the last few weeks, however, these rates have moved

1. Financial market quotations in this section are taken as of
noon, Friday, September 23.

2. To accommodate shifts in seasonal credit demands, the borrowing
assumption was subsequently raised to $475 and $500 million and re-
duced more recently back down to $475 million. Borrowing averaged
$498 million in the maintenance period ending August 31 and dropped to
$447 million in the period ending September 14 on declines in both
seasonal and adjustment borrowing.

up appreciably. Markets built back in a steeper trajectory of near-

term Federal Reserve tightening as incoming economic data were seen as

pointing to a greater risk of inflation. The initial declines in

long-term rates were rolled back within a few days of the System

action, and these rates have risen noticeably further in response to

the recent data. On balance over the intermeeting period, long-term

rates have moved up about 20 to 40 basis points. Equity markets also

declined in recent days, but advanced on net over the period.

(3) With inflation concerns heightened, rising interest

rates in the latter part of the period did not buoy the dollar, which

declined about 1-3/4 percent, on balance. Contributing to the dol-

lar's weakness were signs of unexpected strength in the German economy

and associated increases in German interest rates: Short-term rates

moved only slightly higher, but long-term rates rose 35 basis points.

In Japan, incoming data pointed to a subdued recovery, and short- and

long-term rates showed little change. In Canada, market concerns over

a possible Quebec secession faded in the wake of the weaker-than-

expected showing of support for the Parti Quebecois in provincial

elections. Consequently, the Canadian currency rose 2-1/2 percent

against the U.S. dollar, while Canadian short- and long-term interest

rates declined 50 and 10 basis points, respectively.

(4) The monetary aggregates declined in August and data for

early September suggest a leveling off this month, leaving M2 and M3 a

little above the lower bounds of their long-term ranges. On balance,

the aggregates have been weaker than anticipated at the time of the



last meeting, even after allowing for the effects of the recent tight-

ening of monetary policy. Weakness in August was concentrated in the

liquid components. Demand deposits, continuing to be depressed by

declines in mortgage refinancing, contracted in August, following two

months of surprising strength. Other checkable deposits and savings

deposits also ran off, reflecting the substantial gap between rates on

these and competing instruments that has opened up since the System

began to tighten in February. Some of the balances in the latter

accounts apparently have been shifted into small time deposits, which

accelerated in August. Rates on time deposits, although reacting more

slowly than usual to increases in market rates, have risen somewhat in

recent weeks, whereas returns on liquid deposits have barely budged

this year. In light of the sluggish behavior of deposit rates, the

overall weakness in M2 is roughly in line with historical rela-

tionships embodied in money demand models, given the staff forecast of

spending in the current quarter. The relative attractiveness of mar-

ket investments can be seen in the volume of noncompetitive tenders in

Treasury auctions, which was exceptionally heavy in August. Flows

into stock mutual funds continued to be strong, but outflows from bond

funds persisted; the total of the two was well below the pace of 1992

and 1993, suggesting, at most, modest net shifts between M2 and

capital market mutual funds.4  Institution-only money funds dropped

sharply in response to the rise in market yields, and as a consequence

M3 also was weak last month. The broader aggregate was buoyed by

3. M1 declined at a 2 percent rate in August, as currency growth
slowed a bit, while transaction deposits ran off. Reserves dropped at
a 6 percent rate, holding down the growth of the base to 6-1/4 per-
cent. Over all of 1994, reserves have dropped at a 1-1/2 percent
rate, while the base has increased at a rate of 8-3/4 percent.

4. M2+ was flat in August; from the fourth quarter of last year
through August, this expanded aggregate grew at a 1-1/4 percent rate,
nearly the same pace as for M2.



brisk issuance of large time deposits, as banks continued to rely on

managed liabilities to fund credit growth. As in recent months,

however, banks continued to make heavy use of sources outside the

monetary aggregates, particularly borrowings from foreign offices.

(5) Bank credit slowed in August, although loan growth re-

mained strong. Business loans expanded at an annual rate of almost 10

percent. Anecdotal evidence of further easing in the standards and

terms for business loans continued to accumulate. In recent months,

bank lending to businesses has been boosted by rising external financ-

ing needs and growing merger and acquisition activity, as well as by

shifts away from capital market financing. Consumer loan growth at

banks remained in double digits in August, suggesting that consumer

credit continued to expand briskly. Nonetheless, growth of overall

debt of nonfinancial sectors slowed in recent months, held down by

retirements of state and local obligations from the proceeds of ear-

lier advance refundings. Moreover, federal borrowing has moderated a

bit from earlier in the year on a seasonally adjusted basis. On net,

nonfinancial debt is estimated to have expanded in recent months at

less than a 5 percent annual rate, down from earlier this year,

keeping it well in the lower half of its 4 to 8 percent monitoring

range.

Monetary Policy Alternatives

(6) Three monetary policy alternatives are presented below

for consideration by the Committee. Under alternative B, the federal

funds rate would continue to trade around 4-3/4 percent, consistent

with retaining an allowance of $475 million for adjustment plus sea-

sonal borrowing.5 Alternative C envisages raising the federal

funds rate 1/4 percentage point, to 5 percent, in conjunction with an

increase in the borrowing allowance to $500 million. Under alterna-

tive D, the federal funds rate would be moved up to 5-1/4 percent,

achieved either by an increase in the initial borrowing allowance to

$525 million or by an unchanged borrowing allowance and a hike in the

discount rate to 4-1/2 percent.

(7) In the Greenbook forecast, the policy restraint now in

place is not viewed as adequate to slow spending sufficiently to fore-

stall a buildup of inflation pressures, given the apparent underlying

strength of aggregate demand and the likely absence of any margin of

economic slack. The policy firming built into the staff forecast

would push the federal funds rate up around one percentage point be-

fore next spring. A tightening of about this magnitude over the next

few quarters seems to be built into the structure of market interest

rates; in contrast to the staff assumption, that structure also can be

read as implying further increases subsequently. The firming assumed

by the staff keeps short- and longer-term real interest rates high

enough to rein in output to the neighborhood of potential; core infla-

tion picks up a bit late this year, but edges down over 1995 to a rate

slightly above its recent pace.

5. Over the intermeeting period, seasonal borrowing should trend
down, as is the norm for this time of year, necessitating technical
reductions in the borrowing assumption.



(8) Alternative B, which would retain current reserve condi-

tions, is not inconsistent with the staff assumption of policy firm-

ing, provided that firming resumes some time soon. Inaction might be

deemed particularly appropriate if the Committee believed that strains

on capacity could be less pressing than in the staff forecast, either

because potential output might be greater than assumed by the staff or

because more restraint on spending could be in the pipeline in view of

the substantial increases in interest rates over the past year. More-

over, slow growth of a broad array of monetary and credit aggregates

might be seen as suggesting that financial conditions are not con-

ducive to a pickup in underlying inflation. A pause would allow the

Committee to accumulate more evidence on these questions. Such a

wait-and-see posture would accord with the tone of the press statement

announcing the policy action taken at the August meeting.

(9) Market opinions on what the Committee might do at this

meeting are split. Some analysts have interpreted the recent economic

news as implying sufficiently greater inflation potential to overcome

any presumption of a policy pause; they expect a firming action, per-

haps of 50 basis points. Others still anticipate a hiatus in the

process of policy tightening; however, even many of those in the

latter camp seem to expect some action no later than the November

meeting. While few actually foresee a 25 basis point increase, the

composite effect of these different views has produced a federal funds

futures rate for October that is 25 basis points above the current

funds rate. Nonetheless, maintenance of existing reserve conditions

under alternative B might elicit little reaction in rates beyond the

very shortest maturities because market participants would assume that



tightening had simply been postponed. In these circumstances, longer-

term instruments might trade in their current ranges at least for a

time, although security prices probably will remain quite sensitive to

news bearing on inflation pressures as market participants attempt to

gauge the extent of future policy restraint. In that regard, under

the staff forecast, economic releases over the next few months would

suggest that inflation is on a slightly higher track and that final

demand remains fairly vigorous. Absent unanticipated changes in

policy abroad, the foreign exchange value of the dollar most likely

would remain around its current level, though it could come under some

downward pressure if inflation expectations began to deteriorate

further.

(10) A tightening in reserve conditions at this meeting

might be favored if the Committee saw a significant risk that output

is in the process of surpassing its long-run potential. Waiting in

these circumstances might risk the development of a degree of infla-

tion momentum--partly through expectations channels--that could make

it more difficult to contain inflation at recent rates, much less

achieve the long-run goal of price stability. The 50 basis point

firming of alternative D is the most likely of the three policy

options to keep the Federal Reserve "ahead of the curve" of inflation

pressures and consequently to limit the extent to which policy might

later need to tighten. If the Committee were uncertain about how much

tightening would be required but wanted to respond to recent data, the

more modest 25 basis point move of alternative C might be considered

appropriate.

(11) The 25 basis point tightening of alternative C is con-

sistent with the current structure of market rates, and this policy



action might well trigger only muted interest rate reactions. How-

ever, since most market participants expect either no action or a 50

basis point tightening, alternative C could raise questions about

System intentions, potentially unsettling markets. A considerable

portion of the 50 basis point increase in the federal funds rate under

alternative D would pass through to other short-term rates. In light

of recent experience and the split in market expectations, it's dif-

ficult to say what immediate impact this alternative would have on

interest rates in capital markets. Eventually, assuming economic and

price data consistent with the staff forecast, intermediate-term

yields could tend to work their way a bit higher, as market partici-

pants raised their expected path for Federal Reserve tightening in

this phase of the business cycle. But the System's evident willing-

ness to deal with inflation pressures through a 50 basis point move

should alleviate longer-run concerns in this regard, limiting any

increases in bond yields. With the rise in real interest rates, the

dollar would likely appreciate somewhat on exchange markets.

(12) Under all three alternatives outlined above, the debt

of the domestic nonfinancial sectors should expand at about a 5 per-

cent rate over the balance of the year, placing the annual growth of

this aggregate also at 5 percent, in the lower half of its 4 to 8

percent monitoring range. With capital spending by nonfinancial

corporations anticipated to outpace their internally generated funds

by a widening margin and merger activity continuing at its more ele-

vated pace, business borrowing could strengthen some over the balance

of the year. Commercial banks are anticipated to remain aggressive

lenders to this sector, including for merger-related activity. In the

household sector, consumer credit growth is expected to remain near a



-10-

double-digit rate even as borrowing costs continue to edge up, sup-

porting solid expansion of consumer durables spending. Despite some-

what faster expansion of federal debt late in 1994, growth for the

year--projected at 5-1/2 percent--would be the slowest in fifteen

years.

(13) Growth of the monetary aggregates over the September-

to-December period is presented below for alternatives B and D. Any

action taken this late in the year is unlikely to have much of an

impact on the annual growth rates of the aggregates for 1994, shown in

the lower panel of the table. For illustrative purposes, the path

under alternative B was derived assuming that the funds rate would

hold at its current level for the remainder of the year. The path for

the aggregates under alternative D assumes that the funds rate moves

up to 5-1/4 percent at this meeting and stays there for the balance of

the year. Thus, neither alternative matches the assumption in the

Greenbook forecast. (The response of the aggregates under alternative

C would lie midway between the two alternatives.)

In addition, declines in mortgage prepayments will continue to depress

demand deposits. These factors will place a particular drag on liquid

accounts, and M1 will expand at only a 2-1/2 percent rate over the

period.6 While the growth of small time deposits should remain

robust, not all the funds lost from liquid deposits will remain in M2.

Direct purchases of securities, including noncompetitive tenders at

Treasury auctions, are anticipated to continue at a healthy clip. As

a result, M2 velocity is expected to continue increasing rapidly in

the fourth quarter--at a rate near 5 percent. M3 growth should pick

up a bit over the remainder of 1994, reflecting somewhat reduced

reliance of banks on nondeposit sources of funding.

(15) Under alternative D, M2 would grow at a 1/2 percent

rate over the September-to-December period. The sluggish adjustment

of deposit rates to the rise in market rates would further widen

opportunity costs, depressing M1 and savings deposits even more.

However, should policy firming be accompanied by some price declines

in capital markets, outflows from bond mutual funds could intensify,

some of the outflows might find their way into deposits and money

market mutual funds, partly offsetting the effects on M2 of the higher

cost of holding deposits. M3 would grow at a 3/4 percent rate over

the remaining months of the year, pulled down by a runoff of institu-

tion-only money funds as their yields lag behind the increase in money

market rates that would be in train under alternative D.

6. Rapid currency growth should continue to bolster M1 over the
balance of the year. As a result, under alternative B, the monetary
base should expand at about a 8-1/4 percent rate, while total reserves
should grow at a 1-3/4 percent rate over the September-to-December
period.
