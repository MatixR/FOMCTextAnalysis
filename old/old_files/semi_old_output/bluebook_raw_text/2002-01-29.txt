The attached document represents the most complete and accurate version 
available based on original copies culled from the files of the FOMC Secretariat at the 
Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System.  This electronic document was 
created through a comprehensive digitization process which included identifying the best-
preserved paper copies, scanning those copies,1 and then making the scanned versions 
text-searchable.2  Though a stringent quality assurance process was employed, some 
imperfections may remain. 
 

Please note that this document may contain occasional gaps in the text.  These 
gaps are the result of a redaction process that removed information obtained on a

1 In some cases, original copies needed to be photocopied before being scanned into electronic format.  All 
scanned images were deskewed (to remove the effects of printer- and scanner-introduced tilting) and lightly 
cleaned (to remove dark spots caused by staple holes, hole punches, and other blemishes caused after initial 
printing). 
2 A two-step process was used.  An advanced optimal character recognition computer program (OCR) first 
created electronic text from the document image.  Where the OCR results were inconclusive, staff checked

STUCTLY CONFIDENTIAL (FR) CLASS II FOMC

JANUARY 24,2002

MONETARY POLCY ALTERNATIVES

PREPARED FOR THE FEDERAL OPEN MARKET COMMITTEE
BY THE STAFF OF THE BOARD OF GOVERNORS OF THE FEDERAL RESERVE SYSTEM



1  The federal funds rate has averaged close to the 1¾ percent target since the
last FOMC meeting .  The Desk has purchased $7.2 billion of Treasury securities in
outright operations:  $6.1 billion of Treasury coupon securities in the market and
$1.1 billion of bills from foreign official institutions.  With the unwinding of year-end
demands for currency, the Desk has reduced the outstanding vo lume of long-term
System RPs by $7 b illion, to $21 billion.  The Desk moved to arranging only one,
rather than two, four-week System RPs per week.

MONETARY POLICY ALTERNATIVES

Recent Developments

(1) The Committee’s actions at its December meeting to reduce the federal

funds rate another 25 basis points and to retain an assessment that the balance of risks

was weighted toward economic weakness had been widely anticipated, but investors

apparently read the announcem ent as indicating that the FOMC’s outlook for 

economic conditions was softer than had  been thought.  Although economic data

releases over the intermeeting period generally led market participants to mark up

their expectation  for near-term economic activity, the anticipated growth of aggregate

demand going forward was evidently revised down in light of speeches by several

Committee members and firms’ downbeat guidance on future revenues and capital

spending.  On net, federal funds futures quotes for the next few months are little

changed from their levels at the time of the December meeting and are consistent

with only slight odds of a 25 basis point reduction in the federal funds rate at this

meeting.  Expectations for policy tightening later this year and next, however, were

trimmed 25 to 35 basis points, with the funds rate now moving a little above 4 percent

by fall 2003 (charts). 1  Yields on nominal Treasury coupon securities were unchanged

2  The turn of the year passed uneventfully, and short-term risk spreads fell
back, albeit to levels above those of late summer.  Reports indicate trading conditions
in the U.S. Treasury market improved, although implied volatilities on bond futures
contracts remain elevated.

to down 15 basis points over the intermeeting period.2  Rates on inflation-indexed

Treasury securities fell as much as those on their nominal counterparts, suggesting

little change in inflation expectations, although a survey measure of households’

longer-term inflation expectations dropped considerably.  In private markets, risk

spreads on corporate bonds were little changed.  Broad equity price indexes edged

lower, on net, but, with earnings marked down too, still seem to incorporate

expectations of rapid growth in profits.

(2) The trade-weighted index of the do llar’s exchange value against other

major currencies rose 2½ percent over the intermeeting period, reaching its highest

level since the mid-1980s, as market attention focused on signs that the U.S. economy

would lead the rebound from the global slowdown.  The dollar appreciated

6½ percent against the yen, as the Japanese economy sagged further and fitful

progress on structural reforms continued to disappoint market participants.  Heavy

injections of liquidity by the Bank of Japan, as well as comments from Japanese

officials indicating little resistance to the weakening of the yen, also may have weighed

on that currency.  The dollar touched a record high against the Canad ian dollar late in

the intermeeting period and, on net, increased about 1½ percent.  Against the euro,

the dollar appreciated about 1 percent.  Successful introduction of euro coins and

notes at the start of the year gave the euro only a temporary boost.  Long-term

interest rates in the major industrialized countries generally edged higher on net, but

changes in stock prices were mixed.      

   and U.S. monetary

authorities did not intervene.

(3) The exchange value of the do llar against the currencies of our other

important trading partners increased about 1¼ percent during the intermeeting

period, with  much  of that  rise stem ming from depreciation  of the A rgent ine peso. 

Under intense domestic economic and political pressure, Argentine authorities

abandoned support for one-to-one peso-dollar convertibility in favor of a dual

exchange rate system with a new fixed (but devalued) rate for certain transactions and

a floating rate for all o thers.  As measured by the  floating rate, the peso  initially

depreciated sharply and has since fluctuated in a wide range amid daily intervention

purchases of pesos by the Argentine central bank.  Following the default on some

official debt, prices of Argentina’s bonds, which already had reached  distressed levels

before the December FOMC meeting , sank further.  To date, spillovers to other Latin

American financial markets have appeared quite limited.  Against the U.S. dollar, the

Brazilian real depreciated about 2½ percent during the intermeeting period, and the

Mexican peso gained nearly ¾ percent.  EMBI+ bond spreads narrowed for both

countries.  The Korean won and the Taiwan dollar depreciated somewhat against the

U.S. dollar, but these declines appeared to be related more to  the weakness of the yen

than spillover from Argentina.  Share prices in most of emerging Asia moved higher

on net during the period.

(4) Debt of the nonfederal sectors expanded at an estimated 7¼ percent

annual rate in December, a bit slower than its average pace over the preceding two

months.  Net debt financing by businesses moderated in December, and, based on

preliminary data for January, has remained light.  Some of the proceeds from bond

sales have been used to pay off loans at banks, wh ich continued  to contract into  early

January.  Credit problems in the business sector remained concentrated among the

weakest firms, and markets continued to  be receptive to other corporate offerings,

while banks, according to the most recent senior loan officer survey, have tightened

their standards and terms on business loans somewhat further.  Household borrowing

is showing signs of some slowing .  The recent rise in mortgage rates has damped

mortgage refinancing activity, auto sales have dropped back, and banks have firmed

terms and standards on consumer loans somewhat further as household credit quality

evidently has deteriorated further, mostly among marginal borrowers.  With federal

debt up only slightly, total nonfinancial debt grew at an estimated 6¼ percent annual

rate from September to December.

(5) M2 grew at a 9 percent annual rate in December, a bit less than in

November, and has moderated considerably further in the early weeks of January

(Chart 3).3  M2 growth last month, as has been the case for a while, was supported by

the substantial decline in opportunity costs associated with policy easings and lagged

effects of mortgage refinancing activity.  This aggregate may also have been lifted by

some investor preference for stab le-value assets, evidenced by outflows from equity

mutual funds in December.  The currency component of the aggregate was quite

brisk, lifted by a pickup in demand for U.S. currency abroad.  (See box, “Foreign

Demand for U.S. Currency,” on page 5.)  With nominal GDP apparently about flat in

the fourth quarter, M2 velocity is estimated to have fallen at an annual rate of 9

percent.  Over the four quarters of 2001, it declined 7½ percent, the largest four-

quarter change in  the forty-year  span of the official U.S. monetary  data.

Policy Alternatives

(6) The staff has read the incoming data as indicating stronger-than-

expected economic performance in the quarters surrounding year-end, consistent w ith

a recovery starting early this year.  Even so, the level of real GDP at the end of the

forecast period is little changed, as growth after this quarter has been lowered a touch

on the assessment that Congress and the Administration will be unable to strike a deal

on substantial fiscal stimulus, in contrast to the package assumed in recent

Greenbooks.  The stance o f monetary policy is assumed to remain unchanged until

late this year, and then, as the economic expansion becomes more assured, to firm

enough to bring the federal funds rate to 3 percent by late next year.  Bond yields,

however, are projected to remain around recent trading ranges rather than moving

higher as the upturn takes hold, reflecting a slower pace of monetary policy tightening

than now incorporated into financial markets; equity prices trend higher with nominal

income beginning at about midyear; and the foreign exchange value of the dollar

essentially moves sideways.  Against this financial backdrop, output growth climbs

above that of its potential after midyear, lifted by a resumption of expansion in

business investment.  The unemployment rate, after plateauing at 6 percent this year,

begins to edge lower.  The slack in resource use helps bring about a notable decline in

the rate of inflation in core consumer prices, measured on either a CPI or PCE basis,

over the next two years.

(7) At the end of the Greenbook forecast period in the fourth quarter of

2003, the economy is still seen as operating with unused resources and inflation

appears poised to drift lower.  But with the lingering effects of the capital overhang

dissipating, fiscal policy providing stimulus on net, and the real federal funds rate

remaining on the low side of staff estimates of its equilibrium value, aggregate demand

is expanding at a faster pace than potential output.  To exam ine longer-term strategies



8

for monetary policy as these dynamic imbalances play out, three scenarios were

created with the aid of the FRB/US m odel.  In the baseline, the Greenbook forecast is

extended through 2006 by making several judgmental adjustments to the model that

preserve the central features of the staff outlook.  In particular, trend multifactor

productivity is assumed to climb steadily at a little over 1 percent per year, which,

combined with a modest pickup in capital deepening from its current pace, implies

potential GDP is expanding at a 3½ percent rate by mid-decade.  The effective natural

rate of unemployment remains close to 5¼ percent–the staff’s current long-run

estimate.  The unified federal budget is projected to return to surplus after 2003, but

growing outlays and scheduled tax cuts restrain the rise in federal saving relative to

GDP.  In the baseline, the demand for U.S. exports is bolstered by a 3 percent annual

depreciation of the dollar, as well as the gradual recovery of the world economy, so as

to cap the current account defici t as a percent of GDP at a li ttle over 5 percent.  

(8) The baseline strategy is designed to hold core PCE inflation at

1 percent, about the rate prevailing as the Greenbook projection closes.  With the

unemployment rate only modestly above its natural rate and the growth in aggregate

demand above trend, policy makers m ight choose to  raise the nominal funds rate to

4 percent to elevate the real rate to its equilibrium level of 3 percent, as depicted by 

the solid line in Chart 4.  As a result, the economy edges toward its potential and the

inflation rate remains near its long-run goal of 1 percent.  Two alternative simulations

apply a standard Taylor rule to examine how sensitive these paths are to the Federal

Reserve’s objectives for inflation.

(9) In the price stability  case (the dotted line), policy tightens sufficiently to

point the economy toward an inflation rate of ½ percent as measured by core PCE

prices, or about zero after taking account of the bias in this measure of inflation.  To

achieve this result, policy firms more quickly than in the baseline and then keeps the

funds rate on a slight incline through mid-2005.  As in the baseline, the

unemployment rate moves up to around 6 percent but, unlike the base case, it holds

there through 2003 before dropping slowly.  Even this aggressive pursuit of price

stability does not produce a funds rate profile as steeply sloped as currently embedded

in market pr ices, supporting the view that market participants  are building in

considerably  stronger aggregate  demand than in the staff forecast.  

(10) In the inflation cushion case (the dashed line), policy is steered to

achieve a long-run inflation goal of 1½ percent, which requires the funds rate to drop

below 1¼ percent this year.  By 2004, however, the unemployment rate crosses below

its natural rate and policy firms, with the nominal funds rate gradually moving above

its baseline path.  Ironically, the policy designed to keep the funds rate the furthest

above its zero nominal bound in the long run requires moving the nominal rate

closest to zero in the short run.

(11) With regard to policy choice at this meeting, the Committee might elect

to leave the federal funds rate target unchanged at 1¾ percent if it were reasonably

confident that the more positive tone to incoming data s ignals imminent econom ic

recovery.  Last year’s implementation of monetary and fiscal stimulus should provide

substantial support to spending going forward.  Indeed, judging by the gap of the

actual real funds rate below staff estimates of its equilibrium value, the stance of

monetary policy is already qu ite stimulative (Chart 5 and tab le).  The resurgence in

consumer confidence and the recovery in stock prices over recent months suggest that

household outlays will continue to trend  higher.  With that underlying support to sales

and with technolog ical change providing an incentive to buy new cap ital equ ipment, a

recovery of business investment may be seen  as only a matter of time.  Under these

conditions, the Committee may prefer to stand pat until incoming information sheds

additional light on the possible need for a policy adjustment.  As the forces restraining

aggregate demand abate, at some point the Committee will need to move the funds

rate up  from its current low  level to  prevent excessive stimulus from taking  hold. 

Additional easing now would raise the amplitude of that ultimate policy adjustment,

and put a greater premium on getting the timing of that policy reversal about right,

especially if aggregate demand turns out to be stronger than anticipated.  Given the

uncertainties of forecasting, such fine tuning may run the risk of accentuating the

variab ility of aggregate dem and and asset  prices .  

(12) If the Committee perceived substantial remaining downside risks to the

economic outlook, it instead might select a 25 basis point reduction in the federal

funds rate target to 1½ percent.  While some recent indicators of capital spending

have been encouraging, a sustained revival may be viewed as far from assured.  If

investors in stock and corporate bond markets came to question the long-term

outlook for h igh-tech industries and the associated trends for economy-wide profit

streams and productivity, the resulting downward adjustment in asset prices wou ld set

back the recovery of investment and consumption.  Moreover, should the news on

the labor market remain bad for a while longer, consumer attitudes may turn out to be

more fragile than they have seemed of late.  While easing policy another notch would

not appreciably reduce the risks of such adverse outcomes, it would at least put the

economy on a slightly stronger footing should any of them eventuate.  With an

intensification of inflation unlikely to pose a threat in the next couple of years, the

potential costs of such a policy action might be seen as small when compared with the

cumulative shortfall of resource utilization in the staff forecast.  Indeed, limiting

disinflation at this point might be welcomed for strategic reasons:  The risks

associated with operating policy at very low nominal interest rates might incline the

Committee toward slightly higher inflation than in the Greenbook forecast–as in the 



11

“inflation cushion” strategy described above–in order to be able to put in place low

real interest rates if need be in the future.

(13) With market participants  apparently be lieving that this easing cycle is

drawing to  a close, they are beg inning to focus on when the Committee will change its

assessment of the balance of risks.  A majority of them apparently believe that the

Committee will choose to retain its assessment that the risks are tilted toward

weakness at this meeting, presumably because policy makers’ views of the economy

are thought to evolve gradually in most circumstances.  If that, in fact, describes the

Committee’s view, it would retain its statement that the balance of risks is weighted

toward economic weakness for either policy alternative discussed above.  However, if

the Committee’s outlook has shifted to the point that it now views the recovery as

sufficiently assured–either with an unchanged funds rate or after an additional

¼ percentage point ease at this meeting– it might opt for balanced risks.

(14) Given that financial markets place small odds on a reduction in the

funds rate target at this meeting, the choice of no change, even with risks weighted

toward economic weakness, would induce a slight increase in money market rates and

a smaller rise in bond yields.  Any tendency for rates to rise presumably would be

amplified by a  shift to a neutral balance-of-risks statement as market participants

move up the anticipated po licy tightening and boost its trajectory.  Another ¼

percentage point reduction in the federal funds rate, along with a statement that the

risks were weighted to the downside, would come as a surprise to market participants,

perhaps prompting a sense that the economic outlook was a little weaker than

previously perceived.  As a result, some immediate reduction in long-term as well as

short-term interest rates likely would occur.  The adoption of balanced risks would go

a long way toward short-circuiting any downward revision to expectations about

spending, perhaps even to the point where longer-term yields would rise.

(15) Under the assumption of an unchanged policy stance through mid-year, 

as in the staff forecast, M2 growth from December to June would step down to a 5½

percent annual rate.  The slowing in M 2 mainly reflects the waning effects of last

year’s easings.  In addition, the staff expects outflows of currency to Europe and

Argentina as well as the effects of mortgage refinancings to diminish in coming

months relative to December.  Nonetheless, the associated quarterly average rate of

expansion of M2 would still be well in excess of the 3¾ percent pace of projected

nominal GDP growth, implying a further decline in velocity averaging 2¼ percent

over the first half of the year.

(16) Overall debt of domestic nonfinancial sectors is projected to grow at a

4¼ percent pace from December to June, reflecting an edging off of federal debt and

a 5¼ percent rise in nonfederal debt.  In view of the attractive level of longer-term

rates, corporations are expected to continue to tap the bond markets in volume, but

with external financing needs picking up as the inventory runoff draws closer to an

end, short-term business credit is projected to begin expanding over the spring.  In

the household sector, borrowing probably will remain concentrated in mortgage

markets.  Consumer credit could level out, particularly as auto sales tail off.

Directive and Balance-of-Risks Language

(17) Presented below for the members' consideration is draft wording for

(1) the directive and (2) the “balance of risks” sentence to be included in the press

release issued after the  meeting (not part of the directive).

(1) Directive Wording

The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and financial

conditions that will foster price stab ility and promote sustainable growth in

output.  To further its long-run  objectives, the Committee in the immediate

future seeks conditions in reserve markets consistent with MAINTAINING/

INCREASING/reducing the federal funds rate AT/to an average of around

___1-3/4 percent.

                                                   (2) “Balance o f Risks” Sentence

Against the background of its long-run goals of price stability and

sustainable economic growth and of the information currently available, the

Committee believes that the risks [ARE BALANCED WITH RESPECT TO

PROSPECTS FOR BOTH GOALS] [ARE WEIGHTED MAINLY

TOWARD CONDITIONS THAT MAY GENERATE HEIGHTENED

INFLATION PRESSURES] [continue to be weighted m ainly toward

conditions that may generate economic weakness] in the foreseeable future.
