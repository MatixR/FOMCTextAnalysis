The attached document represents the most complete and accurate version available 
based on original copies culled from the files of the FOMC Secretariat at the Board 
of Governors of the Federal Reserve System.  This electronic document was created 
through a comprehensive digitization process which included identifying the best-
preserved paper copies, scanning those copies,1 and then making the scanned 
versions text-searchable.2   Though a stringent quality assurance process was 
employed, some imperfections may remain. 
 
Please note that some material may have been redacted from this document if that

MONEY MARKET CONDITIONS

Recent developments

(1) RPD and the money supply aggregates all appear to be

expanding at rates well above the upper limits of the Committee's

December-January ranges of tolerance, as shown in the following table.

For December alone, growth of M1 and M2 accelerated to annual rates of

15.8 and 14.6 per cent, respectively (before annual seasonal and benchmark

revisions).1/ Growth of M1 in the fourth quarter was at an 8.6 per

cent annual rate, and growth for all of 1972 at an 8.2 per cent rate.

Although levels of M1 and M 2 both receded somewhat in early January, they

remained high relative to earlier projections.

expected--revenue sharing payments did contribute importantly to recent

growth of the money supply aggregates. In the case of M1, this contri-

bution apparently accounted for about 3 percentage points of the

December growth. No other special contributing factors have been docu-

mented, however; for example, a System telephone survey of banks parti-

cularly affected by Regulation J and the establishment of new RCC's

turned up little evidence of bank requests for increased compensatory

balances from corporations or others. The most plausible explanation of

recent rapid monetary growth thus appears to be the stimulus to trans-

actions demands generated by strong economic expansion.

(3) Shortly after the last Committee meeting, incoming deposit

data indicated that the reserve and monetary aggregates were tending to

run above the upper limits of the Committee's ranges of tolerance, and the

extent of these overshoots widened as the inter-meeting period progressed.

Because the terms of the Treasury's new bond financing were announced at

about the time firm evidence of overshoots became available, the Desk was

somewhat inhibited in moving to resist these excesses. Within this "even-

keel" constraint, however, the Desk did hold back on the provision of

nonborrowed reserves, and the average Federal funds rate advanced nearly

30 basis points over the inter-meeting period. In the latest statement

week, the funds rate averaged around 5.65 per cent. Recently, trading

has been 5.75 per cent, with Desk strategy on the provision of reserves

expected to result in a funds rate ranging between 5-3/4 and 5-7/8 per cent.

(4) Fluctuations in the rates at which Federal funds actually

traded were considerably wider than usual, ranging generally from as low



as 4-1/2 per cent to as high as 7 per cent. Large and erratic

day-to-day fluctuations in float contributed importantly

to this increased rate volatility by making it more difficult for both

banks and the Desk to manage reserve positions. In these circumstances

member bank borrowing was unusually heavy, particularly over the two long

holiday weekends. Average borrowings, however, dropped from $1.8 billion

in the New Year's holiday week to about $690 million in the latest week.

(5) The general firming of money market conditions over the

inter-meeting period was accompanied by relatively modest advances in

other interest rates. In short-term markets these advances ranged from

5 to 20 basis points, but in long-term markets rates were generally un-

changed to only about 10 basis points higher. Sizable demand for securities

--arising partly from the reinvestment of revenue-sharing payments--tended

to limit rate advances on the most liquid types of short-term instruments,

particularly short-maturity Treasury bills. The yield on 3-month bills,

for example, showed a net decline mid-way in the inter-meeting period.

But recently it has risen to about 5.25 per cent, with announcement of

the Phase III wage-price program exerting a modest bearish impact on credit

markets.

(6) In the Treasury auction of its new 20-year bond demands from

reporting Government security dealers and other market professionals proved

to be stronger than anticipated, with their awards amounting to more than half

the total offering. Secondary market demand for the issue from final investors

was unenthusiastic at the unexpectedly low 6.79 per cent stop-out yield, and



-4-

the yield on the issue rose to 6.85 per cent as professionals

pressed to reduce their positions. Positions of reporting dealers have

declined substantially in the past few days, and most recently were

about $70 million

(7) The table on the following page compares recent changes

in money and credit aggregates (seasonally adjusted annual rates) with

those for selected earlier periods. Comparison for the various concepts

of money are in terms of the new, revised series.

Prospective developments

(8) As in the previous Blue Book, three alternative sets of

relationships among monetary aggregates and money market conditions are

shown in summary form below for FOMC consideration (with figures for

aggregates representing seasonally adjusted annual rates of growth).

More detailed monthly and quarterly figures are shown in the table on

page 6a. Figures for money supply as variously defined represent the

new, revised series. Revision of the bank credit proxy and reserve series

has not yet been fully completed, and the figures for RPD represent our

best judgmental estimate of numbers consistent with the new money supply

series, pending completion of the overall revision in the next two weeks.

(9) Ranges of tolerance in RPD and the monetary aggregates

for January-February have been reduced to two percentage points so as

to provide a more precise indication of FOMC target paths from which

deviations can be measured. Strict adherence to a relatively narrow

RPD path may tend to lead to wider fluctuations in the Federal funds

rate. However, clear and significant shifts in the multiplier between

RPD and deposits could provide a basis for adjustment of the RPD path

in the inter-meeting period, depending on Committee preferences.

(10) Alternative B shown in paragraph (8) encompasses longer-

run paths for the aggregates that include a 5--6 per cent annual rate of

growth for M1, the longer-run target specified by the Committee at its

last meeting. Alternative A provides for somewhat more rapid growth in

the aggregates and alternative C for somewhat less.

(11) The short-run ranges of tolerance for the monetary

aggregates remain on the high side of longer-run targets. For example,

in alternative B, the January-February M 1 growth is indicated at

per cent, as compared with the 5--6 per cent longer-run target. It is

expected that revenue sharing payments in January and the beginning of

tax refunds next month will exert some temporary stimulus to growth in

holdings of cash and time and savings deposits.

(12) All of the alternatives shown indicate a slowing in

the second quarter growth rate in M1 and M2 relative to the first quarter.

This reflects mainly (a) disappearance of the transitory upward effect on

M1 from sizable Treasury refunds of taxes and smaller final payments by



-8-

individuals, (b) the lagged effect on money demand of past interest rate

increases, and (c) in alternatives B and C, particularly, reduced public

interest in time and savings deposits other than large CD's as short-term

rates rise further above ceiling rates.

(13) To achieve the aggregates of alternative B, the staff

expects that money market conditions will tighten from around prevail-

ing levels, given the continuing strong transaction demands for money

implicit in the rapid growth in nominal GNP projected for the first and

second quarters. The potential for money market tightening implied by

the alternative B monetary target paths is indicated by the 5-5/8--6-1/4

per cent Federal funds rate range shown for that alternative. Even with

RPD over the forthcoming January-February period rising in a 10--12 per

cent annual rate range, we would expect the funds rate to move up to

6 per cent or somewhat above by the time of the next meeting. But it

should be noted that even-keel considerations--discussed in paragraphs

(16) and (17)--would suggest that the most propitious time for a rise

in the funds rate, should one be required, is before the end of January. A

rise in the funds rate of the dimensions contemplated in alternative B

would likely be accompanied by a further rise in short-term rates generally,

with the 3-month Treasury bill rate in particular moving upward in a

5-3/8--5-3/4 per cent range.

(14) At such market rates, demand for member bank borrowings

would be relatively strong, even with the discount rate at the recently

announced 5 per cent level, and the level of borrowings might be around $1

billion on average. However, as borrowings continue large,many banks will wear



-9-

out their welcome at the window and this will add further to pressure on

open market rates and on banks to restrict acquisitions of loans and

investments.

(15) Efforts to achieve the reserve and monetary aggregates

of alternative C are likely to entail an even greater firming of money

market conditions, with the Federal funds rate probably moving well

above 6 per cent by the time of the next meeting. The 3-month bill

rate would likely rise into the 5-3/4--6 per cent area, if not by the

time of the next meeting then by early March when additional cash borrowing

through tax bill offerings may be anticipated. If short-term rates attain

these levels, there may be a rather marked dampening in flows of consumer-

type time and savings deposits, which could eventually call into question

the viability of current Regulation Q ceilings on such deposits.

(16) If the Committee were to opt to restrain growth in

reserves and monetary aggregates with the result that money market

conditions firmed, even-keel considerations would again be a constraint

on the timing of policy actions. Sufficient time has been given for

distribution of the recent long-term bond offering so that it no longer

appears to require special consideration. However, on January 31 the

Treasury will announce terms for refunding $4.8 billion of publicly-held

obligations that mature in mid-February. It is too early to have an

idea as to the nature of the refunding, although it does seem unlikely

at this point that new cash will need to be raised or that the Treasury

will wish to offer another long bond so close to the recent offering.

Thus, a relatively conventional exchange with short- and intermediate-term

options seems most likely.



-10-

(17) However that may be, a significant tightening of the

money market between late January and mid-February seems precluded if the

Committee wishes to adhere to previous even-keel standards. Some slight

upward drift in money market rates would not necessarily be ruled out,

depending on the psychological atmosphere around the refunding, but the

great bulk of any tightening, should it be required, would have to be

accomplished within the next two weeks.

(18) Alternative A indicates more expansive paths for the

reserve and monetary aggregates which are not likely to entail any

significant change in money market conditions from those recently pre-

vailing; this alternative, therefore, has the greatest probability of

minimizing conflicts between even-keel considerations and monetary

objectives. The funds rate under such conditions is likely to be most

frequently in the 5-3/8--5-7/8 per cent area. If the funds rate were to

remain near the upper end of that band, the 3-month bill rate probably

would be within a 5-1/4--5-1/2 per cent range over the next several weeks.

Upward bill rate pressures could be moderated in the near-term, however,

by demands for bills from State and local governments who have just

received their January revenue-sharing distribution. In addition, apart

from additions to the weekly and monthly bill auctions, the next sizable

bill offering is not expected until early March, as noted earlier.



-11-

(19) Long-term interest rates may not rise very much under

alternative A, but would probably show greater upward adjustments, at

least in the short-run, under alternatives B and C. Demands on bond

markets can be expected to be generally moderate this month and next.

The near-term forward calendar of new corporate and municipal issues

is relatively modest in size, although there are indications that the

volume could build up in the spring. Mortgage market demands, though

remaining large in volume, appear to have crested. Pressures on long-

term rates are thus most likely to come from the supply side, as.banks

and other institutional investors find that their inflows of funds are

dropping off or becoming significantly more expensive--conditions most

likely to develop under alternatives B and C. Bank interest in secur-

ities and mortgages is likely to be lessened in any event as business

loan demands continue strong, partly to help businesses finance the

anticipated acceleration in the rate of inventory accumulation.

(20) In addition to prospective credit flows, market psychol-

ogy will have a particularly important bearing in interest rate develop-

ments in the period ahead. The forthcoming budget message, the progress

of peace negotiations, and continuing evaluation of the new wage-price

program are major factors that will affect investor attitudes. Also,

market assessment of the likely course of monetary policy in the wake

of the recent discount rate action will be an important influence.



-12

Proposed directives

(21) Presented below are three alternative formulations for the

operational paragraph of the directive, which might be taken to correspond

to the similarly lettered policy alternatives discussed in the preceding

section. In all three alternatives it is proposed to retain a reference

to Treasury financing because of the regular February refinancing to be

announced on January 31. Retention of the reference to credit market

developments is suggested should the Committee wish to take account of

the possibility of excessive market reaction to further increases in the

funds rate, particularly in connection with alternatives B and C. The

credit market reference could also encompass adverse reactions to the

discount rate increase should they occur.

Alternative A

FORTHCOMING Treasury financing [DEL: operations] and possible credit

market developments, the Committee seeks to achieve bank reserve

Appendix A

REVISIONS IN THE M1 SERIES

The narrow money stock series--M1 has been revised to reflect:

(1) benchmark adjustments for domestic nonmember banks;
(2) benchmark adjustments to incorporate additional

international banking institutions;
(3) the impact of the revised regulation J; and
(4) new seasonal factors.

These revisions will be described below. It should be noted,
however, that the revised M 1 series, as well as revisions in the other

aggregates, will not be released to the public until early February
because final revisions to credit proxy and reserve series are as yet
incomplete. Beginning January 19, data supplied for internal System
purposes only will include the new M1 and M2 series, as well as other
revised series as they are completed. Thus, for approximately two weeks
the Committee will be receiving revised data while public releases will
show the series on the present basis. The revised series will be supplied
to the public in a press release, with detailed technical explanations
provided in the Federal Reserve Bulletin for February.

SEASONAL FACTORS

The seasonal factor revisions, incorporating the effect of 1972

developments, are minor. No changes were made in seasonal factors for
January, March, or any month in the second quarter for the demand deposit
component seasonal factors. The seasonal factors for each month in the
third quarter were raised slightly, reducing the level of the seasonally
adjusted series, and the factors for February and each month in the fourth
quarter were reduced somewhat. Minor changes also occurred in the seasonal
factors for currency. In general, these were raised for the second and
third quarter months and lowered for the first and fourth quarter months.

For 1972 data, the seasonal adjustment revision alone reduces the third
quarter seasonally adjusted annual rate of growt of M1 by 0.2 percentage
points and increases the fourth quarter growth rate by 0.8 percentage
points. In no month are annual rates of growth changed by more than 2.0
percentage points (annual rate) by the new seasonal factors taken alone.



LEVEL ADJUSTMENTS

Other adjustments significantly increase the level of the M1
series back to 1959. The amount of the level adjustment is $300 million
in 1959 and increases to $9.5 billion at the end of 1972. Appendix Chart 1

compares the level of the old and new seasonally adjusted series weekly
for 1971-72. Appendix Table A-1 displays the components of the level

adjustment for three recent dates.

Benchmark revisions for domestic banks. M1 estimates are based
initially on member bank data with estimates made for nonmember banks
based on historical relationships between country member banks and non-

member banks. These nonmember estimates are then revised when call report

data become available. Based on December 1971 and June 1972 call report
information, the past relationship between nonmember and country bank data

(deposits and vault cash) did not hold in the first half of 1972, leading

to an underestimation of M1 growth at nonmember banks over the year ending

in June 1972, and probably in the second half of 1972 as well. As
shown in Appendix Table 1, the level of M1 has been increased by about

$1 billion at the end of 1971 and by $1.9 billion at the end of 1972.

Foreign Banking Institutions. In December 1970, the M1 series
was revised to incorporate the impact of foreign banking institutions
operating in the U.S. This adjustment eliminated the overstatement of
cash items (understatement of M1) associated with the clearings of these
banks and also added their M 1 type balances to the money supply series.
At that time, data for a few New York City institutions were not available.
The new series now incorporates the impact of these institutions on the

M1 series. As shown in Appendix Table A-l, this revision increases the
narrow money stock by about $3 billion in 1972, and by lesser amounts
back to 1959.

Regulation J revisions. Prior to the November 9 revision of
Regulation J, the M1 series had been biased downward by the timing of
bank payment for Federal Reserve cash letters. This downward bias was
eliminated by the revision in Regulation J which reduced cash items and
float, two items deducted from gross demand deposits in the calculation
of M1. Since Regulation J went into effect, the staff has been adjusting
M1 data to remove the effect of the regulatory-induced changes in cash
items and float. The new series uses actual data after November 9 but
reduces cash items and float prior to November 9 to remote a one time
break in M1 associated with the change in Regulation J. This adjustment
has been carried back to 1959.

June, 1972 Call Reports of condition.
2/ Adjustment for overstatement of cash items associated with
clearance of checks for a few New York City foreign banking operations
and the addition of M1-type liabilities for these institutions.
3/ Adjustment for cash items and float reduction resulting from
amended Regulation J. Actual data after November 9, 1972 and
estimated from reserve bank data prior to November 9, 1972.



The Regulation J increase in the level of M1 is estimated to

be about $500 million in December 1959, growing to about $4.5 billion in
1972, as shown in Appendix Table A-1. This adjustment adds an average
about .1 percentage point per year to the growth in M1 since 1959.

ANNUAL RATES OF CHANGE

While the level of M is raised $8 - $9 billion in 1972,
and less for previous years, the combined effect of the level adjustments
and new seasonal factors on annual rates of change are small. Comparison
of rates of change in the old and new series for recent periods is shown

in Appendix Table A-2.

For annual data, the biggest recent changes occur in 1970 and
1971, which are raised by 0.6 and 0.7 percentage points, respectively.
Semi-annual growth rates for 1972 are changed little, but the second half
of 1971 is raised by 1.0 percentage point. In 1972, quarterly growth
rates are lowered slightly in the first and third quarters and raised in
the second and fourth quarters. The fourth quarter of 1971 is raised
significantly.

Changes in the 1972 monthly pattern are shown in the right panel
of Appendix Table A-2. Three months--February, September, and October--
are increased by more than 2 percentage points at an annual rate. Reduction
exceeding 2 percentage points occurred in January, July, August, and December.

Finally, for the December-January period the staff's projected
M1 growth is 11-1/2 per cent (annual rate) on the old basis and 10 per
cent (annual rate) in the new series.
