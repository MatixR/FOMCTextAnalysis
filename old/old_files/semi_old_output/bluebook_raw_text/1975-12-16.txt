Prefatory Note 
 
 
The attached document represents the most complete and accurate version available 
based on original copies culled from the files of the FOMC Secretariat at the Board 
of Governors of the Federal Reserve System.  This electronic document was created 
through a comprehensive digitization process which included identifying the best-
preserved paper copies, scanning those copies,1 and then making the scanned 
versions text-searchable.2   Though a stringent quality assurance process was 
employed, some imperfections may remain. 
 
Please note that some material may have been redacted from this document if that 
material was received on a confidential basis.  Redacted material is indicated by

1  In some cases, original copies needed to be photocopied before being scanned into electronic 
format.  All scanned images were deskewed (to remove the effects of printer- and scanner-introduced 
tilting) and lightly cleaned (to remove dark spots caused by staple holes, hole punches, and other 
blemishes caused after initial printing). 
 
2 A two-step process was used.  An advanced optical character recognition computer program (OCR) 
first created electronic text from the document image.  Where the OCR results were inconclusive, 
staff checked and corrected the text as necessary.  Please note that the numbers and text in charts and

MONETARY AGGREGATES AND
MONEY MARKET CONDITIONS

Recent developments

(1) M1 increased at about a 12 per cent annual rate in November,

but data available for recent weeks suggest that growth in December will

be much slower. For November and December combined, M1 is, therefore,

projected to grow at about a 7 per cent annual rate. Growth in time deposits

other than money market CD's has been somewhat stronger than expected at the

time of the November FOMC meeting, and M2 is projected to increase at about

a 9.7 per cent annual rate over the November-December period, in the upper

part of the Committee's range of tolerance. Net inflows to thrift institu-

tions have been well maintained.

(2) Some of the unexpected strength in "other" time deposits at

banks stems from increases in business savings accounts following the recent

lifting of the regulatory prohibition on business holdings of such deposits.

In the first three weeks after this regulatory change, they rose to about

$530 million at the weekly reporting banks. Since this form of saving probably

appeals mainly to smaller firms, much of the recent growth may well reflect

shifts of funds out of demand deposits.

(3) With growth in M2 consistently in the upper part of its range,

and M1 growth in November large (particularly after taking account of the shift

of corporate deposits from demand to savings accounts), the Desk has continued

to seek reserve conditions consistent with Federal funds trading around 5 per

cent. Member bank borrowing has remained minimal. Despite the stability of the

Federal funds rate, short-term market interest rates have edged higher in

recent weeks. These increases appear to reflect in part some market concern

that the recent strengthening of key monetary aggregates may before long induce

the System to tighten money market conditions. In addition, they may reflect

seasonal corporate dividend and tax date pressures.

(4) The volume of securities going through longer-term markets

has been quite heavy, and longer-term rates have remained at relatively

advanced levels. The Treasury this week announced that it will raise $3

billion of new cash through 2-year and 4-year notes to be auctioned in late

December. Moreover, the volume of new corporate and municipal bond issues has

been large--due in part to heavy foreign financing activity. The enactment

of a Federal assistance program for New York City has helped bring about



-3-

scattered declines in municipal yields. But the market is still affected by

uncertainties with regard to state agencies, longer-run prospects for the

state itself, and legal challenges to the mandated restructuring of New York

City's debt.

(5) The table on the following page shows (in percentage annual

rates of change) selected monetary and financial flows over various time

periods.

Prospective developments

(6) Summarized below for Committee consideration are alternative

operating specifications for the monetary aggregates and the Federal funds

rate for the period between now and the next Committee meeting. All of

the alternatives can be viewed as being consistent with the FOMC's current

longer-run objectives for the aggregates--as indexed by a 5-7½ per cent rate

of growth in M1 from QIII '75 to QIII '76. They do, of course, imply

differing patterns of growth in M 1 over the target period and differing levels

and time paths of interest rates (as shown in appendix table IV).

1/ The 2-month growth rates for M1 and M2 are based on preliminary new
seasonal factors. Appendix table V compares the new and previous factors
for M1 and shows the effect of the change on monthly growth rates. For
the December-January period, the new factors add about 2¼ percentage
points to the growth rate for M1. The revised money supply series

incorporating new seasonal factors will not be published until late
January. By that time benchmark and certain other statistical adjust-
ments will have been completed for M1, weekly seasonals consistent with
the monthly seasonals will have been developed, and figures for reserves
and bank credit will also have been revised. With the exception of the

table in paragraph (6), all tables show data based on the old seasonal

factors. However, the figures in parentheses in the detailed table

on p. 5a reflect the new seasonal factors.

(7) Under alternative B the Federal funds rate range is centered

around the 5¼ per cent level that has been prevailing for several weeks.

The staff believes that in these circumstances M1 would grow in about a

4-6 per cent, annual rate, range and M2 in a 7-9 per cent range. Growth

of M 1 in the December-January period is expected to be constrained by

continuing shifts of corporate funds from demand deposits to savings accounts.

The expected range of M1 growth reflects our assumption that such shifts may

reduce M growth by 1 to 1 percentage points. This assumption is based on an

evaluation of early data on the increase in corporate savings accounts and our

expectation that the pace at which funds are transferred out of demand accounts

will slow.

(8) Assuming little change in money market conditions, the 3-month

bill rate is likely to fluctuate within a relatively narrow range between

now and the next Committee meeting. The rate could drop somewhat as mid-

December dividend and tax date pressures ease, but offsetting upward pressures

are likely to be generated by a continuation of the Treasury's practice of

raising sizable amounts of new cash in the weekly and monthly bill auctions.

Longer-term rates are likely to change little over the period ahead. The

holiday period will provide only a brief respite for the market, since the

prospective volume of new corporate and municipal offerings in January

remains relatively sizable and a large amount of Treasury financing is

anticipated for the first quarter of the year.



-7-

(9) The basic outlook over the longer run for monetary aggregates and

interest rates appears little changed from the previous blue book. Under

alternative B, the Federal funds rate would be expected to begin rising by

around mid-winter and may reach the 7-7½ per cent range by summer, which would

be a shade less than projected last time. Growth in time deposits other than

large CD's is expected to moderate progressively over the first half of next

year. We have assumed that shifts of funds from demand deposits into corporate

savings accounts will become negligible by late winter, but this assumption

is subject to considerable uncertainty because of the novelty of the development.

(10) Although there may be some effort on the part of banks to issue

CD's for year-end window-dressing purposes, banks are not likely to be aggressive

issuers of CD's in the weeks ahead. Loan demands are likely to remain on the

moderate side, and banks should have ample funds from other sources to accommodate

these demands. Moreover, there are no signs that banks are significantly changing

their conservative lending and liability management policies. Thus, bank credit

growth will probably be relatively moderate in the December-January period, and

also in the first half of next year.

(11) Alternative A contemplates a decline in the Federal funds rate

to the mid-point of a 4¼-5¼ per cent range. Given the high rates of growth

in the monetary aggregates in November, such an easing in the money market

would be contrary to current market expectations and might be accompanied by

a sizable near-term decline in short-term rates. On the other hand, many market

participants may take the view that such an easing is only temporary and, to

that extent, declines in market rates would be limited. Under this alternative,

the staff expects that the funds rate would have to begin rising later in the



-8-

winter in order to attain the FOMC's current longer-run monetary objectives

and that the rate would be in the 7½-8 per cent area by summer. This

alternative, therefore, would ultimately tend to exert considerable pressure on

savings inflows at thrift institutions and banks.

(12) Under alternative C, a rise in the funds rate to the mid-point

of the 5 -6 per cent range between now and the next meeting is contemplated.

Such a move would likely be accompanied by increases of to ¾ of a percentage

point in other short-term rates and by smaller upward adjustments in longer-

term rates. Net inflows of consumer-type time and savings deposits at banks

and thrift institutions would be expected to moderate somewhat from their

recent pace over the next few weeks. Later on, however, they would be subject

to less pressure than under alternatives A or B since the early tightening of

money market conditions would tend to limit the extent to which interest

rates would need to rise in the future in order to keep growth in the

monetary aggregates on target, given the staff's GNP projection.



Proposed directive

(13) Shown below is a proposed operational paragraph for

consideration if the Committee wishes to continue formulating its instruc-

tions in terms of desired growth in monetary aggregates over the months

ahead. No alternatives are presented for this formulation, in the expecta-

tion that the reference to desired growth will be taken to apply to the

longer-term targets and that at this meeting the Committee will not

reconsider its present 5 to 7½ per cent target range for M1, with which

all of the short-run operating alternatives discussed in the preceding

sections are consistent.

"Monetary Aggregate" Proposal

To implement this policy, while taking [DEL: more than usual]

account of developments in domestic and international financial

markets, the Committee seeks to achieve bank reserve and money

market conditions consistent with moderate growth in monetary

aggregates over the months ahead.

(14) Should the Committee desire to formulate the directive

in terms of bank reserve and money market conditions, the language needed

would depend on the specific conditions sought. These alternative "money

market" directives intended to correspond to the similarly lettered policy

alternatives are given below.



-10-

Alternative "Money Market" Proposals

Alternative A

To implement this policy, while taking [DEL: more than usual] account

of developments in domestic and international financial markets,

the Committee seeks to achieve SOMEWHAT EASIER bank reserve and money

market conditions OVER THE PERIOD IMMEDIATELY AHEAD, PROVIDED THAT

MONETARY AGGREGATES DO NOT APPEAR TO BE GROWING AT RATES ABOVE THOSE

CURRENTLY EXPECTED [DEL: consistent with moderate growth in monetary

aggregates over the months ahead].

Alternative B

To implement this policy, while taking [DEL: more than usual] account

of developments in domestic and international financial markets,

the Committee seeks to [DEL: achieve] MAINTAIN PREVAILING bank reserve and

money market conditions OVER THE PERIOD IMMEDIATELY AHEAD, PROVIDED

THAT MONETARY AGGREGATES APPEAR TO BE GROWING AT ABOUT THE RATES

CURRENTLY EXPECTED [DEL: consistent with moderate growth in monetary

aggregates over the months ahead].

Alternative C

To implement this policy, while taking [DEL: more than usual] account

of developments in domestic and international financial markets,

the Committee seeks to achieve SOMEWHAT FIRMER bank reserve and

money market conditions OVER THE PERIOD IMMEDIATELY AHEAD, PROVIDED

THAT MONETARY AGGREGATES DO NOT APPEAR TO BE GROWING AT RATES BELOW

THOSE CURRENTLY EXPECTED [DEL: consistent with moderate growth in monetary

growth in monetary aggregates over the months ahead].



-11-

(14) In all four of the alternatives, it is proposed to delete the

words "more than usual" in the phrase, "while taking more than usual account

of developments in domestic and international financial markets," since

action by the Federal Government has somewhat eased New York City's near-

term financial problems.
