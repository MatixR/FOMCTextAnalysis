Prefatory Note 

 
 

The attached document represents the most complete and accurate version 
available based on original copies culled from the files of the FOMC Secretariat at the 
Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System.  This electronic document was 
created through a comprehensive digitization process which included identifying the best-
preserved paper copies, scanning those copies,1 and then making the scanned versions 
text-searchable.2  Though a stringent quality assurance process was employed, some 
imperfections may remain. 
 

Please note that this document may contain occasional gaps in the text.  These 
gaps are the result of a redaction process that removed information obtained on a

1 In some cases, original copies needed to be photocopied before being scanned into electronic format.  All 
scanned images were deskewed (to remove the effects of printer- and scanner-introduced tilting) and lightly 
cleaned (to remove dark spots caused by staple holes, hole punches, and other blemishes caused after initial 
printing). 
2 A two-step process was used.  An advanced optimal character recognition computer program (OCR) first 
created electronic text from the document image.  Where the OCR results were inconclusive, staff checked 
and corrected the text as necessary.   Please note that the numbers and text in charts and tables were not 
reliably recognized by the OCR process and were not checked or corrected by staff.

MONETARY AGGREGATES AND
MONEY MARKET CONDITIONS

Recent developments

(1) Growth of the monetary aggregates accelerated sharply in

February, moving them well above the Committee's December-to-March target

paths. M-1A grew at about a 12 percent annual rate in February, and at a

7¾ percent rate over the first two months of the year. M-2 was further

buoyed by larger than expected growth of money market mutual funds and M-3

by enlarged issuance of large time deposits at commercial banks to finance

a sharp pick-up in bank credit. Despite large MMC sales, outstanding

small denomination deposits at thrifts declined in January and February, and

only issuance of large time deposits by S&Ls (included in M-3) prevented

a contraction of total thrift deposits. In late February and early March,

transactions deposits declined sharply, and growth in M-1A and M-1B for

March is projected to be very low. On that assumption, growth rates in

these aggregates would be about 1 percentage point above the Committee's

targets for the December-March period. Growth in M-2 over that span would

likely be somewhat stronger relative to target.

(2) The seasonally adjusted annual rates of growth in the family

of reserve measures that originally appeared consistent with the monetary



targets adopted by the FOMC for the December to March period at its last

meeting are shown in the first column of the table below. As indicated by

the second column, the original path for total reserves was adjusted down-

ward to allow for reduced member bank demand for excess reserves, larger

than expected growth in nonmember bank deposits and currency, and less than

expected growth in reservable member bank deposits not included in M-1 or M-2.

In addition, the nonborrowed reserve path was reduced still more in an effort

to exert greater restraint on total reserves and money. Thus far in the

quarter, growth in the monetary base and total reserves has been running

above the adjusted target, while growth in nonborrowed reserves has fallen

below target.

(3) With demands for reserves large relative to supply, and with

the increase in the discount rate on February 15, the federal funds rate

moved up from the 13¼ to 13¾ percent range of earlier weeks to the 14 to

15 percent range in the latter part of February. Recognizing that the

adjustments in the reserve paths would likely entail additional pressures on

the money market, the Committee approved an increase in the upper limit of its



federal funds rate constraint from 15 to 16 percent on February 22 and

then to 18 percent on March 7. By early March funds were trading in excess

of 17 percent on some days and averaged 16.45 percent in the most recent

complete statement week. Member bank borrowing rose in the course of

the intermeeting period, reaching an exceptionally higher level of $3.4

billion on average in the statement week ending March 12; in the preceding

three statement weeks borrowing had averaged about $2 1/4 billion.

(4) Interest rates moved up sharply on balance during the inter-

meeting period as inflationary expectations worsened. Continuing the

sharp rise that had begun in January, bond yields rose about to 1 per-

centage points further, and interest rates on home mortgages have jumped

sharply in the past three weeks. Short-term rates, which had not risen

earlier in the year, increased 3 to 4 percentage points over the inter-

meeting period. They began to rise in mid-February as bank reserve positions

tightened and the discount rate was increased. Pressures in short-term

markets were reinforced by bank issuance of CD's to finance strong credit

demands and by large sales of Treasury bills by foreign official institutions

to finance currency support operations. Uncertainties about the timing

and content of the government's anti-inflation program also contributed to

the market's unsettledness.

(5) In recent weeks, the dollar has shown remarkable strength

in the exchange markets.

, the weighted-average value of the dollar has risen by



about 44 percent since the last Committee meeting.1 This strength was

attributable to the steep rise in U.S. interest rates, to anticipations of

a forthcoming anti-inflation package, to a growing appreciation by the

market of the magnitudes of current account deficits in major countries

abroad, and to the acceleration of inflation in other countries.

(6) The table on the next page shows seasonally adjusted annual

rates of change, in percent, for selected monetary and financial flows over

various time periods.

1/

Partial data through late February, however,
indicate that U.S. banking offices have raised only a moderate amount
of funds offshore, perhaps because this would increase their reservable
managed liabilities. This implies that the privately acquired dollars
may have been channeled into increased net borrowing of U.S. nonfinancial
corporations (possibly through their own foreign affiliates) from foreign
banks or foreign commercial credit sources.

Prospective Developments and Short-term Targets

(7) Shown below for Committee consideration are three alternative

targets for the monetary aggregates over the six-month December to June

interval, along with implied growth rates for the February to June period.1/

Also shown are intermeeting federal funds rate ranges. The funds range

currently in effect is shown under alternative B. Because of recent upward

adjustments in the upper limit, the range has become considerably wider

than the 4 point width that had been usual since the October program was

adopted. If the Committee wished to return to a narrower range, the staff

would suggest that a 13 or 14 to 18 percent range would be generally con-

sistent with alternative B under present market circumstances (and similar

adjustments would need to be made to alternatives A and C).

1/ Because March levels of the aggregates are subject to considerable
uncertainty (with firm data available only for the first week of the

month), it did not seem desirable to focus policy for the period ahead

on a second quarter growth rate. The more detailed tables on pages

7 and 8 do, however, show growth rates of the aggregates (including
M-3) on the more usual calendar quarter basis (based on our current

projection for March).

NOTE: The following annual rates of growth in bank credit for the year and for the quarters are expected
under alternative B: year 1980, 7%, QI, 9k; QII, 64; QIII, 7k; QIV, 6%. Only minor variations in
growth rates would be expected under the other alternatives. For the December to June period, bank
credit growth under alternative B would be 9k percent.



(8) Alternative B extends through June the FOMC's previous

target rates of growth of M-1A and M-1B for the December to March period

of 4 and 5 percent annual rates, respectively. Such growth, as shown on

chart 1 on the next page, would also achieve levels of M-1A and M-1B

by June that are on the midpoint paths of the Committee's longer-run

QIV '79 to QIV '80 target ranges for these aggregates. Of course, given

the surge in growth in the aggregates in February, M-1A and M-1B growth would

have to slow considerably in the February-June period--to 3 and 3¾ percent

average annual rates, respectively. With a significant weakening in these

aggregates recently, and with nominal GNP growth projected by the staff

to decelerate in the spring quarter, such average rates of growth might be

consistent with a federal funds rate over the next few weeks not far from

the 16 to 17 percent level that has prevailed recently.1/ Restraints on

use of credit cards and check overdraft facilities in the new anti-inflation

program could tend to increase the demand for money (or more particularly

currency), but probably by no more than a minor amount, if at all, since

a certain amount of spending might be curtailed and some spenders may simply

write more checks on existing demand deposit holdings.

(9) The staff expects that under alternative B M-2 for the

December-June period would grow around 7¾ percent and by 7 percent from

February to June. This is faster than would be implied by a simple extension

of the 6 percent rate targeted for the December to March period. However,

1/ There is as yet no evidence that larger than normal tax refunds--which
began in late February--have measurably affected money growth. As noted
in the last Bluebook, growth rate of M-1A in March and April could be
increased by 1 to 3 percentage points by such refunds, with offsetting
effects in the ensuing three months. Given the continued uncertain
influence of tax refunds on the aggregates, and the lack of evidence
of any positive impact in the limited data thus far, the staff has still
made no special adjustment in the targets presented to the Committee.

-10-

The specified growth for February-June represents a significant slowing

from the February pace, and as shown in chart 2, such growth would place

M-2 in June at the midpoint of its longer-run range.

(10) The slowing of M-2 is largely a reflection of the assumed

lower rate of expansion in M-1A and M-1B. Within the nontransactions

component of M-2, inflows to money market mutual funds are projected to

moderate, but outflows at thrifts of small denomination deposits are expected

to abate. Inflows to money market funds may be restrained more substantially

by actions taken in connection with the government's new anti-inflation

program, but much of the money involved likely would remain in, or be shifted

to, other deposit accounts in M-2, as well as in M-3. Thus, we would expect

only a relatively minor effect on the total of M-2 and M-3 growth from the

new program, though the distribution of growth among components of the

aggregates would be affected.

(11) The specifications of alternative B imply an annual rate of

growth from February to June of the monetary base and of total reserves of

about 7¾ percent and 5¾ percent, at annual rates, respectively. Member

bank borrowings might average around the $2½ billion over the next few

weeks; assuming that they then edge down toward about $1¾ billion by mid-

year, nonborrowed reserves would increase at about a 4¾ percent annual

rate over the February-June period. The level of borrowing and growth of

nonborrowed reserves would, of course, be affected by any changes in bank

attitudes toward the discount window. It is not clear whether the newly

instituted 3 point surcharge over the basic discount rate will tend to

encourage more willing use of the window, at least up to the point where

the surcharge goes into effect, or will encourage banks to be more

conservative for fear that unexpected events may force them to borrow at

the higher rate.



-11-

(12) Business external financing requirements are expected to

remain substantial in the second quarter as capital outlays are projected

to move higher while internal cash flow falls off. It is possible that

some of the financing need may have already been met to the extent that the

recent surge in borrowing at banks reflected anticipation of credit controls.

Even so, there is likely to be some conflict between business borrowing

needs in the near-term and the special credit restraint program. If the

guidelines of that program are followed, they would imply a marked slowing

in loan growth, given the relatively rapid growth that has already occurred

this year. However, if the new program leads to a reduction of inflationary

expectations, the associated drop that is likely to occur in bond yields

may divert some business borrowing to that market. On balance, it seems

likely that bank credit growth will slow in the months ahead from the very

rapid January-February pace, but still may be large enough to require banks

to continue to issue high cost managed liabilities. Thrifts and mortgage

markets too are likely to remain under considerable tension in the months

ahead absent any substantial decline in short-term rates over the near-term--

which seems unlikely given the monetary targets of alternative B.

(13) Alternative C calls for lower money targets than alternative

B. In the February-June period, M-1A would expand at a 2¼ percent annual

rate. This alternative probably would require some further rise in the

federal funds rate over the next few weeks toward the 18 percent area.

Money market rates generally would follow the funds rate upward, but rate

effects in bond markets would tend to be dominated by factors influencing

inflationary expectations. The tightening of money markets that appears

needed under alternative C might be construed by the market as reinforcing

the new anti-inflation program, and this could lead to some easing of bond

market pressures even as short rates rise. Still, earnings pressures on



-12-

financial intermediaries would be intensified, and consumer and mortgage

credit conditions would tighten further. The dollar would likely strengthen

further, even though some additional U.S. monetary restraint would not come as

a great surprise to the market; foreign central bank intervention sales,

however, would likely limit the extent of the rise in the dollar's exchange

value.

(14) As shown in the charts, the aggregate specifications of

alternative C imply that M-1A and M-1B would be below their midpoint paths

by June. Consequently, to achieve the midpoint of the longer-run ranges

for all of 1980, the Committee would have to raise money growth in the

second half of the year. In that period, interest rates are expected to be

under downward pressure in any event in view of the sharp reduction in real

GNP that the staff is projecting. A federal funds rate of around 14 per-

cent would be projected for late 1980 under alternative B, and would be

a bit lower under alternative C.

(15) Alternative C would probably require growth in the monetary

base over the February to June period at about a 7 percent annual rate,

while total reserves would expand at a 5 percent rate. Nonborrowed

reserves may expand at about a ½ percent annual rate, assuming an initial

level of borrowing of around $2¾ billion and a gradual decline beginning

around mid-spring.

(16) Compared to the other alternatives, alternative A involves

a greater increase in money over the four months ending in June, with

M-1A targeted to expand at a 3¾ percent rate over that period. The monetary

base and total reserves might expand at annual rates of 8 and 6 percent,

respectively. As shown in the charts, the more rapid rates of growth of



-13-

aggregates anticipated under alternative A would carry them to levels in

June above their midpoint paths. The somewhat greater reserve supply would

tend to be associated with some downward pressure on money market rates.

The federal funds rate possibly would decline to about the 15 to 15 per-

cent area over the next few weeks, with an associated member bank borrowing

of around $1¾ billion. Nonborrowed reserves would expand at about a 6½

percent annual rate in the February to June period.

(17) The immediate decline in money market rates that could

develop under alternative A might be viewed by the markets as inconsistent

with the new anti-inflation program. Under that interpretation, the

dollar might weaken on foreign exchange markets; in addition, any

tendency of the bond markets to rally would be limited by continued

inflationary expectations. The short-term rate decline under this alterna-

tive over the next few weeks is not likely to be large enough to make any

significant difference for thrift deposit flows, and mortgage markets would

continue taut.



-14-
Directive language

(18) Given below are suggested operational paragraphs for

the directive consistent with the form of the directive adopted at recent

meetings. It calls for expansion of reserve aggregates at a pace consistent

with the desired rates of monetary growth over the first half of 1980, pro-

vided that the federal funds rate on a weekly average basis remains within

a specified range. The specifications adopted at the last meeting, adjusted

for the March 7 increase in the upper limit of the range for the federal

funds rate, are shown in strike-through form.

In the short run, the Committee seeks expansion of reserve

aggregates consistent with growth over the first {DEL: quarter] HALF of

1980 at an annual rate of about [DEL: 4½] ____ percent for M-1A and [DEL: 5] ____

percent for M-1B, provided that in the period before the next

regular meeting the weekly average federal funds rate remains within

a range of [DEL: 11½ to 18] ____ TO ____ percent. The Committee believes

that, consistent with this short-run policy, M-2 [DEL: as newly defined]

should grow at an annual rate of about [DEL: 6½] ____ percent over the

first [DEL: quarter] HALF.

If it appears during the period before the next meeting that the

constraint on the federal funds rate is inconsistent with the

objective for the expansion of reserves, the Manager for Domestic

Operations is promptly to notify the Chairman who will then decide

whether the situation calls for supplementary instructions from the

Committee.
