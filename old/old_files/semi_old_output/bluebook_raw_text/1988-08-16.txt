Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System.  This electronic document was 
created through a comprehensive digitization process which included identifying the best-
preserved paper copies, scanning those copies,1 and then making the scanned versions 
text-searchable.2  Though a stringent quality assurance process was employed, some 
imperfections may remain. 
 

Please note that this document may contain occasional gaps in the text.  These

MONETARY POLICY ALTERNATIVES

Recent Developments

(1) In accordance with the Committee's decision at its meeting in

late June, the allowance for adjustment plus seasonal borrowing was raised

immediately from $550 to $600 million. Actual borrowing, however, averaged

about $1.3 billion in the first complete reserve maintenance period follow-

ing the meeting, reflecting a surge in borrowing over the long July 4 week-

end and some subsequent difficulties in assessing reserve availability and

demand. In the next two reserve maintenance periods, borrowing averaged

close to $600 million.1 Over much of the intermeeting period, federal

funds traded primarily in a range of 7-3/4 to 7-7/8 percent--about 1/4

point over the level at the time of the last Committee meeting and also

above Desk expectations and the level consistent with previous relation-

ships between borrowing and interest rate spreads. Contributing to upward

pressures were market expectations of further near-term restraint on

reserve provision in light of strength in incoming economic data. In addi-

tion, reserve management by banks turned more cautious in the aftermath of

the earlier bulge in borrowing. On August 9, the discount rate was raised

1. Seasonal borrowing has increased to a record level of around $400
million in recent weeks; in addition to the effects of the wider spread
between the federal funds and discount rates, agricultural banks are
reported by Reserve Banks to be experiencing stronger loan demand, though
this is said not to be related substantially to the drought.



2
to 6-1/2 percent. Federal funds, which were trading around 7-3/4 percent

at the time of the increase, have risen to around 8-1/8 percent most

recently.

(2) Other interest rates also have risen substantially over the

intermeeting period. Before the discount rate hike, short-term rates

generally were up 1/4 to 1/2 of a percentage point--including a 1/2 point

increase in the prime rate--somewhat more than the increase in the funds

rate. Bond yields, held down to an extent by the effects of a reduced

supply of long-term issues in several markets, were unchanged to 1/4 point

higher. With some further firming of policy already built into the

structure of interest rates, private short-term market rates rose only

about 1/4 percentage point more following the discount rate increase,

although the prime rate was raised another 1/2 percentage point. Bond

yields also have risen by about 1/4 of a percentage point in recent days

and broad measures of stock prices have fallen around 3 percent. Some of

the initial reaction in capital markets seemed to reflect uncertainty about

the eventual extent of policy firming and concern about the response of

foreign markets and authorities; these were mirrored in the relatively

damped adjustment in Treasury bill rates, which increased only about 15

2. Consistent with incoming data suggesting considerable strength in the
economy and pressures on wages and prices, the borrowing objective was
increased to $700 million on August 8. However, it was returned to $600
million the next day after monetary policy was firmed through the
increase in the discount rate.



basis points. Judging from the behavior of risk premiums and the stock

prices of banking and thrift organizations, the failure of First Republic-

Bank and the deepening thrift crisis appeared to have had little overall

effect on market assessments of the risk of advancing funds to depository

institutions and their holding companies.

(3) Responding in part to the firming of monetary policy and to

better-than-expected U.S. trade figures for May, the dollar's weighted

average exchange value climbed by about 2-1/4 percent over the intermeeting

period, . At its peak

just following the rise in the discount rate, the dollar was nearly 4 per-

cent above late-June levels, but it has eased off a little in recent days.

Some of the strength in the dollar reflected a more general weakness in the

mark, even in the face of Bundesbank action that pushed short-term market

rates up by nearly a full percentage point over the period. Short-term

interest rates in the United Kingdom rose even more, as the Bank of England

moved to restrain further a U.K. economy threatening to overheat. Japanese

short-term rates increased only slightly.

the Desk sold about $3 billion

against marks, all before the discount rate increase, divided equally

between System and Treasury accounts.

3. In the Treasury's mid-quarter refunding, bidding was reasonably good

for 3-year notes on the day of the discount rate increase, but less
robust for the 10-year notes the next day. These issues yielded 8.77 and
9.27 percent, respectively, about 15 to 20 basis points above yield
levels in when-issued trading prior to the discount rate action.

-5-

(4) Money and credit flows in July were affected by the previous

tightening of monetary policy and by some short-term adjustments in assets

and liabilities by banks, their depositors, and borrowers, partly in

anticipation of rising rates. Growth of M2 and M3 slowed last month to 3

and 5-1/2 percent annual rates, respectively, both somewhat less than the

Committee's specifications of 5-1/2 and 7 percent for the June-to-September

period. The weakness in M2 was concentrated in its overnight RP and Euro-

dollar components. Both overnight and term RPs declined last month in

conjunction with declines in commercial bank holdings of Treasury securi-

ties in trading accounts in late June and early July. The drop in over-

night Eurodollars was partly mirrored in a jump in term Eurodollar instru-

ments; banks began issuing term Eurodollars at relatively more attractive

rates, perhaps to lock in funding costs. Reflecting the rise in market

interest rates and opportunity costs since early spring, growth of retail

assets in M2--that is, M2 less demand deposits and overnight RPs and Euro-

dollars--was around 5-1/2 percent, considerably less than in the first few

months of the year. In view of the fairly steep retail deposit yield

curve, expansion of retail instruments was surprisingly tilted in favor of

liquid deposits--especially other checkable deposits--and may have

reflected expectations that time deposit rates would continue to rise. M3

slowed only moderately in July despite a sharp deceleration in bank credit;



issuance of managed liabilities in this aggregate was buoyed by substitu-

tions for other sources of funds. Through July, M2 and M3 expanded at

6-1/2 and 6-3/4 percent annual rates from their fourth-quarter bases, leav-

ing them a little above the midpoints of their annual ranges.

(5) M1 expanded at a 9 percent annual rate in July, boosted by the

strong growth in other checkable deposits. Since the fourth quarter of

1987, M1 has increased at a 5-3/4 percent annual rate. The monetary base

accelerated to a 10-1/2 percent annual rate in July, bringing growth for

the year to 8-1/4 percent. Strength in the base mainly reflected a surge

in total reserves, to a 12 percent rate, partly as excess reserves

rebounded.

(6) Borrowing by domestic nonfinancial sectors moderated in July,

especially in bond markets, where offerings by state and local governments

and corporations fell substantially following a surge in June. Business

borrowing from commercial banks slowed only a bit last month, but commer-

cial paper of nonfinancial business dropped off sharply. Judging from bank

data, consumer borrowing also appears to have slowed last month. Federal

borrowing was seasonally light, as the Treasury funded operations in part

by a sizable drop in its cash balance; however, the Treasury announced

financing plans consistent with a large increase in borrowing in coming

months. From the fourth quarter of 1987, domestic nonfinancial debt is

estimated to have expanded through July at an 8-1/4 percent rate, below the

midpoint of its 7 to 11 percent annual range.



Policy Alternatives

(7) Two policy alternatives are presented below. Alternative B

maintains the current $600 million assumption for adjustment plus seasonal

borrowing and alternative C increases intended borrowing to $800 million.

Under alternative B, a federal funds rate of around 8 percent would be

consistent with the average relationship that prevailed over the first half

of this year between borrowing and the funds rate-discount rate spread.

However, expectations of a further tightening of policy could persist under

alternative B, causing funds to trade somewhat higher, in an 8 to 8-1/4

percent range. Federal funds likely would trade between 8-1/2 and 8-3/4

percent under alternative C, perhaps more toward the lower end of this

range if the additional firming acted to dispel expectations of still

further near-term policy moves.

(8) The table below gives expected June-to-September growth rates

of the monetary aggregates under the two alternatives, as well as the

implied growth rates from July to September. Also shown are the associated

federal funds rate ranges that trigger Committee consultation; both are

higher than the current 5 to 9 percent range, to center them more around

the expected level of federal funds trading. (More detailed data are shown

on the table and charts on the following pages.) As discussed below, under

either alternative, growth in M2 and M3 is projected to fall short of the

rates specified for June to September at the last FOMC meeting, mainly

reflecting the effects of the rise in interest rates over the last six

weeks, which was not assumed in constructing the money paths at the last



-8-

meeting, and the unexpected weakness in bank credit along with associated

funding needs. Both alternatives would leave M2 near the midpoint of its

long-run range by September, and M3 a little above the midpoint of its

range.

(9) Financial markets in recent days have largely built in a

federal funds rate of around 8-1/8 percent, although some further adjust-

ments may occur under alternative B. For example, the 3-month Treasury

bill rate might edge higher to around 7-1/8 percent as some of the remain-

ing uncertainties about any further responses of capital markets in the

U.S. and financial markets and policies abroad are resolved. Bond yields

should remain around current levels, especially if the dollar, as expected,

continues fairly firm. The dollar could come under downward pressure,

however, and bond yields resume their rise, if incoming data suggested that

the pace of international adjustment was proceeding considerably less

-10-

rapidly than previous trade reports had suggested, other data were seen as

portending greater odds of inflation pressures, or foreign monetary author-

ities tightened aggressively. In any case, the long-term Treasury bond

yield would tend to move higher, perhaps by 10 to 20 basis points, if the

Treasury receives authority to issue more of such securities.

(10) M2 under alternative B is expected to increase at a 3-3/4

percent pace over the last two months of the quarter, slightly higher than

in July. This speedup is associated with a strengthening in overnight RPs

and Eurodollars, already evident in recent weekly data, in part as banks

rebuild their government security positions. The retail component of M2

should decelerate in response to wider opportunity costs. Within M2,

liquid household deposits, which have begun to soften in early August, are

expected to be relatively weak. Small time deposit growth should quicken

as the public takes advantage of the more attractive returns offered on

fixed-maturity accounts, but not by enough to offset the moderation in

liquid deposits. Slower OCD growth, along with weakness in demand deposits

as compensating balance requirements are scaled back, should damp M1

expansion over the next two months to an average of just under 4 percent.

(11) On a quarterly average basis, M2 growth in the third quarter

would be only 4 percent, implying a 3 percent rate of increase in its

velocity given the staff's income projection, after a 1 percent rate of

decline in the first half of the year. This rebound in velocity largely

reflects the turnaround in market interest rates and opportunity costs

since early spring. Even if short-term rates remain near current levels,



-11-

velocity still would be expected to rise further in the fourth quarter.

Under these circumstances, M2 would be likely to continue growing at around

its third-quarter pace, and to end the year near, though perhaps a bit

below, the midpoint of its annual range. While the drought is reducing

second-half growth in nominal GNP in the staff forecast, it is not expected

to affect appreciably the relationship of money demand to GNP and interest

rates. Nonetheless, this relationship is more uncertain than usual, given

the effects of the drought in boosting the ratio of final sales to current

income; on the one hand, for a given level of income, higher nominal pur-

chases would tend to increase transactions demands for money and depress

income velocity; on the other, in order to finance these purchases saving

flows and associated acquisitions of financial assets, including those in

the monetary aggregates, would be reduced, tending to raise income

velocity.

(12) Under alternative B, average M3 growth over August and

September is projected to stay at its 5-1/2 percent July pace, despite a

pickup in bank and thrift credit. Outflows from institution-only money

funds are expected to follow the recent rise in market rates, and inflows

to Treasury deposits will be holding down needs for managed liabilities.

With credit at depository institutions projected to continue in the fourth

quarter at around the rates of August and September, M3 could grow at close

to a 6 percent rate over the balance of the year, bringing its growth for

the year to around 6-1/2 percent. The debt of domestic nonfinancial sec-

tors is projected to grow at around an 8 percent annual rate over the



-12-

remainder of the year, placing it a little below the midpoint of its moni-

toring range by year-end.

(13) The tightening of reserve positions under alternative C

immediately following the discount rate hike would be somewhat surprising

to market participants and the associated 1/2 percentage point increase in

the funds rate probably would show through nearly fully in private money

market rates. Nominal bond yields probably would rise by less. This

action might allay market concerns about future inflation, implying that

the rise in nominal interest rates would reflect at least as large an

increase in real rates. The higher real rates would boost the dollar on

foreign exchange markets, at least for a time, and the greater foreign

demand for dollar assets could cushion somewhat the effects on bond and

stock prices.

(14) With the higher interest rates of alternative C, M2 is pro-

jected to record only 3 percent growth over August and September. The

upward movement of rates would slow M2 even further in the fourth quarter,

moving this aggregate appreciably below the midpoint of its annual growth

range. Growth of M3, by contrast, would probably not be damped enough

under alternative C to move below its midpoint, even by year-end. Long-

term debt issuance by businesses likely would be more restrained under

alternative C, shifting some business credit demands to banks, despite a

probable further increase in the prime rate.



-13-

Directive language

(15) Draft language for the operational paragraph, with the usual

alternatives for varying degrees of reserve pressure, is presented below.

The draft language on possible intermeeting adjustments also has the usual

options for symmetry and asymmetry; in the ordering of the factors affect-

ing such adjustments, it retains the implicit emphasis on resisting infla-

tionary pressures adopted at the June meeting.

OPERATIONAL PARAGRAPH

In the implementation of policy for the immediate future,

the Committee seeks to DECREASE SLIGHTLY (SOMEWHAT)/MAIN-

TAIN/increase slightly (SOMEWHAT) the existing degree of

pressure on reserve positions. Taking account of indications

of inflationary pressures, the strength of the business

expansion, developments in foreign exchange and domestic

financial markets, and the behavior of the monetary aggregates,

somewhat (SLIGHTLY) greater reserve restraint would (MIGHT), or

slightly (SOMEWHAT) lesser reserve restraint might (WOULD), be

acceptable in the intermeeting period. The contemplated

reserve conditions are expected to be consistent with growth in

M2 and M3 over the period from June through September at annual

rates of about ____ AND ____ [DEL: 5-1/2-and-7] percent, respectively.

The Chairman may call for Committee consultation if it appears

to the Manager for Domestic Operations that reserve conditions



-14-

during the period before the next meeting are likely to be

associated with a federal funds rate persistently outside a

range of ____ TO ____ [DEL: 5-to-9] percent.
