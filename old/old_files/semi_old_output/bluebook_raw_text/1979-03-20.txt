Prefatory Note 

 
 

The attached document represents the most complete and accurate version 
available based on original copies culled from the files of the FOMC Secretariat at the 
Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System.  This electronic document was 
created through a comprehensive digitization process which included identifying the best-
preserved paper copies, scanning those copies,1 and then making the scanned versions 
text-searchable.2  Though a stringent quality assurance process was employed, some 
imperfections may remain. 
 

Please note that this document may contain occasional gaps in the text.  These 
gaps are the result of a redaction process that removed information obtained on a

1 In some cases, original copies needed to be photocopied before being scanned into electronic format.  All 
scanned images were deskewed (to remove the effects of printer- and scanner-introduced tilting) and lightly 
cleaned (to remove dark spots caused by staple holes, hole punches, and other blemishes caused after initial 
printing). 
2 A two-step process was used.  An advanced optimal character recognition computer program (OCR) first 
created electronic text from the document image.  Where the OCR results were inconclusive, staff checked

Recent developments

(1) M-1 declined further in February, at a 3¾ per cent annual

rate. Data for early March suggest a resumption of M-1 growth,

but for the February-March period growth is still projected at only a 1 per

cent annual rate, 2 percentage points below the low end of the range set by

the FOMC. Shifts of transactions balances to Automatic Transfer Service (ATS)

savings accounts and NOW accounts in New Yorkare estimated to be reducing

M-1 growth by about 2¼ percentage points during February and March, about

one percentage point less than the effect in each of the first three

months after the introduction of these accounts. After allowing for

this impact, M-1 continues to be much weaker than would be expected on

the basis of the continued rapid expansion of nominal GNP and the usual

lagged effect of higher interest rates. The persistence of this weakness

since last fall and collateral evidence of very sharp increases inclose

substitutes for money, such as money market mutual funds and repurchase

agreements, suggest that a downward adjustment in the public's demand

for money relative to income may be under way--similar to the adjustment

that took place in 1975-76 following the high interest rate levels reached

in 1974.

(2) M-2 increased at a 2 per cent annual rate in February--

following its January decline--and is projected to grow at a 3¾ per

cent annual rate over February and March, also below the lower end of its

range. Despite the continued growth of ATS accounts, savings deposits

dropped sharply further in February. Money Market Certificates (MMCs),

on the other hand, continued to expand at a rapid pace, and growth in

the large time deposits included in M-2 strengthened. Deposits at savings

and loan associations and mutual savings banks expanded in February at

about a 9 per cent annual rate, roughly the same pace as recorded in each

of the preceding three months, as large sales of MMCs continued to offset

outflows from other account categories.

(3) Following a weak advance in December, commercial bank

credit in January-February expanded at about a 12½ per cent

annual rate, with business loan growth unusually strong. Banks financed

the expansion of earning assets during the two months in part by issuing

nearly $8 billion of large-denomination time deposits--only some of which

are included in M-2. Moreover, funds obtained from nondeposit sources



expanded about $8 billion--mainly Federal funds and RP's with nonbank

customers. Another estimated $5 billion of bank credit was financed from

foreign branch repayments of advances previously extended by domestic

head offices. Foreign branches obtained a portion of the funds for these

repayments from increased Eurodollar deposits of U.S. residents and perhaps

others as confidence in the stability of the dollar on exchange markets

increased and the relatively high Eurodollar interest rates became

attractive to investors active in international money markets.

(4) The Trading Desk has continued to maintain a Federal

funds rate of 10 per cent or a bit higher since the February FOMC meeting.

On March 2, as incoming data suggested that growth in both M-1 and M-2

over February-March would likely be at rates below the Committee's ranges,

the FOMC held a telephone meeting to determine whether supplementary

instructions were required. In light of contradictory evidence on under-

lying trends in the economy following the economy's strong performance

in the fourth quarter of 1978, the FOMC decided that the funds rate

objective should remain unchanged.

(5) Nonborrowed reserves are expected to decline at about an

8¼ per cent annual rate over the February-March period, as a sharp decrease

in February is projected to be only partly offset by modest growth in

March. This contraction reflects mainly the decline of demand deposits

from mid-January through late February. As in January, member bank

borrowing at the discount window averaged about $1 billion in February,

and is expected to continue at close to this level in March. Thus, the

growth in total reserves over February and March is expected to be

similar to that for nonborrowed reserves. Given the decline in total

reserves over February-March, the monetary base is expected to expand



at only a 3 3/4 per cent annual rate, even though the currency component is

projected to grow at a 9 3/4 per cent annual rate over the period.

(6) Short-term interest rates have generally risen about 5 to

25 basis points and bond yields about 10 to 20 basis points since the

February FOMC meeting. With economic activity continuing to expand

and the rise in prices accelerating, some market participants appear

to have concluded that the probability of a further tightening in

monetary policy over the near-term has increased, despite the weak

performance of the aggregates. Nonetheless, most short-term rates

remain below levels reached around the turn of the year. Rates on

shorter-dated Treasury bills provide the main exception to this pattern,

as they have moved up to their highest level of the current expansion,

partly in response to sizable bill sales by foreign official institutions

and Treasury issuance of cash management bills. Treasury and corporate

bond yields also reached new highs for the current expansion during the

intermeeting period. Rates on primary mortgages have remained essentially

unchanged since year end.

(7) The dollar has been quite firm in the exchange markets

since the last FOMC meeting.

the U.S. has sold large amount of dollars to

acquire marks and Swiss francs to repay swap debt. In addition, the Desk

has added modestly to foreign currency balances, particularly yen. From

February 6 to March 16 the System purchased about $1 billion equivalent of

foreign currencies and the Treasury about $750 million equivalent.

Prospective developments

(9) Shown below for Committee consideration are three alternative

specifications for the monetary aggregates and the Federal funds rate for

the March-April period. Alternative B calls for no near-term change in

the Federal funds rate, while alternatives A and C, respectively, would ease

and increase restraint in coming weeks. (More detailed and longer-term

data are contained in the tables on pp. 8 and 9.)

(10) The table on page 10 shows the growth rates for the

aggregates that would be required to reach levels in April and June

implied by the longer-run ranges adopted by the FOMC in February. To

reach levels in April that are on the midpoint paths of the longer-run QIV '78

to QIV '79 ranges, M-1 would have to expand at about a 12 per cent annual rate

from February and M-2 at a 14 per cent annual rate, as shown in the middle

column of the table. Growth for M-1 would have to be about 3¾ percentage points

slower or faster to reach by April the lower or upper ends, respectively,

of the longer-run ranges. M-1 would have to expand at a 7-1/2 per cent

annual rate and M-2 at over a 10 per cent annual rate to achieve mid-

points paths by June.

(11) The staff now expects that M-1 will decline at about

a 2 per cent annual rate in the first quarter, despite projected growth of

nominal GNP at an annual rate of more than 12 per cent. Thus, a sub-



-11-

stantial increase in V-1, at about a 14 per cent annual rate,

is implied for the current quarter, as shown in Appendix II. About

3 percentage points of this increase can be explained by shifts of demand

deposits to ATS and NOW accounts, and another few percentage points by the

usual lagged effects of higher interest rates on money demand. But there

is also a large unexplained residual, and, as noted in paragraph (1), it

appears to the staff that this residual may to a great extent reflect a

downward shift in money demand relative to income.

(12) The strength and duration of such a shift in money demand

is most difficult to estimate while it is in process. The downward shift

that began in late 1974 seems to have lasted for a little over two years,

and may have reduced M-1 growth by as much as 5 percentage points at an

annual rate in the early part of the period and 3 percentage points later

(based on experience with the money demand equation in the Board's quarterly

econometric model). With the public having economized on cash balances

to such a great extent only a few years ago, we are projecting that the

present shift may not be as large nor last as long. Thus, we have--again--

projected a resumption of M-1 growth for the policy period immediately

ahead.

(13) Under alternative B, with the funds rate remaining un-

changed from the currently prevailing level of 10 per cent or a little

higher, given the staff's GNP projection, we expect M-1 to increase

over the March-April period in a range centered on a 4 to 9 per cent

annual rate range. With growth at the midpoint of this range, the level

of M-l in April would be below the low end of the path implied by the

Committee's current longer-run range. Growth at the 9 per cent upper end



-12-

of the alternative B short-run range, would bring M-1 to a level in

April just above the low end of the Committee's longer-run range, as

shown in the chart on the next page.

(14) Under alternative B, M-2 is expected to expand in a 3 to

7 per cent annual rate range in March-April, considerably above its

recent rate of growth. Most of the acceleration reflects the projected

strengthening of M-1, but the interest-bearing component of M-2 is

expected to rise a little faster than it has, on average, over the past

few months. Commercial banks can be expected to benefit to some extent

from the elimination of the rate ceiling differential on MMCs, effective

mid-March, and the unusually rapid outflow of savings deposits of recent

months is expected to diminish. However, as shown in the chart on the

following page, even growth in M-2 at the upper end of the alternative B

range would leave the level of this aggregate in April below the lower end

of the path implied by the Committee's longer-run range.

(15) It is estimated that the mid-March regulatory changes that

reduced the effective interest rates on MMCs offered by thrifts by about

50 basis points could slow their total deposit inflows by roughly 2

percentage points, at an annual rate. Thrifts are thus likely to have to

reduce their liquidity and borrow more from the FHLBanks and other sources

to finance mortgage lending. They may also limit their new commitment

activity further over the near-term as they reevaluate their prospective

deposit inflows. Such a slowing of thrift deposit flows suggests that

the level of M-3 in April will remain below the lower limit of the path

traced by its longer-run growth rate range.

(16) If, as projected, the monetary aggregates strengthen in

March-April, market expectations of a near-term tightening of monetary

policy may themselves lead to some upward pressures on short-term interest

rates. In addition, the Treasury market may have to absorb further bill

sales by foreign accounts, and the Treasury may have to offer a sizable

amount of cash management bills to cover cash drains prior to the mid-

April tax date. Rate pressures could be intensified if banks increase

the pace of their CD offerings, which they might well do if bank

credit demands remain strong, availability of corporate RP money declines

as the April tax date approaches, or the return flow of funds from their

branches abroad diminishes. Any tendency for short-term rates to rise,

however, would be blunted by stability of the funds rate at near current

levels, as contemplated under alternative B. The dollar may well continue

to trade around current levels in the exchange markets over the next few

weeks, accompanied by continuation of some central bank net sales of

dollars.

(17) Under alternative B, bond yields can be expected to fluctuate

in a fairly narrow range. The volume of oncoming supplies in the municipal

market is likely to rise from the recent pace, but the corporate new

issue calendar remains quite modest. Moreover, the Treasury is entering

a period of seasonally light coupon financing activity. It is expected

to raise about $2 billion of new money in early April through sale of a

15-year bond (or perhaps a 5-year note), but thereafter it is expected

to borrow only about $1 billion of additional new money in the coupon

market until June. While there appears to be little reason to expect any

significant rise in bond market rates under alternative B, the projected

slowing of deposit flows at thrift institutions suggests that primary

mortgage yields may edge higher in coming weeks.



-15-

(18) Under alternative C, the Federal funds rate would rise

to the midpoint of a 10-1/4 to 11 per cent range. Growth in M-1 and

M-2 would likely be in annual rate ranges of 3-1/2 to 8-1/2 per cent

and 3 to 7 per cent, respectively. A tightening action at this time,

while widely discussed by financial market participants in recent weeks,

does not appear to have been fully discounted, and thus market interest

rates would be expected to move up rather significantly in both long-

and short-term markets, with the increases greatest in the short-term

area.

(19) A firming policy action at this time could lead to a

further strengthening of the dollar. This would probably be reflected

mainly in larger central bank net sales of dollars and would also pro-

vide greater opportunities to reduce outstanding Federal Reserve swap

debt. Such developments would, in domestic markets, tend to raise

shorter-dated Treasury bill rates further relative to other short-term

interest rates and, if foreign official institutions continued to liquidate

their holdings of nonmarketable Treasury issues, increase Treasury borrow-

ing in domestic markets.

(20) Alternative A involves a decline in the funds rate over the

intermeeting period to the midpoint of a 9-1/4 to 10 per cent range.

Market rates would likely respond initially to this action by declining

from current levels. Thereafter, however, if the monetary aggregates

continue to rise as projected, and incoming data confirm the staff's

economic forecast, the decline of interest rates might begin to be

reversed. A decline in the funds rate would probably induce some downward

pressure on the international exchange value of the dollar.



-16-

(21) Over the QIV '78-QIV '79 period as a whole, the staff

still expects little net change in the Federal funds rate, given M-1

growth a shade above the middle of the Committee's 1½ to 4½ per cent

1/
range.- The funds rate might drift upward between now and mid-year

under alternative B and would, of course, more surely rise under

alternative C. But interest rates might tend to decline somewhat

in the latter half of the year, especially under alternative C, as the

rate of growth in nominal GNP decelerates further. Under alternative A,

however, we would expect interest rates to rise later in the year to

offset the stimulative effect on the aggregates of the easing in market

conditions assumed for the weeks ahead if M-1 growth over the year is to

be near the middle of the 1½ to 4½ per cent range. The projected

interest rate paths are shown in appendix I. All paths assume a down-

ward shift in money demand (in addition to ATS effects) on the order of

2 to 2½ percentage points for the year.

1/ Assuming, on the basis of recent evidence, that ATS shifts reduce M-1

growth by a little less than 3 percentage points.

Directive language

(22) Given below are suggested operational paragraphs

for the directive in the customary form. Alternative language consistent

with the short-run specifications of the alternatives discussed in the

preceding section is shown for the Committee's objective for the Federal

funds rate early in the period. At a later point, alternative language

is also provided for placing main emphasis either on monetary aggregates

or on money market conditions. The language and specifications adopted

last month are shown in strike-through form.

In the short run, the Committee seeks to achieve bank reserve

and money market conditions that are broadly consistent with the

longer-run ranges for monetary aggregates cited above, while

giving due regard to the program for supporting the foreign

exchange value of the dollar and to developing conditions in

domestic financial markets. Early in the period before the next

regular meeting, System open market operations are to be directed

at [DEL: maintaining the] ATTAINING A weekly average Federal funds rate

(A) SLIGHTLY BELOW THE CURRENT LEVEL.
(B) at about the current level.
(C) SLIGHTLY ABOVE THE CURRENT LEVEL.

[DEL: provided that over the February-March period the annual rates of

growth of M-1 and M-2, given approxiimately equal weight, appear

to be within ranges of 3 to 7 per cent and 5 to 9 per cent,

respectively. If growth of M-1 and M-2 for the 2 month period

appears to be outside the indicated limits, the Manager will

promptlly notify the Chairman, who will then consult with the

Commmittee to determine whether the situation calls for

supplementary instructions.]

NOTE: Weekly data for columns 1, 2, 3, 6, and 7 are statement week averages of daily data. Weekly data in column 4 are average rates set in the auctions of 6-month
bills that will be issued on the Thursday following the end of the statement week. Data in column 5 are 1-day Wednesday quotes. For columns 8 through 11, the weekly
date is the mid-point of the calendar week over which data are averaged. Columns 12 and 13 are 1-day quotes for Friday and Thursday, respectively, following the end
of the statement week. Column 14 is an average of contract interest rates on commitments for conventional first mortgages with 80per cent loan-to-value ratios made
by a sample of insured savings and loan associations on the Friday following the end of the statement week. Column 15 gives FNMA auction data for Monday preceding
the end of the statement week. Column 16 is a 1-day quote for Monday preceding the end of the statement week. The FMMA auction yield is the average yield in bi-
weekly auction for short-term forward commitments for Government underwritten mortgages. GNMA ields are average net yields to investors on mortgage-backed securi-
ties for immediate delivery, assuming prepayment in 12 years on pools of 30-year FHA/VA mortgages carrying the coupon rate -50 basis points below the current FHA/VA
ceiling.

NOTE: Government security dealer trading positions are on a commitment basis. Trading positions, which exclude Treasury securities financed by
repurchase agreements maturing in 16 days or more, are indicators of dealer holdings available for sale over the near-term. Underwriting syndi-
cate positions consist of issues still in syndicate, excluding trading positions. The basic reserve defilit is excess reserves less borrowing at
Federal Reserve less net Federal funds purchases. Weekly data are daily averages for statement weeks, except for corporate and municipal issues
in syndicate which are Friday figures.

* Strictly confidential.
** Monthly averages for excess reserves and borrowings are weighted averages of statement week figures.
