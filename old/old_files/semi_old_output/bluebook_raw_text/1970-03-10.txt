MONEY MARKET AND RESERVE RELATIONSHIPS

Recent developments

(1) Preliminary estimates indicate that the adjusted bank

credit proxy for February declined in the magnitude projected at the

time of the last Committee meeting, but that estimated changes in the

deposit components which make up the proxy differed substantially from

projections. Private demand deposits declined much more steeply, on

average, than anticipated, and contributed to a commensurately larger

than projected drop in the money supply; whereas time deposits, instead

of continuing to decline sharply as expected, showed virtually no decline

at all. The table shows how projections of changes in these variables

for February were revised as the inter-meeting period progressed.

(2) Over the same interval, the projected March increases in

these aggregates were strengthened, mainly for time deposits, partly in

recognition of the change in policy that was voted. The March projection

for the money supply, though raised somewhat in the month of February,

did not become strong enough to achieve the previous bluebook money

supply projection for the quarter. Revised projections of the adjusted

credit proxy for the quarter, however, did strengthen relative to the

previous bluebook.

(3) While the staff had expected some gradual improvement

in time deposit performance under the less restrictive alternative a opted

by the Committee, the improvement developed more rapidly than projected

partly because of an earlier and larger decline in bill rates than

anticipated. Much of the improved performance of time deposits was

attributable to consumer-type deposits at banks outside major money

centers. In addition, the attrition of domestic large negotiable CD's

came to a halt in early February, and inflows of foreign official funds

into time deposits were larger than expected.

(4) After the last Committee meeting, bill rates declined

a further 45 to 60 basis points, bringing the total decline from

year-end peaks to the neighborhood of 125 basis points. The 3-month

bill was most recently quoted at 6.85 per cent, and the 1 year bill at

6.55 per cent (which makes long CD's competitive with this bill, though

not with other money market instruments). The decline in bill rates was



-3-

part of a general downward move in interest rates in both short- and

long-term securities markets and appears to have reflected mainly

changing investor attitudes generated by weakening business indicators

and expectations of an easing in monetary policy.

(5) While Treasury bill rates dropped sharply in the first

week after the last Committee meeting, the average effective rate on

Federal funds remained in the 9--9-1/2 per cent range of the previous

four weeks. Subsequently, however, as bill rates started to bottom out,

the Federal funds rate dropped by about a percentage point and averaged

between 8 and 8-1/2 per cent in the past two statement weeks, with a

range of trading generally between 7-1/2 and 9 per cent in the week just

past. Dealer financing costs at New York banks have also declined

recently, with the average in the latest statement week dropping to just

below 9 per cent. Net borrowed reserves averaged $900 million in the

two statement weeks ended February 25, but they declined sharply to

$694 million in the most recent statement week ending March 4. Similarly,

member bank borrowings, which had averaged about $1.1 billion in

February, dropped to $833 million in the statement week just past.

Prospective developments

(7) If the Committee wishes to continue on the growth path

of monetary aggregates (taken together),and associated money market

conditions, that are implicit in the policy stance adopted at the

last meeting, it may wish to consider the following second paragraph

for the directive (alternative A):

To implement this policy, while taking account of [DEL: the

current Treasury refundin possibble bank regulatory changes

and] the Committee's desire to see moderate growth in money and

bank credit over the months ahead, System open market operations

until the next meeting of the Committee shall be conducted with

a view to MAINTAINING THE SOMEWHAT LESS [DEL: moving gradually toward

somewhat less] firm conditions THAT HAVE BEEN ATTAINED in the

money market; provided, however, that operations shall be

modified promptly to resist any tendency for money and bank credit

to deviate significantly from a moderate growth pattern.

(8) Less restraint in the money markets developed gradually

over the past few weeks, and less firm money market conditions may now

be taken to encompass a Federal Funds rate generally averaging in

an 8--8-1/2 per cent range, net borrowed reserves generally in a

$650-$850 million range, and member bank borrowings averaging

$800-$900 million. If money market conditions are held quite close



-6-

to those prevailing in the statement week just past, the 3-month

bill rate might be expected to move downward within a 6-5/8--7 per

cent range as the market's expectations of somewhat less restraint

in money market conditions appear to be confirmed. It is quite possible

that the bill rate could drop below the bottom of this range if market

expectations of more easing develop, or if behavior of the monetary

aggregates indicates to the Account Manager that he should shade money

market conditions toward the lower end of the specifications (for example,

having a Federal funds rate most frequently at 8 per cent or a little

below).

(9) The Treasury will need to raise about $1-3/4 billion of

new cash by late March or early April, in addition to the already

announced ongoing increments to regular weekly and monthly bill auctions.

It appears likely that additional bills will be offered, possibly for

payment in early April. But there is some possibility the Treasury may

raise the cash in the coupon area (in which case the announcement would

come within the next few days so as to obtain payment before the start of

the quarterly grace period at thrift institutions). A coupon issue for

cash could well attract speculative interest in the current market environ-

ment. But the offering is small enough in any event so as to minimize

the need for "even keel".

(10) Any modest additional bill offering seems unlikely to

offset the expected downward tendency in bill rates. Not only may



-7-

monetary policy and signs of economic weakness work toward lower bill

rates, but there is also some tendency for bill rates to drop seasonally

in early spring, reflecting retirement of tax bills (amounting to $1.8

billion in March and $4.8 billion in April). As bill rates drift down,

it is likely that private short-term rates (such as on commercial paper,

finance company paper, and bankers' acceptances) will move down further.

In recent weeks declines in private short-term rates have lagged

substantially behind the drop in bill rates and the marked widening in

these rate spreads may not be sustainable, although continuing sales of

bank-related paper could tend to moderate declines in short-term rates

generally. Long-term interest rates, too, may move down further,

reflecting business news and the expected easing in short-term markets,

although offerings in corporate, municipal, and Federal agency markets

are likely to remain large. However, all these markets are susceptible

to some technical upward readjustment in yields, given the extent and

rapidity of the recent rate declines.

(11) In view of the more favorable relationship between

Regulation Q ceilings and short-term market rates that is posited above,

and taking account of the recent upward trend in time deposits, the staff

expects a sizable rebound in time deposits during March and April. In

March such deposits may rise in a 10-13 per cent annual rate, range, even

assuming foreign time deposits grow a little more slowly on average

than in February. The growth rate might be somewhat larger in April,



-8-

as banks become more successful in attracting back large negotiable CD

funds at declining short-term market interest rates, although it is most

difficult to evaluate how aggressive banks will be in the CD market

relative to the commercial paper and Euro-dollar markets.

(12) The money supply, which has varied sharply in recent

months, seems likely to expand in a 4-7 per cent annual rate range on

average in March. The money supply, while dropping sharply on average

from January to February, did grow over the past few weeks and in early

March was above its February average. Little net change from the

current level would be anticipated over the balance of March, on the

assumption that transactions demands for cash will remain relatively

weak, However, in the last few days of March a temporary bulge is likely

to develop, reflecting in part a temporary reduction in cash items

stemming from the changed pattern of foreign transactions that could be

associated with the 4-day Easter holiday abroad. In April, a slower

growth, on average, in the money supply is anticipated, unless economic

activity should turn out to be stronger or interest rates significantly

lower than projected.

(13) The adjusted bank credit proxy in March may grow in a

8-11 per cent annual rate range, due partly to a rise in Government

deposits stemming from Treasury cash financing, but in April growth in

the adjusted proxy is expected to drop to a 5-8 per cent range as the

rise in private demand deposits diminishes and U.S. Government deposits



-9-

decline some. These projections allow for continued growth in commercial

paper at about $100 million per week and assume no change in Euro-dollar

takings from current levels.

(14) The table below summarizes expected first quarter annual

rates of increase for key monetary variables. Second quarter projections

are also shown, assuming the money market conditions of paragraph (8),

but with the expectation that short-term rates will be dropping further,

partly for seasonal reasons, in late spring. The projections also

assume that the sharp rise anticipated for time deposits will be partly

offset by further repayment of Euro-dollars and/or declining bank

interest in selling commercial paper, and that a sizable drop in

seasonally adjusted U.S. Government deposits from the March average

to the June average will provide a temporary fillip to the money

supply. It should be recognized, of course, that the projections are

subject to a considerable range of estimating error, and that they

depend importantly on realization of staff projections of the level

of economic activity as presented in the greenbook.

Policy alternative

(15) If it is the Committee's desire to encourage somewhat

more growth in the monetary aggregates, and to move further toward less

firm money market conditions, it may wish to consider the following

second paragraph for the directive (alternative B):

To implement this policy, while taking account of

[DEL: the current Treasury refunding possible bank regulatory

changes and] the Committee's desire to see moderate growth

in money and bank credit over the months ahead, System

open market operations until the next meeting of the

Committee shall be conducted with a view to CONTINUING

TO MOVE moving gradually toward somewhat less firm condi-

tions in the money market; provided, however, that opera-

tions shall be modified promptly to resist any tendency for

money and bank credit to deviate significantly from THE

ANTICIPATED [DEL: a moderate ] growth pattern.

(16) A continuing move toward less firm money market condi-

tions might entail a Federal funds rate averaging between 7 and 8 per

cent, member bank borrowings dropping to around $700 million, and net

borrowed reserves of $500-$700 million. Under these conditions, the

3-month bill rate is likely to drop below 6-1/2 per cent over the next

few weeks, and could move even lower as the spring progresses.

(17) The anticipated weakness of the economy through the

second quarter suggests that it will be difficult to generate much more

growth in the money supply than indicated in alternative A without a



-11-

substantially lower level of interest rates. At the same time, the

continuing tight position of banks generally suggests that there would

be a sharp expansion in bank credit if market interest rates dropped

well below Regulation Q constraints, and banks thereby had the opportunity

to regain their market position through time deposits. As best we can

estimate the further easing in money market conditions specified in

paragraph (16) might be associated with a March growth rate of 12-15

per cent, annual rate, in total time deposits, and possibly with an

even further rebound in the spring quarter. The money supply might show

only a little more strength, with most of that later in the spring as

lower interest rates make it marginally more attractive to rebuild cash

balances. Mainly because of the rise in time deposits, the adjusted

bank credit proxy would also be stronger than under alternative A,

rising in an 8-11 per cent annual rate range in March and April together.

It is assumed that the additional time deposits obtained by banks would

substitute in part for funds now obtained through nondeposit sources.

(18) Staff guesses as to how the monetary aggregates might

develop under alternative B are shown in the table below (with figures

representing percentage annual rates of change):
