Prefatory Note 

 
 

The attached document represents the most complete and accurate version 
available based on original copies culled from the files of the FOMC Secretariat at the 
Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System.  This electronic document was 
created through a comprehensive digitization process which included identifying the best-
preserved paper copies, scanning those copies,1 and then making the scanned versions 
text-searchable.2  Though a stringent quality assurance process was employed, some 
imperfections may remain. 
 

Please note that this document may contain occasional gaps in the text.  These 
gaps are the result of a redaction process that removed information obtained on a 
confidential basis.  All redacted passages are exempt from disclosure under applicable

1 In some cases, original copies needed to be photocopied before being scanned into electronic format.  All 
scanned images were deskewed (to remove the effects of printer- and scanner-introduced tilting) and lightly 
cleaned (to remove dark spots caused by staple holes, hole punches, and other blemishes caused after initial 
printing). 
2 A two-step process was used.  An advanced optimal character recognition computer program (OCR) first 
created electronic text from the document image.  Where the OCR results were inconclusive, staff checked

MONETARY POLICY ALTERNATIVES

Recent developments

(1) Following the November 3 FOMC meeting, reserve paths were

constructed assuming $400 million of adjustment plus seasonal borrowing.

However, in light of the fragile market conditions and uncertainty about

liquidity demands and discount borrowing behavior, the Desk treated the

allowance for borrowing flexibly, gearing open market operations to a

considerable extent on the level of the federal funds rate relative to a

central tendency of 6-3/4 to 6-7/8 percent, as discussed by the Commit-

tee. In each of the two complete maintenance periods since the last

meeting, the Desk made informal downward adjustments to the borrowing

allowance in order to avoid a tightening of money markets and a surge of

borrowing late in the period, and actual borrowing averaged about $225

million over the two periods. On December 4, the borrowing allowance

was reduced formally to $300 million, as evidence of a reduced willing-

ness to borrow accumulated. Actual borrowing has averaged $140 million

over the first eight days of the current maintenance period. After

expanding at a double-digit pace in October, total and nonborrowed

reserves contracted in November, owing to a drop in required reserves

associated primarily with the reversal of the post-crash bulge in

transactions accounts, and to a lower average level of excess reserve

demands.

(2) Federal funds have averaged in the 6-3/4 to 6-7/8 percent

range over the intermeeting period, close to the average in the days



leading up to the last FOMC meeting. Most other short-term rates have

risen somewhat on balance, perhaps reflecting some ebbing both of pref-

erences for liquidity as markets calmed somewhat and of hopes for fur-

ther ease in monetary policy, as incoming data failed to suggest a near-

term weakening of the economy and the dollar fell. Rate increases were

especially sharp on one-month private instruments, but these were

attributable to efforts to lock in funding over the end of the year in

anticipation that once again reserve market conditions would tighten

substantially around that date. Yields on long-term Treasury securities

have risen a little less than one-half a point since early November,

with much of the increase occurring as the dollar declined sharply

following release of unfavorable trade data for October. Corporate bond

yields rose considerably less, however, and rates on municipal bonds

have fallen over the intermeeting period, reflecting the restoration of

calmer, more liquid conditions to most sectors of these markets. In

general, markets are functioning more normally, with bid-ask spreads and

dealer access to funding returning to levels prior to the stock market

collapse; even so markets remain skittish, with occasional episodes of

unusually wide price swings and of incipient flights to liquidity and

quality echoing the experience after mid-October.

(3) The dollar has declined by about 5 percent on a weighted-

average basis since the last Committee meeting. Market disappointment

over U.S. budget deficit reduction efforts contributed to the dollar's

weakness in the early part of the intermeeting period, as did various

statements by U.S. and German officials to the effect that they were not



willing to sacrifice other objectives to that of exchange rate stabil-

ity. The early December round of concerted official interest rate

reductions by Germany and several other European countries did lend some

temporary support to the dollar. However, dollar declines resumed, and

disappointing trade figures for October triggered a steep further drop

in the exchange value of the dollar.

The Desk purchased

about $1.5 billion against marks and yen, with the total divided evenly

between System and Treasury accounts. Over the period, short-term

interest rates declined by about 1/2 percentage point, on average, in

major foreign countries, while long-term rates declined slightly on

balance. Stock prices fell by about 3 percent in Japan, while dropping

a further 12 percent in Germany and rising slightly in the United King-

dom, compared with declines of around 6 percent in the United States.

(4) The monetary aggregates weakened substantially in November.

While some of the weakening reflected a runoff of the bulge in demand

deposits that followed the stock market plunge in October, demand depos-

its dropped below early October levels and OCDs decreased. M1 contract-

ed at a 6-1/2 percent annual rate in November; growth for October and

November combined was about 4-1/4 percent at an annual rate. With the

nontransactions portion of M2 expanding only sluggishly, the level of M2

was about unchanged in November, following a 7-1/4 percent rate of

growth in October; growth of M2 at a 3-1/2 percent rate over the two

months fell short of the Committee's 6 to 7 percent range for the broad

aggregates. Only small time deposits and money fund shares have shown

any strength recently, as their yields have remained attractive relative

to rates on market instruments and liquid deposits. The extent of the

dropoff in M1 and M2 in November, as well as the relative movements of

components within M2, suggest that there were no lasting unusual demands

for liquid, insured deposits. In addition, the runup in interest

rates and opportunity costs through mid-October probably continued to

restrain demands for these aggregates. To supplement weak core deposit

growth, banks and thrift institutions issued managed liabilities at a

robust pace in November, and flows into institution-only money funds

moved up sharply, as returns on these funds lagged the downward movement

of market rates in late October. As a consequence, M3 expanded at a 4-

3/4 percent annual rate, bringing growth in this aggregate from

September to 6-1/2 percent. Based on the staff Greenbook GNP forecast,

the velocities of M1 and M2 appear to be increasing slightly further in

the fourth quarter, while the velocity of M3 probably is dropping a

little.

(5) The staff estimates that growth for 1987 on a fourth-quarter

to fourth-quarter basis will be 4-1/4 percent for M2 and 5-1/2 percent

for M3, considerably below the pace of recent years, leaving these

aggregates respectively well below and at the lower ends of their 5-1/2

to 8-1/2 percent annual ranges. M1 growth, at 6 percent, also would

represent a sharp deceleration from the experience of the previous two

years. The slowing of these aggregates and turnaround of their veloci-

ties appear to be attributable primarily to the rebound in interest

rates and opportunity costs in 1987 following steep declines in 1986.

However, the extent of the moderation in money growth is somewhat more

than can be accounted for using historical relationships among money,

interest rates, and income. In part, the interest sensitivity of money

demand may have increased in recent years, given the effects of deregu-

lation and greater ease in effecting financial transfers; weakness in

demand deposits in particular may be reflecting this tendency. In

addition, special factors, including changes in consumer borrowing

incentives under the new tax law, may have tended to restrain

accumulation of liquid assets in M2.

(6) Borrowing by private nonfinancial sectors may have slowed

somewhat in November. Partial data suggest that business borrowing

weakened last month, with both bond issuance and short-term borrowing

below the pace of previous months. In part, credit needs were depressed

by a reduced level of merger and leveraged buyout activity. Borrowing

by state and local governments remained near the subdued pace that has

prevailed in recent months. For households, banking data together with

the earlier expiration of most auto incentive programs suggest consumer

credit growth was moderate. On the other hand, Treasury borrowing has

increased to fund a larger fourth-quarter deficit. Overall, the debt of

domestic nonfinancial sectors is estimated to have expanded in November



-7-

in line with its trend of just over 9 percent since the fourth-quarter

1986 base; it thus appears that the debt aggregate will end the year

near the middle of its 8 to 11 percent range.



Policy alternatives

(7) Three alternatives for monetary policy are presented below for

Committee consideration. They are based on the options of maintaining

current reserve and money market conditions, or seeking somewhat easier

(alternative A) or somewhat tighter (alternative C) conditions. The

latter two alternatives are assumed to involve changes of approximately

1/2 point in the federal funds rate from current levels along with

associated adjustments of reserve pressures. Investor caution about

default risk and potential volatility may continue in financial markets

over the near term. In such circumstances, the apparent added reluc-

tance of banks to be seen tapping the discount window since the last

FOMC meeting also could persist. Moreover, year-end pressures may

affect bank reserve management and the movements of interest rates in

coming weeks. As a consequence, the relationship between the amount of

adjustment plus seasonal borrowing and the spread of the funds rate over

the discount rate is likely to remain unusually uncertain for awhile.

In constructing the alternatives, the staff has assumed that, if finan-

cial markets remain unusually sensitive and instability in the borrowing

relationship persists, the borrowing objective will continue to be

interpreted with some degree of flexibility in implementing open market

operations.2

2. The issue of the relative emphasis to give the federal funds rate
and discount window borrowing as guides to day-to-day open market opera-
tions is discussed in the accompanying memorandum by Donald L. Kohn and
Peter D. Sternlight, "Strategies for Open Market Operations," dated
December 11, 1987.



(8) Anticipated growth of the monetary aggregates from November to

March under each alternative is presented in the table below, along with

the associated federal funds rate bands. The memo items in the table

show the implied rates of growth through March from the estimated

fourth-quarter base for the 1988 ranges, as well as the FOMC's tentative

1988 ranges themselves. (More detailed data are shown on the table and

charts on the following pages.) Under all the alternatives, growth of

the monetary aggregates in coming months is expected to rebound from the

unusual weakness in November. However, based on the experience of

recent weeks, the projected growth paths do not incorporate any allow-

ance for heightened demands for money resulting from the stock market

collapse and subsequent financial and economic uncertainty.

window associated with this level of federal funds trading seems espe-

cially difficult to gauge for the coming two maintenance periods, which

surround year-end, as depository institutions position themselves for

anticipated year-end pressures. Given continuing uncertainties in

financial markets and concerns about bank credit quality, some reluc-

tance on the part of banks to be seen at the window is likely to persist

after year-end. Borrowing of perhaps around $300 million could be

consistent with the assumed federal funds rate in the new year.

(10) With federal funds continuing to trade around recent levels,

short-term rates might show mixed movements in coming weeks. Private

short-term rates should decline once year-end pressures have passed,

while Treasury bill yields could edge higher, with the 3-month bill rate

rising to above 6 percent under alternative B. However, any narrowing

of spreads could be limited, as economic uncertainties here and abroad,

combined with the overhang of previous financial difficulties, sustain

market concerns about the financial strength of debtors and the institu-

tions that have extended them credit. The dollar would probably continue

under general downward pressure, although a new G-7 accord could lend an

element of stability for a time. Should dollar weakness abate, and eco-

nomic indicators point to a softer economy along the lines of the staff

forecast, bond yields could drop somewhat from the elevated levels of

recent days.

(11) Under the unchanged reserve market conditions of alternative

B, M2 growth from November to March likely would pick up from the 3-1/2

percent average pace of October and November, placing this aggregate



-12-

just below the 5 percent lower bound of the growth cone associated with

its tentative 1988 range by March. The decline in market interest rates

since mid-October has lowered opportunity costs on retail deposits to

around their summer levels. As the effects of increases in opportunity

costs earlier this year fade, deposit inflows should pick up. M2 is

thus expected to grow nearly apace with GNP through the first quarter of

next year, with its velocity essentially unchanged. This compares with

an increase in V2 that averaged 3 percent at an annual rate over the

first three quarters of this year.

(12) M3 is expected to grow at a 6 percent annual rate from Novem-

ber to March under alternative B, about the same pace as in recent

months; such growth would keep this aggregate through March well within

its tentative range for 1988. Flows to institution-only money funds

should weaken substantially as their returns move down into more normal

alignment with market rates. However, bank credit expansion is likely

to rebound in coming months from its November pause, and thrift asset

growth should be well maintained, buoyed by continued large acquisitions

of ARMs. Overall household mortgage and consumer credit expansion in

the first quarter is expected to stay around the reduced fourth-quarter

pace, as housing activity and consumer durables spending remain about

flat. Business borrowing is expected to be sizable, as the financing

gap remains appreciable, while share retirements fall back only

modestly. State and local bond issuance should continue near its recent

subdued pace, but a substantial volume of federal government borrowing

is anticipated to finance the higher deficit. In all, the debt of



-13-

domestic nonfinancial sectors in March is expected to stand 9 percent at

an annual rate above its fourth-quarter base--the midpoint of its 7-1/2

to 10-1/2 percent tentative range for 1988.

(13) M1 growth is expected to average 4 percent over the next four

months under alternative B. This represents a slight pickup from its

average pace over October and November, abstracting from the effects of

the bulge. Little expansion is expected on a month-average basis in

December, given the pattern of growth in late November and early Decem-

ber. But with interest rates essentially flat, increases averaging 5

percent at an annual rate are projected over the first three months of

next year. Even so, the monthly pattern of M1 growth is expected to

produce an increase in velocity of 2 percent in the first quarter.

(14) The 1/2 percentage point lowering of the federal funds rate

under alternative A would bring it to the 6-1/4 to 6-3/8 percent area.

This probably would be associated with minimal borrowing in the near-

term and perhaps in a range around $150 million in the new year. Such

an easing is not expected by financial market participants, at least in

the absence of much hard evidence indicating that the stock market

decline or other factors have begun to retard spending significantly.

Choosing this alternative thus would depress short-term market rates

below recent levels, with the 3-month Treasury bill rate likely to

fluctuate around 5-1/2 percent. Yields on private short-term

instruments probably would decline by more, as the policy easing

improved prospects for continued economic expansion and helped relieve

worries about credit quality. Such an action would tend to restore



-14-

differentials between U.S. and European short-term interest rates to

levels prevailing before recent cuts in official lending rates abroad,

increasing downward pressure on the dollar. If inflationary concerns in

financial markets are intensified, declines in bond yields may be

limited.

(15) Lower short-term market rates relative to deposit offering

rates under alternative A would prompt more rapid inflows into M2-type

accounts. M2 growth from November to March would be expected to pick up

to 6 percent. Higher compensating balance requirements in response to

reduced market rates would boost business demand deposits, while more

savings-type balances would be diverted to NOW and other liquid accounts

in response to reduced opportunity costs. M1 growth of 6 percent

expected over November to March implies expansion at almost an 8 percent

rate in the early months of 1988, given the slow growth now in train for

December. The faster growth in core deposits likely would produce only

a partial offset in reduced issuance of managed liabilities in M3, as

greater loan demands would be placed on banks and thrifts in response to

generally easier credit conditions. With this alternative, M3 might

expand at around a 6-1/2 percent pace from November to March. By then,

M2 would be within, and M3 around the midpoint of, the FOMC's tentative

ranges for 1988.

(16) The firming of reserve market conditions embodied in alterna-

tive C would also take market participants by surprise. Federal funds

rates could rise back to the 7-1/4 to 7-3/8 percent area, with borrowing

perhaps around the $500 million range in early 1988. Rates on private



-15-

instruments could rise appreciably, especially if a negative reaction in

stock markets induced a renewed flight to safety and liquidity. Higher

funding costs would cause banks to increase their prime rates by at

least 1/2 point, while rates on consumer installment and mortgage loans

also would be raised. But higher interest rates would enhance the

attractiveness of dollar assets to international investors, and a ten-

dency for the exchange value of the dollar to appreciate in the near-

term could emerge.

(17) The higher interest rates of alternative C can be expected to

prevent M2 from accelerating much from its recent pace. M3 growth could

slow somewhat, especially as money funds experienced outflows when mar-

ket rates rose. In March, M2 would be well below, and M3 somewhat

above, the lower bounds of their tentative 1988 ranges. Given its rela-

tively greater interest sensitivity, M1 would probably grow at only a 2

percent rate through March, well below its average growth to date this

year.

Directive language

(18) Draft language for the operational paragraph is shown below.

The second sentence from the November directive, which calls for special

flexibility in the conduct of open market operations, might be retained.

However, the remaining special language from that directive is proposed

for deletion; much of it referenced unusual demands for liquidity. The

sentence on possible intermeeting adjustments would add a reference to

"conditions in financial markets" to the usual listing of factors to be

considered in deciding on the desirability of such an adjustment.

OPERATIONAL PARAGRAPH

In the implementation of policy for the immediate future, the Com-

mittee seeks to DECREASE SOMEWHAT (Alt. A)/maintain (Alt. B)/INCREASE

SOMEWHAT (Alt. C) the degree of pressure on reserve positions [DEL: sought in

recent days]. The Committee recognizes that STILL SENSITIVE [DEL: the volatile]

conditions in financial markets and uncertainties in the economic out-

look may continue to call for a special degree of flexibility in open

market operations [DEL: ,depending, in particular, on-demands-for-liquidity-

growing out of recent or prospective developments in financial markets].

TAKING ACCOUNT OF CONDITIONS IN FINANCIAL MARKETS, [DEL: apart-from-such-con-

siderations,] somewhat (SLIGHTLY) lesser reserve restraint would (MIGHT),

or slightly (SOMEWHAT) greater reserve restraint might (WOULD), be ac-

ceptable depending on the strength of the business expansion, indica-

tions of inflationary pressures, developments in foreign exchange mar-

kets, as well as the behavior of the monetary aggregates. [DEL: While the

outlook for monetary growth over the months ahead is subject to unusual



-17-

uncertainly,] The contemplated reserve conditions are expected to be

consistent with growth in M2 and M3 over the period from NOVEMBER

THROUGH MARCH [DEL: September through December] at annual rates of about [DEL: 6 to 7]

____ percent AND ____ PERCENT, RESPECTIVELY [DEL: but more rapid growth is pos-

sible should preferences for liquidity be pariticulary strong]. Over the

same period, growth in M1 is expected to REMAIN RELATIVELY LIMITED [DEL: be

well above its average pace in the previous several months]. The Chair-

man may call for Committee consultation if it appears to the Manager for

Domestic Operations that reserve conditions during the period before the

next meeting are likely to be associated with a federal funds rate per-

sistently outside a range of [DEL: 4 to 8] ____ TO ____ percent.
