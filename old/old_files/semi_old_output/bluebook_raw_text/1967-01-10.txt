MONEY MARKET AND RESERVE RELATIONSHIPS

Recent developments

With bill rates declining further and other money market

conditions easing slightly, total member bank deposits (bank credit

proxy) expanded at an annual rate of 3.4 per cent in December, the

first monthly increase since July; after considering bank borrowing

abroad, the proxy rose by about 5 per cent. Yields on Treasury bills

of all maturities have fallen below 5 per cent, with the 3-month

bill recently hovering around 4.80 per cent. Yields available on

short-term Federal agencies also declined sharply, while rates on

bankers' acceptances and finance company paper were reduced moderately.

The recent declines in bill rates have apparently contained

a large expectational component, particularly since market demand

for bills tended to taper off after mid-December when funds appeared

to be diverted increasingly to CD's and other short-term instruments.

Dealer bill positions have risen further from earlier high levels;

dealers also continue to carry a sizable amount of coupon issues

maturing in over a year, and have built up holdings of Federal agency

issues and CD's.

Conditions in the Federal funds and dealer loan markets

eased only modestly in December; indeed, they tightened briefly in

connection with year-end money market churning. Very large dealer

CONFIDENTIAL (FR) -2- January 9, 1967.

financing requirements during the past month have contributed not

only to maintenance of pressure on the money markets, but also to

expansion in bank credit since a good part of these financing needs

have been accommodated through increased lending by money market banks.

Partly in consequence, these banks have experienced an enlarged basic

reserve deficiency, which they have financed by actively bidding for

Federal funds and in some cases coming to the discount window for

temporary assistance.

Federal funds traded over a fairly wide range of rates

during the past four weeks and have averaged about 5-3/8 per cent as

compared with an average of about 5.60 per cent in the preceding four

weeks. Net borrowed reserves fluctuated between $93 million and

$276 million in the latest 4-week period, but averaged about $170

million, down from an average of $215 million in the preceding four

weeks. Member bank borrowings averaged $560 million in the latest

period, unchanged from four weeks ago.

The decline in bill rates last month enabled banks to bid

more successfully for CD's, and the total outstanding rose contra-

seasonally by $150 million during the month. Total time and savings

deposits began to grow rapidly in the second week of December, and

contributed importantly to the continuing week to week increases in

bank credit proxy during the month. Between the last statement weeks

of November and December, the bank credit proxy expanded by almost



CONFIDENTIAL (FR) -3- January 6 , 1967.

13 per cent annual rate, after having declined by about 12 per cent

from the end of October to the end of November. The December rise

in bank credit included substantial additions to bank holdings of

short-term U.S. Government securities, as banks made efforts to restore

their liquidity position; business loans of banks showed no net

expansion in December.

Expansion in the money supply, which resumed in mid-November,

continued in December. Private demand deposits rose by about 9 per

cent during the month on average, but this increase in large part

represented a short-run response to declines in U.S. Government

deposits. With respect to reserve aggregates, both nonborrowed and

total reserves showed only a very slight expansion in December, as banks

economized on excess reserves (after seasonal adjustment) during the

month.

Prospective developments

Bank credit expansion is likely to continue in January,

but at a slower pace than indicated by the large recent week to week

increases. The increase in the January average of outstanding bank

credit over the December average may be in a 7-9 per cent (annual

rate) range, but this includes the carry-over effect on the monthly

averages of the strength in the latter part of December. From the

end of December through the end of January, a growth rate in the 4-6

per cent range appears likely.



CONFIDENTIAL (FR) -4- January 6, 1967.

These projections assume that the 3-month bill rate stays

roughly within the recent 4.75-4.85 per cent range over the period

ahead, that net borrowed reserves fluctuate around $100 million, and

that Federal funds and dealer loan rates back down somewhat from

recent high levels of around year-end. The 3-month bill rate might

move toward the upper limits of the range assumed if dealer attitudes

should lead to a reversal of the large build-up in bill positions

that was recently an important factor pulling bill rates down relative

to other short-term rates. Upward bill rate pressures are most likely

to develop if dealer financing costs do not come down from recent

levels (when they were generally in a 5-3/4 - 6-1/2 per cent range

in New York and around 5-1/2 per cent outside New York), and if the

usual seasonal reflow of corporate money into bills does not come up

to expected proportions. However, market psychology will remain an

important influence on bill rates, with the continuance of bullish

market attitudes dependent partly on interpretations of monetary

policy and of the fiscal implications of the forthcoming Federal

budget.

With respect to credit demands, it is assumed that business

loans resume a moderate growth related in part to accelerated payments

by corporations of withheld individual income tax payments in January;

and, as a partial offset, that banks become less active in lending

to dealers as the latter's positions are reduced somewhat and as



CONFIDENTIAL (FR) -5- January 6, 1967.

financing from corporations through repurchase agreements becomes

more available.

The interest rate and credit demand assumptions appear

consistent with expansion of time and savings deposits at all

commercial banks by about 12 per cent in January on a monthly average

basis. This projection assumes that banks will be able to add about

$500 million to outstanding CD's despite the large $5.5 billion of

maturities in January and that the somewhat more rapid increase in

other time deposits that has recently developed will continue. It

further assumes that banks generally will not move to reduce interest

rates paid on CD's until their liquidity positions are more comfortable

or until they are more convinced that loan demand is fading.

Money supply in January is expected to show little or no

net change on average. Private demand deposits may decline somewhat,

partly because of a projected rise of almost $1 billion in U.S.

Government deposits. But private demand deposits are not assumed

to decline by as much as Government deposits rise, in contrast to

what has often been their past short-run behavior. The decline in

private demand deposits is likely to be limited by renewed business

loan growth.

These deposit projections imply a sizable expansion in

aggregate reserves in January on average--in the order of 10-12

per cent for nonborrowed and total reserves. For December-January



CONFIDENTIAL (FR) -6- January 6, 1967.

together, nonborrowed reserves may show an increase around the 5-7

per cent range. The December-January increase in such reserves,

together with related monetary variables, is shown in the table

below in comparison with other periods (all figures being annual

rates of increase for the period including terminal months).

Dec. '66- Calendar
Jan. '67 Aug. '66- Feb. '66- Aug. '65- years

(projected) Nov. '66 July '66 Jan. '66 1966 1965

Bank credit proxy 5-7 -3.0 + 7.5 + 7.8 +3.7 + 9.1
Time deposits 9-11 +3.1 +11.6 +14.4 +8.3 +16.0
Money supply 3-5 -0.7 + 1.9 + 6.9 +1.9 + 4.7

Nonborrowed reserves 5-7 -4.3 + 2.6 + 4.9 +0.7 + 4.3

If the Committee wishes to continue a gradual reduction

in the degree of monetary restraint, it might call for open market

operations to achieve a set of money market conditions that might

include a net borrowed reserve position averaging close to zero and

Federal funds averaging near 5 per cent. This would, in all likelihood,

bring the 3-month bill rate down to a 4.60-4.75 per cent range. It

would also encourage gradual relaxation of bank loan policies.

Such an easing of money market conditions--given the current

economic outlook indicated in the Green Book--would be likely to

encourage further bank credit expansion through the winter months,

although possibly not at a trend rate much above the December-January

average indicated in the table. Long-term yields would be more likely



CONFIDENTIAL (FR) -7- January 6, 1967.

to decline further as banks increased their acquisitions of municipals

and long Governments. And, with long-term rate declines, mortgages

would become increasingly attractive to institutional investors.

Finally, it should be noted that if further signs of

substantial economic weakness are noted by the market, the level of

interest rates could move sharply down, even if net borrowed reserves

are not very different from their recent range. But such a movement

of interest rates might not necessarily be accompanied by any greater

expansion of bank credit than projected--and possibly less--as banks

might begin reducing CD rates and might see some immediate sizable

declines in demand deposits associated with loan repayment. Main-

tenance of bank credit expansion would under the circumstances

depend on a relatively rapid growth in nonborrowed reserves, which

would permit banks to repay debt to the Federal Reserve and perhaps

to others and to liberalize portfolio investment policies and lending

terms markedly.
