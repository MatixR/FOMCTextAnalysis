1969-04-29,1969-04-29,"(1) Interest rates and monetary aggregates have moved in
diverse, and to some extent unanticipated ways, since the System's
recent policy actions. Treasury bill rates generally rose after the
increasesin the discount rate and in reserve requirements were announced
on April 3, and reached a peak on the mid-April tax date. Subsequently
bill rates have drifted back. The 3-month bill was most recently quoted
while longer-term bills have dropped below those earlier levels. Most
short-term rates outside the bill area have risen, on balance, since
early April.
","(2) Expectations of future Treasury debt repayment and
greater market convictions that monetary and fiscal policies will slow
inflation were factors tending to press lower the longer-end of the
yield curve in the Treasury bill market. These same factors, together
with peace hopes, also affected interest rates in bond markets. And
yields on U.S. Government, State and local, and corporate long-term
issues moved 15-25 basis points below their early April levels. Most
recently, this rally in bond markets has faded in face of a continued
sizable volume of corporate and municipal offerings and in anticipation
of the sizable Treasury mid-May refunding.

nominal amounts before the tax date. And for a week at mid-month
the Treasury borrowed an average of $723 million a day directly from
the Federal Reserve, resulting in an enlarged need for System
absorbing operations. Also, in meeting cash payments prior to mid-
month tax receipts, the Treasury made unusually large C-bank calls.
Partly as a result of the Treasury cash management policy, the reserve
position of major money market banks came under severe pressure. The
basic reserve deficits of major banks have fluctuated in a $3.5 - $5.0
billion range, with deficits in New York running $1.5 - $2.0 billion,
substantially deeper than in March. Trading in Federal funds since the
last Committee meeting has frequently been at, or above,7-1/2 per cent
with some activity as high as 8 per cent, particularly in the tax
period. The average rate has been around 7-1/4 per cent thus far in
April. Loan rates to dealers have tended mostly to a 7-1/2 - 8 per
cent range.
","(6) Net borrowed reserves for all member banks rose to $995
million and borrowings to an average of $1.1 billion in the most
recent statement week, the first week affected by the higher reserve
requirements. In the preceding three statement weeks net borrowed
reserves were in a $650 - $900 million range, with average borrowings
fluctuating between $750 million and $1.2 billion.

Prospective developments
","(8) The sharp average annual rates of expansion in money
supply and the bank credit proxy for April are not likely to be repeated
in May--and some reversal could develop--given prevailing money market
conditions. These conditions can be taken to comprise a Federal funds
rate generally fluctuating in a 7 - 7-3/4 per cent range, member bank
borrowings $900 million to $1.2 billion, and net borrowed reserves
$800 million to $1 billion. The 3-month Treasury bill may fluctuate
in a 5.90 - 6.20 per cent range.
","(9) It is possible that bill rates will come under some
further downward pressure in the period ahead. The System is expected
to supply a substantial amount of reserves over the next three weeks.
Moreover, the mid-May refunding could generate additional demand for
bills, with the amount depending on the nature of the exchange and
market attitudes at the time. The refunding will probably be announced
the afternoon of April 30, and at the moment many market participants
are expecting a""rights"" exchange involving about $6 billion of publicly
held May and June maturities. These potential demands may press on a
relatively limited current and expected market supply of bills. Dealer
bill positions have recently declined; the Treasury has just paid off
$2 billion of April tax bills as well as $200 million of monthly bills;
and further substantial net debt repayment will develop by the end of
","(10) Given these demand-supply conditions in the bill market,
it could require relatively high dealer loan rates and a Federal funds
rate fluctuating around the upper end of the specified range to avert
a decline in the 3-month bill rate to, or below, the lower end of the
range in paragraph (8). Even if the 3-month bill rate is maintained
in that range, longer-term bill rates (on a discount basis) could remain
below the 3-month bill. In particular, the yield on the 1-year bill
might possibly be low enough relative to the Regulation Q ceiling to
enable banks to increase sales of longer-term CD's somewhat.
","(11) Actual CD attrition in May is expected to drop to a
$250 - $500 million range. But because May is a month when CD's
seasonally show a $500 - $700 million increase, seasonally adjusted
CD experience would be a significant inhibiting factor on bank credit
growth. Consumer-type time and savings deposits are expected to grow
quite modestly, recovering somewhat from the tax-induced April weakness.
All in all, total time and savings deposits in May are likely to decline
on average in a 0 to 3 per cent annual rate range.
","(12) Private demand deposits are expected to rise from the
end of April to the end of May, mainly reflecting an expected $1-1/2
billion decline in U.S. Government deposits over the course of the
month, a sizable portion of which represents attrition of the maturing
mid-May Treasury issue. The average level of the money supply in May,
however, is likely to be slightly below that of the April average level.
","(13) The bank credit proxy (including Euro-dollars) may
decline in May in a 2 - 5 per cent, annual rate, range. Loan demands
from business and nonbank financial institutions may moderate some
from their April pace, which was influenced by tax period borrowing.
However, security loans could rise more than last month in view of the
Treasury financing, and particularly if temporary holders participate
in the financing to a sizable extent. Given these loan demands, with
member bank deposits tending to contract on average, banks are likely
to remain inactive in the municipal market, to redeem a sizable
portion of their $2 billion holding of the maturing mid-May Treasury
issues, and to sell the ""rights"" to the June Treasury maturity. At
the same time, banks are not likely to be very willing lenders on
security loans, and interest rates on these loans will probably be
at a substantial penalty relative to the securities to be financed.
","(14) Under the circumstances, it would appear that inter-
mediate and longer-term interest rates are likely to move up over the
next few weeks, unless expectations of a weakening economy, or peace,
were to become more prevalent. Should a sizable market interest
develop in new Treasury issues and new corporate and municipal bonds--
say, for expectational reasons--it is quite possible that a strong
demand pull would be exerted on monetary aggregates. In this event,
bank credit and money supply in May could turn out to be stronger than
projected unless the Federal Reserve--through the workings of a proviso
clause or otherwise--operates to hold back on reserves relative to
demand, thereby tightening conditions in the money market toward or
beyond the tight end of specifications in paragraph (8).

1970-11-17,1970-11-17,"(1) The adjusted money supply in October rose only slightly,
thus falling considerably short of the 4-1/2 per cent rate of increase
expected at the time of the last meeting of the Committee. While spread
throughout the banking system, the greater portion of the weakness in the
money supply appears to have been at reserve city banks and to be associated
with the weakness in demands for short-term credit, perhaps in large part
related to the auto strike. As shown in the table in paragraph (3), since
mid-October the weekly data have, without exception, run below the path
indicated in the last Blue Book; and in the week of November 4 the short-
fall amounted to some $1-1/2 billion.
","(2) Growth in the adjusted bank credit proxy in October fell
even further below expectations than the money supply. Currently the proxy
is estimated to have increased at only about a 1/2 of 1 per cent rate over
the month, compared with a 7 per cent rate expected at the time of the
Committee meeting. In addition to the weakness in private demand deposits,
the increase in the proxy was held down by a slightly more rapid pace of
runoff of non-deposit sources of funds than allowed for, a slower growth
in time deposits than earlier anticipated, and a greater decline in U.S.
Government deposits. The October rate of increase in time deposits is
estimated at 22 per cent, compared with a projection of 26-1/2 per cent,
reflected some slowing in net inflows of both CD's and other time and
savings deposits. Like the weakness in the money supply, this slowing
was concentrated at reserve city banks,

","(4) In view of the shortfall in monetary growth rates in
October, as well as in the fourth quarter, the Desk has encouraged more
comfortable money market conditions than those generally prevailing around
the time of the October 20 meeting. With the ""even keel"" constraint
lessened after the auction date of the new note, Federal funds began to
trade more frequently below 6 per cent and in the last day or two have
been trading around the new 5-3/4 per cent discount rate. Net borrowed
reserves over the statement weeks since the last meeting have fluctuated
in a $120 to $290 million range while average member bank borrowings have
remained quite stable around $430 million.
","(5) Short-term interest rates have declined markedly since the
Committee meeting, particularly in the Treasury bill market where the
rate on 3-month issues has dropped about 50 basis points to around 5.45
per cent. The fall in bill rates was influenced by anticipation of a
near-term cut in the discount rate and the commercial bank prime rate
(both of which subsequently were reduced by 1/4 point),by reinvestment
of the proceeds of the heavy recent volume of capital market offerings,
and, also, by reduced demands for short-term credit partly as a result
of the prolonged auto strike. These same influences have worked to re-
duce rates on private short-term market instruments as well, and most of
these rates are about 25--50 basis points below their levels as of
October 20. Bond markets have rallied in the last two weeks, bringing
yields somewhat below those prevailing around the time of the last FOMC
","(6) On October 23, the Treasury announced a rights exchange
for the $7.7 billion of maturing 5 per cent notes, $6.0 billion of which
were publicly held. Holders of the maturing notes were given the option
of an exchange into either a 3-1/2-year, 7-1/4 per cent note at par or
a 5-3/4-year, reopened 7-1/2 per cent note priced to yield 7.39 per cent.
The exchange was very successful with an attrition rate of only 11 per
cent, or about $650 million, of the public's holdings. These two new
issues were most recently trading at premiums of 1-3/4--2 points. In
conjunction with the October 30 announcement of the results of the rights
exchange, the Treasury announced a $2.0 billion cash financing in the
form of an auction on November 5 of a 6-3/4 per cent, 18-month note, with
very successful, and an average issuing rate of 6.21 per cent resulted,
a rate considerably below earlier market expectations.

Prospective developments
","(8) The recent weakness in demand deposits, and also to a
degree in time deposits, suggests that the fourth quarter target growth
rate for the money supply of 5 per cent (and the anticipated attendant
bank credit growth rate of 9 per cent) are not likely to be attained,
even with money market conditions similar to the easier conditions
most recently prevailing. The latter might be taken to include a
Federal funds rate around the new 5-3/4 per cent discount rate and a net
reserve position for banks in a +$50 to -$200 million range. Given
these money market conditions, the staff's current projections of likely
growth in money supply, bank credit, and total reserves are shown below.
As may be seen the money supply over the quarter would be expected to
grow at a 3 per cent annual rate, with growth expected to accelerate
from the very low recent rates as economic activity picks up in connection
with the ending of the auto strike. The adjusted bank credit proxy
is expected to grow at only a 3-1/2 per cent annual rate for the quarter,
partly as U.S. Government deposits show a substantial decline.

With these aggregates and money market conditions, the staff would expect
the 3-month bill rate to be in a 5-1/4--5-3/4 per cent range. It is
possible that the bill rate could rise in the last few weeks of the year
as the result of an expected $2 billion Treasury bill offering for new
cash to be announced shortly, of usual seasonal pressures, and of some
renewed short-term credit demands following settlement of the auto strike,
A back-up in short-term rates, should it develop, would tend to limit,
though perhaps not completely halt, further declines in long-term interest
","(9) In light of the staff's estimate of the outlook for
monetary aggregates noted above for the fourth quarter the Committee
may wish to consider a further easing in money market conditions in an
effort to move back to its previously desired track. But since
it seems likely that some of the recent deposit weakness
may have been related to diminished short-term credit and cash working
balance needs as a result of the auto strike, the Committee may also
wish to consider settling for a somewhat slower aggregate growth in the
fourth quarter than previously desired. This approach might then allow
for a counterbalancing growth in the money stock at a rate above 5 per
cent in the first quarter when the economy will be doing most of its
catching up from strike effects. For example, the Committee may not
wish to ease money market conditions, and other interest rates, as much
as now seems likely to be required to attain a 5 per cent money stock
growth in the fourth quarter, and then have to turn around and tighten
money market conditions in the first quarter in order to keep money
growth to 5 per cent at a time when transactions demands for cash will
likely be accelerating. One alternative would be for the Committee to
strive for, say, a 4 per cent money growth rate in the fourth quarter
and a compensating 6 per cent rate in the first, thus maintaining the
annual rate over the fourth and first quarters together at around 5 per
","(10) The following table summarizes relationships between
money market conditions, typified for convenience by the Federal funds
rate, and rates of increase in monetary aggregates thought at the
moment to be consistent for the fourth quarter.
Annual rates of increase
Federal funds rate! /  Money supply Bank credit
Needless to say, these relationships are, at best, approximate, are no
doubt subject to considerable error, and should be considered as mid-
points of fairly wide ranges, But they are presented so that the
Committee might have some basis for expressing its preferences with
respect to trade-offs over the near-term between monetary aggregates
and money market conditions.
","(11) The choice to be made among the range of alternatives
summarized in paragraph (10) would appear to depend to an important
extent on the trend rate of growth that the Committee desires for money
and bank credit over a longer period of time. As earlier noted, if the
FOMC wished to remain on a 5 per cent growth trend for money stock, it
might accept a slower rate in the fourth quarter and a more rapid rate
in the first quarter in the interest of not unduly wrenching money and
credit markets. If the FOMC's basic desired path, on the other hand,
were to move up to a trend rate of growth that was about 6-7 per cent
for money in the fourth and first quarters taken together, the Committee
might then wish to be more aggressive with respect to reserve provision
in the fourth quarter in order to effect a smooth adjustment to the more
rapid money supply growth path. Two broad alternatives are discussed in
the next two subsections: one (alternative A) calls for maintaining the
target for money growth for the fourth and first quarters taken together
at a 5 per cent annual rate; the other (alternative B) calls for a higher
average rate of growth over that time span.
Policy alternative A. (12) If the Committee wishes to stay
on a 5 per cent growth path for the money supply, but is wiling to
permit some shortfall in the fourth quarter which would be made up in
the first quarter, it might consider the following language for the
second paragraph of the directive:
""To implement this policy, the Committee seeks to
promote some easing of conditions in credit markets and
moderate growth in money and attendant bank credit expan-
sion over the months ahead, WITH ALLOWANCE FOR TEMPORARY
SHIFTS IN MONEY AND CREDIT DEMANDS RELATED TO THE AUTO
STRIKE. System open market operations until the next
meeting of the Committee shall be conducted with a view
to maintaining bank reserves and money market conditions
consistent with those objectives-[DEL:taking account of the
forthcoming Treasury financings.""]
This alternative might be best achieved if the Federal funds rate were
permitted to move progressively downward in a 5-3/4 - 5 per cent range
over the weeks ahead in the interest of attaining the Committee's longer-
run money supply and bank credit objectives. As noted earlier, our
estimates would suggest that a 5 per cent funds rate may be required to
achieve 4 per cent money growth over the fourth quarter. At such a
funds rate, it would be expected that this money growth shortfall might
be made up in the first quarter without any very substantial further
alteration of money market conditions. But in view of uncertainties
about the funds rate-deposit relationship and given the possibility of
exaggerated market reactions, it may be prudent to work the funds rate
down gradually between now and the next meeting while checking incoming
data to determine whether expected relationships are in fact developing.
","(13) The table below shows monthly patterns of monetary
aggregates consistent with this policy alternative.

If it proved necessary to push the Federal funds rate to around the low
end of a 5 - 5-3/4 per cent range over the next few weeks, the 3-month
Treasury bill rate would be likely to move into a lower range than the
to 5 per cent, or below, partly on expectations that the discount rate
would soon be reduced again. And longer-term interest rates would tend
to decline more rapidly than otherwise as banks continued to acquire
securities even as loan demands picked up.
","(15) It is most difficult to specify the net reserve position
of banks likely to be consistent with a Federal funds rate in the 5 -
range. Member bank borrowings would likely average in a $300-$400
million range (with the lower end of the range respesenting largely
necessitous long-term borrowing from the window by two banks). But it
is very unclear as to how banks' demands for excess reserves are likely
to change as the Fed funds rate drops further. One would expect that
banks would want to hold somewhat more excess reserves as the Fed funds
rate declined, but at a rate still as high as 5 per cent the level of
excess reserves desired over time may be only $50 - $100 million above
recent experience. This would mean that over a period of several weeks
sizable net free reserves are not likely to be prevalent. But, with
required reserves in a given week fixed by the lagged reserve scheme,
the banking system as a whole (with borrowings at minimal levels) would
have no way in any particular statement week to dispose of excess reserves
created when open market operations supply nonborrowed reserves in
excess of current required reserves in order to encourage bank credit
and deposit expansion. Individual banks could, of course, reduce their
own excess reserves, and the rapidity and eagerness with which they did
so would affect the Federal funds rate. In practice, though, banks may
be slow to realize that the System is easing the money market and thus,
at least for a while, may be sluggish in selling off excess reserves in
the Federal funds market. This could mean that at the beginning of an
effort significantly to ease the money market it would take fairly
sizable excess reserves in the banking system to lower the Federal funds
rate to, say, a 5 per cent average for a statement week. But once
indivdual banks realized that it did not pay to be slow in disposing of
excess reserves, a lower average level of excess reserves for the banking
system would result for any given Fed funds rate.
Policy alternative B. (16) This alternative is presented in
the event that the Committee may wish to consider a more aggressive
easing in the money market than under alternative A in order to increase
the likelihood of moving closer to a 5 per cent money growth rate (and
around 6 per cent bank credit) in the fourth quarter, partly as a way
station to moving on to a 6 - 7 per cent growth path for money for the
fourth and first quarters taken together. Suggested language for such a
directive is shown below.
""To implement this policy, the Committee seeks to promote
some FURTHER easing of conditions in credit markets and moderate
SOMEWHAT GREATER growth in money THAN SOUGHT EARLIER and
attendant bank credit expansion over the months ahead. System
open market operations until the next meeting of the Committee
shall be conducted with a view to maintaining bank reserves
and money market conditions consistent with those objectives;
[DEL: taking account of the forthcoming Treasury financings.""]
","(17) To achieve a 5 per cent money growth in the fourth quarter
(with the quarter already half over) the staff would expect the Federal
funds rate to have to drop well below 5 per cent, and probably also below
however, expect that a Federal funds rate in a 4--5 per cent range would
prove consistent with a money growth rate somewhere in a 4--5 per cent
annual rate range. The weekly patterns of money supply and bank credit
in the inter-meeting period consistent with a 5 per cent growth rate in
money are shown in the following table:

_ _~~ ___ __ ______
","(18) Over this period member bank borrowings would be expected
to be at minimal levels (apart from the necessitous borrowing noted
earlier) and net free reserves might consistently emerge, although it is
very difficult, for reasons noted earlier, to predict how large net free
reserves may be. The 3-month Treasury bill rate might drop to around
tained rally in bond markets would likely be generated. With short-term
market rates low, Euro-dollar borrowings of banks would tend to drop
significantly further as banks would be willing and able to obtain
domestic CD's in volume; moreover, as markedly lower interest rates
developed, banks would begin to lengthen CD maturities to lock up rela-
tively low interest cost funds, and short-term Euro-dollars (maturing
within thirty days) would become relatively less attractive.
","(19) If a 5 per cent growth rate in money supply were attained
in the fourth quarter, the Federal funds rate could likely remain in a
first quarter, assuming GNP in nominal terms rises in the first quarter
by about the 9 per cent annual rate that is projected. If money growth
were less than 5 per cent in the fourth quarter, money market conditions
probably would have to be eased somewhat further in the first quarter
since it would take a larger than 7 - 8 per cent money growth rate in
that quarter to compensate for the shortfall from 5 per cent in the
fourth quarter.

1970-12-15,1970-12-15,"(1) Deposit data now available for all of November indicate that
growth in the narrowly-defined money supply was substantially stronger in
the month than indicated either by the estimate based on partial data
shown in the greenbook or by the preliminary week-by-week figures available
to the Trading Desk in late November and early December. According to the
latest estimates, the money supply grew at a 4-1/2 per cent annual rate in
November, and its level was above the monthly figure consistent with a 4 per
cent growth rate for the fourth quarter. The final money supply figure
for October, while showing very little growth on average for the month,
was also a bit above the initial estimate available at the last Committee
meeting. A factor contributing to the larger-than-expected money supply
growth recently may have been a bulge in transactions demand stemming from
enlarged bond and stock market activity.
","(2) The bank credit proxy in November also ran a little above
earlier projections, and the gap widened in early December. In addition
to private demand deposits, U.S. Government deposits are larger than
expected, reflecting sales of special securities to foreign official
holders. Banks have continued to substitute time deposits for commercial
paper and, until very recently, for Euro-dollars. Since the Board's
December 1 announcement of regulatory actions affecting the opportunity
cost of obtaining such funds, Euro-dollar borrowings have increased somewhat,
although some of the increase may be seasonal.

supply and the adjusted credit proxy.

","(4) During the period since the mid-November Committee meeting,
the Federal funds rate was moved down into a 5--5-1/2 per cent range, in
the interest of promoting desired growth in the money supply. Most
recently, Federal funds have been trading at the lower end of the indicated
range, occasionally even dipping below, despite sizable Desk reserve
absorbing operations. Member bank borrowings averaged $370 million in
the past two statement weeks, not much above minimal levels, and about
$60 million below the October-November average. Net borrowed reserves
averaged around $100 million in the past two statement weeks, about $130
million below the October-November average,
","(5) The downtrend of market interest rates, begun earlier in
the quarter, was sharply extended during the inter-meeting period, with
yield declines in some short-term markets ranging to as much as another
to 5/8 percentage point. Further reductions in the prime rate and the
discount rate, continued weakness in the economy, and anticipations of
still further easing of monetary policy contributed to these declines.
In the Treasury bill market, the key 3-month issue was most recently quoted
around 4.85 per cent, about 40 basis points below its level at the time
of the Committee meeting. The decline in long-term market yields occurred
despite the very heavy calendars of new corporate and municipal bond
offerings. Desk buying of nearly $300 million of Treasury coupon issues
over the period contributed marginally to the declines in long-term rates.
","(6) The following table summarizes seasonally adjusted annual
rates of change in major financial aggregates for selected periods.

Prospective developments
","(7) Given recent developments, and with a Federal funds
rate generally in a 5--5-1/4 per cent range, it appears that the money
supply may grow at around a 9 per cent annual rate in December, and at
about a 5 per cent annual rate for the fourth quarter. As to the
adjusted bank credit proxy, it may be expected to expand at about a
the fourth quarter. The more rapid growth of the credit proxy in
December, as compared with October-November, reflects not only greater
expansion in private demand deposits but also larger inflows of U.S.
Government and time deposits. Banks have issued a sizable amount of
large CD's in recent weeks, in part to acquire securities at a time of
declining interest rate expectations and partly in anticipation of
seasonal CD run-offs in the latter part of December.
","(8) Against the background of a 5 per cent growth rate for
money supply over the fourth quarter, the table on the following page
shows three alternative growth paths for money, bank credit, and total
reserves for the first quarter. Alternative A involves a 5 per cent
money growth rate; alternative B, 6 per cent; and alternative C, 7 per
cent. The last section of the text (paragraphs 14 through 19) discusses
possible directive language for various policy courses.
","(9) The bank credit proxy figures shown in the table assume,
for alternatives A and B, no further decline in Euro-dollar borrowings
from recent levels. This neutral assumption seems to be about the best
we can make, given uncertainties as to the ultimate pattern of bank

response to recent Board actions and as to the likely changes in the
recent substantial differentials in costs of Euro-dollars as against
domestic funds. Even under these alternatives, it should be recognized
that a resumption of decline in Euro-dollar borrowings is a real possi-
bility. Under alternative C, declining market interest rates would
very likely encourage some further shift away from Euro-dollar borrow-
ings absent additional Board action. Outstanding bank-related commercial
paper is expected to continue declining, though at a slower pace. In
general, growth in time and savings deposits other than large CD's may
be dampened as post-strike auto sales tend to impinge on the personal
saving rate. Under alternative A, such growth is projected to be a
little less in the first quarter than in the fourth, but under alterna-
tives B and C, time deposits are assumed to grow somewhat more rapidly
because market interest rates would be relatively lower. Bank interest
in large CD's is likely to be fairly strong, as they continue to want
to acquire market securities and as business loan demand picks up.
","(10) The range of money market conditions, as typified by
the Federal funds rate, that would be expected to be consistent over
the next few weeks with the various paths for the aggregates are
summarized below.
Annual rates of increase
in money supply
Federal funds rate 4th Qtr. 1st Qtr.
Weekly figures for the aggregates between now and the next FOMC meeting
consistent with these paths are shown in the table on page 9.
","(11) In the case of alternative A, the Federal funds range
is wide enough to allow for some tightening from recent levels. This
may be required to limit money growth in the first quarter to 5 per
cent should the Greenbook projection of a 10-1/2 per cent annual rate
of growth in nominal GNP in the first quarter be realized. Since the
last meeting of the Committee, the demand for money has proven to be
somewhat stronger, at given Federal funds rates, than the staff antici-
pated. This greater demand may have been temporary, however, resulting
from a sudden surge in financial market transactions, as noted earlier.
Because of uncertainties as to the source of recent money demand and as
to transactions needs associated with such a large bulge in prospective
GNP growth, a fairly wide Federal funds rate range is also shown for
alternatives B and C. If demand for money at given Federal funds rates
continues to be greater than anticipated--as a result of financial
transactions or the need to finance a temporary large post-strike bulge
in GNP--the Committee may be faced with the possibility of either per-
mitting the Federal funds rate to rise above the ranges shown in
paragraph (10) for any particular alternative chosen, or permitting,
at least temporarily, a higher money growth rate than contemplated.
","(12) Between now and the next Committee meeting (mid-
January), the 3-month Treasury bill rate may move through intervals
of both downward and upward pressure, in response to a succession of
seasonal and post auto-strike influences. Consequently, the yield

loney Supply

may fluctuate in a 4-1/2--5 per cent range, assuming the Federal funds
rate stays around 5--5-1/8 per cent and the net reserve position of banks
is mostly on the negative side, with borrowings at minimal levels (apart
from necessitous borrowing of two banks). If the Federal funds rate
were to move above this range--for example, in order to restrain money
supply growth--an appreciable rise in the 3-month bill rate might
develop; the bill rate might move back up to around 5-1/4 per cent, and
the downward tendency of other interest rates might well be reversed.
If, on the other hand, the Federal funds rate were to be persistently
below 5 per cent, the bill rate might move toward the lower end of, or
even below, the range shown, particularly in view of the absence of a
Treasury cash financing in January. A declining bill rate would likely
be accompanied by some downdrift in other short-term rates, although
yield spreads of other short rates over the bill rate have narrowed
since early November. Any further downdrift in short rates would
intensify pressures for a further reduction in the prime rate.
","(13) Long-term interest rates may move downward somewhat
further even in the absence of short-term rate declines, reflecting a
seasonal pick-up in long-term fund flows after year-end and some
moderation in the supply of securities coming to market. There will
be the usual lull in new corporate and municipal issues between now
and the turn of the year; although sizable offerings seem likely in
January, the volume in prospect appears to be somewhat below recent
months. Agency offerings are likely to diminish further in view of
the greater availability of credit at private financial institutions.
The next Treasury financing--its mid-February refunding--will not be
announced until January 20, shortly after the mid-January FOMC meeting.
No significant amounts of new cash are likely to be raised by the Treasury
until around the time of this refunding and then again in March. Under
the circumstances, if short-term interest rates do show a sustained
downward tendency in the period immediately ahead, a considerable rally
in bond markets may again develop.
Possible directive language
","(14) This section presents possible language for the second
paragraph of the directive for the three alternative policy courses
discussed above, as well as a fourth possibility involving renewal of
the present directive language.
","(15) Alternative A. This alternative is proposed for possible
use if the Committee decides upon a 5 per cent target growth rate for the
money supply in the first quarter:
To implement this policy, the Committee seeks to promote
[DEL: some easing of conditions in credit markets and moderate growth
in money and attendant bank credit expansion over the months
ahead with allowance for temporary shifts in money and credit
demands related to the auto strike.] System open market opera-
tions until the next meeting of the Committee shall be conducted
with a view to maintaining bank reserves and money market con-
ditions consistent with those objectives.
Deletion of the phrase ""some easing of conditions in credit markets"" is
proposed in light of the analysis in paragraphs (10) and (11) above
suggesting that some rise in the Federal funds rate might be required as
the quarter progresses to keep the money supply growth rate from exceed-
ing 5 per cent. While some rise in the Federal funds rate would not
necessarily be inconsistent with continued declines in long-term rates,
particularly if over-all credit demands slacken, it is assumed that the
Committee would not want to indicate that it was seeking ""to promote""
some easing of credit market conditions under a policy course that
contemplates the possibility of some firming of money market conditions.
","(16) As indicated, it is also proposed to delete the clause
""with allowance for temporary shifts in money and credit demands related
to the auto strike."" This clause had been included in the previous
directive to reflect the Committee's willingness, for reasons related
to the auto strike, to accept money growth rates in the fourth and first
quarters that were, respectively, below and above its longer-run target
rate. At present, however, if the Committee adopts this alternative
its target for the first quarter presumably will not exceed its target
for the longer run. (For the same reason, deletion of the clause in
question is proposed in the two following alternatives also.)
","(17) Alternative B. This alternative is proposed for
possible use if the Committee decides to set its target for money at
the 6 per cent rate indicated by the revised data to have prevailed
in the three quarters before the auto strike:
To implement this policy, the Committee seeks to promote
some easing of conditions in credit markets and moderate growth
in money [DEL:and attendant bank credit expansion over the months
ahead AT ABOUT THE AVERAGE RATE PREVAILING IN THE FIRST THREE
QUARTERS OF 1970, with ATTENDANT BANK CREDIT EXPANSION allowance
for temporary shifts in money and credit demands related to the
auto strike.] System open market operations until the next
meeting of the Committee shall be conducted with a view to main-
taining bank reserves and money market conditions consistent
with those objectives.
(8) Alternative C. This alternative is suggested for
possible use if the Committee decides to step up its target growth
rate for money to 7 per cent:
To implement this policy, the Committee seeks to promote
some easing of conditions in credit markets and moderate
SOMEWHAT MORE RAPID growth in money [DEL: and attendant bank credit
expansion over the months ahead THAN PREVAILED IN THE FIRST
THREE QUARTERS OF 1970, with ATTENDANT BANK CREDIT EXPANSION
allowance for temporary shifts in money and credit demands
related to the auto strike.] System open market operations
until the next meeting of the Committee shall be conducted
with a view to maintaining bank reserves and money market
conditions consistent with those objectives.
Deletion of the word ""some"" from the statement that ""the Committee
seeks to promote some easing of conditions in credit markets"" is
suggested because of the greater degree of credit market easing likely
to ensue under this policy course.
","(19) Alternative D. There remains the possibility that, in
light of the expected first-quarter surge in nominal GNP in the aftermath
of the auto strike, the Committee may wish to accept a temporarily
higher money growth rate during the first quarter than it would contemplate
at this time for the longer run. To articulate such a policy, the
Committee could decide simply to renew the second paragraph of the
existing directive without change:
To implement this policy, the Committee seeks to promote
some easing of conditions in credit markets and moderate growth
in money and attendant bank credit expansion over the months
ahead, with allowance for temporary shifts in money and credit
demands related to the auto strike. System open market operations
until the bext meeting of the Committee shall be conducted with a
view to maintaining bank reserves and money market conditions
consistent with those objectives.
If the Committee adopts this alternative it could instruct the Manager to
maintain essentially prevailing money market conditions--as typified
by a Federal funds rate of 5 to 5-1/4 per cent--so long as the money
supply in the weeks ahead appears to be on a path consistant with growth
in the first quarter at an annual rate in a range between, say, 5 and 7
per cent.

1971-01-12,1971-01-12,"(1) Weekly deposit data now available on a preliminary basis
through December 30 and on a partial basis through January 6 indicate
that growth in the narrowly-defined money supply was at an annual rate
of about 6.7 per cent on average in December, and only about 3.6 per
cent for the fourth quarter. While the rate of growth in money supply
during December exceeded that of any previous month since August, it
still fell appreciably short of the projected 9.5 per cent rebound that
was indicated at the last meeting of the Committee. Moreover, the
November money supply growth rate was revised downward to 2.8 per cent
from the 4.5 per cent rate estimated in mid-December. The combination
of these developments resulted in a fourth quarter money supply growth
rate that was about 1-1/2 percentage points below the roughly 5 per
cent rate of growth that had been expected in consequence of the FOMC's
decision at the last meeting. In the case of the adjusted bank credit
proxy, it too grew somewhat less in December than had been indicated
at the mid-December meeting, but the rate of growth was still substan-
tial as extremely strong time deposit growth more than offset further
declines in non-deposit funds. The latest estimates and the original
target paths for the various monetary aggregates are compared in the
following table:

","(2) That there might be a significant shortfall in money supply
did not become evident until December 28, although there were some tentative
indications of the direction of movement just before the long Christmas
weekend. During the final days of December, it was still not known
whether the preliminary estimate of a shortfall for the week of the
how much of a year-end bulge in deposits might develop from the widely
predicted heavy seasonal repatriation of Euro-dollars by corporations
seeking to comply with balance of payments regulations. By January 4,
however, more complete data indicated that the drop in the week of the
flected the accompanying very large pay-off of business loans and a
marked increase in the Treasury balance.
","(3) The day-to-day behavior of the Federal funds rate since
the last meeting of the Committee has been particularly volatile, as is
often the case during the period around year-end. During the last two
statement weeks of December the funds rate averaged 4.83 per cent, and
then in the week ending January 6 it dropped to 3.82 per cent, largely
because bank reluctance to borrow on the year-end statement date produced
a low Federal funds rate which carried through the turn-of-the year holiday
weekend. In the past two days, Federal funds have been trading mostly
in a range of 4-3/8--4-3/4 per cent, with the Desk aiming most recently
at about 4-1/2 per cent rate in view of the weakness that has developed
in the aggregates. Net free reserves averaging about $120 million were
published for the last two statement weeks, with year-end maneuvering
and bad weather conditions leading to sizable excess reserves.
","(4) After a period of hesitation and even back-up in the
last half of December, interest rates have declined in the last two
days, with the largest drop in corporate bond yields. In early
January the bank prime loan rate was reduced to 6-1/2 per cent, following
the reduction to 6-3/4 per cent just before Christmas. The Federal
Reserve discount rate was cut another 1/4 point to 5-1/4 per cent
effective January 8; this reduction had already been well discounted by
the market. Most recently the 3-month bill was quoted around 4.75 per

Prospective developments
","(6) Taking the December figures as a starting point, the
table on the next page shows three patterns of growth for the monetary
aggregates over the first quarter which the Committee may wish to
consider. The three growth paths shown for the narrowly-defined money
supply present alternatives that take account in differing ways of the
recent shortfalls relative to expectations, as follows:
(A) Alternative A shows a pattern consistent with a 6 per
cent annual rate of growth for M1 over the first quarter of 1971. This
would be equal to the rate of growth for the quarter that the Committee
indicated as the minimum acceptable at its last meeting, at a time when
it was expected that fourth quarter growth would be 5 per cent. Thus
alternative A does not make up for the fourth quarter shortfall. The
growth rate for the fourth and first quarters taken together would be
only about 4-3/4 per cent, as compared with the 5-1/2 per cent previously
desired. As a result, under alternative A the March level of the money
supply would be about $1 billion below previous expectations.
(B) Alternative B shows a growth path for the first quarter
which makes up for the shortfall in December and in the fourth quarter.
The first quarter growth rate in this alternative is 7-1/2 per cent,
which would lead to a March level for the money stock equal to that
resulting from the earlier 5-1/2 per cent path for the fourth and first
quarters taken together.
(C) Alternative C, which has an 8-1/2 per cent annual rate of
growth in the first quarter for M1, makes up for the shortfall and raises
the growth rate in money supply for the September-to-March period back up
to the 6 per cent rate of expansion experienced over the first three
quarters of 1970.

","(7) The range of money market conditions, as typified by
the Federal funds rate, expected to be consistent over the next few
weeks with the various paths for the aggregates are noted below. The
large increases in the money stock, given the Federal funds rate, depend
mainly on the resurgence in economic activity expected to result from the
catch-up in GM auto output during the first quarter. How strong a
resurgence will develop and how such a temporary bulge will affect
money demand are additional uncertainties that compound the usual
difficulties of specifying relationships between money market conditions
and monetary aggregates.

","(8) The weekly paths between now and the next meeting for the
various alternatives are shown in the table on the next page.
","(9) Realization of alternative A aggregates would require, in
the staff's judgment, pushing the Federal funds rate up from its recent
trading range of around 4-1/2 per cent. With nominal GNP projected to
rise at an 11.7 per cent rate in the first quarter, strong transaction
demands for money and a pick-up in short-term private credit demands are
expected. Should the GNP projection and these money and credit demands
be realized, short-term rates would rise in the process of keeping money
growth down to 6 per cent. Although a tightening of the money market
following a reduction in the discount rate would be rather puzzling

to the market, it would probably be interpreted as an effort to keep
short rates up, and, with some lag, the 3-month bill rate would likely
move back up toward the new 5-1/4 per cent discount rate. Marginal
reserve measures would be tighter than recently prevailing.
","(10) Under alternative B, the money market may have to be
eased from currently prevailing conditions; the funds rate was around
half of the 4--4-3/4 per cent range specified. The 3-month bill rate
would likely go into a 4--4-5/8 per cent range, but may not drop to the
lower end of the range unless the Federal funds rate falls to 4 per cent
or below for a sustained period of time. Under alternative C, which
would probably require a funds rate below 4 per cent, the bill rate might
also decline below 4 per cent, although expectations that rates were
bottoming out might tend to inhibit such a decline in the 3-month rate.
In either case, movements in the bill rate would be influenced by ex-
pectations as to future discount rate actions as well as by the nature of
forthcoming Treasury financings.
","(11) The Treasury is expected to announce its mid-February
refunding on January 20. Books will be open until Wednesday, January 27
on the exchange portion, and if there is a cash portion, an auction would
be likely and would be held in early February. About $5 billion of
publicly-held securities mature in February, but the Treasury is also
likely to include in the exchange $1 billion of maturing March coupon
issues, and may pre-refund other later maturing issues. A large refunding
that accomplishes a noticeable amount of debt extension would tend to
lower short-term interest rates,-partly as a result of demand for bills
from holders of maturing issues not wishing to lengthen. Recent upward
adjustments in interest rates on intermediate-term Government securities
were partly in anticipation of such an enlarged refunding.
","(12) With the forthcoming Treasury refunding probably largely
discounted by the market, with recent corporate issues well received, and
in light of the still large spread of long- over short-term rates, it
seems likely that longer-term interest rates will drop further, except
under conditions specified for alternative A. Interest rate declines
would tend to accelerate should the Federal funds rate move down
significantly from prevailing levels.
","(13) Banks over the period ahead are likely to continue to be
aggressive buyers of municipal and U.S. Government securities in order to
lock in existing yields, Even though business loan demand may rise, net
inflows of total deposits to banks are likely to be sufficiently strong
to leave them with a substantial surplus of investment funds. Growth
in time and savings deposits other than CD's, as well as large CD's, may
slow somewhat from the advanced rate of the last half of 1970, in light
of the projected acceleration in consumer durable goods spending, but
is still likely to remain vigorous. Relatively more expansion in time
deposits would be expected under alternatives B and C, in view of the
anticipated further declines in market interest rates. With respect to
nondeposit sources, banks will become even less willing holders of Euro-
dollars to the extent that domestic short-term interest rates decline
further relative to Euro-dollar rates. The actual movement of bank Euro-
dollar holdings will depend in large part on any further official action
that may be taken to affect them. For the present projection, we have
assumed a further drop in Euro-dollar holdings of about $300 to $400
million per month under Alternatives B and C.
Possible directive language
","(14) This section presents possible language for the second
paragraph of the directive for the three alternative policy courses dis-
cussed above. As will be noted, all three alternatives have the same
second sentence, calling for bank reserves and money market conditions
consistent with the objectives described in the first sentence. Also,
the second sentence includes a reference to the forthcoming Treasury
financing; as mentioned in paragraph (11), above, an announcement of
the terms of this financing is expected on January 20. Finally, it will
be noted that the structure of all three alternatives is similar to that
in the directives the Committee was issuing before the December 15 meet-
ing; it has been assumed that the Committee adopted a different structure
in the second paragraph of the December 15 directive primarily because of
special circumstances it expected to prevail during the period, encompass-
ing the year-end, to which that directive applied.
","(15) Alternative A. This alternative is proposed for possible
use if the Committee decides upon a 6 per cent target growth rate for the
money supply in the first quarter, despite the shortfall in the fourth
quarter from the 5 per cent rate that had been expected at the time of the
last meeting.

Unlike alternatives B and C below, the first sentence of this alternative
does not indicate that the Committee desires to promote easier conditions
in credit markets. Such a statement has been omitted since this directive
might entail tighter money market conditions with potential consequences
for credit markets generally.
","(19) Alternative B. This alternative is proposed for possible
use if the Committee decides that the fourth-quarter shortfall in money
should be made up in the first quarter. As indicated in paragraph (6B)
above, attainment of the average March level of money contemplated by the
Committee at the December 15 meeting would involve a growth rate for money
over the first quarter of about 7-1/2 per cent.
To implement this policy, THE COMMITTEE SEEKS TO PROMOTE
SOME EASING OF CONDITIONS IN CREDIT MARKETS AND MODERATE GROWTH
IN MONEY AND ATTENDANT BANK CREDIT EXPANSION. System open

provided that the expected rates of growth in money and
bank credit will at least be achieved].
The phrase ""some easing of conditions in credit markets"" has been
reintroduced here in line with the expectation noted in paragraphs (10)
and (12). That interest rates--encompassing intermediate- and longer-
term as well as short-term rates--would decline under this alternative.
","(20) Alternative C. This alternative is proposed for
possible use if the Committee decides to seek growth in money over the
first quarter at a faster rate than would be required simply to make
up the fourth quarter shortfall. One possible growth rate under this
alternative--8-1/2 per cent--was noted in paragraph (6C) above.
To implement this policy, THE COMMITTEE SEEKS TO
PROMOTE EASING OF CONDITIONS IN CREDIT MARKETS AND MORE
RAPID GROWTH IN MONEY, WITH ATTENDANT BANK CREDIT
EXPANSION, OVER THE MONTHS AHEAD. System open market
operations UNTIL THE NEXT MEETING OF THE COMMITTEE shall
be conducted with a view to maintaining BANK RESERVES

CONSISTENT WITH THOSE OBJECTIVES, TAKING ACCOUNT OF THE
FORTHCOMING TREASURY FINANCING [DEL: until the next meeting of the
Committee, provided that the expected rates of growth in
money and bank credit will at least be achieved].
Whereas alternative B includes a statement to the effect that ""the
Committee seeks to promote some easing of conditions in credit markets,""
the word ""some"" is omitted in the corresponding statement in this alter-
native. This difference reflects the expectation that interest rates
would decline somewhat more under this alternative--which calls for
""more rapid growth in money""--than under alternative B.

1972-10-17,1972-10-17,"(1) The narrowly-defined money supply grew at a 6 per cent annual
rate in September, little more than in August and well below the 11 per cent
annual rate projected in the Blue Book at the time of the last Committee
meeting. It turned out that half of the $2 billion bulge in M1 that
developed over the two statement weeks ending September 6--which included
the long Labor Day weekend--was immediately reversed, and the level of M1
remained reduced throughout the month. Because of the marked shortfall in
M1, growth of M2 in September was also below expectations, although less so
than M1 due to a slightly stronger than anticipated growth in time deposits.
","(2) For much of the inter-meeting period RPD growth also appeared
to be running below the 9-1/2 to 13-1/2 per cent September-October target
range. Most recently, however, unexpectedly large excess reserves have
raised the indicated RPD growth rate for the two months to 10-1/2 per cent
(with about two percentage points representing larger excess reserves than
assumed at the time of the Committee meeting).
","(3) In view of the Committee's desire to attain a lower rate of
growth in M1 and other aggregates than had been projected, and with credit
market conditions calming, the Federal funds rate was allowed to edge up a
little over the inter-meeting period. On a weekly average basis, the range
of movement was from 4.93 per cent in the week of the last meeting to a high
of 5.15 per cent. This latter rate was on the high side of the Desk's aim,
and in the most recent statement week the funds rate averaged 5.09 per cent.
","(4) Most other short-term interest rates have also risen somewhat
since the last meeting of the Committee. The 3-month bill rate has been most
recently quoted at 4.85 per cent, up about 20 basis points since
the last meeting. The prevailing bank prime rate moved up to 5-3/4 per cent,
and two banks with a floating prime rate went to 5-7/8 per cent today.
Most long-term rates, on the other hand, have shown little change since the
last Committee meeting, except that municipal bond yields have declined
fairly substantially. Stability in bond markets in part reflected recent
rumors of an imminent peace settlement in Vietnam and possibly also hopes
for favorable Congressional action on an expenditure ceiling. In these
circumstances, the Treasury elected to meet its October cash needs by
auctioning a $2 billion two-year note. The average rate in the auction
was 5.86 per cent, but following allotment the price of the issue dropped
by about the estimated value of the tax and loan account credit and the
market yield rose to 5.95 per cent.

Prospective developments
","(6) The approach taken in this blue book differs in some respects
from previous practice--the principal difference being to puc more stress on
targets and less on projections. The table on the following page shows possible
longer-run targets for key monetary aggregates which the Committee may wish to
consider in setting its financial objectives. The longer-run relationships
among monetary aggregates and interest rates are discussed in paragraphs (7) to
","(9). Suggested shorter-run operating targets that are thought to be generally
consistent with the longer-run objectives are presented in paragraphs (10) to
","(7) to
(9). Suggested shorter-run operating targets that are thought to be generally
consistent with the longer-run objectives are presented in paragraphs (10) to
(7) The longer-run targets under alternative A are indexed by an
M1 annual growth rate of 7 per cent in each of the fourth and first quarters.
We would expect that there may be only a modest further rise in short-term
interest rates in the fourth quarter under this alternative. In the first
quarter, with the rate of increase in nominal GNP projected to continue strong
and with large contra-seasonal Treasury cash borrowing anticipated, short-term
rates seem likely to rise more rapidly. The timing of interest rate movements
cannot, of course, be predicted with any certainty. It is always possible,
for example, that sizable foreign central bank transactions may affect the bill
market. Also, interest rates could rise substantially late this year as the
market anticipated heavy Treasury first quarter credit demands. On balance, one
might anticipate a 3-month Treasury bill rate rising to a 5-1/2--5-3/4 per cent
area by the end of the first quarter.
","(8) Under alternatives B and C (indexed by 6 per cent and 5 per
cent annual rates of growth in M1, respectively) the staff would expect upward

pressure on short-term interest rates to emerge sooner and to carry rates to
higher levels than under alternative A. It is likely that Treasury bill rates
by some time in early 1973 would move above ceiling rates on consumer-type
time deposits (for which the highest rate is 5-3/4 per cent on 2-year and over
maturities), thus raising the odds on a substantial slowing in time deposit
inflows to banks by late in the first quarter. As a result, M2 growth,
particularly under alternative C, is targeted to slow more than M1 growth.
Net inflows to nonbank savings institutions, whose ceiling rates on time
certificates are 1/4 percentage point higher than banks, would also come
under pressure, though not importantly perhaps until the second quarter.
(9) In long-term markets, credit demand pressures from private
sectors are expected to remain moderate into the winter. However, given its
large cash needs, the Treasury seems likely to tap all possible sources,
including the bond market, to satisfy its financing requirements. In general,
though, long-term markets are most vulnerable to upward rate pressures from
the supply of funds side. The institutional supply of funds would likely be
constrained under alternative C, and to a smaller degree under B. And as
interest rates began to rise, there might be some temporary investor withdrawal
from long-term commitments of funds.

(7) The longer-run targets under alternative A are indexed by an
M1 annual growth rate of 7 per cent in each of the fourth and first quarters.

Net inflows to nonbank savings institutions, whose ceiling rates on time
certificates are 1/4 percentage point higher than banks, would also come
under pressure, though not importantly perhaps until the second quarter.
(9) In long-term markets, credit demand pressures from private
sectors are expected to remain moderate into the winter. However, given its
large cash needs, the Treasury seems likely to tap all possible sources,
including the bond market, to satisfy its financing requirements. In general,
though, long-term markets are most vulnerable to upward rate pressures from
the supply of funds side. The institutional supply of funds would likely be
constrained under alternative C, and to a smaller degree under B. And as
interest rates began to rise, there might be some temporary investor withdrawal
from long-term commitments of funds.
(10) Suggested short-run operating targets for the two month
October-November period are shown below for the various alternatives
described above:
Alt. A Alt. B Alt. C
","(11) The suggested operating targets indicate ranges for the
two month October-November period for the average growth rates of reserves,
for average growth rates for money supply as variously measured, and for
money market conditions as represented by the Federal funds rate. The mid-
points of the RPD ranges are thought to be consistent with the mid-points
of M1 and M2 growth rates for each of the alternatives. All of the Federal
funds rate ranges encompass current money market conditions, with the range
being wide enough to make it reasonably probable that aggregate objectives
under the various alternatives would be attained. Under alternative A, the
Federal funds rate range centers on recently prevailing conditions, and the
staff would expect that realization of the targeted growth rates in the aggre-
gates would produce little movement in the average funds rate. Under
alternative B, the funds rate range is skewed above prevailing rate levels,
indicating our expectations that restraining monetary growth to the rates
targeted would induce a rise in the funds rate. Under alternative C, the
range is skewed even more in an upward direction.
","(12) While the Committee could direct the Account Manager to utilize
the operating targets shown above in any one of several ways, it may wish to
consider the following approach which is similar to the procedure followed by
the Committee in recent meetings. Under the proposed approach if RPD appears
to be moving toward the high end of the indicated range, for example, the Desk
would become somewhat more grudging in supplying nonborrowed reserves and
still more grudging if RPD seemed to be exceeding the range--but not to the
extent of forcing the funds rate above whatever upper limit the Committee might
specify. But in judging whether to take reserve action that tightens (or
eases) the money market, the Desk would be guided also by developments in the
monetary aggregates. For instance, if the monetary aggregates appear to be
remaining within the Committee's targeted range, the Manager would not have to
take any reserve action that tightens or eases the money market, even though
RPD is running high or low in its range. (Under such circumstances, it would
be presumed that unanticipated changes in the multiplier relationship between
reserves and monetary aggregates had occurred.) If, on the other hand,
monetary aggregates should move outside the Committee's targeted range, the
Desk would modify reserve-supplying operations in the appropriate direction,
subject to the federal funds rate constraint. The funds rate ranges shown
in paragraph (10)can, of course, be modified by the Committee on policy
grounds, depending upon how much emphasis it wants to place on limiting
possible variations in interest rates, the degree to which it wishes to stress
growth rates for the aggregates, and the extent to which it wants to take
account of special circumstances of the moment such as ""even keel"".
","(13) In the interval between now and the next meeting, the
around prevailing levels. The Treasury may again add about $200 million per
week to its weekly bill auctions beginning in November. In addition, it
appears now that the Treasury, because of a tight cash position, will have
to lower its cash balance at the Fed in the first half of November, forcing
the System to undertake offsetting operations. Given the improved technical
position of the market, however, we would not expect sizable upward rate
pressures in the near-term--for example, the 3-month bill rate is not likely
to move much above 5 per cent--unless the funds rate were to move up
appreciably. Similarly, near-term pressures in long-term markets would
likely be quite modest, given the moderation of private credit demands, if
prevailing money market conditions are maintained.
","(14) The recent Treasury cash offering and the forthcoming
financing to be announced on October 25 would, however, augment the
sensitivity of long- and short-term credit markets to a persistent firming
of money market conditions. In addition to refinancing a small amount of
securities maturing in mid-November, the forthcoming Treasury operation
may also raise new cash, perhaps about $2 billion.
Proposed directives
","(15) Presented below are three alternative formulations for the
operational paragraph of the directive, which might be taken to correspond
to the similarly lettered policy alternatives discussed in the preceding
Alternative A
""To implement this policy, while taking [DEL: special] account of
the effects of possible bank regulatory changes, TREASURY FINANCING
OPERATIONS, AND developments in credit markets, [DEL: and international
developments,] the Committee seeks to achieve bank reserve and money
market conditions that will support SOMEWHAT more moderate growth
in monetary aggregates over the months ahead THAN RECORDED IN THE
THIRD QUARTER.""
Alternative B
""To implement this policy, while taking [DEL: special] account of
the effects of possible bank regulatory changes, TREASURY FINANCING
OPERATIONS, AND developments in credit markets, [DEL: and international
developments,] the Committee seeks to achieve bank reserve and money
market conditions that will support more moderate growth in monetary
aggregates over the months ahead THAN RECORDED IN THE THIRD QUARTER.""
Alternative C
""To implement this policy, while taking [DEL: special] account of
the effects of possible bank regulatory changes, TREASURY FINANCING
OPERATIONS, AND developments in credit markets, [DEL: and international
developments,] the Committee seeks to achieve bank reserve and money
market conditions that will support [DEL: more] moderate growth in monetary
aggregates over the months ahead.""
","(16) In all three alternatives, it is proposed to retain the
references to possible bank regulatory changes and credit market developments;
to add a reference to Treasury financing, particularly because of the November
refinancing to be announced in late October; and to delete the reference to
international developments, in view of the recent strength of the dollar.
Also, it is proposed to delete the word ""special"" in the phrase ""while
taking special account. . . ."" because of the recently improved technical
condition of credit markets.
","(17) In alternatives A and B, which call, respectively, for
""somewhat more"" and ""more"" moderate growth in monetary aggregates over the
months ahead, it is proposed to add the phrase ""than recorded in the third
quarter."" This addition is proposed in the interest of clarity, since the
long-run monetary growth rates specified under these alternatives, while
below the third-quarter rates, are equal to or above those recorded in
August and September.

1973-01-16,1973-01-16,"(1) RPD and the money supply aggregates all appear to be
expanding at rates well above the upper limits of the Committee's
December-January ranges of tolerance, as shown in the following table.
For December alone, growth of M1 and M2 accelerated to annual rates of
revisions).1/ Growth of M1 in the fourth quarter was at an 8.6 per
cent annual rate, and growth for all of 1972 at an 8.2 per cent rate.
Although levels of M1 and M 2 both receded somewhat in early January, they
remained high relative to earlier projections.

In December-January Period

Tolerance Estimates
","(2) Contra-seasonal December increases in State and local
Government holdings of both demand and time deposits suggest that--as
expected--revenue sharing payments did contribute importantly to recent
growth of the money supply aggregates. In the case of M1, this contri-
bution apparently accounted for about 3 percentage points of the
December growth. No other special contributing factors have been docu-
mented, however; for example, a System telephone survey of banks parti-
cularly affected by Regulation J and the establishment of new RCC's
turned up little evidence of bank requests for increased compensatory
balances from corporations or others. The most plausible explanation of
recent rapid monetary growth thus appears to be the stimulus to trans-
actions demands generated by strong economic expansion.
","(3) Shortly after the last Committee meeting, incoming deposit
data indicated that the reserve and monetary aggregates were tending to
run above the upper limits of the Committee's ranges of tolerance, and the
extent of these overshoots widened as the inter-meeting period progressed.
Because the terms of the Treasury's new bond financing were announced at
about the time firm evidence of overshoots became available, the Desk was
somewhat inhibited in moving to resist these excesses. Within this ""even-
keel"" constraint, however, the Desk did hold back on the provision of
nonborrowed reserves, and the average Federal funds rate advanced nearly
week, the funds rate averaged around 5.65 per cent. Recently, trading
has been 5.75 per cent, with Desk strategy on the provision of reserves
expected to result in a funds rate ranging between 5-3/4 and 5-7/8 per cent.
","(4) Fluctuations in the rates at which Federal funds actually
traded were considerably wider than usual, ranging generally from as low
as 4-1/2 per cent to as high as 7 per cent. Large and erratic
day-to-day fluctuations in float contributed importantly
to this increased rate volatility by making it more difficult for both
banks and the Desk to manage reserve positions. In these circumstances
member bank borrowing was unusually heavy, particularly over the two long
holiday weekends. Average borrowings, however, dropped from $1.8 billion
in the New Year's holiday week to about $690 million in the latest week.
","(5) The general firming of money market conditions over the
inter-meeting period was accompanied by relatively modest advances in
other interest rates. In short-term markets these advances ranged from
changed to only about 10 basis points higher. Sizable demand for securities
--arising partly from the reinvestment of revenue-sharing payments--tended
to limit rate advances on the most liquid types of short-term instruments,
particularly short-maturity Treasury bills. The yield on 3-month bills,
for example, showed a net decline mid-way in the inter-meeting period.
But recently it has risen to about 5.25 per cent, with announcement of
the Phase III wage-price program exerting a modest bearish impact on credit
","(6) In the Treasury auction of its new 20-year bond demands from
reporting Government security dealers and other market professionals proved
to be stronger than anticipated, with their awards amounting to more than half
the total offering. Secondary market demand for the issue from final investors
was unenthusiastic at the unexpectedly low 6.79 per cent stop-out yield, and
the yield on the issue rose to 6.85 per cent as professionals
pressed to reduce their positions. Positions of reporting dealers have
declined substantially in the past few days, and most recently were
about $70 million

to provide a more precise indication of FOMC target paths from which
deviations can be measured. Strict adherence to a relatively narrow
RPD path may tend to lead to wider fluctuations in the Federal funds
rate. However, clear and significant shifts in the multiplier between
RPD and deposits could provide a basis for adjustment of the RPD path
in the inter-meeting period, depending on Committee preferences.
","(10) Alternative B shown in paragraph (8) encompasses longer-
run paths for the aggregates that include a 5--6 per cent annual rate of
growth for M1, the longer-run target specified by the Committee at its
last meeting. Alternative A provides for somewhat more rapid growth in
the aggregates and alternative C for somewhat less.
","(11) The short-run ranges of tolerance for the monetary
aggregates remain on the high side of longer-run targets. For example,
in alternative B, the January-February M 1 growth is indicated at
per cent, as compared with the 5--6 per cent longer-run target. It is
expected that revenue sharing payments in January and the beginning of
tax refunds next month will exert some temporary stimulus to growth in
holdings of cash and time and savings deposits.
","(12) All of the alternatives shown indicate a slowing in
the second quarter growth rate in M1 and M2 relative to the first quarter.
This reflects mainly (a) disappearance of the transitory upward effect on
M1 from sizable Treasury refunds of taxes and smaller final payments by
individuals, (b) the lagged effect on money demand of past interest rate
increases, and (c) in alternatives B and C, particularly, reduced public
interest in time and savings deposits other than large CD's as short-term
rates rise further above ceiling rates.
","(13) To achieve the aggregates of alternative B, the staff
expects that money market conditions will tighten from around prevail-
ing levels, given the continuing strong transaction demands for money
implicit in the rapid growth in nominal GNP projected for the first and
second quarters. The potential for money market tightening implied by
the alternative B monetary target paths is indicated by the 5-5/8--6-1/4
per cent Federal funds rate range shown for that alternative. Even with
RPD over the forthcoming January-February period rising in a 10--12 per
cent annual rate range, we would expect the funds rate to move up to
should be noted that even-keel considerations--discussed in paragraphs
","(16) and (17)--would suggest that the most propitious time for a rise
in the funds rate, should one be required, is before the end of January. A
rise in the funds rate of the dimensions contemplated in alternative B
would likely be accompanied by a further rise in short-term rates generally,
with the 3-month Treasury bill rate in particular moving upward in a

would be relatively strong, even with the discount rate at the recently
announced 5 per cent level, and the level of borrowings might be around $1
billion on average. However, as borrowings continue large,many banks will wear
out their welcome at the window and this will add further to pressure on
open market rates and on banks to restrict acquisitions of loans and
","(15) Efforts to achieve the reserve and monetary aggregates
of alternative C are likely to entail an even greater firming of money
market conditions, with the Federal funds rate probably moving well
above 6 per cent by the time of the next meeting. The 3-month bill
rate would likely rise into the 5-3/4--6 per cent area, if not by the
time of the next meeting then by early March when additional cash borrowing
through tax bill offerings may be anticipated. If short-term rates attain
these levels, there may be a rather marked dampening in flows of consumer-
type time and savings deposits, which could eventually call into question
the viability of current Regulation Q ceilings on such deposits.
(16) If the Committee were to opt to restrain growth in
reserves and monetary aggregates with the result that money market
conditions firmed, even-keel considerations would again be a constraint
on the timing of policy actions. Sufficient time has been given for
distribution of the recent long-term bond offering so that it no longer
appears to require special consideration. However, on January 31 the
Treasury will announce terms for refunding $4.8 billion of publicly-held
obligations that mature in mid-February. It is too early to have an
idea as to the nature of the refunding, although it does seem unlikely
at this point that new cash will need to be raised or that the Treasury
will wish to offer another long bond so close to the recent offering.
Thus, a relatively conventional exchange with short- and intermediate-term
options seems most likely.

Thus, a relatively conventional exchange with short- and intermediate-term
options seems most likely.
(17) However that may be, a significant tightening of the
money market between late January and mid-February seems precluded if the
Committee wishes to adhere to previous even-keel standards. Some slight
upward drift in money market rates would not necessarily be ruled out,
depending on the psychological atmosphere around the refunding, but the
great bulk of any tightening, should it be required, would have to be
accomplished within the next two weeks.
","(18) Alternative A indicates more expansive paths for the
reserve and monetary aggregates which are not likely to entail any
significant change in money market conditions from those recently pre-
vailing; this alternative, therefore, has the greatest probability of
minimizing conflicts between even-keel considerations and monetary
objectives. The funds rate under such conditions is likely to be most
frequently in the 5-3/8--5-7/8 per cent area. If the funds rate were to
remain near the upper end of that band, the 3-month bill rate probably
would be within a 5-1/4--5-1/2 per cent range over the next several weeks.
Upward bill rate pressures could be moderated in the near-term, however,
by demands for bills from State and local governments who have just
received their January revenue-sharing distribution. In addition, apart
from additions to the weekly and monthly bill auctions, the next sizable
bill offering is not expected until early March, as noted earlier.
","(19) Long-term interest rates may not rise very much under
alternative A, but would probably show greater upward adjustments, at
least in the short-run, under alternatives B and C. Demands on bond
markets can be expected to be generally moderate this month and next.
The near-term forward calendar of new corporate and municipal issues
is relatively modest in size, although there are indications that the
volume could build up in the spring. Mortgage market demands, though
remaining large in volume, appear to have crested. Pressures on long-
term rates are thus most likely to come from the supply side, as.banks
and other institutional investors find that their inflows of funds are
dropping off or becoming significantly more expensive--conditions most
likely to develop under alternatives B and C. Bank interest in secur-
ities and mortgages is likely to be lessened in any event as business
loan demands continue strong, partly to help businesses finance the
anticipated acceleration in the rate of inventory accumulation.
","(20) In addition to prospective credit flows, market psychol-
ogy will have a particularly important bearing in interest rate develop-
ments in the period ahead. The forthcoming budget message, the progress
of peace negotiations, and continuing evaluation of the new wage-price
program are major factors that will affect investor attitudes. Also,
market assessment of the likely course of monetary policy in the wake
of the recent discount rate action will be an important influence.
Proposed directives
","(21) Presented below are three alternative formulations for the
operational paragraph of the directive, which might be taken to correspond
to the similarly lettered policy alternatives discussed in the preceding
section. In all three alternatives it is proposed to retain a reference
to Treasury financing because of the regular February refinancing to be
announced on January 31. Retention of the reference to credit market
developments is suggested should the Committee wish to take account of
the possibility of excessive market reaction to further increases in the
funds rate, particularly in connection with alternatives B and C. The
credit market reference could also encompass adverse reactions to the
discount rate increase should they occur.
Alternative A
To implement this policy, while taking account of THE
FORTHCOMING Treasury financing [DEL: operations] and possible credit
market developments, the Committee seeks to achieve bank reserve
and money market conditions that will support [DEL: slower] SOME MODERATION

1973-05-15,1973-05-15,"(1) Both M1 and M2 appear to be expanding at annual rates somewhat
above the upper ends of the Committee's April-May ranges of tolerance. Growth
in RPD for the same period, however, seems to be falling short of its range,
as shown in the table. The divergent tendencies evident in money supply
and RPD expansion are attributable to a lower than anticipated average
level of excess reserves in May; to greater than anticipated growth in
currency, which swells M but does not absorb required reserves; and to a
difference (still partly projected) in the weekly pattern of deposits from
that projected earlier (which affects the required reserve component of RPD
with a lag).

","(2) The tendency for money supply growth to exceed the Committee's
target ranges became evident soon after the last meeting, and the Desk, while
May 11, 1973
taking account of even-keel, adopted a somewhat more reluctant reserve
supplying strategy. This was expected to raise the Federal funds rate from
the 6-7/8 to 7 per cent range prevailing at the time of the last meeting
into a 7-1/4--7-1/2 per cent range. In the week ending May 2 the average
funds rate rose to 7.43 per cent, and then in the most recent week to
averaged $1.7 billion, little different from the preceding four weeks.
","(3) The recent rise in the funds rate to more than 7-1/2 per
cent reflected unexpected shortages in the supply of reserves arising
partly from a large shortfall in float over the week-end of May 5, which
was partly related to delays in transfers of funds to banks because of a
computer failure. In response to developing money market tightness in the
most recent period, the Desk supplied reserves mainly through repurchase
agreements. The impact of the higher funds rate on market attitudes was
blunted by the reserve supplying efforts of the Desk, by the relatively
low volume of total dealer positions, and by the ready availability of
dealer financing at favorable rates from non-bank institutions.
","(4) During most of the inter-meeting period, interest rates on
market securities showed little net response to the rise in the Federal
funds rate. While average issuing rates in the auction of the Treasury's
new 6-7/8 per cent note and 7 per cent bond were apparently nudged upward,
these securities dropped somewhat in yield in the immediate post-auction
period, and yields on short-term bills declined about a quarter of a
percentage point, with the 3-month issue moving to just under 6 per cent.
This drop reflected both current and prospective shortages in the market
supply of Treasury bills. In addition to the usual April and June redemptions
of tax bills, the Treasury recently initiated a cut-back of its regular
bill auction by $100 million a week; $1.7 billion of the maturing May
securities will be redeemed--creating potential demands for bills; the
rest of the May maturities were refunded into longer-maturity notes and
bonds; and it was announced that the initial Treasury cash borrowing in
the new fiscal year might not come until early August.
","(5) Following the 1/4 point rise in the discount rate to 5-3/4
per cent on April 23, a further increase to 6 per cent was announced
Thursday. Yesterday's announcement was received relatively quietly by
the market. Bill rates initially adjusted upward about 10 basis points,
but rose further on Friday as the day progressed, perhaps in part due to
persisting money market tightness on that day. The 3-month bill most
recently was quoted 6.23 per cent bid. There were minor price declines
in Treasury and other bond markets. On balance, since the last Committee
meeting, corporate and municipal bond yields have changed little, while
mortgage rates have edged up and longer-term Government securities have
advanced about 1/8 of a percentage point in response to the Treasury's debt
lengthening operation.

","(8) Alternative B is consistent with the long run path for the
aggregates (as indexed by M1 growth of 5--5-1/2 per cent) adopted by the
Committee at recent meetings. Attainment of these longer-run objectives
might well involve some further tightening of the money market, with

the funds rate between now and the next Committee meeting probably moving
up toward the top of the 7-1/4--8 per cent range shown. This represents
somewhat tighter money market conditions than were specified at the time
of the last meeting as consistent with the given longer-run objectives for
the aggregates. This specification of tighter money market conditions re-
flects the greater strength of money supply in recent weeks and the sizable
upward revision in the projection of nominal GNP for the second quarter.
","(9) In May-June, M 1 growth is indicated to be less rapid than
in April. Income tax refunds will be tapering off in the forthcoming
period, and growth will also be held down by the cumulative impact of past
interest rate increases together with the restraint on reserve growth
targeted. By the third quarter, a further modest slowing in M 1 growth
would be needed to attain the longer-run target. This might be accomplished
without any additional tightening in money market conditions beyond the 7-1/4--8
per cent funds rate range, particularly if, as projected, the rate of growth
in GNP moderates.
","(10) Between now and the next Committee meeting the 3-month
Treasury bill rate is likely to move back up into a 6-1/4--6-5/8 per cent
range under alternative B. The recent rise in the discount rate and the
somewhat tauter money market conditions anticipated will put pressure on
dealer financing costs and will also give banks a further incentive to sell
or liquidate bills as compared with other forms of adjustment. In addition,
a $1--$2 billion drop in the Treasury balance at the Fed is anticipated prior
to mid-June tax receipts and this will cause the System to sell more bills
than otherwise into the market. The bill rate is still expected to remain
unusually low relative to the funds rate, however. The Treasury's favorable
cash position has enabled it to pay down maturing coupon issues and bills, and
the Treasury has also stressed debt lengthening in its refunding operations.
In this assessment of the bill market, we have not assumed any substantial
reflow of funds from abroad.
","(11) Pressure on bank liquidity positions is expected to persist
in the weeks ahead as bank lending continues to grow at a rapid pace. There
has been some moderation of business loan demands as the shift of commercial
paper borrowers to banks has abated. Nevertheless, the projected rapid
rate of business inventory accumulation and large plant and equipment outlays
indicate basic strength in credit demands.
","(12) These demands are likely to be financed in large part by
issuance of CD's in sizable volume, though diminished from the record first
quarter pace. If the cost of issuing CD's is increased (by raising reserve
requirements), the amount of CD's issued will probably be cut back some-
what because of the higher effective rate, banks will shift to other
forms of raising funds (such as selling securities), and lending terms to
business may righten somewhat further.
","(13) The availability of bank credit to finance demands will
also be dampened by an expected further slowing of net inflows of consumer-
type time and savings deposits as short-term interest rates edge higher.
The staff has not assumed a rise in Regulation Q ceilings that pertain to
such deposits. Given this assumption, a more marked slowing of consumer-
type time deposit flows is anticipated around the mid-year interest crediting
period and continuing into the third quarter, when Treasury bill rates are
expected to rise further.
","(14) Long-term interest rates seem likely to rise somewhat under
the conditions of alternative B partly as restraint on bank credit availa-
bility leads banks to participate relatively little as suppliers of funds
in securities markets. Reduced flows of funds to nonbank savings institu-
tions will also work toward upward pressure on mortgage rates and on debt
markets more generally as Federal agencies offer sizable amounts of
securities to help support the mortgage market. Demands on long-term bond
markets, however, still appear quite moderate, and this may permit a rise
in short rates to develop without significant impacts on long rates. But
expectations are very important in the determination of long rates, and
should monetary actions be interpreted as implying that credit will
tighten substantially further, or remain tight for a more extended period
than expected, long rates could well come under more upward pressure.
","(15) Alternative A indicates specifications that appear consis-
tent with a policy move toward a higher growth rate for the aggregates
than encompassed in alternative B. This alternative implies some easing
of money market conditions in the weeks ahead.
","(16) Under alternative C, which moves toward a lower long-run
growth rate for the aggregates, it would appear that the Federal funds
rate would probably have to rise above 8 per cent over the period imme-
diately ahead. Because of lags the main impact on M1 growth would not
occur until the third quarter, when--to achieve the 4--4-1/2 per cent
long-run objective--M1 growth would have to fall to a 3 per cent annual
rate. M2 growth also would slow sharply, given the significantly higher
short-term rates and assuming no increase in Regulation Q ceilings for
consumer-type time deposits. Given the low growth rates for the aggre-
gates expected for the third quarter under this alternative, the Committee may
find it necessary to ease money market conditions in the course of summer
if it desires to stay on the longer-run growth paths of alternative C
Proposed directive
","(17) Presented below are three alternative formulations for
the operational paragraph of the directive, which might be taken to
correspond to the similarly lettered policy alternatives discussed in the
preceding section. In light of the comments by a number of members at the
previous Committee meeting about the disadvantages of using such qualita-
tive terms as ""moderate"" or ""modest"" to characterize the desired growth
rates in the monetary aggregates, such objectives have been expressed
relative to the actual growth over the past 6 months. These 6-month growth
rates are shown in the table on page 4. The diverse behavior of the various
monetary aggregates, however, creates difficulties in characterizing future
targets in the same way relative to past performance for all aggregates.
","(18) The 6 month comparison works quite well for M1, since
the long-term target range specified under alternative B (5--5-1/2 per
cent) and the short-run range of tolerance encompass the 5-1/4 per cent
growth rate experience in the past 6 months; the ranges specified under
A and C are, respectively, somewhat above and somewhat below the 6-month
pace. For the bank credit proxy, actual growth over the past 6 months
exceeds both the long-run target and near-term expectations under all
three alternatives. For RPD and M2 , the situation is a little more compli-
cated, but for the most part the previous 6-month rates of expansion are
above specifications in the three alternatives (with some exceptions in
alternative A).
","(19) The directive language below attempts to take account of
the differences in specified future movement of the aggregates relative to
the past. As will be noted, an instruction to take account of credit market
developments is included in alternative C since the relatively sharp tightening
of money market conditions contemplated could lead to undesirably rapid
adjustments in credit markets generally.
Alternative A

and money market conditions consistent with SOMEWHAT FASTER

Committee's August-September range of tolerance, but M1 appears to be well
below and M2 is near the bottom of their respective ranges, as the table
shows. In August the narrowly defined money supply experienced a small
contraction instead of expanding slightly as projected, and growth of M2
at a 6-1/2 per cent annual rate was also substantially short of expecta-
tions. The smaller shortfall from target for M2 as compared with M1
reflects the continuing expansion in consumer-type time deposits, particu-

larly the 4-year wild card accounts. The fact that RPD's are growing around
the mid-point of their range of tolerance, even though the money supply
aggregates are low, stems from the Committee's decision to reduce (by two
per centage points) the whole range of tolerance for RPD's relative to
that shown in the Bluebook for alternative B, while dropping (by just one
per centage point) only the low ends of the ranges for M1 and M2 .
","(2) Early in the intermeeting period RPD's and the money supply
aggregates all appeared to be expanding at annual rates close to or above
the upper limits of the Committee's August-September ranges of tolerance.
By the end of August, although growth of M1 and M2 appeared to be slipping
to annual rates close to or below the low ends of their ranges, RPD's
continued to grow at a rate near the top of theirs. In view of the emphasis
on RPD's at the last meeting, the Account Manager adopted a reserve supplying
strategy early in the period under which the Federal funds rate was expected
to move up toward the top of the Committee's 10-11 per cent rate range. Later,
however, RPD growth moved down into the Committee's range of tolerance, and
the monetary aggregates weakened further. Accordingly, the Desk did not
continue to press for progressively firmer conditions of reserve availability.
The Federal funds rate has averaged around 10-3/4 per cent since late August.
","(3) Yields on intermediate and long-term securities trended down-
ward during most of the intermeeting period, substantially extending the
market rally begun before the last meeting, as market participants began
to believe that the maximum degree of monetary restraint had been reached.
Declines ranged to around 30 basis points on both municipal and Treasury
issues, and to about 35 basis points on new corporate bonds. A further
increase in the prime rate to 9-3/4 per cent on August 27, had little
dampening impact on this downtrend. At the same time, the general market
improvement facilitated sale of a $2 billion Treasury note on August 24 and
of a sizable volume of new Federal agency issues during late August and early
September. Most recently, however, the bond market rally has ended, and
some yields have risen, as the money market continued taut and the Board took
action on September 7 raising marginal reserve requirements on large CD's.
In the last two days, a number of banks raised the prime rate to 10 per cent.
","(4) In contrast to bond yields, rates on home mortgages continued
to rise during the intermeeting period. The increase in FNMA auction yields
amounted to 32 basis points. Continued upward pressure on mortgage rates is
hardly surprising in view of the large further attrition in savings accounts
at non-bank thrift institutions during August, and the resulting continuing
low volume of new mortgage commitments.
","(5) Currently, most short rates are close to or at new highs,
The only short rates that showed significant declines within the intermeeting
period were those on Treasury bills and Federal agency securities, and even
these declines proved to be temporary. The 90-day Treasury bill rate, for
example, dropped below 8.50 per cent shortly after the last meeting, then
rose to a new high of more than 9 per cent and most recently has traded
around 8.80 per cent. Over the full intermeeting period, private short-term
rates have posted further advances ranging generally from 1/8 to 1/4 of a
percentage point.

Prospective developments
","(7) Given the recent weakness in money supply and the continued
high level of interest rates, it now appears that the long-run target path
for M1 initially adopted by the Committee last March and reaffirmed at recent
meetings cannot be attained by the end of this year without an abrupt and
very large decline in interest rates. If current money market conditions
are maintained over the next several months, the staff would expect M 1 growth
in the fourth quarter to be around 2-1/2 per cent at an annual rate. Such
a growth rate would lead to a level of M1 that is some $2.5 billion below
the December level implicit in the 5-1/4 per cent long-run path line adopted
by the Committee. This path, extended to March 1974, is shown in the chart
on the following page.
","(8) The assumption of unchanged money market conditions is
incorporated in the specifications presented here as alternative C. This
alternative includes a growth rate for M1 over the fourth and first quarters
combined of about 3 per cent. The levels of M1 that would be reached in the
final months of each of these quarters under this alternative are shown on
the chart by the dots labelled ""C"". As will be noted from the chart, the
shortfall from path would be expected to widen further in the first quarter.
Specifications for this and other alternatives are summarized in the following
table and spelled out more fully in the table on page 6a.

M I of 6 per cent, the rate required to reach the longer-run 5-1/4 per cent path
by March. This pattern is illustrated by the dots labelled ""A"" on the chart.
To compensate for the cumulative restraining impact on money supply of recent
high interest rates, this alternative implies a decline in the Federal funds
rate, with an initial drop over the next few weeks to a level possibly as low
as 8-1/2--9 per cent. Given the lagged relationship between money demand and
interest rates, the longer that shortfalls in monetary aggregates continue, the
sharper the decline in interest rates that would be needed to bring the
aggregates back on path within any specific period. Accordingly, significant
delays in permitting greater reserve availability would increase the risk

that a return to the 5-1/4 per cent path by the end of the first quarter would
require easing to a degree that might lead to a subsequent unduly sharp expansion
in money.
","(10) Alternative B falls in between A and C in terms of growth in
the aggregates. It also implies a smaller drop in interest rates than does
alternative A. The 6-month growth rate for M1 under this alternative is
around 4-1/2 per cent at an annual rate. Thus, like C, it would represent
a path that falls short of the Committee's previous long-run target, but
of course the shortfall is less.
","(11) The short-run September-October growth rate in RPD's is
very large under these alternatives, ranging around 16 per cent at an annual
rate. About half of this rapid growth rate is attributable to expected
behavior of CD's and non-deposit sources of funds (including about 3-1/2
percentage points that reflect the impact of the two marginal reserve actions).
Only about 2 percentage points of the growth reflects expected expansion in
private demand deposits, as only a slight increase is indicated for M1 in
September-October, while 4-1/2 percentage points are accounted for by
expansion in time and savings deposits other than large CD's.
If the Committee were to decide to permit money market conditions
to ease significantly over the next few weeks--e.g. a Fed funds rate below
strongly influenced. A substantial decline in short-term interest rates
would probably be set in motion. And long-term rates would also drop, though
perhaps not as much as short rates, in view of the still wide spread of
short- over long-rates and given the downward adjustment that has already
taken place in long rates in recent weeks. If, on the other hand, money
market conditions remained about unchanged from those recently prevailing,
short-term rates could be expected to advance somewhat further as seasonal
pressures build up during the fall. Long-term rates would probably also
regain part of their recent declines.
","(13) Given the money market conditions of alternative C--indicated
by a Federal funds rate in a 10 to 11 per cent range--growth in consumer-type
time and savings deposits at banks would be expected to slow noticeably as
the realignment of consumer financial asset holdings to the new rate structure
tapers. M2 under alternative C may be expected to rise at about a 5-1/2 per
cent annual rate in the September-October period. The market interest rates
decline envisaged under alternative A and B would lead to greater growth in
consumer-type time deposits than under C and hence to somewhat greater growth
in M2 . Nonbank thrift institutions are expected to remain under pressure in
the months ahead, assuming no change in money market conditions, but the
pressures would moderate a little once the most interest-sensitive depositors
have shifted out. The position of thrift institutions would ease, of course,
as market interest rates decline under alternatives A and B.
","(14) Business loan demand at banks is expected to continue relatively
strong over the months ahead, accmpanied by bank demand for money market funds.
However, bank issuance of CD's should be tempered by the new marginal reserve
requirement, although some bank demand will shift toward Euro-dollars and
inter-bank loans. And bank credit growth is expected to moderate over the
coming months from the exceptionally rapid August pace.
Proposed directive language
","(15) Presented below are three alternative formulations for
the operational paragraph of the directive, which are intended to cor-
respond to the similarly lettered policy alternatives discussed in the
preceding section. For all three alternatives it is proposed to delete
the word ""immediately"" from the phrase ""over the months immediately
ahead"" to avoid any implication that the Committee seeks to achieve
the aggregate growth rates described within a very few months. As
will be noted, alternatives A and C refer to growth rates in the
aggregates ""thus far this year."" For the period through August, these
are as follows: M1, 5 per cent; M2 , 7-1/2 per cent; and the bank
credit proxy, 14 per cent.
Alternative A
To implement this policy, while taking account of
international and domestic financial market developments
[DEL: and the forthcoming Treasury financing], the Committee
seeks to achieve bank reserve and money market conditions
consistent with SOMEWHAT MORE RAPID [DEL: slower] growth in mone-
tary aggregates over the months [DEL: immediately] ahead than has
occurred on average thus far this year.
Alternative B
To implement this policy, while taking account of
international and domestic financial market developments
[DEL: an the forthcoming Treasury financing], the Committee seeks
to achieve bank reserve and money market conditions con-
sistent with [DEL: slower] MODERATE growth in monetary aggregates
over the months [DEL: immediately] ahead [DEL: than has occurred on
average thus far this year].
Alternative C
To implement this policy, while taking account of
international and domestic financial market developments
[DEL: and the forthcoming Treasury financing], the Committee
seeks to achieve bank reserve and money market conditions
consistent with slower growth in monetary aggregates over
the months [DEL: immediately] ahead than has occurred on average
thus far this year.

rising at an annual rate of nearly 11 per cent, but 11 has changed little
on balance in recent weeks. For the two-month target period as a whole,
the annual growth rate appears to be running at around 6-1/2 per cent,
close to the upper limit of the Committee's range of tolerance, as the
table shows. With recent expansion of time deposits other than large CD's
slowing a little more than expected, growth in M2 appears to be only a
little above the mid-point of its two-month range of tolerance. The
flattening of M1 in early December lends some credence to the view that the
November upsurge reflected essentially temporary influences, including a
rise in foreign commercial and central bank deposits and increased pre-
cautionary holdings by the public stemming from the energy crisis and the
associated stock market decline.

","(2) RPD's appear to have contracted during the November-December
target period at about a 5.0 per cent annual rate. This shortfall was
greater than allowed for by the Committee's range of tolerance. As shown
in Table 2, most of the shortfall in RPD's was attributable to a weaker than
expected performance of large CD's (subject over most of the period to a
reserve requirement of 11 per cent). Relatively more reserves than
anticipated were absorbed by private demand deposits.

rate to rise toward the 10-1/2 per cent upper limit of its range of
tolerance. Because of the uncertainties in the economic outlook stemming
from the mid-East oil embargo and the sensitive state of financial market
psychology, however, the Committee directed the Account Manager to continue
aiming for a weekly average Federal funds rate around 10-1/4 per cent.
In the first two statement weeks of December the funds rate actually
averaged 10.17 and 10.04 per cent respectively, with the rate dropping
sharply on the last day of both weeks. Member bank borrowing at the
Federal Reserve amounted to $1.5 billion in the first week of December,
with excess reserves rising to $375 million, but in the following week
excess reserves were negative, by $244 million, and borrowing dropped back
to $1.3 billion.
","(4) Since the last Committee meeting, most short- and long-term
market interest rates have fluctuated in response to changing expectations
with regard to monetary policy and the impact of the energy crisis on the
economy. On balance since the last Committee meeting, most short-term
rates have declined somewhat. For the most part, the decline in these
rates occurred following announcement of the reduction in marginal
reserve requirements on December 7. The declines ranged generally from
bill rate was bid at 7.53 per cent. A few large banks have raised their
prime lending rate to 10 per cent, but the higher rate has shown no
tendency to spread through the banking system.

Prospective developments
","(6) Of the three alternatives summarized below for Committee
consideration, alternative B includes a growth rate for M1 over the
first half of 1974 that is consistent with the extension to mid-year of
the 5 per cent growth path adopted by the Committee at its previous meeting.
This growth path starts from the revised September 1973 base (which is about
$2-1/2 billion above the old series, as was indicated in the previous bluebook).
In alternative B, M1 is targeted to increase at a 4-1/2 per cent annual rate
from December '73-to June '74. This growth rate is lower than 5 per cent to
compensate for the overshoot in M1 growth in the fourth quarter. As shown in
the chart on the next page, the estimated level of the money stock in December
is about $1 billion above the path level for that month. Alternatives A and C
involve more and less rapid growth in the aggregates, respectively. (Detailed
figures for the alternatives are shown on page 6a; all figures for the aggregates
are based on revised data, though revisions are still in a preliminary

","(7) With regard to money market conditions, the staff would
expect some decline in the Federal funds rate between now and mid-January
if the Committee chooses to provide the reserves consistent with alternative B.
A funds rate range of 9--10-1/4 per cent is shown for that alternative. If
the rate were to drop toward the lower end of the range over the next few
weeks, the staff would not anticipate that any significant further reductions
would be needed in the first few months of 1974 to be consistent with the
targeted growth rates for money.
","(8) The decline in the funds rate expected under alternative B
(and the greater decline expected under alternative A) essentially reflects
the substantial downward revision in the staff's projection of growth in
nominal GNP and the associated weakening in the demand for money and credit.
At the time of the last meeting the staff was projecting about a 9 and
of 1974 respectively; currently, the projected rates of growth are about
","(9) If the Committee wishes to maintain money market conditions
close to those currently prevailing, the staff would expect growth in the
aggregates to slow to alternative C dimensions. With the Federal funds
rate unchanged, it is likely that market interest rates--particularly
short-term rates--would adjust upward from current levels in the process
of re-establishing a more normal relationship to the funds rate. Current
levels of market rates are low relative to the funds rate--in part,
apparently, because market participants are anticipating an economic
slowdown and the money market easing that has accompanied slowdowns
in the past.
","(10) Market interest rates, however, do not appear to have fully
discounted future declines in the funds rate. Thus, an actual drop in the
funds rate, such as would be likely to occur under alternative B, might
trigger sizable further declines in short-term interest rates and also
some decline in long rates. Expectational forces probably would carry market
rates down in the short run by more than is sustainable over the longer run,
however, assuming the funds rate in the early months of next year remained
in the 9 per cent plus range. On balance, over the next few weeks the
funds rate drops to 9-1/2 per cent or somewhat below. This assumes no
substantial central bank sales of Treasury securities as a result of reflows
of dollars from abroad.
","(11) The greater decline in the funds rate under alternative A,
as compared with B, would intensify market expectations of declining
interest rates. If the funds rate were to drop rapidly and to fall below
a little lower, at least temporarily. Market expectations of a decline in
the discount rate would become much more prevalent.
","(12) Among the assumptions we have made in working out the
various monetary and interest rate relationships are: (1) moderate growth
in large negotiable CD's, in some part reflecting the lower cost of those
funds resulting from the recent reduction in marginal reserve requirements;
(2) continued fairly strong short-term credit demands by business (at
least in the early part of next year when inventory accumulation is expected
to be strong), but only moderate business loan growth at banks unless the
prime loan rate drops relative to the commercial paper rate; (3) no Treasury
cash borrowing until March (unless foreign central banks find it necessary
to redeem sizable amounts of Treasury specials) and sharply diminished
Federal agency borrowing; and (4) moderate growth in consumer-type time
deposits at banks (under alternative C) and more rapid growth as market
interest rates decline (under alternatives B and A) as banks reduce time
deposit offering rates only with a lag.
Proposed directive language
","(13) Presented below are three alternative formulations for
the operational paragraph of the directive, which are intended to
correspond to the similarly lettered policy alternatives discussed in
the preceding section. As will be noted, alternatives A and C refer to
growth rates in the aggregates ""so far this year."" For the period
through November, these are as follows in terms of the revised series:
M 1, 6.0 per cent; M2, 8.8 per cent; and the bank credit proxy, 11.1 per
Alternative A
To implement this policy, while taking account of inter-
national and domestic financial market developments, the Committee
seeks to achieve bank reserve and money market conditions con-

months ahead AT ABOUT THE RATES PREVAILING SO FAR THIS YEAR.
Alternative B

1974-02-20,1974-02-20,"(1) The money stock and reserve aggregates have shown a mixed
performance relative to the Committee's ranges of tolerance during the
January-February target period. For most of the period since the last
meeting, M1 and RPD's appeared to be growing at rates well below the low
ends of their ranges. However, a sharp rise of M1 in the first two weeks
of February (with the second week based on preliminary and partly estimated
data) brought the growth rate back within the range of tolerance, M2 remained
within its range for most of the period, as growth in consumer-type time and
savings deposits was strong, and moved slightly above the top of the range
when the preliminary data for the second week of February became available.

","(2) In January, M1 declined at a 3.1 per cent annual rate,
instead of rising slightly as originally indicated. The sharp rise
February 15, 1974
of M 1 in the first two weeks of February suggests a growth rate for the month
of around 11 per cent. Some part of this February increase in private balances
may be related to a very sharp and considerably greater than anticipated
decline in U.S. Government deposits.
","(3) Growth of RPD's in the January-February period appears to be
somewhat below the lower end of the Committee's range of tolerance. As
shown in the table below, RPD's supporting private demand deposits are
declining substantially--rather than rising slightly as expected--reflecting
mainly the impact on required reserves, as lagged two weeks, of changes in
the weekly pattern of demand deposit flows. Excess reserves also are running
lower than expected, on average, thus reducing the need to supply reserves
through open market operations. CD's and other time deposits have been
absorbing more RPD's than anticipated.

","(4) Conditions have eased significantly in the Federal funds
market since the last Committee meeting. The funds rate had averaged 9.60
per cent in the statement week of January 23 that encompassed the meeting.
Shortly after the meeting, in light of the decision taken by the Committee,
the Desk began supplying reserves at a pace consistent with a funds rate in
a 9¼--9½ per cent range. Subsequent operations were conditioned by the
Treasury financing then in process. Shortfalls in growth rates of M1 and
RPD relative to the Committee's ranges of tolerance led to somewhat more
active reserve supplying operations, and the funds rate averaged 8.93 per
cent in the week ended February 13. The Desk is currently aiming at a
reserve supply consistent with a funds rate of around 9 per cent.
","(5) As the funds market has eased in recent weeks, declines in
other short-term rates have ranged around 100 basis points and the bank
prime loan rate has dropped from 9¾ to 9 per cent at some banks. Reductions
in market rates have occurred even though the volume of directly placed and
dealer placed commercial paper coming to market was exceptionally heavy
and a sizable amount of large CD's was marketed by commercial banks, given
large business loan growth and a favorable market atmosphere. Despite the
drop in short-term market rates, member bank borrowing at the Fed was
maintained, averaging around $1.1 billion during the past four weeks,
slightly higher than in the previous four weeks.
","(6) Yields in all sectors of the bond market have also been
subject to downward pressure since the January FOMC meeting, notwithstand-
ing a heavy volume of new corporate and municipal issues brought to market
and fairly aggressive lengthening of maturities by the Treasury in its mid-
February refunding. These latest reductions in long-term rates offset a
sizable part of the increases recorded in late December and early January.
","(7) The Treasury auctioned three new debt issues totaling $4.05
billion during the last week in January to refinance $4.5 billion of publicly
held debt maturing in mid-February. The issues--$1.5 billion of a 3¼-year,
million of a 19½-year, 7½ per cent bond--were well received by the market.
All were sold at premiums; both the 7-year note and the 19½-year bond are
currently trading at prices above their auction averages, while the price of
the 3 -year note is close to its average. However, dealer awards in the
auction were large--amounting to about $1.6 billion in total. Dealers have
since distributed only about one-fourth of these awards, but they have not
been pressing aggressively thus far to market their remaining holdings.

of change) selected monetary and financial flows over various recent time

(inter-meeting period)
","(10) Alternative B includes the 5¾ per cent annual growth rate
for M1 for the period from December to June adopted by the Committee at its
last meeting, which is depicted in the chart on the following page. The
longer-run growth of M2 implied by this alternative is around 10 per cent,
about 2 percentage points higher than indicated at the last Committee
meeting. 1/ The increase in M2 growth reflects the greater than expected
strength of recent net inflows of consumer-type time deposits at banks and
the lower average level of market interest rates that has already developed
and is assumed to continue into the months ahead under this alternative.

","(11) A longer-run 5¾ per cent growth path for M1 is associated
with lower interest rates than in the previous blue book mainly because
of the downward revision in nominal GNP expansion projected by the staff.
At the time of the last Committee meeting, economic activity at current
prices was projected to expand at a 6½ per cent annual rate in the first
half of the year, whereas a 5½ per cent expansion is now projected. This
would be expected to lower transactions demands for money and therefore
to reduce the interest rates associated with a given growth in the money
","(12) With short-term interest rates having declined by around
one percentage point since the last meeting, market rates have already
moved close to levels that now seem consistent with a 5¾ per cent M1
growth. Thus, little or no further decline would be expected under
alternative B. The Federal funds rate range for that alternative is
indicated at 8¼--9½ per cent, centering close to the recently prevailing
","(13) Recent interest rate declines will be working to sustain
money demand in the months ahead, including demand for both cash balances
and interest-earning deposits. In the February-March period, M1 growth
in a 7½--9½ per cent annual rate range is indicated under alternative B.
Because of the sizable shortfall of M 1 in January, such a rate of in-
crease is needed to restore M1 to the desired longer-run growth path.
Growth of M1 in February may be particularly large, reflecting perhaps
a decline in U.S. Government deposits between January and February that
is virtually unprecedented in size. The Treasury redeemed $800 million
of maturing debt in mid-February and the cash deficit for February also
seems to be a little larger than seasonal.
","(16) Growth in consumer-type time and savings deposits at
banks is likely to continue generally strong, perhaps bolstered by a build-
up in precautionary balances by consumers. The growth, however, will
probably slacken a little from that of January, when net inflows (as in
October) may have been enlarged somewhat by an increased amount of
interest crediting (taking place on the final day of quarters) resulting
from the higher ceiling rates. Under alternative A, growth in consumer-
type time deposits would probably be even more rapid for a while--at least
until further declines in market rates lead banks to begin reducing
offering rates for consumer-type deposits. The expected rise of interest
rates under alternative C would reduce the relative attractiveness of
consumer-type time deposits, though, judging from recent experience, the
effect of higher market rates might be more marked on the specialized
thrift institutions than on commercial banks.
","(17) With funds available in volume through consumer-type time
deposits, banks are not expected to be aggressive issuers of large CD's
in the weeks ahead. Business loan demand at banks may not moderate
substantially from the January pace until the rate of overall business
inventory accumulation slackens, as is projected for the spring. However,
mortgage and consumer credit demands are likely to be quite modest in the
period immediately ahead, given the weakness in home buying and in sales
of cars, mobile homes, and recreational equipment.
","(18) In time, the recent removal of capital controls and large
international funds flows stemming from the rise in oil prices may come to
have an appreciable effect on domestic banking aggregates and market
conditions. Thus far, however, discernible effects have been minor, and
have included mainly reports of offerings of longer-term dollar-denominated
CD's to U.S. investors by foreign affiliates of U.S. banks, and reports of
strong interest by U.S. and foreign corporations in shifting longer-term
borrowing from the Euro-dollar market to U.S. capital markets. The potential
for investment in the United States of funds from the oil-exporting countries
is even more dramatic, but here too there has been little indication of
sizable money-flows. Under the circumstances, we have not yet made any
special allowance for the effects of international financial developments
on domestic markets and aggregates.
Proposed directive
","(19) Presented below are three alternative formulations for the
operational paragraph of the directive, which are intended to correspond
to the similarly lettered policy alternatives discussed in the preceding
section. In all three alternatives, it is proposed to delete the reference
to Treasury financing because the quarterly refunding announced on January 30
has been virtually completed.
Alternative A
To implement this policy, while taking account [DEL: of the
forthcoming Treasury financing and] of international and domestic
financial market developments, the Committee seeks to achieve
bank reserve and money market conditions consistent with moderate
SOMEWHAT GREATER growth in monetary aggregates over the months
Alternative B
To implement this policy, while taking account [DEL: of the
forthcoming Treasury financing and] of international and domestic
financial market developments, the Committee seeks to achieve
bank reserve and money market conditions consistent with moderate
growth in monetary aggregates over the months ahead.
Alternative C

1978-02-28,1978-02-28,"(1) M-1 increased at a 7-1/4 per cent annual rate in January,
but it appears to be declining at a 1/2 per cent rate in February. Thus,
growth over January and February combined is projected at around a 3-1/2
per cent annual rate, in the lower half of the FOMC's range. M-2 appears
to be expanding at a 6-1/2 per cent annual rate over the January-February
period, close to the mid-point of its range. Renewed expansion in savings
and small denomination time deposits at banks and a continued rise in
large denomination time deposits included in M-2 helped to maintain growth
in this aggregate in January.1/ At thrift institutions, on the other hand,

Range Latest Estimates
deposit inflows slowed further in January and seem to be continuing
at a reduced pace in February. Over January and February, nonborrowed
reserves are expected to increase at a 17 per cent annual rate,
largely reflecting the surge in demand deposits around the turn of the
year and a rise in excess reserves possibly associated with difficulties
in reserve management due to severe weather.
","(2) With incoming data indicating that the monetary aggregates
were growing at rates well within the Committee's ranges, the Account Manage-
ment has continued to seek a Federal funds rate of around 6¾ per cent
since the January FOMC meeting. Under these circumstances, short-term
interest rates generally have changed little on balance since mid-January
despite relatively strong short-term credit demands. The Treasury
has begun to raise new cash in its weekly auctions of 3- and 6-month
bills, and short-term borrowing by businesses continued sizable
in recent weeks. Bank loans to businesses accelerated substantially
in January and early February, more than offsetting a decline in commercial
paper issuance by nonfinancial corporations.
","(4) In long-term credit markets, public bond offerings by
corporations over the intermeeting period were modest, and rates on
corporate bonds have changed little on balance since mid-January. At
the same time, municipal bond yields have fallen somewhat, as demands
for tax-exempt securities have continued to be quite strong. Mortgage
interest rates in both primary and secondary markets, on the other hand,
have edged upward further, reflecting pressures on fund availability
resulting from the slowing of deposit inflows to thrift institutions.
","(5) Yields on Treasury coupon securities also have risen
slightly since mid-January. Both the Treasury and Federally-sponsored
agencies have been substantial net borrowers over this period. The
Federal Home Loan Bank System, for example, raised $1.4 billion of new
cash in conjunction with its February refinancing, to meet a growing
demand for advances from member institutions. The Treasury borrowed
about $6 billion of cash through regular issues of 2- and 4-year notes
since the last FOMC meeting, and obtained an additional $2 billion in
its regular mid-quarter refunding of $5 billion of maturing issues.1/
Noncompetitive tenders in the refunding auctions came to $2 billion,
about $1 billion above the total in the November refunding. In the
weeks following the auctions, the new issues have traded below their
average auction prices.

alternative longer-run growth ranges for the monetary aggregates
over the QIV '77-QIV '78 period, along with the ranges currently
in place.
Alt. A Alt. B Alt. C Current
","(8) Alternative B continues the ranges for M-1 and M-2
that were adopted by the Committee in October for the QIII '77-QIII '78
period. Alternatives A and C represent, respectively, somewhat more and
somewhat less expansive policy alternatives. Under all three
alternatives, the M-3 growth range is projected to be lower than
the current range for this aggregate. Since around year end, net
inflows of deposits to thrift institutions have persisted at a rate
considerably lower than previously anticipated, and, as a result, the
staff has reduced its projections of such inflows over the year ahead.
","(9) Each of the alternatives presupposes an upward adjustment
in deposit ceiling rates at banks and thrift institutions of 50 basis
points on small-denomination time deposits; the adjustments in ceiling
rates are assumed to occur in April under alternative C, in May under
B, and in June under A. Without such adjustments, the increase in
market rates thought necessary to restrain M-1 growth to the mid-point
of the indicated ranges would lead to growth in M-2 and M-3 near
the lower ends of the ranges shown.1/
","(10) The table below provides perspective on the relation-
ship among growth rates proposed for the QIV '77 to QIV '78 period
and the implied growth rates for more extended periods ending in
to a 5.6 per cent annual rate of expansion over the 15-month period
starting with QIII '77 and to a 6.3 per cent annual rate of growth
over the 18-month period beginning with QII '77--in both cases within
the current FOMC range but above the mid-point. The higher growth
rates over these longer periods reflect the sizable overshoot in
M-1 growth in the third quarter of last year and the more moderate
overshoot in the fourth quarter. M-1 growth at around the 5 per cent
mid-point of the proposed alternative C range would nearly compensate
for the slight fourth quarter overshoot but not for the larger third
quarter overshoot.

","(12) A Federal funds rate centered on the recently prevailing
level of 6-3/4 per cent, as contemplated under alternative B, is likely
to be associated with M-1 growth over February-March in a 1 to 6 per cent
annual rate range. The February weakness in M-l, following several months
of strong growth, is thought by the staff to be transitory. Money growth
in March is expected to rebound to a little over a 7 per cent annual rate--
mainly because of the increase in transactions demands associated with the
projected strengthening of economic activity following the recent weather-
induced slowdown. The expected rebound in M-1 also reflects in some
degree projections indicating that the volume of tax refunds to individuals
will be large relative to other recent years.
","(13) The February-March growth rate of M-1 shown under alterna-
tive B implies a first quarter expansion of about 4-3/4 per cent, annual
rate, well within the Committee's 4 to 6-1/2 per cent longer-run range.
However, the staff anticipates that further increases in market interest
rates will be required in order to constrain M-1 growth over the one-
year QIV '77 - QIV '78 period to the mid-point of that range. Even
though the staff has reduced its projection of economic growth this year,
nominal GNP is still expected to increase at an 11-1/4 per cent rate over
the QIV '77 - QIV '78 period, leading to relatively strong money demand.
In addition, the restraining impact on money demand from the relatively
sharp 1-3/4 percentage point increase in short-term interest rates that
took place between the spring and fall of last year will be exhausted
relatively soon; since October short-rates have risen only about another
in money demand relative to income, the Federal funds rate would probably
have to begin rising again in April and reach 8 per cent by fall in order
to constrain M-1 growth for the QIV '77-QIV '78 period to the mid-point
of the 4 to 6-1/2 per cent alternative B range.1/
","(14) Growth in M-2 over the February-March period is likely
to be in a 4-1/2 to 8-1/2 per cent annual rate range under alternative B.
With market yields above the ceiling rates on savings deposits and all
maturities of small denomination time deposits at commercial banks,
inflows of such deposits are likely to remain modest in February-March.
However, growth in large denomination time deposits included in M-2 are
expected to continue to offset slow growth of deposits subject to Regu-
lation Q ceiling as banks aggressively seek funds to finance credit
","(15) At thrift institutions the relatively attractive yields
available in the market for shorter-term investments have slowed total
deposit inflows so far in 1978, although ceiling rates on the longest-
term deposits are still somewhat above those on market instruments.
With no further increase in short-term interest rates, growth in deposits
at thrift institutions can be expected to remain modest in the near-term.
Consequently, S&L's are likely to limit their new commitment activity
and also--in financing takedowns of their record level of outstanding
commitments--to reduce their own liquidity and further increase borrowing
from FHL Banks. Although thrift deposit inflows are expected to rise
from their depressed first quarter pace if ceiling rates are raised in
the spring (as we are assuming), inflows will probably remain considerably
below the strong pace of expansion of 1977.
","(16) With the Federal funds rate remaining near its present
generally are likely to fluctuate within a relatively narrow range over
the intermeeting period. A little upward rate pressure might develop in
short-term credit markets; the Treasury is expected to raise $10 billion
of new money in the bill market prior to the March and April tax dates,
and depository institutions are likely to continue liquidating shorter-
term Treasury issues to meet loan demands. However, intermediate- and
long-term market rates might decline a bit in the weeks immediately ahead.
Treasury demands in these maturity ranges are not likely to be unusually
large. In addition, the pace of new offerings by corporations and State
and local governments is expected to remain moderate, while the institu-
tional demand for bonds is likely to continue to be quite strong. Both
primary and secondary mortgage rates will probably continue to be under
upward pressure, given the slowing of deposit growth at the thrift
","(17) Over the longer-run both short- and long-term interest
rates are likely to rise. Given the strength that is projected in
economic activity, rate pressures may become evident in spring and summer
as a result of expanding private credit demands and Federal Reserve efforts
to restrain money growth. Further increases in short- and intermediate-
term rates will be accompanied by reduced liquid asset holdings of
depository institutions, by increased commercial bank offerings of
large denomination time deposits, and by stepped up borrowing demands
of Federal housing agencies. The increases in short- and intermediate-
term rates will probably be transmitted to some extent to long-term
markets. However, as in 1977, such increases will be limited by the
continued high cash flows of insurance companies and pension funds.
","(18) Under alternative C the Federal funds rate would rise
over the intermeeting period to the mid-point of a 7 to 7-1/2 per cent
range, and the February-March annual rate of growth of M-1 and M-2 would
likely be in 1/2 to 5-1/2 and 4 to 8 per cent annual rate ranges, respec-
tively. The 3-month Treasury bill rate would probably rise to about 7
per cent by mid-March, with commensurate adjustments in other short rates.
Member bank borrowings could be expected to rise sharply once again,
increasing pressures for a discount rate increase. At the same time,
the rise in short-term interest rates associated with this alternative
would tend to strengthen the dollar on international exchange markets.
","(19) The tightening of money market conditions contemplated
under alternative C would further slow the net inflow of deposits sub-
ject to rate ceilings in the weeks immediately ahead and thus would
increase the need for an adjustment in deposit ceiling rates. Lending
policies of banks and thrift institutions would become more restrictive.
There would be increased pressure on Government support programs in the
mortgage area. The Home Loan Bank System would be expected to turn more
and more to the market to raise cash to support advances to savings and
loan associations, and mortgage bankers would increase takedowns of
existing FNMA commitments while also aggressively seeking new commit-
ments. In such an environment, the increase in short-term rates would
probably be rather promptly transmitted to the intermediate- and long-
term sectors of the market, where Government security dealers still have
a long position of moderate size in Treasury coupon issues.
","(20) The near-term increase in interest rates under alterna-
tive C would work toward a reduction in growth of the aggregates over
the longer run. However, given the projected strength of money demand,
a further increase in interest rates would be required in order to limit
M-1 expansion to the mid-point of the 4 to 6 per cent alternative C range
over the QIV '77-QIV '78 period. The staff would expect the funds rate
under this alternative to average 7-3/4 per cent in the second quarter
and to rise to 8-1/4 per cent by fall.
","(21) Alternative A involves a reduction in the Federal funds
rate over the intermeeting period to the 6-1/2 per cent mid-point of a
reversal of the early January rise in short-term interest rates. Long-
term rates, on the other hand, might not retrace all of their recent
increases if, as appears likely at the moment, market participants con-
cluded that the decline in short-term rates was likely to be temporary.
Meanwhile, the dollar would probably tend to soften in international
exchange markets.
","(22) The approach of alternative A appears most consistent
with a monetary policy that encourages more rapid growth in the monetary
aggregates over the longer-run than under either alternatives B or C.
Nevertheless, given the strength projected for economic activity, the
near-term decline in the funds rate under A would probably soon have to
be reversed to restrain growth in the aggregates to rates consistent
with the mid-points of longer-run ranges for alternative A. The funds
rate would have to begin rising again in the second quarter and might
reach a high for the year of about 7-3/4 per cent by fall.
Directive language
","(23) Given below are alternatives for the operational
paragraphs of the directive. The first formulation places main
emphasis on near-term rates of growth in monetary aggregates. The
second formulation, like the directive adopted at the last meeting,
places main emphasis on money market conditions; it shows--in strike-
through form--the specifications adopted at the last meeting. As
suggested below, the particular language needed in the opening lines
of the money market formulation would depend on the specific conditions
sought; the three alternatives shown--calling, respectively, for
somewhat easier, prevailing, and somewhat firmer money market condi-
tions--are intended to be associated with the specifications discussed
in the preceding section under alternatives A, B, and C.
""Monetary Aggregates"" Formulation
The Committee seeks to encourage near-term rates of growth
in M-1 and M-2 on a path believed to be reasonably consistent
with the longer-run ranges for monetary aggregates cited in the
preceding paragraph. Specifically, at present, it expects the
annual growth rates over the February-March period to be within
the ranges of ____ to ____ per cent for M-1 and ____ to ____
per cent for M-2. In the judgment of the Committee such growth
rates are likely to be associated with a weekly-average Federal
funds rate of about ____ per cent. If, giving approximately
equal weight to M-1 and M-2, it appears that growth rates over
the 2-month period will deviate significantly from the mid-points
of the indicated ranges, the operational objective for the
Federal funds rate shall be modified in an orderly fashion within
a range for ____ to ____ per cent. In the conduct of day-to-day
operations, account shall be taken of emerging financial market
conditions, including the unsettled conditions in foreign exchange
If it appears during the period before the next meeting that
the operating constraints specified above are proving to be
significantly inconsistent, the Manager is promptly to notify the
Chairman who will then decide whether the situation calls for
supplementary instructions from the Committee.
""Money Market"" Formulation
At this time, the Committee seeks to maintain about the
prevailing money market conditions (OR TO ACHIEVE SOMEWHAT EASIER
OR SOMEWHAT FIRMER MONEY MARKET CONDITIONS) during the period
immediately ahead, provided that monetary aggregates appear to
be growing at approximately the rates currently expected, which
are believed to be on a path reasonably consistent with the
longer-run ranges for monetary aggregates cited in the preceding
paragraph. Specifically, the Committee seeks to maintain the
weekly-average Federal funds rate at about [DEL: the current level]
____ per cent, so long as M-1 and M-2 appear to be growing over
the [DEL: January-February] FEBRUARY-MARCH period at annual rates within
ranges of [DEL: 2½ to 7½] ____ TO ____ per cent and [DEL: 5-to-9] ____ TO
____ per cent, respectively. If giving approximately equal
weight to M-1 and M-2, it appears that growth rates over the
the indicated ranges, the operational objective for the weekly-
average Federal funds rate shall be modified in an orderly
the conduct of day-to-day operations, account shall be taken
of emerging financial market conditions, including the unsettled
conditions in foreign exchange markets.
If it appears during the period before the next meeting that
the operating constraints specified above are proving to be
significantly inconsistent, the Manager is promptly to notify
the Chairman who will then decide whether the situation calls
for supplementary instructions from the Committee.

1978-05-16,1978-05-16,"(1) Growth in M-1 accelerated to an annual rate of 19 per
cent in April, partly reflecting the sharp rebound in economic
activity that is in process. In addition, the month appears to
have been affected by transitory tax-related factors, including a
build-up in individual cash balances to make larger than usual
nonwithheld tax payments and some delay by the Treasury in processing
such payments. M-1 is expected to increase at about a 6-1/2 per cent
annual rate in May, given data thus far available in the month,
bringing growth over the April-May period to around a 13 per cent
annual rate, well above the upper end of the Committee's range. The
rapid expansion of M-1 also has boosted growth in M-2 over April and
May to about an8-3/4 per cent annual rate, near the upper end of
its two-month range. The pick-up in deposit growth in April enabled
banks to accelerate their acquisitions of earning assets to a 21
per cent annual rate. Deposit growth at nonbank thrift institutions
remained weak in April.

","(2) As incoming data on the aggregates continued to
strengthen following the April FOMC meeting, the Desk raised its
Federal funds rate target to around 7-1/4 per cent from the 6-3/4
per cent level which had prevailed since early January. At a tele-
phone conference meeting on May 5, it was reported that growth in
M-1 appeared to be well in excess of the Committee's range and growth
in M-2 at the top of its range. To provide time for more evidence
on the economy and on the extent to which the strength in the aggre-
gates would subside, the FOMC decided that the Desk should continue
aiming for a 7-1/4 per cent Federal funds rate. However, the Manager
was instructed to be more tolerant of deviations of the funds rate
above the desired level than below it, and in the most recent state-
ment week the Federal funds rate averaged 7.32 per cent.
","(3) The increase in the Federal funds rate from the earlier
Federal Reserve Banks. In the statement week just ended, such borrow-
ing totalled $1.7 billion, up from a level of $239 million in the week
of April 19. The discount rate was raised 1/2 point to 7 per cent on
May 11, in order to bring it into better alignment with market rates,
and most recently member bank borrowing has declined substantially.
Still, increased member bank borrowing on average is estimated to supply
the bulk of the 11-1/4 per cent expansion in total reserves over the
April-May period.
","(4) Along with the rise in the Federal funds rate, most
short- and longer-term market interest rates have risen by 20 to 45
basis points since the April Committee meeting, and the bank prime rate was
increased from 8 to 8-1/4 per cent. Demands of nonfinancial businesses
for short-term credit remained quite strong, as evidenced by substantial
increases in both commercial paper and bank business loans in April.
The Treasury, on the other hand, has paid down $12 billion of cash mange-
ment bills since the April tax date, contributing to a relative scarcity
of short-term bills. The reduction in the available supply of these
instruments has helped to limit the response of many short-term interest
rates to the firming of money market conditions. In its mid-May refund-
ing, the Treasury redeemed $1.9 billion of the $5.9 billion of publicly
held maturing issues and offered a total of $4 billion in a 10 year note
and a 22-1/4 year bond. Dealers distributed the bulk of their awards
of the bond and about half of their holdings of the new notes within a
day or two of the auction. Despite the rise in interest rates, stock
prices have moved higher on balance over the inter-meeting period.
(4) Conditions in mortgage markets have continued to tighten.
Rates on primary conventional mortgages have risen 15 basis points since
mid-April, bringing the increase in this rate over the first four months
of 1978 to about 1/2 percentage point. In addition, savings and loan
associations reduced their outstanding level of loan commitments again
in March, and concern about further upward movements in mortgage rates
has contributed to a marked rise in offerings at FNMA auctions of forward
purchase commitments.

","(8) Growth in M-1 is expected to slow considerably over
the two-month May-June period from the extraordinary April rate, partly
because the temporary impact of tax-related factors should be unwinding.
Under alternative A--which encompasses a range for the Federal funds
rate centered on its recently prevailing level of around 7-3/8 per
cent--M-1 is expected to expand in a 4 to 8 per cent annual rate
range over the May-June period. Given this projection, the level
of M-1 in each month of the second quarter would be above

to be in a 5 to 9 per cent annual rate range under alternative A.
Unlike levels of M-l, the implied levels of M-2 would be generally
within the longer-run ranges adopted by the Committee for this
aggregate, as shown in Chart 2 on the following page.1/
","(10) The recent and expected near-term increases in market
rates of interest will probably be associated with continued slow
growth in savings deposits. Banks are expected to benefit only
modestly from the June 1 introduction of the new 6-month and 8-year
certificates, because these instruments are likely to be particularly
attractive to the most interest-sensitive depositors who will probably
However, with loan demands expected to remain large, and demand deposits
decelerating from their rapid growth in April, banks are projected
to step up significantly their issuance of large-denomination
time deposits. Since a major portion of such instruments are included
in M-2, the interest-bearing component of this aggregate is expected
to pick up somewhat from its reduced March-April pace.
","(11) Even if the funds rate does not rise significantly
from recent levels, other short-term rates could edge up further
over the weeks ahead. Issuance of commercial paper and bank CD's is
likely to be substantial in coming weeks to accommodate the expected
large business demands for credit. Moreover, the Treasury is not
expected to retire bills, as it did following the April tax date, and
it is possible that the Treasury may issue a sizable short-dated cash
management bill in early June. Finally, if the dollar continues to
strengthen on exchange markets, foreign official accounts might become
significant net sellers of bills.
","(12) Long-term rates are expected to show relatively little
change under the conditions of alternative A. Public offerings of
corporate bonds are projected to remain moderate over the coming
weeks, and State and local bond issuance should drop off markedly
in late May after the effective date of the new IRS ruling with
regard to sinking fund provisions of tax-exempt bond offerings. On
the other hand, the Treasury--after retiring about $2 billion of
coupon securities in the latest refunding--will probably raise about
$2 to $2 billion of new cash when it sells the regular four-year
cycle note in early June. In addition, the FHLB System will announce
terms for its mid-quarter refunding early next week, and is expected
to raise about $1 billion in this operation. Receptions for these
offerings could be quite good, however, since dealers have distri-
buted the bulk of their awards of the Treasury refunding issues
and have reestablished a short position in coupon issues.
","(13) Alternative B calls for an increase in the Federal
funds rate to the mid-point of a 7½ to 8¼ per cent range between
now and mid-June. M-1 growth would likely be in a 4 to 8 per cent
annual rate range over May and June and M-2 growth in a 4-1/2 to 8-1/2
per cent range. Under this alternative, short-term rates generally
might rise 1/2 percentage point or a little more. With loan demands
expected to remain sizable, relatively prompt upward adjustments
in the prime loan rate may be anticipated. Moreover, a rise in
member bank borrowings would also increase pressure for another
discount rate adjustment. Bond yields too could be expected to
rise, though increases may be limited since current market yields
have probably anticipated some further monetary tightness. The
widening spread between interest rates in the United States and
the rest of the world would tend to provide support for the exchange
value of the dollar.
","(14) The staff believes that over the QI '78 to QI '79
period interest rates will have to rise to levels significantly
higher than previously projected if M-1 growth is to be restrained
to the mid-point, or perhaps even the upper half, of its 4 to 6½
per cent longer-run range. M-1 is now expected to expand at about a
more than projected last month. Consequently, in order to achieve
must rise sufficiently to restrain M-1 growth to an annual rate below
nominal GNP is projected to grow at an 11-3/4 per cent annual rate.
The implied rates of increase in velocity--shown in Appendix II--are
unusually large, more than twice the average of the past two years.
","(15) The Federal funds rate level that the staff believes
will be needed to induce such velocity increases are shown in
Appendix I. Under alternative A the Federal funds rate might need
to rise by fall into a range of 9 to 10 per cent--about one percentage
point higher than projected last month.1/ These projections assume
some further downward shift in the demand for money--as a result, for
example, of more intensive marketing of previously introduced innovations
and interest rates in the Board's econometric model has not generated
any evidence of a further downward shift over the past five quarters.
","(16) Under either alternative A or B, growth over the
quarters ahead of interest-bearing deposits subject to rate ceilings
will slow more than projected last month. Not only are market
interest rates now expected to be higher, but the upward adjustment
in deposit rate ceilings announced by the regulatory agencies is less
than the staff had previously projected.1 Consequently, the staff
believes that a further increase in deposit rate ceilings on longer-
term certificates will be needed to maintain flows of small-denomination
time deposits, and has assumed such an increase in the fourth quarter.
Even with an increase in ceiling rates, growth in M-3 over the longer-
run policy period may be around the lower end of its 7½ to 10 per cent
range. While growth in small-denomination time and savings deposits
at banks will also remain weak, M-2 expansion is expected to be near
the mid-point of the Committee's longer-run range, reflecting sizable
issuance of time deposits not subject to interest rate ceilings.
The slower growth of deposits subject to rate ceilings, and the
resultant increased reliance on managed liabilities and draw-downs
of portfolio liquidity by both banks and thrift institutions, will
be associated with mounting strains on their balance sheet positions.
As the year progresses, therefore, the ability and willingness of
these institutions to meet credit demands can be expected to decline
Directive language
","(17) Given below are alternatives for the operational
paragraphs of the directive.1/ The first formulation, like the
directive adopted at the last meeting, places main emphasis on near-
term rates of growth in monetary aggregates; it shows--in strike-
through form--the specifications adopted at the last meeting. The
second formulation places main emphasis on money market conditions.
In both formulations, variants are shown for particular phrases that
are intended to be associated with the specifications discussed in
the preceding section under alternatives A and B.
""Monetary Aggregates"" formulation
The Committee seeks to encourage near-term rates of growth
in M-1 and M-2 on a path believed to be reasonably consistent
with the longer-run ranges for monetary aggregates cited in
the preceding paragraph. Specifically, at present, it expects
the annual growth rates over the [DEL: April-May] MAY-JUNE period to
be within ranges of [DEL: 4 to 8½] ____ TO ____ per cent for M-1 and
[DEL: 5½ to 9½] ____ TO ____ per cent for M-2. In the judgment of
the Committee such growth rates are likely to be associated
with a weekly-average Federal funds rate
(A) AT ABOUT THE CURRENT LEVEL.
(B) slightly (OR SOMEWHAT) above the current level.
If, giving approximately equal weight to M-1 and M-2, it appears
that growth rates over the 2-month period will deviate significantly
from the midpoints of the indicated ranges, the operational
objective for the Federal funds rate shall be modified in an
orderly fashion within a range of [DEL: 6¾ to 7½] ____ TO ____ per cent.
In the conduct of day-to-day operations, account shall be taken
of emerging financial market conditions, including the conditions
in foreign exchange markets.
If it appears during the period before the next meeting
that the operating constraints specified above are proving to
be significantly inconsistent, the Manager is promptly to notify
the Chairman who will then decide whether the situation calls
for supplementary instructions from the Committee.
""Money Market"" Formulation
At this time, the Committee seeks (A) to maintain about the
prevailing money market conditions (or (B) to achieve slightly or
somewhat firmer money market conditions) during the period
immediately ahead, provided that monetary aggregates appear
to be growing at approximately the rates currently expected,
which are believed to be on a path reasonably consistent with
the longer-run ranges for monetary aggregates cited in the
preceding paragraph. Specifically, the Committee seeks (A) to
maintain the weekly-average Federal funds rate at about the
current level (or (B) to increase the weekly-average Federal
funds rate slightly or somewhat from the current level), so
long as M-1 and M-2 appear to be growing over the May-June period
at annual rates within ranges of ____ to ____ per cent and ____
to ____ per cent, respectively. If, giving approximately equal
weight to M-1 and M-2, it appears that growth rates over the 2-
month period are approaching or moving beyond the limits of the
indicated ranges, the operational objective for the weekly-
average Federal funds rate shall be modified in an orderly
fashion within a range of ____ to ____ per cent. In the conduct
of day-to-day operations, account shall be taken of emerging
financial market conditions, including the conditions in foreign
exchange markets.
If it appears during the period before the next meeting
that the operating constraints specified above are proving to
be significantly inconsistent, the Manager is promptly to notify
the Chairman who will then decide whether the situation calls for
supplementary instructions from the Committee.

1978-11-21,1978-11-21,"(1) Following a sharp September increase, M-1 slowed to a
expanding at a 2¼ per cent rate in November. The slower growth of M-1
this month reflects the impact on the daily average November level of
what appears to be a transitory drop in demand deposits in late
October; in addition, the introduction of Automatic Transfer Service
(ATS) is also dampening M-l growth.1/ For October and November
combined, growth is projected at a 2¾ per cent annual rate, well below
the limit set by the FOMC. M-2 appears to be expanding at about
a 7½ per cent annual rate, the midpoint of its FOMC range. Growth
in small time deposits picked up in October, reflecting record
inflows of the 6-month certificates, but savings deposits declined

and growth of large-denomination time deposits included in this
measure, while accelerating at month-end, moderated on a daily
average basis. Total deposit growth at nonbank thrift institutions
also moderated a bit in October, despite increased issuance of the
new money market time deposit.
","(2) Following the October FOMC meeting, the Account Manage-
ment raised its funds rate objective to the 9 per cent mid-point of
the 8¾ to 9¼ per cent range specified by the Committee. Funds generally
traded around the upper limit of this range, however, as the Desk first
encountered difficulty in providing reserves because of a shortage of
collateral and then in the last days of October was reluctant to take
aggressive action to reduce the rate in view of conditions in the
foreign exchange market. To strengthen the dollar in foreign exchange
markets and counter inflationary pressures, on November 1 the discount
rate was raised one percentage point to 9½ per cent,1/ reserve require-
ments on large denomination time deposits were increased 2 percentage
points, and up to $30 billion of foreign currencies were mobilized for
intervention in foreign exchange markets. The FOMC also raised its
funds rate range to 9½ to 9¾ per cent. In light of the volatile
conditions in foreign exchange markets, the Desk limited its reserve
supplying actions in the days immediately following the announcement,
and funds traded at rates somewhat above the upper end of the new
range. In recent days, though, Federal funds have traded at rates within
the Committee's new range--mainly within the upper part of the range.
","(3) The trade-weighted exchange value of the dollar and the
value of the dollar against key currencies have risen substantially
since the November 1 announcement and, as can be seen in the table below,
the value of the dollar has recovered to its August-September levels
(with the exception of the mark). Operations in foreign exchange
markets on behalf of the Treasury and System accounts since the
November 1 announcement have resulted in net sales of $2.4 billion
of German marks, $350 million of Swiss francs, and $200 million of
Japanese yen.

following the October FOMC meeting and then increased further in
response to the System's tightening moves in early November, recording
gains of 1 percentage point or more over the intermeeting period. Rates
have been under less upward pressure in the Treasury bill market, with
the 3-month Treasury bill rate about unchanged on balance over the
period and longer-term bills up 35 to 55 basis points. The
difference in movement between Treasury and private rates appears mainly
to reflect the impact of international financial flows. Foreign official
institutions have made substantial purchases of bills over this
period.1/ At the same time, it seems likely that private capital
outflows have added to upward pressures on private short-term rates.
For example, it appears that a substantial part of the large CD
issuance by U.S. banks has been undertaken to finance both loans
to foreign banks and advances to their own foreign branches.

around these lower levels in subsequent market trading, although the
Treasury has in recent weeks raised $2.7 billion in new cash through

change since the beginning of the month, mortgage yields have risen.
By mid-November the average yield on new mortgage loan commitments at
savings and loan associations had moved to over 10 per cent, despite
constraints imposed by usury ceilings in some States. The increase in
yields reflects both the recent slowing of thrift deposit inflows and
the continued strong demands for credit. Savings and loan associations
increased outstanding mortgage commitments again in September, and
growth in their mortgage holdings is estimated to have increased
somewhat in October.

Prospective developments
","(8) Two alternative specifications for the monetary
aggregates and the Federal funds rate for the November-December period
are shown below for Committee consideration. Both are believed con-
sistent with the longer-run growth ranges adopted by the Committee
last month for the QIII '78 to QIII '79 policy period. Alternative A
calls for no near-term change in the Federal funds rate, while
Alternative B increases policy restraint in coming weeks. (More detailed
and longer-term data are contained in the tables on pp. 8 and 9).
Alt. A Alt. B
Ranges for Nov.-Dec.
","(9) Alternative A contemplates a Federal funds rate
between now and the next meeting centered in the prevailing 9½ to 9¾
per cent range. Growth in M-1 over the November-December period is
expected to be in a 1 to 6 per cent annual rate range--assuming that
transfers to savings deposits because of ATS will reduce M-1 growth
over these two months by 3 to 5 percentage points. Some acceleration
in M-1 growth is anticipated in December. The relatively slow growth
of October-November in part represented the public's adjustment to
the very rapid expansion in money that occurred in September. In
December, we expect the relatively strong underlying demand for money

to reassert itself. Over the fourth quarter as a whole, M-1 growth
is expected to be 6¼ per cent on the assumption that ATS effects
reduce growth by 1 percentage point for the period.
","(10) The specifications in the table on page 7 also show
the supplementary aggregate M-1+, should the Committee wish to provide
additional quantitative guidance to the Desk during a period when
measured M-1 growth will be reduced to an uncertain extent by ATS.
Over the two-month policy period, this supplementary aggregate is
expected to increase in a 2 to 6 per cent annual rate range--the
midpoint of which is below the 6 per cent average annual rate of
growth of this aggregate since mid-year.
","(11) Expansion of M-2 under alternative A is likely to be
in a 6½ to 10½ per cent annual rate range over the November-December
period. The interest-bearing component of this aggregate will be
buoyed by shifts from demand to ATS savings accounts, as well as
by some expected shifts of funds from thrift accounts and other
nonbank sources as the public attempts to meet minimum balance require-
ments on the new transactions accounts. The total of other interest-
bearing deposits in M-2 is expected to moderate slightly from the third
quarter pace, despite the recent higher level of market rates of
interest. Issuance of 6-month money market time deposits (MMTDs)
and large-denomination certificates is expected to offset a further
contraction of nontransferable savings accounts and fixed ceiling
rate time deposits. Banks are likely to continue offering MMTDs
and large-denomination time deposits aggressively in order to finance
their lending. MMTDs are particularly attractive to large banks
since their effective cost is currently below that on large-
denomination CD's by about 1 percentage point.
","(12) The staff has reduced somewhat its projection of
thrift flows for the current quarter in view of their recent slowing
as well as the higher than previously assumed level of market rates.
There may be some continuing tendency for thrifts to reduce promotion
of MMTDs or to cease offering ceiling rates on such certificates, but
by and large the institutions are expected to be under competitive
pressure to continue offering ceiling rates, particularly after
December 1 when outstanding MMTDs begin to mature. Furthermore, the
FHLBB has made it known to S&Ls that advances will not be liberally
available to institutions that do not make reasonable efforts to roll
over maturing 6-month certificates.
","(13) If the Federal funds rate remains around the 9½ to 9¾
per cent level over the intermeeting period, as envisioned under
alternative A, short-term market rates may show mixed changes.
Private short-term credit demands are expected to remain relatively
strong in coming weeks. Nonetheless, the relatively wide spread between
rates on private short-term instruments and the Federal funds rate
may tend to narrow as it becomes clear that the System is not tightening
its policy stance further. The Treasury is expected to offer a
sizable volume of cash management bills in early December and to
continue to put more emphasis on 3-month bills in its weekly bill
offering. Thus, rates on shorter-term Treasury bills may tend to
move up somewhat from current relatively low levels, unless foreign
central bank acquisitions of these instruments once again become
sizable. With regard to longer-term markets, the expected issuance
of foreign-currency denominated securities will likely reduce the
volume of debt issued in the U.S. market over the next few months.
With a modest calendar of corporate and tax-exempt issues also in
prospect, bond yields are unlikely to rise from current levels and
may even decline. Mortgage rates, on the other hand, can be expected
to move higher as demands for loans continue strong at a time when
the thrift inflows are expected to slow.
","(14) Under alternative B, the Federal funds rate would
rise by mid-December to the midpoint of a 9¾ to 10½ per cent range.
M-1 growth would likely be in a ½ to 5½ per cent annual rate range
over November-December, and M-1+ and M-2, respectively in 1½ to 5½
and 6 to 10 per cent ranges. The further increases in short-term
rates would slow M-2 and M-3 growth only modestly, as more aggressive
offerings of 6-month certificates and large-denomination time
deposits could be expected partly to offset weakness in other deposits.
","(15) A further increase in the funds rate against a
backdrop of recent slow growth in the aggregates would add support to
the view that the Federal Reserve is committed to an aggressive
policy to counter inflation and support the dollar. In reaction,
short-term interest rates would likely adjust promptly to the
higher funds rate. However, the impact on bond yields is less clear.
Although capital and money market yields generally tend to move
together, they might not in this case if the inflation anticipations
of market participants are lowered by this action. The dollar would
also be expected to improve somewhat further in exchange markets.
","(16) Appendix I shows the expected Federal funds rate
ranges over the QIII '78 to QIII '79 policy period. In view of the
monetary restraint already in train, the midpoint of the alternative
A path would call for no further increase in the funds rate over this
period. The alternative B pattern contemplates that the increase
in the funds rate in the intermeeting period would be maintained
through the first quarter of 1979. This additional restraint on
monetary expansion implies that the funds rate could be lower than
the alternative A path by next summer while still achieving the
same growth in the aggregates over the QIII '78 to QIII '79 period.
Directive language
","(18) Given below are suggested operational paragraphs
for the directive. The language added last month ""giving due
regard . . . to uncertainties associated with the introduction of
ATS"" has been retained. The form of the first paragraph below
is similar to the directive adopted at the last meeting, while
additional alternative language is provided for placing main
emphasis either on monetary aggregates or on money market conditions
should the Committee wish to return to a formulation similar to that
used for some time before the October meeting. Should the Committee
wish to employ M-1+ as a guide for operations, appropriate language
is shown in brackets. The specifications adopted at the September
meeting are shown in strike-through form.
In the short run, the Committee seeks to achieve bank
reserve and money market conditions that are broadly consistent
with the longer-run ranges for monetary aggregates cited above,
while giving due regard to developing conditions in domestic
and international financial markets/more generally and to
uncertainties associated with the introduction of ATS. Early
in the period before the next regular meeting, System open
market operations are to be directed at attaining a weekly
average Federal funds rate

M-1 growth by about 1½ percentage points over the longer-run policy period
rather than the 3 percentage points originally estimated in February.
4/ Targeted reserve aggregate paths reflect adjustments made subsequent to the
November FOMC meeting for apparent sustained changes in deposit mix and
higher than anticipated levels of excess reserves.
Inflows to MMC's and large denomination time deposits accounted for all of
the growth. M-3 registered a 6-1/4 percent rate of growth during the last
three months of the year as thrift institutions--particularly credit unions
and mutual savings banks--were less successful than banks in attracting
deposits in the current environment of high interest rates. As shown in
Charts 1 and 2, the deceleration of growth in the monetary aggregates over
recent months kept the growth of M-1 and M-3 within the Committee's
desired longer-run ranges for the year ending with the fourth quarter of
range and--even with the sharp fourth quarter deceleration--bank credit
exceeded its longer-run growth range.
","(2) Over the fourth quarter, growth in total reserves was
close to the target path developed by the staff to be consistent with
the Committee's desired growth for the key monetary aggregates, while
growth in nonborrowed reserves was above path, as may be seen from the
bottom panel of the table on the preceding page. Growth in the monetary
base was below target as the public's desire to increase holdings of
currency--the principal component of the base--turned out to be below
even the relatively slow growth that the staff had anticipated. The
total reserves supplied could have been sufficient to offset
the impact on M-1 of weak currency growth since more reserves than
expected were being released in December by shortfalls relative to
expectations in non-money liabilities of banks. However, banks in December
held an unusually and unexpectedly high level of excess reserves, thereby
absorbing the reserves that might otherwise have been used to support money.
","(3) In addition, the relation between reserve and money growth
over any particular time span can diverge because of lagged reserve account-
ing. Demand deposits were weak relative to path in December, thereby affect-
ing the demand for total reserves in late December and early January (and
tending to reduce the rate of growth in total reserves on average from
December to January). Given the recent weakness in reserve demand, the
level of borrowings declined from the $1.7 billion level initially set at
the FOMC meeting. Most recently, the Desk had expected a level of borrow-
ings in the $1.1 to $1.3 billion range, reflecting both weakness in required
reserves and an upward adjustment of some $150 million in the nonborrowed
reserve path for the three weeks ending January 9 in view of the projected
weakness in total reserves.
","(4) The drop in member bank borrowing since the Committee meet-
ing has not been associated with any decline in the federal funds rate, as
may be seen in the table below. In part, the unusually strong demand by
banks for excess reserves in recent weeks may have held up the funds rate.
But in addition, in December banks may have shied away from use of the
discount window, thereby exerting somewhat pressure on the funds market,
following relatively active use of the window in late October and November.

","(5) On balance, since the November FOMC meeting, most short-
term market rates--apart from the funds rate--declined about 20 to 50 basis
points, and yields on Treasury bonds have fallen about 10 basis points.
Yields on high grade corporate and municipal banks, in contrast, have been
essentially unchanged. Mortgage rates have edged higher since the last
Committee meeting, and commitments and lending declined sharply at S&Ls in
November. The Treasury borrowed heavily during the intermeeting period,
raising $3.5 billion of new cash at its regular bill auctions, $5.3 bil-
lion in cash management bills, and another $4.8 billion of new cash in
hand, was relatively light.
","(6) The dollar's exchange value has dropped by almost 3 percent
on a weighted-average basis since the last FOMC meeting, reflecting market
reaction to political developments in the Middle East and to a relative
increase in foreign interest rates.
. U.S. authorities purchased, net,
$300 million equivalent of marks toward repayment of Federal Reserve swap
indebtedness through year-end, but in early January U.S. authorities
sold about $220 million equivalent of foreign currencies, mainly DM.
Exchange markets have been thin and volatile--day-to-day fluctuations in
rates and the size of bid-asked spreads have been unusually wide. Gold
resumed its feverish rise, most recently being quoted at $590 per ounce,
up $200 from the last Committee meeting.

Alternative longer-run targets and strategy
","(8) This section of the bluebook presents material to provide
a basis for preliminary Committee discussion of longer-run target ranges
for the aggregates for 1980, and perhaps beyond--preparatory to making
a decision on these matters at the February meeting. The table below
shows two alternative sets of ranges for 1980 (QIV '79 to QIV '80) as a
starting point for discussion. The ranges shown in the upper panel are
in terms of monetary aggregates as currently defined, while preliminary
estimates of consistent target ranges based on new definitions of the
aggregates are presented in the lower panel. These new definitions will
be ready for publication in February, and the Committee would presumably
make its decision at the February meeting in terms of the newly defined
measures. (The monetary targets for the current and new series are
reconciled in appendix B.)

","(9 ) Alternative I represents a continuation of current policy
with respect to growth of M-1 after adjustment is made for shifts out of
existing demand deposits into ATS accounts. In recent months, it has
been assumed that such shifts would reduce M-1 growth for 1979 as a whole
by about 1-1/2 percentage points, with the bulk of the shift having
occurred in the first half of the year. The staff's judgment at present
is that the initial stock adjustment to the introduction of the new pay-
ments service has been virtually completed and therefore that growth in
ATS accounts in the future will not reflect significant shifts out of
1/
existing demand deposit accounts. Thus, the 4-1/2 to 7-1/2 percent
M-1 growth under alternative I for 1980 would be equivalent--after
allowance for estimated ATS effects--to the 3 to 6 percent target for
of the time and savings deposit components of M-2, would be 6 to 9 per-
cent. If the present 5 to 8 percent range for M-2 were retained, growth
would probably again be near the upper end of the range.

for 1980 indexed by a 3 to 6 percent rate of growth for M-1. The
sizable difference in growth rates of M-1 between alternatives I
and II--a difference of 1-1/2 percentage points--has been chosen
to help clarify differential economic impacts of policy alternatives.
Of course, the Committee may wish to choose growth rates between I
and II, or even higher than I or lower than II. Economic effects of various
longer-run strategies are noted in the ensuing paragraphs.
","(11) The implications for the economy of alternative I, which
assumes a 6 percent M-1 growth over the projection period, are laid out in
detail in the Greenbook. A summary of effects of this assumption on
nominal GNP, real GNP, prices, and unemployment is shown in the first row
of each panel of the table on the next page. The second row of each panel
shows the projected effects of holding M-1 growth to 4½ percent--the mid-
point of the alternative II range--over each of the next three years. As
compared with the higher money growth rate, the lower M-1 growth rate
reduces the rate of increase in prices by about a percentage point after
three years (the end of 1982), but retarding effects on real GNP through-
out the period are substantial. The differential impacts of alternative M-1
strategies assume the rather long lag between monetary policy changes and
price effects that has characterized past experience and that is reflected
in our quarterly econometric model. If price expectations in labor and
product markets have become more directly sensitive to announced monetary
policy, the damping effects on price from a slowing in money growth might
well be more pronounced, and the retarding effects on output less so.
Announcement of a 4½ percent M-1 target may also have a favorable effect
on the exchange value of the dollar since it would probably be taken to
signify stronger efforts to contain inflation. But any benefits achieved
by announcement of a relatively low money growth target would be quickly
dissipated if sustained inflationary momentum, in combination with a need
to moderate economic weakness, made it impractical for the Committee to hold
money growth to the target.

as III with regard to M-l, but also includes a federal tax
cut. The tax cut amounts to about $30 billion, half of
which reflects a reduction in corporate income tax rates,
effective mid-1980,and the other half a rollback of social
security rate and base increases scheduled for 1981.
","(12) A faster rate of growth in M-1 than the midpoint of
alternative I--say one near the 7 percent upper end of the range--would
raise output and prices,with impacts roughly equal in magnitude to the
constraining effects of alternative II. While such an accelerated rate of
M-1 growth for 1980 could be construed as a temporary accommodation to the
increase in energy prices imposed by OPEC, it is also likely that its
announcement would further fuel inflationary expectations and adversely affect
the dollar in exchange markets. Thus, it could result in an even more
rapid increase in prices, less stimulative impacts on output, and,over
time,further upward pressures on interest rates.
","(13) The third row of each panel in the table indicates the
probable results of a strategy of maintaining a 6 percent rate of growth
in M-1 for 1980, but reducing this growth rate gradually over the next two
years to 5 percent and then to 4 percent. This strategy would be
associated with less output loss over the period than strategy II and
would restrain inflation more than strategy I. Whether such a policy
can be undertaken with even less adverse effects on output and employment
depends, of course, on success of the policy in reducing inflationary
expectations, particularly as such expectations affect decisions in labor
and product markets. Announcement of a firmly held intention to lower
growth rates might tend to reduce such expectations more than would
announcement of only, for example, a one-year goal of 6 percent M-1 growth.
On the other hand, announcement of multi-year targets leaves the System
more exposed to the possibility that unforeseen events will require adjust-
ments in the announced targets, and therefore heightens the risk that the
credibility of the targeting process may be impaired.
","(14) While there is not yet any clear Administration or
Congressional impetus for a discretionary fiscal policy change, the fore-
casted weakness of the economy does suggest the distinct possibility of
a tax cut initiative later this year. To provide the Committee with some
idea of how such an action--particularly one designed to have a relatively
favorable price impact--might affect the environment for monetary policy,
a tax cut projection has been included in the fourth row of each panel.
The rate of price increase is reduced by a rollback of social security
tax increases now scheduled for the beginning of 1981. Thisand an assumed
general corporate tax cut taking effect in the third quarter of 1980,also
would tend to increase real spending.
Policy alternatives for the short-run
","(15) Shown below for Committee consideration are three alternative
growth rates for the monetary aggregates covering the first three months
of 1980 and associated federal funds rate ranges for the period between
now and the February meeting. Aggregates in the upper panel are based
on the current definitions, which would provide the basis for operations
until the next meeting. Preliminary estimates of consistent rates of
growth on the new definitions are shown in the second panel to help
prepare the transition to such measures at the February meeting. More
detailed data for current definitions, including growth rates on a quarterly
average basis related to alternative longer-run paths, are shown in the
tables on pp. 15 and 16 .

","(16) The Committee's choice of a shorter-run monetary growth
path for the first three months of 1980 may depend in part on the longer-
run target it chooses and in part on the pattern of money growth it wishes
to see over the course of the year. (The relation of the proposed shorter-
run targets to the midpoints of longer-run alternatives I and II is displayed
in chart 3, following page 16). Growth through the year can be
targeted at a pace roughly equal to the longer-run objective, or growth
can be higher (lower) early in the year and offsettingly lower (higher)
later in the year. Given the projected pattern of money demand, various
target paths during the year selected by the Committee would have differing
effects on interest rates, on exchange markets, and on the probability of
success in attaining particular long-run targets. In the ensuing analysis
the transactions demand for money is assumed to be weakest in the first

half of the year, when economic activity and nominal GNP growth are
projected to be weakest, and then to strengthen, along with nominal GNP,
in the second half.
","(17) The recent relatively slow growth of M-1 raises the possi-
bility that the record level of interest rates following the October 6
program may have induced another round of one-time shifts out of existing
money balances. Even if any such shift has about run its course,
demands for cash in the first quarter of 1980 may still be fairly weak,
given the less than 5 percent annual rate of increase in nominal GNP that
is projected for that period. Thus, achievement of the 6 percent annual
growth rate for M-1 over the first quarter in alternative A--which appears to
involve increases of about 8 and 3 percent in the monetary base and total
reserves, respectively--may be accompanied by relatively substantial
declines of interest rates from current levels.
","(18) The federal funds rate may drop to, or conceivably below,
the bottom of the 10½ to 15½ percent range specified for alternative A
over the next few weeks, and the 3-month bill rate could be in a 9 to 10
percent area. If the discount rate were not changed from the present
$200 to $300 million, and nonborrowed reserves would expand by about 15
percent over the quarter. Of course, if the discount rate were reduced
significantly under the circumstances, member bank borrowing would be
somewhat higher.
","(19) A sizable rally in bond markets would seem likely under
this alternative, even though some pick-up in bond offerings may be expected
as corporations take the opportunity to fund large short-term indebtedness.
Mortgage rates also would decline, as spreads widen against bond yields
and thrift institutions become more confident about the availability of
lower cost deposits to fund mortgage acquisitions.
","(20) The substantial decline in short rates that appear to
be implied by alternative A probably would be accompanied by significant
downward pressures on the international value of the dollar, especially
if the dollar also remains under pressure because of the crises in the
mid-East. Downward pressures would be strongest if market participants
come to expect a further decline in U.S. interest rates and interpret the
decline of interest rates as a sign that the Fed's resolve to combat
inflation has weakened.
","(21) However, assuming that the decline in economic activity
has begun to abate by summer, but that the rate of inflation has not slowed
significantly, interest rates would probably begin rising during the spring
or summer if M-1 growth over the year 1980 were held to 6 percent or less,
as shown in the first and fourth columns of appendix C. For a given longer-
run growth rate, interest rates would be at higher levels by year-end under
this alternative than under alternatives B and C, partly because it will
provide a little greater stimulus to economic activity and partly because
the larger expansion of M-1 in the first quarter will allow less scope to
accommodate the subsequent increase in the transactions demand for money as
nominal GNP expands in the second half.
","(22) In order to achieve the 5 percent rate of growth of M-1
in the first quarter specified under alternative B, a decline in interest
rates from current levels would also be likely. The funds rate, for example,
would probably drop over the next few weeks into the lower half of the 11½
to 15½ percent rate range shown for this alternative, with the 3-month bill
rate declining to the 10 to 11 percent area. Over the first quarter the
monetary base and total reserves might have to increase at about 7½ and 2½
percent rates, respectively, and with member bank borrowings falling to
around $800 to $900 million, nonborrowed reserves would expand by about
","(23) Even the more modest decline in money market rates
associated with alternative B is likely to induce a rally in bond markets
as it becomes clear that interest rates have peaked. The decline in
mortgage rates would probably be moderate, though. Net inflows of funds
to thrift institutions are likely to pick up only modestly from their
second half of 1979 pace, and costs of such funds would not decline as
much as under alternative A. The exchange value of the dollar under
alternative B is likely to decline somewhat as market participants focus
on the decline of interest rates, but there would be less downward pressure
than under alternative A, in part because any interest rate declines under
alternative B would be associated with slower money growth.
","(24) The more modest money growth over the next few months under
alternative B provides more scope for expansion in M-1 in the second half
of 1980 than does alternative A. Moreover, the smaller reduction of interest
rates, as compared with alternative A, would provide less stimulus to nominal
GNP and money demand later this year. Thus, under this alternative interest
rates may drift downward through summer under longer-run alternative I,
shown in the second column of appendix C. However, under the more restrictive
longer-run policy of alternative II, interest rates would probably begin
rising by spring as the quantity of money demanded tended to expand more
rapidly than the supply that would be provided consistent with the 4½ percent
midpoint of the alternative II path.
","(25) Alternative C contemplates a rate of growth of M-1 of
about 4 percent in the first three months of 1980, which, given the
staff's GNP outlook, would probably involve little, if any, decline in
interest rates from current levels in that period. The funds rate may be
a bit below the 13 percent midpoint of the 11½ to 16 percent federal funds
rates specified for this alternative, with the 3-month bill rate around
and total reserves is likely to be about 7 and 1½ percent, respectively;
assuming borrowings of about $1¼ billion or a bit higher, nonborrowed
reserves might increase at about a 4 percent rate. Longer-term interest rates
probably would decline no more than modestly from current levels over the
next few weeks, as it became clear to market participants that, despite
relatively slow growth in M-1, very little ease was developing in money
market conditions. Alternative C would tend to help support the exchange
value of the dollar since it would be associated with maintenance of a
relatively high level of interest rates.
","(26) The relatively high level of interest rates of alternative C
in the first quarter would probably not be long sustained, however, if the
Committee sought a 6 percent growth rate for M-1 for the year 1980. The
funds rate would be expected to decline by early spring, and reach levels
by year-end lower than under alternative B. However, should the Committee
seek to restrain M-1 growth to a 4½ percent rate during 1980, interest
rates would probably change little over the balance of the year.
Directive language
","(27) Given below are suggested operational paragraphs for
the directive consistent with the form of the directive adopted at
the October and November meetings. It calls for expansion of reserve
aggregates at a pace consistent with the desired rates of growth in
M-1 and M-2 over the first quarter of 1980, provided that the federal
funds rate on a weekly average basis remains within a specified range.
The range for the funds rate adopted on November 20 is shown in strike-
through form.
In the short run, the Committee seeks [DEL: to restrain
expansion of reserve aggregates [DEL: to a pace] consistent with
[DEL: deceleration in] growth of M-1, AND M-2 [DEL: , and M-3 in] OVER the
[DEL: fourth] FIRST quarter of [DEL: 1979 to] 1980 AT ANNUAL rates OF ABOUT

funds rate remains within a range of [DEL: 11½ to 15½] ____ TO ____
If it appears during the period before the next
meeting that the constraint on the federal funds rate is
inconsistent with the objective for the expansion of reserves,
the Manager for Domestic Operations is promptly to notify the
Chairman who will then decide whether the situation calls for
supplementary instructions from the Committee.

1980-03-18,1980-03-18,"(1) Growth of the monetary aggregates accelerated sharply in
February, moving them well above the Committee's December-to-March target
paths. M-1A grew at about a 12 percent annual rate in February, and at a
buoyed by larger than expected growth of money market mutual funds and M-3
by enlarged issuance of large time deposits at commercial banks to finance
a sharp pick-up in bank credit. Despite large MMC sales, outstanding
small denomination deposits at thrifts declined in January and February, and
only issuance of large time deposits by S&Ls (included in M-3) prevented
a contraction of total thrift deposits. In late February and early March,
transactions deposits declined sharply, and growth in M-1A and M-1B for
March is projected to be very low. On that assumption, growth rates in
these aggregates would be about 1 percentage point above the Committee's
targets for the December-March period. Growth in M-2 over that span would
likely be somewhat stronger relative to target.

of reserve measures that originally appeared consistent with the monetary
targets adopted by the FOMC for the December to March period at its last
meeting are shown in the first column of the table below. As indicated by
the second column, the original path for total reserves was adjusted down-
ward to allow for reduced member bank demand for excess reserves, larger
than expected growth in nonmember bank deposits and currency, and less than
expected growth in reservable member bank deposits not included in M-1 or M-2.
In addition, the nonborrowed reserve path was reduced still more in an effort
to exert greater restraint on total reserves and money. Thus far in the
quarter, growth in the monetary base and total reserves has been running
above the adjusted target, while growth in nonborrowed reserves has fallen
below target.

the increase in the discount rate on February 15, the federal funds rate

adjustments in the reserve paths would likely entail additional pressures on
the money market, the Committee approved an increase in the upper limit of its
federal funds rate constraint from 15 to 16 percent on February 22 and
then to 18 percent on March 7. By early March funds were trading in excess
of 17 percent on some days and averaged 16.45 percent in the most recent
complete statement week. Member bank borrowing rose in the course of
the intermeeting period, reaching an exceptionally higher level of $3.4
billion on average in the statement week ending March 12; in the preceding
","(4) Interest rates moved up sharply on balance during the inter-
meeting period as inflationary expectations worsened. Continuing the
sharp rise that had begun in January, bond yields rose about to 1 per-
centage points further, and interest rates on home mortgages have jumped
sharply in the past three weeks. Short-term rates, which had not risen
earlier in the year, increased 3 to 4 percentage points over the inter-
meeting period. They began to rise in mid-February as bank reserve positions
tightened and the discount rate was increased. Pressures in short-term
markets were reinforced by bank issuance of CD's to finance strong credit
demands and by large sales of Treasury bills by foreign official institutions
to finance currency support operations. Uncertainties about the timing
and content of the government's anti-inflation program also contributed to
the market's unsettledness.
","(5) In recent weeks, the dollar has shown remarkable strength
in the exchange markets.
, the weighted-average value of the dollar has risen by
about 44 percent since the last Committee meeting.1 This strength was
attributable to the steep rise in U.S. interest rates, to anticipations of
a forthcoming anti-inflation package, to a growing appreciation by the
market of the magnitudes of current account deficits in major countries
abroad, and to the acceleration of inflation in other countries.
","(6) The table on the next page shows seasonally adjusted annual
rates of change, in percent, for selected monetary and financial flows over
various time periods.
Partial data through late February, however,
indicate that U.S. banking offices have raised only a moderate amount
of funds offshore, perhaps because this would increase their reservable
managed liabilities. This implies that the privately acquired dollars
may have been channeled into increased net borrowing of U.S. nonfinancial
corporations (possibly through their own foreign affiliates) from foreign
banks or foreign commercial credit sources.

Prospective Developments and Short-term Targets
","(7) Shown below for Committee consideration are three alternative
targets for the monetary aggregates over the six-month December to June
interval, along with implied growth rates for the February to June period.1/
Also shown are intermeeting federal funds rate ranges. The funds range
currently in effect is shown under alternative B. Because of recent upward
adjustments in the upper limit, the range has become considerably wider
than the 4 point width that had been usual since the October program was
adopted. If the Committee wished to return to a narrower range, the staff
would suggest that a 13 or 14 to 18 percent range would be generally con-
sistent with alternative B under present market circumstances (and similar
adjustments would need to be made to alternatives A and C).

","(8) Alternative B extends through June the FOMC's previous
target rates of growth of M-1A and M-1B for the December to March period
of 4 and 5 percent annual rates, respectively. Such growth, as shown on
The specified growth for February-June represents a significant slowing
from the February pace, and as shown in chart 2, such growth would place
M-2 in June at the midpoint of its longer-run range.
","(10) The slowing of M-2 is largely a reflection of the assumed
lower rate of expansion in M-1A and M-1B. Within the nontransactions
component of M-2, inflows to money market mutual funds are projected to
moderate, but outflows at thrifts of small denomination deposits are expected
to abate. Inflows to money market funds may be restrained more substantially
by actions taken in connection with the government's new anti-inflation
program, but much of the money involved likely would remain in, or be shifted
to, other deposit accounts in M-2, as well as in M-3. Thus, we would expect
only a relatively minor effect on the total of M-2 and M-3 growth from the
new program, though the distribution of growth among components of the
aggregates would be affected.
","(11) The specifications of alternative B imply an annual rate of
growth from February to June of the monetary base and of total reserves of
about 7¾ percent and 5¾ percent, at annual rates, respectively. Member
bank borrowings might average around the $2½ billion over the next few
weeks; assuming that they then edge down toward about $1¾ billion by mid-
year, nonborrowed reserves would increase at about a 4¾ percent annual
rate over the February-June period. The level of borrowing and growth of
nonborrowed reserves would, of course, be affected by any changes in bank
attitudes toward the discount window. It is not clear whether the newly
instituted 3 point surcharge over the basic discount rate will tend to
encourage more willing use of the window, at least up to the point where
the surcharge goes into effect, or will encourage banks to be more
conservative for fear that unexpected events may force them to borrow at
the higher rate.
","(12) Business external financing requirements are expected to
remain substantial in the second quarter as capital outlays are projected
to move higher while internal cash flow falls off. It is possible that
some of the financing need may have already been met to the extent that the
recent surge in borrowing at banks reflected anticipation of credit controls.
Even so, there is likely to be some conflict between business borrowing
needs in the near-term and the special credit restraint program. If the
guidelines of that program are followed, they would imply a marked slowing
in loan growth, given the relatively rapid growth that has already occurred
this year. However, if the new program leads to a reduction of inflationary
expectations, the associated drop that is likely to occur in bond yields
may divert some business borrowing to that market. On balance, it seems
likely that bank credit growth will slow in the months ahead from the very
rapid January-February pace, but still may be large enough to require banks
to continue to issue high cost managed liabilities. Thrifts and mortgage
markets too are likely to remain under considerable tension in the months
ahead absent any substantial decline in short-term rates over the near-term--
which seems unlikely given the monetary targets of alternative B.
","(13) Alternative C calls for lower money targets than alternative
B. In the February-June period, M-1A would expand at a 2¼ percent annual
rate. This alternative probably would require some further rise in the
federal funds rate over the next few weeks toward the 18 percent area.
Money market rates generally would follow the funds rate upward, but rate
effects in bond markets would tend to be dominated by factors influencing
inflationary expectations. The tightening of money markets that appears
needed under alternative C might be construed by the market as reinforcing
the new anti-inflation program, and this could lead to some easing of bond
market pressures even as short rates rise. Still, earnings pressures on
financial intermediaries would be intensified, and consumer and mortgage
credit conditions would tighten further. The dollar would likely strengthen
further, even though some additional U.S. monetary restraint would not come as
a great surprise to the market; foreign central bank intervention sales,
however, would likely limit the extent of the rise in the dollar's exchange
","(14) As shown in the charts, the aggregate specifications of
alternative C imply that M-1A and M-1B would be below their midpoint paths
by June. Consequently, to achieve the midpoint of the longer-run ranges
for all of 1980, the Committee would have to raise money growth in the
second half of the year. In that period, interest rates are expected to be
under downward pressure in any event in view of the sharp reduction in real
GNP that the staff is projecting. A federal funds rate of around 14 per-
cent would be projected for late 1980 under alternative B, and would be
a bit lower under alternative C.
","(15) Alternative C would probably require growth in the monetary
base over the February to June period at about a 7 percent annual rate,
while total reserves would expand at a 5 percent rate. Nonborrowed
reserves may expand at about a ½ percent annual rate, assuming an initial
level of borrowing of around $2¾ billion and a gradual decline beginning
around mid-spring.
","(16) Compared to the other alternatives, alternative A involves
a greater increase in money over the four months ending in June, with
M-1A targeted to expand at a 3¾ percent rate over that period. The monetary
base and total reserves might expand at annual rates of 8 and 6 percent,
respectively. As shown in the charts, the more rapid rates of growth of
aggregates anticipated under alternative A would carry them to levels in
June above their midpoint paths. The somewhat greater reserve supply would
tend to be associated with some downward pressure on money market rates.
The federal funds rate possibly would decline to about the 15 to 15 per-
cent area over the next few weeks, with an associated member bank borrowing
of around $1¾ billion. Nonborrowed reserves would expand at about a 6½
percent annual rate in the February to June period.
","(17) The immediate decline in money market rates that could
develop under alternative A might be viewed by the markets as inconsistent
with the new anti-inflation program. Under that interpretation, the
dollar might weaken on foreign exchange markets; in addition, any
tendency of the bond markets to rally would be limited by continued
inflationary expectations. The short-term rate decline under this alterna-
tive over the next few weeks is not likely to be large enough to make any
significant difference for thrift deposit flows, and mortgage markets would
continue taut.
","(18) Given below are suggested operational paragraphs for
the directive consistent with the form of the directive adopted at recent
meetings. It calls for expansion of reserve aggregates at a pace consistent
with the desired rates of monetary growth over the first half of 1980, pro-
vided that the federal funds rate on a weekly average basis remains within
a specified range. The specifications adopted at the last meeting, adjusted
for the March 7 increase in the upper limit of the range for the federal
funds rate, are shown in strike-through form.
In the short run, the Committee seeks expansion of reserve
aggregates consistent with growth over the first {DEL: quarter] HALF of
percent for M-1B, provided that in the period before the next
regular meeting the weekly average federal funds rate remains within
a range of [DEL: 11½ to 18] ____ TO ____ percent. The Committee believes
that, consistent with this short-run policy, M-2 [DEL: as newly defined]
should grow at an annual rate of about [DEL: 6½] ____ percent over the
first [DEL: quarter] HALF.
If it appears during the period before the next meeting that the
constraint on the federal funds rate is inconsistent with the
objective for the expansion of reserves, the Manager for Domestic
Operations is promptly to notify the Chairman who will then decide

1981-05-18,1981-05-18,"(1) Adjusted for estimated shifts of funds from nontransactions
to NOW accounts, growth in M-1B accelerated in April to about a 14 percent
annual rate.1/ To some extent, this pick-up in M-l growth may reflect
a realignment in the public's stock of money holdings toward more
normal relationships with income and interest rates following the near-
record increase in velocity earlier this year. Growth of M-lB in April
was substantially more rapid than the pace implicit in the Committee's
performance of M-1B in the winter, the level of M-1B in April was well
within the Committee's longer-run range--about at the midpoint. Growth
of M-2 remained relatively rapid last month, and its level continued to
be above the upper end of its longer-run range. Growth in the nontrans-
action component of M-2 slowed markedly, however. The total of savings
and small time deposits did not expand in April, and MMMF growth slowed
as market rates rose substantially above average MMMF yields around mid-
month. M-3 in April expanded at almost a 10 percent rate, and its level
remains above the upper end of the Committee's longer-run range.

","(2) Nonborrowed reserves declined sharply in April, as banks
were forced to borrow more to meet their reserve needs; they also reduced
their excess reserves by a sizable amount. By the statement weeks ending
April 29 and May 6 average borrowings had increased to the $2.3 to $2.5
billion area, and the funds rate had moved higher--by late April and early
May tending to exceed the upper end of the 13 to 18 percent range for
consultation adopted at the March meeting. After consultation in early
May, the Committee agreed to adhere to the previously adopted money
targets, recognizing that the federal funds rate would probably fluctuate
above the upper limit of the funds rate range.1 / Most recently, the rate
has been in the 18 to 19 percent area. The basic discount rate and the
surcharge were raised 1 percentage point each, effective May 5.

","(3) In response to the strength of money demand relative to
the Committee's short-run targets, and to the discount rate action, short-
term market rates generally rose sharply over the intermeeting period.
While still below their December highs, Treasury bill rates have increased
private money market obligations have risen by even larger amounts. The
bank prime rate was raised in steps from 17 percent at the end of March
to 19 percent, but these increases lagged the rising commercial paper
and Eurodollar rates, contributing to a shift of credit demands toward
U.S. offices of large banks in late April and early May.
","(4) Treasury and corporate bond yields have risen about 1
percentage point since late March to record levels. Despite the increase
in longer-term yields, and an increase in the number of postponements,
public offerings of corporate and municipal notes and bonds have remained
relatively large. The Treasury has raised about $8 billion in note and
bond sales, including around $2 billion in its recently completed quarterly
refunding auctions. The average commitment rate on primary conventional
mortgages at S&Ls increased to more than 16 percent in the intermeeting

all major currencies, increasing on a weighted-average basis by 9 percent
to the highest level since late 1977.
U.S. authorities have not been
in the market. The dollar's strength over this period primarily reflected
the sharp rise in U.S. interest rates.

policy strategies for the current quarter. The upper panel of the table
shows growth rates for the two-month April to June period, and the lower
panel gives consistent growth rates for the March to June interval covered by
the Committee's short-run target adopted at the last meeting. The M-1B
growth targets abstract from the estimated impact of nationwide NOW
accounts, as do the Committee's longer-run targets.1/ (More detailed
and longer-run data for the aggregates, on both an adjusted and unadjusted
basis, including those for M-1A, are shown in the tables on pp. 6 and 7.)

","(8) Alternative C is based on continuation of the 5 percent
annual rate of growth for M-1B over the March to June period targeted by
the Committee at its last meeting--a growth rate which, as shown in
widen their spread over MMMF yields. As shown in chart 2, the level of M-2
in June would be at the upper bound of its longer-run range for the year
under alternative C, while it would remain somewhat above the range under
the other two alternatives.
","(11) The projected slowing of real and nominal GNP this quarter,
as well as the recent increases in interest rates, should tend to retard
narrow money growth from the extremely rapid April pace. However, money
demand may remain fairly strong, and interest rates under upward pressure,
unless the economy is considerably weaker than the staff now anticipates
or unless the current level of interest rates induces another shift to
more intensive cash management. Even under alternative A--which involves
growth in total reserves from April to June at an 8 percent annual rate--
the federal funds rate seems likely to remain in a 17 to 20 percent range
over the balance of the quarter.1/ Assuming the present discount rate
structure, adjustment borrowing would probably be around $1 to $2 billion.
Continued high long-term rates may tend to induce firms to focus their
growing credit demands on banks and other sources of short-term credit
over the near term--although the limited flexibility of many borrowers
and a desire to stem the deterioration of balance sheets likely will
maintain bond issuance at a high level.
","(12) Alternatives B and C would call for a growth in total
reserves over the April to June period at annual rates of 6 and 4 percent,
respectively. A federal funds rate around 20 percent or a bit higher is
likely to emerge over the next few weeks under alternative B, while the
funds rate under C could rise further. Given current discount rates,
borrowing at the discount window might rise to around the $2 billion
area under alternative B and to around $3 billion under alternative C.
Of course, any increase in the present discount rate level and structure
would work to reduce the demand for borrowing. Other short-term rates
would probably rise substantially further under these alternatives, with
upward pressures particularly intense under alternative C. Long-term
interest rates would also rise further over the weeks ahead, probably
inducing a large volume of postponements and cancellations of bond
","(14) The outlook for interest rates under all three alternatives
suggests continued weakness in mortgage demands and also intense earnings
pressures on thrift institutions, with alternative C implying a higher
probability of a number of failures this summer. Moreover, with their
deposit flows weak--and less than they may have anticipated--some institu-
tions may find it necessary to draw down their stock of liquid assets.
Although the new mortgage instruments recently approved by the FHLBB are
likely to be translated into an increased willingness of thrifts to make
mortgage loans, their impact on interest income will be modest for some
Directive language
","(15) Given below is a suggested operational paragraph for
the directive consistent with the form of the directives adopted at
recent meetings. The specifications adopted at the meeting on March 31
are shown in strike-through form.
In the short run the Committee seeks behavior of reserve
aggregates consistent with A SUBSTANTIAL DECELERATION OF growth in
M-1B from [DEL: March] APRIL to June [DEL: at] TO an annual rate of [DEL: 5½] ____ percent
[DEL: or somewhat less,] after allowance for the impact of flows into NOW
accounts, and WITH growth in M-2 at an annual rate of about [DEL: 10½]
____ percent. It is recognized that shifts into NOW accounts will
continue to distort measured growth in M-1B to an unpredictable
extent, and operational reserve paths will be developed in the
light of evaluation of those distortions. If it appears during the
period before the next meeting that fluctuations in the federal
funds rate, taken over a period of time, within a range of [DEL: 13] ____
to [DEL: 18] ____ percent are likely to be inconsistent with the monetary
and related reserve paths, the Manager for Domestic Operations is
promptly to notify the Chairman, who will then decide whether the
situation calls for supplementary instructions from the Committee.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1981-10-05,1981-10-06,"(1) Growth of M1-B (adjusted for shifts into NOW accounts)
accelerated to almost a 7 percent annual rate in August, but then con-
tracted in September. Over the June to September short-term target period
growth was at about a 1¾ percent annual rate, well below the Committee's
objective for that interval. As shown in the last column of the table
on the next page, growth in adjusted M-1B for the year to date is just
a little over 1 percent at an annual rate, well below the lower limit of
the Committee's 3½ to 6 percent longer-run range.
","(2) Growth of M2 over the June to September period was at a
end of the FOMC's longer-run range. The nontransaction component of M2
in August and September showed considerable strength, led by continued
large inflows into money market mutual funds.
","(3) In interpreting the third quarter behavior of M2, it should
be noted that its growth was restrained by diversion of M2 balances to
retail RPs issued by depository institutions in part to compete with MMMFs
but mainly to attract customer funds in anticipation of the October 1
issuance of All Saver Certificates (ASCs).1  These RPs were not included
in M2 when it was redefined in early 1980 because they were not of any
importance at that time. Inclusion of all such RPs in M2 would raise its
$6.3 billion at S&Ls, $1.3 billion at mutual savings banks, and
$3.5 billion at commercial banks. Staff estimates based on sample
data suggest such RPs rose a further $4 billion by the end of

growth from June to September by about 2 percentage points. If adjusted
to include retail RPs, growth of M2 would be about ¾ of a percentage point
above the longer-run target range.
","(4) Nonborrowed reserves expanded at a 20 percent annual rate
over the third quarter. Total reserves expanded substantially less, though,
as adjustment borrowing from the discount window declined, reflecting the
weakening in required reserves against transaction balances. In the
most recent statement week, adjustment borrowing averaged a little over
$1 billion, some $350 million below the level assumed in constructing the
reserve paths after the last meeting. Growth in the monetary base was
considerably less rapid than expansion in total reserves, as expansion of
currency slowed to an unusually low 4 percent annual rate over the past
three months.1/
","(5) The federal funds rate, which had averaged around 19 percent
in July and around 18¼ percent at the time of the August meeting, recently
has traded in a 14½ to 16½ percent range as pressure in the reserves market
to 2½ percentage points. The bank prime rate was reduced by 1 percentage
point to 19½ percent, and the Federal Reserve reduced by 1 percentage point
to 3 percent the surcharge rate for large, frequent borrowers at the
discount window.
","(6) Despite the easing in the money market, bond yields have
increased on balance since the last meeting by 50 to over 100 basis points.
The advance in long-term yields reflected in large part market concerns about
federal deficits in fiscal 1982 and beyond. The Treasury raised over
$8 billion of new money in September to build up its cash balance to help
meet the large fourth-quarter combined (unified and off-budget) deficit of
around $50 billion, and it has recently held or announced auctions
to raise another $5 billion of cash through 20- and 7-year issues.
","(7) Since its peak in early August, just prior to the last
FOMC meeting, the dollar has declined on balance by about 7 percent.
Lower short-term interest rates in the United States contributed to the
dollar's net decline, but the market also reacted to the prospective
improvement in Germany's current account and a weakening in that of the
United States.
Prospective developments
","(8) The table below presents three alternative approaches to
the monetary aggregates for the fourth quarter of 1981. Implied growth
rates for the QIV '80 to QIV '81 longer-run policy period for each of
these alternatives are also shown. Possible ranges for the intermeeting
federal funds rate are indicated in the last line of the table. (More
detailed data on these and other aggregates may be found on the following
two pages, and charts indicating the relationship of the alternative three-
month targets to the Committee's existing longer-run ranges for 1981 may
be found on the next three pages.)

","(9) Alternative A is designed to achieve a rapid enough expansion
of M1-B over the next three months so that it would reach the lower limit
of the FOMC's 3½ to 6 percent longer-run target range by December. This
approach would probably lead to growth in M2 (and also M3) for the year
well above target. Alternative C is designed to bring M2 closer to its
target for the year, with the projected small overshoot accounted for mainly
by shifts of funds out of non-M2 assets into ASCs; such an approach would

leave M1-B for the year well below the lower end of its range. Alternative
B falls midway between the two approaches.1/
","(10) Under the specifications of alternative C we would expect
growth in M1-B at a 6 percent annual rate over the September to December
period to be consistent with maintaining M2 relatively near to the upper
limit of its longer-run target range. The staff does not expect this
alternative to involve further downward pressures on short-term interest
rates, given the 7 percent increase in nominal GNP projected for the
fourth quarter and assuming less rapid downward shift in demand for M1-B
","(11) Over the next few weeks, the federal funds rate under
this alternative may fluctuate for the most part in the area of 15 to 16
percent. Other short-term rates are not likely to drop further under
such circumstances, and they could edge higher. Business net demands on
financial markets are expected to remain sizable as profits continue
to be squeezed, and to focus, as in the recent past, on short-term markets.
About half of the Treasury's large cash need between now and year end
is expected to be raised in the bill market.
","(12) Total reserves would need to expand at a 3 percent annual
rate over the last three months of the year if the monetary specifications
of alternative C are to be achieved. Adjustment borrowing at the discount
window would probably vary between $900 million and $1.2 billion, given
the current structure of discount rates and a federal funds rate in the area
of 15 to 16 percent. Nonborrowed reserves would be targeted to expand at a
","(13) The specifications of alternative B call for a more rapid
growth in M1-B at around a 9 percent annual rate from September to
December, sustained by 6 percent annual rate of growth in total reserves.
The federal funds rate under these conditions is likely to decline to
around the current 14 percent basic discount rate or just below. Adjust-
ment borrowing at the discount window would move down to minimal levels
in the area of $200 to 300 million or so. Nonborrowed reserve growth
would be at a 14 percent annual rate over the next three months.
","(14) Other short-term rates would decline along with the
-funds rate, and a substantial rally in bond markets might develop. The
possibilities of such a rally, or the length of one, would be limited by
the large pent-up corporate and municipal demands for long-term credit that
are likely to materialize as credit conditions ease. Declines in mortgage
rates are likely to lag drops in other longer-term yields, in part reflecting
continued pressures on thrift institutions only partially relieved by ASCs.
It would probably take some time before any significant pick-up in mortgage
commitments was evident, given the past volatility of market conditions and
the relatively short-term maturity of ASC deposits.
","(16) Under alternative A, M1-B growth is targeted to rise at
about a 12 percent annual rate from September to December in order to
bring this aggregate back to the lower bound of its long-run range by the
end of the year. We would expect a substantial drop in short-term rates--
with the funds rate dropping into a 10 to 12 percent range on average and
to reach this objective. Total reserves would have to rise at a 9 percent
annual rate over the quarter, and nonborrowed reserves at about an 18
percent annual rate. A reserve operating path that appears to entail market
rates well below the present 14 percent discount rate calls into question
the sustainability of that rate, for technical reasons if for no other.1/
","(17) M2 under this alternative would probably grow at a 12
percent annual rate over the next three months. Net inflows of funds to
thrift institutions may pick up somewhat, but more importantly, pressures on
their earnings would be greatly alleviated. Both mortgage market rates and
bond yields are likely to show a substantial drop, calling forth stronger
demands for longer-term financing. In exchange markets, the dollar would
probably weaken considerably. However, the declines in long-term rates
and exchange rates would tend to be moderated in the degree that market
participants came to believe that a substantial rebound of short-term
rates was in prospect over a reasonably near term. Such a rebound would
be expected by the staff early next year in the process of restraining money
growth to FOMC's 1982 targets. Such upward interest rate pressures would
be intensified as the sharp easing of credit conditions between now and
year-end contemplated by alternative A leads to more of a strengthening
in economic activity in the first part of next year than is in the current
staff projection.

1982-06-30,1982-07-01,"(1) Though showing only a very slight rise on balance over the
last two months, M1 grew over the March-to-June period at a 4 percent
annual rate, somewhat above the Committee's 3 percent short-run objective.
From the fourth quarter of 1981 to June, M1 is estimated to have increased
at a 6.3 percent annual rate, almost 1 percentage point above the upper
end of its 1982 range. Following a surge in late 1981 and early 1982,
growth in the OCD component has slowed markedly on balance over the last
few months, roughly in line with expectations built into the intermeeting
M1 path; this slowing suggests some abatement in precautionary demands for
","(2) M2 growth at an 8.7 percent annual rate over March-June also
was somewhat above the Committee's second-quarter path, reflecting stronger
than expected expansion of its nontransaction component as well as the
overshoot in M1. From the fourth quarter of 1981 to June, M2 is estimated
to have increased at a 9.3 percent annual rate, just above its longer-run
range. The strength in M2 growth, accompanied by a substantial decline in
its income velocity, suggests that enhanced liquidity demands affected
this aggregate, as well as M1, over the first half of the year. In June,
however, M2 growth slowed substantially.

in June, after growing at about a 9 percent annual rate over the preceding
two months. Business loan growth appears to have remained fairly rapid.
Bank issuance of large CDs accelerated sharply in the past two months,

","(4) Total reserves expanded at about a 3¼ percent average annual
rate in May and June; with nonborrowed reserves growing at an 8½ percent
rate over the two months, borrowing at the discount window fell about
$340 million from the April level. Throughout the intermeeting period
borrowing has remained above the initial level of $800 million specified
by the Committee, averaging $950 million for the six weeks. Borrowing in
excess of the initial level early in the period partly reflected increased
needs for borrowed reserves resulting from unexpected shortfalls in reserve
factors late in the week as well as apparent difficulties of some large
individual institutions in gauging reserve positions.1/ Most recently,
nonborrowed paths have implied borrowing around $1 billion, as money growth
above Committee objectives has boosted the demand for total reserves rela-
tive to the path for nonborrowed reserves.

the two most recent full statement weeks,2/ compared with the 14½ percent
area prevailing at the time of the May FOMC meeting. At the same time,
however, other interest rates have risen about ½ to 1½ percentage points

Longer-run targets
","(7) Two options that seem reasonable under current circumstances
in reconsidering the monetary aggregate targets for 1982 are retention of
the present ranges (shown as alternative A below) or adoption of somewhat
higher ranges (shown as alternative B).1/ The desirability of higher ranges
depends in part on whether it is thought that the strong demands for
liquidity of the first half of the year--reflected in declines in velocity
of both M1 and M2--are likely to abate. It also depends, of course, on the
degree of monetary restraint the Committee deems appropriate under current
economic circumstances and on assessment of the expectational impact on
interest rates and the economy of announced changes, if any, in target
Alt. A Alt. B
","(8) Whether the Committee retains its current longer-run ranges,
or raises them modestly as in alternative B, a marked slowing in growth of
M1 would be required from the first-half pace of a little over 7 percent at
an annual rate (as measured from QIV '81 to QII '82). If the Committee were
to aim at 5 percent growth for the year, expansion in the second half would
have to slow to around a 2¾ percent annual rate. Second-half growth could
be about 4¾ percent at an annual rate if the Committee were to accept a
","(9) It is believed that the degree of slowing in M1 growth
implied by retention of the current longer-run target ranges is generally
consistent with the staff's forecast of a moderate pickup in economic
activity in the second half of this year, assuming growth in M1 over the
year near the upper limit of its long-run range. Growth in M2 and M3
would be expected to be around the upper end of their ranges. An accelera-
tion in the velocity of monetary aggregates is expected in the second half
of the year--in the case of M1 to the 4½ to 5½ percent range. Apart
from the positive impact of renewed economic confidence and reduced demands
for precautionary balances on velocity growth, more intensive use of cash
balances could emerge if there is a spread of sweep accounts or shifts
out of cash into the kinds of highly liquid time deposit accounts that are
being considered by DIDC at its forthcoming meeting. On the other hand,
continued unusual demands for liquidity could damp the expected rebound
in velocity, and make it less likely that a significant upturn in economic
activity would occur in the context of money growth within the bounds of
the existing target ranges.
","(10) Factors relevant to the setting of tentative targets for
in financial structure and technology, progress in curbing wage-price
pressures, and the continued need to encourage economic recovery. Un-
certainties about the impact of financial innovation and public attitudes
toward money and other liquid assets argue for maintaining relatively wide
ranges for targets, such as the present 3 percentage points. Continuing
progress toward price stability suggests that these ranges might be
reduced next year, but slower growth in money next year can also be
accomplished, of course, within the present ranges.
","(11) A reduction in 1983 of the upper and lower limits of the
ranges for M1, M2, and M3 from their current levels by ½ percentage point
would be consistent with the staff's GNP projection for that year--if
actual growth in the aggregate were permitted to be near the upper limits
of the ranges. The table on the following page summarizes implications
for economic activity of various monetary policy strategies, as indexed
by growth rates for M1. Strategy 1 underlies the staff's judgmental
GNP projection, which is based on growth of M1 at a 5 percent rate in
alternative projections are derived from differences calculated by the
quarterly econometric model.
","(12) Strategy 2 projects the possible outcome of a modest
increase in the target range for money this year, while returning to the
strategy 1 assumptions for M1 growth in the next years. This approach
tends to have a positive effect on economic activity this year, but it
leads to a somewhat higher inflation rate over time and the probability
of a noticeable rebound of interest rates in 1983 after a drop in the
latter part of this year. This interest rate rebound contributes to
a slowing in growth of economic activity in the latter part of the pro-
jection period. Strategy 4 contemplates an increase in money growth this
year and also more growth than under strategy 2 during the next two years.
Economic activity would tend to be stronger over the three projection
years, but the rate of price inflation, after falling for a while, begins
to accelerate in 1984. The rate of inflation could, of course, pick up

earlier, with economic activity weaker, should such a monetary course
itself have adverse effects on inflationary expectations. Strategy 3,
which contemplates a more rapid deceleration in money growth over the next
two years following 5 percent growth this year, produces the most rapid
progress toward price stability but at the cost of stronger pressures
on short-term interest rate and reduced real growth. With all of the
monetary strategies, short-term interest rates remain relatively high
in real terms. This evolves out of the continued strength in nominal
income and associated money demand relative to money supply targets, with
nominal income sustained by stimulative fiscal policy of the Federal
Government whose credit demands are generally insensitive to interest
Alternative short-run targets

targets for the third quarter, plus associated ranges for the federal funds
rate during the intermeeting period. More detailed data for the alternatives
are shown in the table on page 11.

Growth from June to September
","(14) Under alternative A, M1 over the next three months would
grow at a rate matching that of the upper bound of the Committee's current
longer-run range. Because such a trajectory would mean that there would
be no narrowing of the existing absolute gap relative to the top of the
range, alternative A might be viewed as especially consistent with a deci-
sion to raise the 1982 range or to tolerate a small overshoot. Under
alternative B, M1 would expand at a rate that, if sustained, would result
in growth for the year at about the 5½ percent upper bound of the longer-
run range, while alternative C contemplates growth in M1 which would move
the aggregate to just within this year's range by September. Under all
alternatives, the level of M2 by September would be around its upper limit--
a bit above in the case of alternative A and somewhat below in the case
of alternative C. (See charts on the next two pages).

will be relatively strong owing in part to special factors. The introduc-
tion of lower income tax withholding schedules tends to boost M1 balances

to adjust to changes in disposable income. Growth in July is also likely
to be increased in some small degree by enlarged social security benefits
stemming from this year's COLA which will be paid out just prior to the
long July 4th holiday weekend.
","(16) The growth of M1 at a 4 percent pace specified in alterna-
tive B for the whole June-September period is not expected to be accompanied
by upward interest rate pressures despite the anticipated strengthening
in nominal GNP. It seems likely that transaction demands for cash in the
third quarter will be satisfied in part by liquidity built up earlier this
year. The federal funds rate might be at or somewhat below the 14¼ percent
level of recent statement weeks, trading generally in a 13-14¼ percent
range. At the current 12 percent discount rate, adjustment borrowing
from the discount window likely would be in the $800 million to $1 billion
area. With expansion in total reserves at a 5 percent annual rate over
the quarter, a nonborrowed reserve path calling for growth at a slightly
faster rate would be implied.
","(17) Other short-term rates might decline some under this
alternative, with the 3-month bill rate moving back toward 12 percent or
somewhat lower. Bond yields might also decline a little, but any break-
out from the rate range of the past few months probably would require in
addition more favorable fiscal policy developments or indications that
economic recovery, and associated private capital demands, will be weaker
than now generally anticipated. However, Treasury borrowing in the third
quarter is currently estimated by the staff at about $50 billion, con-
siderably higher than announced to date by the government and possibly
more than generally anticipated in the market. Barring a large decline
in longer-term rates, corporate bond issues are likely to remain limited.
Business borrowing at banks and in short-term markets may taper off, but,
if so, is likely to be replaced by a reduced accumulation of liquid assets,
following the apparent second quarter surge. Household borrowing is likely
to remain restrained, owing to the deterrent effects of high real interest
rates and lender caution.
","(18) Alternative A, which targets faster growth in M1 than
alternative B, could well produce a fairly substantial decline in money
market rates. An increase in total reserves on the order of 6 ¼ percent
from June to September would be consistent with the 5 ½ percent growth
rate specified for M1 during the quarter. The federal funds rate likely
would decline to a zone somewhat above the present discount rate, with
adjustment borrowing falling into the $300 to $500 million range. Assuming
borrowing were to average about $400 million, growth of nonborrowed reserves
would be 12 percent.
","(19) The easing of the funds market likely to occur under this
alternative should result in a substantial lowering of market rates generally.
The 3-month Treasury bill rate probably would fall to around the 11-11½
percent area and the decline in bank costs of funds would likely push the
prime rate down. Mortgage rates would again begin declining, encouraging
moderately stronger loan demand in that sector. Lagging yields on money
market funds would tend to strengthen M2 and M3 a bit in the short run as
more aggressive money managers shift away from market instruments. In
exchange markets, the dollar likely would probably decline substantially;
this tendency could be limited to a degree, however, if foreign central
banks responded by seeking an easing of their domestic interest rates.
","(20) Alternative C sets the most restrictive monetary target,
with M1 growth during the third quarter specified at only 2½ percent.
It seems likely that the more restrained reserve provision consistent
with such growth would place further pressure on the money markets, with
the federal funds rate moving to 15 percent or a bit higher over the inter-
meeting periods. Borrowing at the discount window would rise to the vicinity
of $1½ billion, and nonborrowed reserves would drop at a 1½ percent annual
rate over the quarter.
","(21) The firming in the funds market expected under alternative
C should be accompanied by moderately higher market rates generally but
with the likelihood that commercial paper and CD rates may rise more
rapidly than Treasury bill rates as concerns about spreading financial
problems are exacerbated. The 3-month bill rate may be in a 13 to 13½
percent range, and 3-month CD rates could move above 16 percent. Financial
pressures would inhibit the upturn in aggregate demand. The bank prime
rate likely would rise, as would primary mortgage rates. The dollar
probably would come under further substantial upward pressure in exchange
Directive language
","(22) Given below is a suggested operational paragraph for the
directive. The specifications adopted at the meeting on May 18 are
shown in strike-through form.
In the short run, the Committee seeks behavior of reserve
aggregates consistent with growth of M1 and M2 from March to June
TO SEPTEMBER at annual rates of about [DEL: 3] ____ percent and [DEL: 8] ____
percent respectively. [DEL: The Committee also noted that deviations
from these targets should be evaluated in light of changes in the
relative importance of NOW accounts as a savings vehicle.] The
Chairman may call for Committee consultation if it appears to
the Manager for Domestic Operations that pursuit of the monetary
objectives and related reserve paths during the period before
the next meeting is likely to be associated with a federal
funds rate persistently outside a range of [DEL: 10 to 15] ____ TO ____

1983-03-28,1983-03-29,"(1) M2 grew at around a 24½ percent annual rate in February,
but is estimated to have decelerated considerably to about an 11½ percent
annual rate in March. To a degree, the reduced growth of M2 appears to
reflect a slowing in funds shifted into money market deposit accounts
(MMDAs) from sources outside M2.1/ In addition, however, growth of M2
appears to be ""basically"" slowing in March, as its nontransactions
component, abstracting from shifts, seems to be decelerating markedly.
","(2) M3 grew at about a 13½ percent annual rate in February;
its growth, too, is estimated to have slowed markedly in March--to about
a 6½ percent annual rate. The level of M3 in March places it near the
upper end of the FOMC's annual target range of 6½ to 9½ percent. Because
depository institutions have responded to the strong net inflows into core
deposits in part by running off large CDs, this aggregate has been much
less affected by the introduction of the new instruments than M2.
","(3) M1 advanced at a record annual rate of just above 22 percent
in February. Preliminary data indicate that growth in March remained
strong--at about a 16 percent annual rate--bringing this aggregate even

further above its 4 to 8 percent longer-term range. With shifts into
super NOW accounts from outside of M1 in February and March estimated
to be comparatively small and roughly offset by transfers of funds
from M1 to MMDAs, the underlying strength in transactions deposits
apparently continues to be considerable. In addition, M1 growth has
been bolstered by unusually strong increases in currency throughout
the first quarter. The large increase in M1 during the first quarter
as a whole--14 percent at an annual rate on a quarter-over-quarter
basis--appears to represent a continuation of the upward shift in M1
demand (given income and interest rates) that developed last year. In
the first quarter, the velocity of M1 dropped by about 6 percent at an
annual rate.
","(4) The debt of nonfinancial sectors is projected to have
increased over the first quarter at a rate near the lower end of FOMC's
fourth quarter. Private borrowing is estimated to have remained close
to the reduced fourth-quarter pace; although funds raised in credit
markets by the federal government declined a little, they continued
to account for nearly half of the total of such borrowing. Bolstered
by a sharp increase in inflows of funds as a result of aggressive
offerings of MMDAs, depository institutions are estimated to have
accounted for around 60 percent of net credit extended to domestic non-
financial sectors in the first quarter, up from an average of a little
over 30 percent in the last three years. Bank credit growth rose from
first, and loans and investments at thrift institutions apparently have
picked up as well. At banks, acquisition of Treasury securities is
estimated to have accounted for about half of the increase in their
assets. The greatly enlarged intermediation through depository institu-
tions last quarter was accompanied by substantial disinvestment of money
market mutual fund shares and a considerable slowing in direct acquisitions
of credit market instruments by private domestic nonfinancial sectors.
","(5) Total and nonborrowed reserves declined at 14¼ and 12½
percent annual rates, respectively, in February after growing slowly in
January. Preliminary data indicate a modest rebound in growth for these
measures in March. The declines in total and nonborrowed reserves since
December mainly reflect reductions in required reserves because of
shifts out of savings and small time deposits into MMDAs and the run-
off of large CDs. The monetary base has grown much more strongly than
these reserve measures in each of the past three months, owing to the
rapid growth in currency. The level of adjustment plus seasonal borrowing
implied by the reserve paths was kept at $200 million throughout the
intermeeting period. Actual borrowing, however, has averaged about $390
million per week, reflecting such influences as unexpectedly strong
demands for excess reserves (apparently related at times to unusually
slow responses by banks to reserve requirement reductions) and misses
in projections of factors affecting reserves at the end of a statement
week (caused at times by computer and wire transfer problems).1/
","(6) While borrowing ran higher than anticipated, free reserves
were generally positive, and the federal funds rate continued to fluctuate
around the 8 percent discount rate over most of the intermeeting period,
After declining in the weeks immediately following the FOMC meeting,
other short-term interest rates began rising in early March, reflecting
concerns that sustained rapid growth of the monetary aggregates had, at a
minimum, made a near-term discount rate cut much less likely. On balance,
short-term rates have risen as much as 35 basis points since the February
meeting. Long-term rates, on the other hand, have declined about 45 to
increased further, partly in response to continued moderation in inflation
and favorable implications for the economy of the break in oil prices.
average basis since the last Committee meeting. The dollar has declined
by 3/4 percent against the mark as the latter currency benefited from a
solid conservative party victory in the March general election, and has
remained about unchanged against the yen. However, it has risen by
about 5 percent against the French franc and a similar amount against the
. Short-term interest rates abroad declined
somewhat, on average, reflecting cuts in German, Swiss, and Dutch official
lending rates.

aggregates for the March to June period are shown in the table below,

would be down within the range under alternatives B and C, as shown in

","(10) The staff expects a further slowing of M2 growth as the
shifts to MMDAs from non-M2 assets moderate with the ebbing of the
initial stock adjustment to the new accounts and with the decline in
MMDA offering rates. We have assumed that M2 growth will be increased
by about 1 percentage point or a little more over the the March to June
less distorted than M2 by new deposit instruments, is expected to
expand at a pace only somewhat slower than in the first quarter; CDs
are expected to stop running off, as depository institutions continue
to finance moderate expansion in credit demands and also further build
up holdings of U.S. Government securities, though at a slower pace than
in the first quarter.
","(11) Partly because lagged effects of earlier market rate
declines have dissipated, we expect broad money growth to slow over the
months ahead (even abstracting from MMDA shifts). Nonetheless, judging
from recent behavior, we would expect demand to be sufficiently strong
so that an effort to bring M2 growth down to the pace of alternative C
might be associated with rising interest rates. However, a deceleration
to the pace of B or A might be accomplished with stable or declining
","(12) More clearly than in the case of M2, M1 growth basically
appears to be running strong (given income and interest rates). However,
all the alternatives assume a considerable slowing in M1 expansion over
the March to June period, as our models suggest. Even with the assumed
slowing, the velocity of M1 in the second quarter would still decline,
though by much less than in earlier quarters, rather than rise sub-
stantially as is typical of the early stages of a cyclical recovery.
","(13) The debt of domestic nonfinancial sectors in the second
quarter is expected to grow at a 9 percent annual rate, remaining some-
what above the growth of GNP. Borrowing, seasonally adjusted, by both
the federal government and by private sectors is projected to strengthen
in the second quarter. The federal government will have to raise a sub-
stantial volume of funds in credit markets in a quarter when seasonal
tax inflows have frequently in the past allowed it to repay debt. The
increase in household borrowing is expected to be concentrated in the
mortgage area. In the business sector, with inventories no longer running
off, borrowing needs also will rise. With the shift to MMDAs largely
completed, the bank and thrift share of lending to nonfinancial sectors
is expected to decline from the extraordinary level of the first quarter,
but to remain above the average of the last few years.
","(14) Alternative B contemplates a federal funds rate fluctuating
around the current 8-1/2 percent discount rate, assuming adjustment (includ-
ing seasonal) borrowing at the discount window of around $200 million. Total
and nonborrowed reserves can be expected to rise from March to June at
annual rates of 6 and 7-1/2 percent, respectively, after declining on
balance over the previous three-month period largely because of deposit
mix changes related to introduction of MMDAs. The monetary base is
expected to grow about as rapidly as in the first quarter.
","(15) Other short-term interest rates may decline moderately
from current levels as the stability of the funds rate around the present
discount rate and slowing of growth in the aggregates reduce fears of a
near-term tightening of monetary policy. This also seems consistent
with greatly reduced net issuance of Treasury bills in the second quarter,
reflecting a seasonal reduction in cash needs. Longer-term interest rates
might also decline, if favorable market expectations generated by slower
money growth and incoming evidence of moderate economic activity over-
come continuing supply pressures. Treasury coupon offerings are expected
to remain about as large as in the first three months of 1983, and
businesses also can be expected to offer a fairly large volume of inter-
mediate- and long-term securities in an ongoing effort to improve balance
sheet structures.
","(16) Alternative A, which calls for 10 percent M2 growth from
March to June, would probably be associated with a drop in the federal
funds rate to the 7 to 8 percent area. Adjustment borrowing of around
$150 to $200 million would be consistent with such a funds rate range if
the discount rate were cut to 8 percent. Or such a funds rate might
emerge, or be approached, if borrowing were dropped to the $50-100
million range at the current discount rate.
","(17) Short-term interest rates may decline considerably under
alternative A, as market fears of any near-term tightening are allayed
and current dealer financing costs drop along with the funds rate. The
short-term rates would lead to a further decline in the bank prime rate.
Longer-term rates may also decline, but the declines may be limited by
a resultant step-up in corporate bond offerings.
","(18) Alternative C is assumed to involve a rise in the federal
funds rate to the 9 to 9½ percent area, and an increase in the level of
borrowing to the $500 to $700 million range. Short-term interest rates
would rise somewhat further, since the market would not appear to have
fully discounted such a tightening. The 3-month bill rate could rise to
around 9 percent and large CDs would probably be offered at 9½ percent
or higher, exerting upward pressure on the prime rate. Longer-term rates
would also rise, and the spread of the mortgage rate over the bond rate
may also widen, as lenders contemplated the cost impacts of rising deposit
rates, especially with such a large proportion of their deposits in the
form of MMDAs and MMCs. Higher U.S. interest rates would probably lead
to further upward pressure on dollar exchange rates.
Directive language
","(19) Given below are two alternative drafts for the operational
paragraph of the directive. The first retains the general approach adopted
at the February meeting, but with the language updated to take account of
developments since that time, with M3 now apparently just above the upper
limit of its long-run range, and M2 starting just above its range. The
second is proposed in the event the Committee decides to return to specifi-
cation of numerical objectives for the monetary aggregates. This alternative
also includes language in brackets that might be considered, depending
on how or whether the Committee wishes to condition the Desk's response
to incoming data on the aggregates.
Alternative I - Existing Language
For the more immediate future, the Committee seeks to maintain
the existing degree of restraint on reserve positions. Lesser re-
straint would be acceptable in the context of appreciable slowing of
growth in the monetary aggregates [DEL: to or below] RELATIVE TO the paths
implied by the long-term ranges, taking account of the distortions
relating to the introduction of new accounts. The Chairman may call
for Committee consultation if it appears to the Manager for Domestic
Operations that pursuit of the monetary objectives and related reserve
paths during the period before the next meeting is likely to be
associated with a federal funds rate persistently outside a range
of [DEL: 6 to 10] ____ TO ____ percent.
Alternative II - Language Incorporating Numerical Objectives for Second
In the short run, the Committee seeks restraint on reserves
consistent with a slowing from March to June in growth of M2 and M3
to annual rates of about ____ and ____ percent respectively. The
Committee anticipates that M1 growth at an annual rate of about
____ percent would be consistent with its objectives for the broader
aggregates. [The Committee agreed that somewhat faster monetary
growth would be tolerated if it appeared to be associated with
continuing distortions from growth of the new deposit accounts or
unusual demands for liquidity.] [Lesser restraint on reserves would
be acceptable in the context of a more pronounced slowing in the
growth of the aggregates.] The Chairman may call for Committee
consultation if it appears to the Manager for Domestic Operations
that pursuit of the monetary objectives and related reserve paths
during the period before the next meeting is likely to be associated
with a federal funds rate persistently outside a range of ____ to
____ percent.

1983-07-12,1983-07-13,"(1) M2 is estimated to have increased at a 10 percent annual
rate in June, bringing its growth for the March-to-June period to just
around 8½ percent at an annual rate--a bit below the objective for
these months established by the Committee in March. By June, M2 had grown
about 9 percent from its February-March '83 base, and was somewhat above
the midpoint of this year's longer-run range for the aggregate. Shifts
into MMDA balances from outside M2 appear to have slowed markedly, at
least as judged by the recent cessation of growth in MMDAs. With issuance
of CDs by banks and thrift institutions stronger than expected, M3 is
estimated to have expanded at around a 10¼ percent annual rate in June,
and at an 8 percent annual rate from March to June, somewhat above the
FOMC's 8 percent objective for these months set in March. By June, M3 was
at the upper end of the Committee's 6½ to 9½ percent range for 1983.
","(2) M1 expanded at about a 10½ percent annual rate in June,
and growth from the fourth quarter to June was at about a 13¾ percent
annual rate, well above the FOMC's range of 4 to 8 percent for the year.
Although M1 velocity continued to decline substantially in the first
quarter, more recently in the second quarter M1 velocity showed only a
relatively small decline, as the upward impact on M1 demand of reductions
in interest rates in 1982 faded. In May and June, all major components of
this aggregate, including demand deposits, increased substantially,
suggesting that recent strength has in some degree reflected growing
transactions needs for money balances.

","(3) The debt of domestic nonfinancial sectors is estimated to
have grown at about a 13 percent annual rate in June. The acceleration
of growth from the 10¼ percent average rate of April and May was due to a
surge in federal borrowing, as the Treasury sought not only to cover large
continuing needs for funds but also to build up its cash balance. The
debt of private nonfinancial sectors increased at almost an 8 percent
annual rate in June, a bit above the pace of earlier this year. For the
year to date, total domestic nonfinancial debt has increased at around a
midpoint of the FOMC's 8½ to 11½ percent long-run range. Bank credit
increased at almost a 10 percent annual rate in June, close to the average
of the previous two months. Loan growth picked up somewhat in June from
the pace of April and May; real estate lending strengthened further and
business loans showed the first substantial increase since January.
","(4) After declining in May, total reserves grew at a 15 percent
annual rate in June, reflecting primarily robust expansion in required
reserves needed against transactions deposits and also some growth in
excess reserves. However, nonborrowed reserves (including extended
credit 1/) increased less--rising by 8 percent--as adjustment plus seasonal
borrowing rose to an average of $679 million. The federal funds rate
traded in an 8 to 9 percent range for most of the period since the last
meeting, up only slightly from earlier weeks. Most recently, funds have
been trading around 9 to 9-1/8 percent, though higher rates have been
associated with temporary pressures related to the semi-annual statement
repaid in early July.
date and long holiday weekend. The level of borrowing incorporated in the
reserve paths had been set at $350 million initially following the FOMC
meeting, and was later raised to $400-500 million. Nonetheless, the demand
for borrowing has remained unusually strong--as has the demand for excess
reserves--relative to the prevailing spread of the funds rate over the
discount rate, and borrowing has consistently exceeded these levels (and
was particularly large over the period encompassing the statement date and
long holiday weekend).
","(5) Other short-term market interest rates have risen about 75
basis points further over the intermeeting period, in part reflecting the
tightening in the reserve market but also in some degree in anticipation
of a further such tightening given the strength of incoming data on money
and economic activity. Long-term taxable bond rates have also risen about

increases in dollar interest rates. At its peak in mid-June the dollar
on a weighted average basis was slightly above its previous November 1982
. The announce-
ment of a record U.S. trade deficit for May has had little apparent effect
on dollar exchange rates.
Monetary and credit targets for 1983 and 1984
","(7) A major issue in the re-evaluation of the longer-run monetary
and credit ranges earlier established for 1983 is the probable inconsistency
between the range for M1 and those for the other monetary and credit
aggregates. It would take virtually zero growth from June to December for
M1 expansion over the year 1983 to come in around the upper limit of its
current 4 to 8 percent longer-run range. The projected strength of nominal
GNP suggests considerably stronger demand for M1 than that, given something
like present interest rate levels, or even rates somewhat higher.
","(8) Against that background, two alternatives are shown below
for the monetary and credit aggregates in 1983. Alternative I reproduces
the present ranges. Alternative II differs only by including an M1 range
that has greater odds of being consistent with the broader aggregates.
Upward adjustments in growth ranges are not suggested for the broader
aggregates, even though recent experience suggests the possibility that
expansion of M2 and particularly M3 over the year is more likely to be
in the upper half of their ranges rather than near their midpoints as
earlier anticipated. It is not expected that the recent decision by DIDC
to eliminate ceiling rates on time deposits (but not on regular NOW and
savings accounts) by October 1 will have any very significant impact on
growth of M2 and M3, since time deposit expansion has for some time already
been in forms either without ceiling or with ceilings indexed to market
Alt. I Alt. II
Total credit 8½ to 11½ 8½ to 11½
","(9) The implications of these targets for annual growth rates
of the aggregates over the second half of 1983 are shown in the last two
columns of the table below. It should be noted that a considerable slowing
in M1 growth over the balance of the year is needed if even the upper end
of the alternative II M1 range is to be achieved. Growth in the broader
monetary and credit aggregates would not need to be as different in the
second half of this year relative to the first half for growth to fall
within their present longer-run ranges. The table below shows second half
growth rates consistent with expansion of M2 and M3 for the year in the
upper half of their ranges and expansion of total credit at its midpoint.

instead of QIV '82.
","(10) At this meeting the Committee will also be considering
tentative target ranges for 1984. The principal question would appear to
be whether to retain current ranges or lower them. It is not expected
that financial innovations or regulatory changes will tend to increase the
demand for the broader aggregates (given income and interest rates) next
year. Indeed, M2 may grow a little less relative to income than is expected
during the 1983 longer-run target period as residual shifts into MMDAs
become negligible next year. Against that background, and with an unusually
large and rising high employment federal deficit for the second year of an
economic recovery in prospect, and increase in monetary growth ranges would
probably raise the odds on a strengthening in inflationary pressures and
","(11) The current longer-run ranges for the aggregates are wide
enough to encompass lower actual growth rates in 1984 than in 1983. Thus,
one option (Alternative I in the table below) for the Committee--in addition
to simply retaining the present ranges--would be to retain the ranges but
indicate that actual growth for 1984 was expected to be lower in the ranges
than it had been in 1983. Our staff GNP projections for 1984--which show
slower growth in nominal and real GNP--presume that expansion of M2 next
year is ½ percentage point slower than the 8½ percent or so assumed for this
year (from the February/March '83 base). Yet another option (Alternative II)
would be to lower all of the longer-run ranges for the broader aggregates
by ½ percentage point. A variant on this option (Alternative III) would be to
lower only the upper limits of the ranges by ½ point (or possibly 1 point),
on the thought that reductions in the lower limits would tend to bring
them to ""unrealistic"" rates in relation to the economic outlook.
Alt. I Alt. II Alt. III
","(12) Alternative II does not include a lower M1 range than is
currently in place. But the 4 to 8 percent range would represent a con-
siderable reduction from likely growth this year, or from this year's
range if the Committee chose to raise it. M1 demand this year was augmented
by the upward adjustment of cash balances induced by the lower level of
market rates that developed as inflation ebbed; such a lagged effect is not
anticipated next year, and the velocity of M1 may develop along lines
more consistent with earlier post-war cyclical and secular patterns. Of
course, there are still large unknowns. Super NOW accounts bearing market
rates may come increasingly to affect the behavior of M1, and we remain
uncertain about how the public's attitudes toward these accounts as well
as regular NOW accounts are being influenced by transactions needs, interest
rates, and broad considerations of wealth and liquidity. It should also
be noted that if a sizable further decline in short-term interest rates
happens to occur, a large further rise in M1 could develop, involving
growth rates higher than in the alternatives presented, as market rates
come near to the regulatory ceiling on regular NOW accounts.1/
","(13) The credit aggregate next year is likely to grow a little
more slowly than this year. This moderation is consistent with the staff's
forecast of slightly slower nominal GNP growth, but as in 1983, credit
growth is likely to exceed the expansion of nominal income. The growth
in federal debt is expected to slow next year (the dollar volume of
net Treasury borrowing should remain about the same as 1983), while
private credit expansion remains close to this year's pace. Credit usage
by nonfederal sectors is expected to be moderated by a drop-off in
borrowing by state and local governments, whose bond issuance in recent
quarters has been boosted by the effects of the decline in interest rates
and the anticipation of bond registration requirements. Household borrowing
is expected to expand about as rapidly as in 1983, but business borrowing
is expected to increase substantially from its depressed pace of this
year, as the rise in spending for fixed capital and inventories outpaces
a fairly strong profit performance.
Monetary strategies over the next few years
","(14) To provide additional perspective for longer-run policy
decisions, the table on the next page shows projected impacts on real
GNP, prices, and interest rates of alternative approaches to the monetary
aggregates over the next several years. Strategy 1 reproduces the staff's
basic GNP forecast for this year and next (assuming 8½-percent M2 growth
this year and 8 percent next) and also shows projections through 1985 and
assumes more rapid money growth over the period through 1986, in this
case a continued 8½ percent M2 growth. Strategies 3 and 4 represent an
effort to depict policy approaches that show contrasts in the timing of
restraint and ease over the course of economic recovery. Strategy 3 aims
at a relatively stringent policy over the balance of this year and next
while easing off in 1985 and 1986; strategy 4 aims at the reverse
approach of easing over the balance of this year and next, and tightening
in the last two years shown. Strategy 3 assumes a reduction in M2 growth
to around 7¾ percent in 1983 and 1984 and an acceleration to around 8½
percent on average over the next two years, while strategy 4 assumes an
acceleration of M2 growth to around 9 percent in 1983 and 1984 and a decel-
eration to around 7½ percent in the next two years; in both strategies M2
growth was constrained to average a little over 8 percent over the 4-year
period. Differences between GNP, prices, and interest rates in strategy 1
and those in other strategies are based largely on model results, as is
the extension of strategy 1 into 1985 and 1986.
","(15) The steady ½ point reduction of M2 growth under strategy 1
is accompanied by a gradual deceleration in growth of real GNP and some
further improvement in price performance. The 3-month Treasury bill rate

strategies, see paragraph (14) of the
declines over 1984, following a small rise during the second half of this
year, but shows no further decline subsequently. By contrast, the faster M2
growth of strategy 2 promotes further declines in the bill rate and faster
growth in real GNP than strategy 1 over the whole 4-year period. No
significant pick-up in inflation from the current rate is indicated, given
the structural characteristics of our model, but one may question whether
the more rapid drop in the unemployment rate and rise in plant capacity
utilization under this alternative would not induce a more prompt re-
emergence of wage and price pressures, given the degree of economic
inefficiency in much marginal plant capacity, desires by labor to make up
for recent wage concessions, and general fears of re-emerging inflation
on the part of consumers and business.
","(16) Strategies 3 and 4 depict alternative courses of events
depending on whether monetary policy is front-loaded or not. The earlier
imposition of restraint under strategy 3 appears to involve no less real
growth over the 4-year period than does the front-loading of ease under
strategy 4. However, strategy 3 entails a better price performance through-
out the period. Interest rates decline under this strategy after a
substantial further rise in the latter half of 1983 and by 1985 and 1986
are lower than under strategy 4. Of course, looking beyond 1986, a slowing
in monetary growth would be needed under strategy 3 to avoid a later
acceleration in price increases.
Policy alternatives for the short run
","(17) The table below shows alternative specifications for the
monetary aggregates and federal funds rate ranges for the June to
September period. (More detailed data for the alternatives, including
their relation to the current longer-run ranges, are shown in the charts
and table on the following pages. The quarterly interest rate path
consistent with the staff's GNP projection is shown in Appendix I.)
Alt. A Alt. B Alt. C
Growth from June to Sept.
","(18) The specifications of Alternative A contemplate no further
tightening of money market conditions over the next few months. A federal
funds rate range of 6 to 10 percent is shown for this alternative, the
same as in the directive adopted at the last meeting. However, a federal
funds rate in the upper half of that range--around 9 percent or a little
higher--would be contemplated. Recent experience with borrowing at the
discount window would suggest that borrowing would tend to be in the
$450 to 600 million range. From June to September, nonborrowed and total
reserves would be expected to expand at annual rates of about 5½ and 4
percent, respectively.
","(19) M2 growth under this alternative will probably slow from
the rapid May-June pace, but should remain in the upper part of the FOMC's
longer-run range for that aggregate. The small increases in interest rates
that have developed since early May may act to restrain M2 growth a little,

despite the projected relatively strong expansion in personal income and
nominal GNP, but in addition M2 growth may be restrained by the further
slowing of shifts into MMDA accounts that appear to be signaled by data
of recent weeks. Mainly reflecting the behavior of M2, M3 growth is
also expected to slow from the pace of the last two months. Banks and
thrift institutions may continue to rely more heavily than in the early
part of this year on issuance of large CDs, as loan demands tend to
strengthen in reflection of the more rapid pace now evident in economic
","(20) Under alternative A, M1 growth is anticipated to slow much
more substantially than growth in the other aggregates. In large part,
this is because M1 demand is no longer expected to be buttressed by the
lagged impact of last year's sharp declines in interest rates. Indeed, the
recent rise in short-term rates should begin to have a restraining effect
on M1. The assumed M1 growth in this alternative would be consistent,
given our GNP projection, with about no change in its income velocity
in the third quarter,1/ in contrast to the declines in velocity that have
generally characterized the past several quarters. Such a turn-around
in velocity would not be unexpected during the course of a cyclical expan-
sion. However, as noted earlier, large uncertainties surround estimates
of M1 demand, given the change in its composition as NOW accounts have
become an increasingly important component of the aggregates. Should the
public continue to place a substantial amount of savings in components of
M1, and over the next few weeks some of the tax cut may well be lodged
in such deposits, the velocity of M1 could continue to fall--with M1
growth faster--at current levels of interest rates. On the other
hand, the large build-up in M1 balances of the past several quarters could
well support a rapid expansion in GNP without much further increase in M1
should confidence generated by continuing favorable economic news entail
a substantial reduction in demand for liquidity.
","(21) Given recent market rate adjustments, it would seem most
likely that interest rates would generally remain near current levels
under alternative A or decline some. In large degree, market rate increases
in recent days seem to have been in anticipation of a further tightening
of monetary policy. The 3-month Treasury bill rate might be in an 8¾ to
ceptionally sensitive, however, given the unexpected strength of the
economy, and the level of rates will be strongly influenced by assessment
of the meaning for monetary policy over the next few months of incoming
economic news and the Federal Reserve's decisions about longer-run targets.
If and as short-term interest rates tend to stabilize, long-term rates
may tend to decline from current levels.
","(22) The total debt of domestic nonfinancial sectors is ex-
pected to increase at about a 9 percent rate over the third quarter, less
than in the second quarter. While actual Treasury offerings will be
larger in the third quarter, they are expected to slow on a seasonally
adjusted basis from the very rapid second-quarter pace, when the Treasury
built up its cash balances by a substantial amount. Tax exempt offerings
are expected to remain well below the second-quarter pace, which had been
influenced by the desire to avoid registration requirements that took
effect on July 1. Business borrowing is likely to fall more on banks
relative to bond markets than it had in the second quarter. However, some
pick-up in bond offerings from the relatively moderate June pace might
be expected, particularly if the bond market shows signs of a decline in
","(23) Alternative B encompasses a further increase in pressures
on bank reserve positions in an effort to increase the-odds that growth
in the broad monetary aggregates will remain within their longer-run
target ranges and to exert even more restraint on growth of M1. This
alternative would involve borrowing from the discount window in the $850
million to $1 billion range (given the present discount rate), and the
federal funds rate might be expected to move well into the 9½ to 10 percent
area. Total reserves are likely to expand at about 2¼ percent annual rate
over the June to September period. Nonborrowed reserves would be about
flat if the level of borrowing rose to the range specified.
","(24) Although market interest rates have probably to some
extent discounted the further tightening in policy envisioned by this
alternative, the 3-month Treasury bill rate would likely rise further to
the 9¼ to 9¾ percent area, and longer-term rates would move still higher,
at least in the short run. The rise in long-term rates would tend to
discourage bond market financing, diverting additional loan demand to
short-term market sectors. This, together with the rise in short-term
market rates, would put substantial upward pressure on the prime loan
rate. Mortgage loan rates would probably advance further to the neighbor-
hood of 13½ percent, which would be a new high for the year.
","(25) M1 growth could be expected to slow to about 6 percent
from June to September under this approach and, assuming the market pressures
of alternative B were maintained through year-end, to expand at a somewhat
slower pace in the final months of the year. If this occurred, M1 growth
for the year (QIV '82 to QIV '83) would be in the vicinity of 10½ percent.
M2 is expected to grow at an 8½ percent annual rate from June to September
under this alternative--which would bring this aggregate back toward the
midpoint of its longer-run range. While thrift deposit flows might be
about the same as under alternative A, higher deposit costs would once
again begin to eliminate the earnings of a large number of S&Ls and MSBs,
exerting upward pressure on mortgage rates.
","(26) Alternative C involves an approach that would exert
relatively strong restraint on the aggregates and credit markets over the
near-term. M1 growth might be lower than 10 percent for the year and
growth of M2 over the year would probably be somewhat below the midpoint
of its longer-run range. Under this approach, federal funds would
be expected to rise to 10½ percent or so over the near-term. With the
level of borrowing at the discount window expanding to about $1¼ billion
and market interest rates rising, the current level of the discount rate
would be called into question, as indeed it also would under alternative B.
Total reserves would change little from June to September, and nonborrowed
reserves would drop by about 5 percent at an annual rate if borrowing
rose as specified.
","(27) Under this alternative, given the restraint on reserve
positions, M1 would be expected to expand at only a 4½ percent annual rate,
while M2 and M3 would both increase at 8 percent rates, over the June to
September period. The 3-month bill rate would rise substantially--to
about 10 to 10½ percent--and the bank prime rate might move up to perhaps
dollar would probably tend to rise substantially in foreign exchange markets,
and the viability of international debt positions of a number of major
borrowing countries would come further into question. Earnings pressures
on thrifts would be very substantial. However, the projected interest
rate levels producing these pressures would probably slow the economy and
credit demands substantially by winter, so that a drop in interest rates
would be expected at least by the early part of next year consistent with
tentative longer-run monetary and credit targets for that year.
Directive language
","(28) Given below is draft directive language related to the
Committee's decisions on the longer-run ranges (draft language for the
operating paragraph is shown in paragraph ","(29)). Suggested deletions
of language are shown in strike-through form with suggested additions in
caps and certain alternatives bracketed.
The Federal Open Market Committee seeks to foster monetary
and financial conditions that will help to reduce inflation further,
promote [DEL: a resumption of] growth in output on a sustainable basis,
and contribute to a sustainable pattern of international trans-
actions. At its meeting in February the Committee established
growth ranges for monetary and credit aggregates for 1983 in
furtherance of these objectives. The Committee recognized that
the relationships between such ranges and ultimate economic goals
have been less predictable over the past year; that the impact of
new deposit accounts on growth ranges of monetary aggregates cannot
be determined with a high degree of confidence; and that the
availability of interest on large portions of transaction accounts,
declining inflation, and lower market rates of interest may be re-
flected in some changes in the historical trends in velocity. [DEL: A
substantial-shift of-funds-into-M2-from-market instruments, in
eluding- large-certificates of deposit not included in M2, in
association with-the-extraordinarily rapid build-up-of money
market-deposit accounts, distorted growth in that aggregate during
the-first-quarter.]
In establishing growth ranges LAST FEBRUARY for the aggregates
for 1983 against this background, the Committee felt that growth
in M2 might be more appropriately measured after the period of
highly aggressive marketing of money market deposit accounts had
subsided. The Committee also felt that a somewhat wider range was
appropriate for monitoring M1. [DEL: These growth ranges were to be
reviewed in the spring, and altered, if appropriate, in the light
of evidence at that time. The Committee reviewed the ranges at
this meeting and decided not to change them at this time, pending
further review at the July meeting.] With these understandings,
the Committee established the following growth ranges: for the
period from February-March of 1983 to the fourth quarter of 1983,
7 to 10 percent at an annual rate for M2, taking into account the
probability of some residual shifting into that aggregate from non-
M2 sources; and for the period from the fourth quarter of 1982 to
the fourth quarter of 1983, 6½ to 9½ percent for M3, which appeared
to be less distorted by the new accounts. For the same period a
tentative range of 4 to 8 percent was established for M1, assuming
that Super NOW accounts would draw only modest amounts of funds
from sources outside M1 and assuming that the authority to pay
interest on transaction balances was not extended beyond pre-
sently eligible accounts. An associated range of growth for
total domestic nonfinancial debt was estimated at 8½ to 11
percent. THESE RANGES WERE REVIEWED AT THE MAY MEETING AND
LEFT UNCHANGED, PENDING FURTHER REVIEW IN JULY.
AT THIS MEETING, THE COMMITTEE REAFFIRMED THE LONGER-RUN
RANGES ESTABLISHED EARLIER FOR GROWTH IN M2, M3, [M1?], AND TOTAL
DOMESTIC NONFINANCIAL DEBT IN 1983 [WITH GROWTH IN THE BROADER
MONETARY AGGREGATES EXPECTED TO BE IN THE UPPER PART OF THEIR
RANGES]. [WITH REGARD TO M1, THE COMMITTEE, TAKING ACCOUNT OF
THE RAPID GROWTH IN THE FIRST HALF OF 1983 ASSOCIATED WITH THE
CONTINUED DECLINE IN VELOCITY AND ANTICIPATING A DECELERATION
IN GROWTH OVER THE SECOND HALF OF THE YEAR, ESTABLISHED A RANGE
OF ____ TO ____ PERCENT FOR THE YEAR AS A WHOLE.] THE COMMITTEE ALSO
AGREED ON TENTATIVE GROWTH RANGES FOR THE PERIOD FROM THE FOURTH
QUARTER OF 1983 TO THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 1984 OF TO PERCENT
FOR M2, ____ TO ____ PERCENT FOR M3. AND ____ TO ____ PERCENT FOR M1.
THE ASSOCIATED RANGE FOR TOTAL DOMESTIC NONFINANCIAL DEBT FOR NEXT
YEAR WAS SET AT ____ TO ____ PERCENT.
In implementing monetary policy, the Committee agreed that
substantial weight would continue to be placed on behavior of the
broader monetary aggregates, [DEL: expecting that distortions in M2
from the initial adjustment to the new deposit accounts will
abate.] The behavior of M1 will continue to be monitored, with
the degree of weight placed on that aggregate over time dependent
on evidence that velocity characteristics are resuming more
predictable patterns. [or THE COMMITTEE ALSO AGREED TO INCREASE
THE WEIGHT OF M1 IN POLICY IMPLEMENTATION WITH THE DEGREE OF
WEIGHT DEPENDENT ON THE STRENGTH OF EVIDENCE THAT THIS AGGREGATE
WAS RESUMING A MORE PREDICTABLE RELATIONSHIP TO OTHER KEY ECONOMIC
MAGNITUDES]. Debt expansion, while not directly targeted, will
be evaluated in judging responses to the monetary aggregates.
The Committee understood that policy implementation would involve
continuing appraisal of the relationships between the various
measures of money and credit and nominal GNP, including evalua-
tion of conditions in domestic credit and foreign exchange markets.
(29) Draft language for the operational paragraph is shown
below. Since the proposed language refers to alternative approaches for
a new quarter, the old language (which referred to the second quarter)
is not shown.
The Committee seeks in the short run to [increase (alt. C),
increase somewhat (alt. B), or maintain (alt. A)] the existing
degree of reserve restraint. The action is expected to be
associated with growth of M2 and M3 at annual rates of about
____ and ___ percent respectively from June to September. The
Committee anticipates that a deceleration in M1 growth to an
annual rate of around ____ percent will be consistent with its
third-quarter objectives for the broader aggregates. [Depending
in part on evidence about the strength of economic recovery,
lesser restraint would be acceptable in the context of a signi-
ficant shortfall in growth of the aggregates from current
expectations, while somewhat greater restraint would be
acceptable should the aggregates expand more rapidly.] The
Chairman may call for Committee consultation if it appears
to the Manager for Domestic Operations that pursuit of the
monetary objectives and related reserve paths during the period
before the next meeting is likely to be associated with a
federal funds rate persistently outside a range of ____ to ____

1984-07-16,1984-07-17,"(1) Growth in M1 accelerated to about a 12-1/4 percent annual
rate on average in May and June. As a result, expansion over the March to
June period, at about an 8-1/4 percent rate, was well above the Committee's
specification for that period of 6-1/2 percent. In contrast to M1, growth
in the broader monetary aggregates was about in line with anticipations,
in the case of M3 in line with the upward revised expectations of the last
Committee meeting. Over the March to June period, M2 grew at a 7-3/4
percent annual rate and M3 at a 10-1/4 percent rate. Compared with the
longer-run ranges adopted at the February meeting, M1 by June was somewhat
below its upper limit, M2 a little below the middle of the range, and M3
above the range.
","(2) Domestic nonfinancial debt is estimated to have expanded
at about a 13 percent annual rate over the past three months, with both
federal and private borrowing continuing at about their advanced first-
quarter pace. Borrowing related to mergers is estimated to have accounted
for about one percentage point of total debt growth in the first half of
the year.
","(3) Total reserve growth accelerated to a 10-3/4 percent rate
in May and further to a 26 percent annual rate in June, owing to a larger
demand for excess reserves and rapid growth of required reserves in June
which reflected especially strong demand deposits in that month and a
surge in large time deposits that began in May. After adjustment for

","(4) The federal funds rate has risen from the area of 10-1/2
percent at the time of the May meeting to an average of around 11 percent
in June, with trading mostly in an 11 to 11-1/2 percent range thus far
in July. Money market pressures were especially marked around the mid-June
tax date and in the reserve maintenance period containing the quarter-end
statement date and the July 4 holiday. Generally, over the whole period
since the last Committee meeting, federal funds have traded at a higher
rate than might have been expected relative to the average level of discount
window borrowing, perhaps partly because large banks seem to have become
somewhat more conservative in their reserve management (for example, more
reluctant to use the discount window) in light of market concerns generated
by Latin American debt problems. Given these concerns, the spread of CD over
bill rates widened further and there were indications of tiering within the
CD market. Spreads have narrowed somewhat in recent days, but over the
intermeeting period 3-month CD and Euro-dollar rates rose around 50 basis
points on balance, while the 3-month T-bill rate was about unchanged. Mar-
ket concerns also appear to have affected private credits in general to some
degree. The bond market has been quite volatile since the FOMC meeting, with
Treasury bond yields currently about 15 to 40 basis points below levels at
the time of the last FOMC meeting. Private longer-term market rates, on
the other hand, are about unchanged on balance over the same period, while
rates on conventional fixed-rate home mortgages have risen about 65 basis
","(5) The dollar's exchange value has risen, net, about 4
percent on a weighted average basis since the last Committee meeting.
Appreciations against major foreign currencies range from 3 percent
against the Canadian dollar to almost 6 percent against sterling. The
dollar weakened early in the period at the time of greatest concern about
large banks, but the rise in U.S. short-term interest rates and indications
of stronger than expected U.S. growth contributed to a sharp rise in the
weighted average dollar to a new peak.
Longer-run ranges for 1984 and 1985
","(6) The table below shows the 1984 growth ranges for the
monetary and credit aggregates that are currently in place, an alternative
set that might be considered, and actual growth through the first half of the
year. The alternative encompasses somewhat higher growth ranges for M3 and
credit than in the current set of ranges.
Actual Growth
Current Alternative QIV to QII QIV to June
","(7) As may be seen from the table, the growth to date for M1
and M2 suggests little need to alter their longer-run ranges. Despite
growth in nominal GNP over the first half of the year that has been about
of the year, expansion of these two aggregates has been within their ranges.
Growth in their income velocities accelerated to annual rates of around
rise in short rates since the fourth quarter, following velocity increases
in the second half of last year in the neighborhood of 2-1/2 percent for
both aggregates. The largest velocity increases for M1 and M2 occurred in
the first quarter of this year, and velocity growth in the second quarter
was more in line with experience in the second half of last year. Assuming
that velocity continues to rise at a moderate pace, and also assuming some
little further rise in short-term interest rates, M1 growth over the balance
of the year is likely to remain in the upper half of its range and M2
growth around its midpoint, given the staff's GNP projection.
","(8) In contrast to M1 and M2, growth of M3 and total debt
has been above their longer-run ranges thus far this year, as the
velocities of these aggregates have not accelerated from their pace in
the second half of last year. The alternative set of ranges for 1984
provides an option of raising growth of M3 and debt by 1/2 and one
percentage points, respectively, while retaining the current M1 and M2
ranges. This could be considered as needed to reflect the impact of merger
activity. Credit growth for the year might be above the upward adjusted
range, though, given the strength of demands for goods and services in the
staff's GNP forecast. On the other hand, there is also some, though small,
probability that M3 and debt growth could come within their present longer-
run ranges by year-end. This could occur if concerns about the fragility
of financial institutions and markets were to intensify, making it more
difficult for institutions to raise funds and leading to more conservative
lending practices generally. It may also occur if for other reasons the
economy were to slow more than currently projected and merger activity were
to subside much more rapidly than assumed.
","(9) Three alternative sets of tentative ranges for 1985 are
shown in the table below for Committee consideration. Alternative I simply
represents the current ranges. Alternative III reduces all of the ranges
by 1/2 point-with an option shown in parentheses for narrowing the M1
range while retaining the alternative III midpoint should the Committee
wish to indicate a little more confidence in M1 as a guide. Alternative II
is in between. No alternative providing higher ranges is shown on the
thought that would be inconsistent under existing economic circumstances-
particularly so in the market's view--with the Committee's intention to
continue making progress toward reasonable price stability.
I II III
","(10) How much, if any, reduction in growth of the aggregates
the Committee might wish to consider for 1985 depends in part on assessment
of the trend in velocity. It also depends on the desirability of a more or
less gradual strategy of monetary growth rate reductions given price
pressures, the need to sustain the economic expansion, and implications of
various strategies for overall financial and economic stability.
","(11) With regard to the underlying trend in the velocity of M1,
that cannot be known with any real certainty, given the relative recentness
of institutional changes affecting that aggregate. The trend since the
Second World War after taking out the effect of the rise of interest rates
over that period appears to be around 2 percent. The most probable outcome
under current circumstances would seem to be under 2 percent, as the intro-
duction of interest-bearing checkable accounts may well have increased the
income elasticity of demand for M1 by making transactions accounts more
attractive as savings instruments and also may have worked to reduce the
pace of technological innovation in money substitutes. With regard to the
trend velocity of M2, our best estimate continues to be around zero, al-
though M2 velocity has proven to be quite variable. At the beginning of
from $2,500 to $1,000. We have assumed that this change will have only a
minimal impact on M1 and M2.
","(12) At this point monetary policy is expected to confront
greater upward price pressures next year than this, as we go into the third
year of economic expansion with relatively limited excess labor and plant
capacity and assuming a drop in the dollar on exchange markets. If, as
currently projected by the staff, price increases next year are on the
order of 5 to 5-1/2 percent while economic growth decelerates to a pace
more consistent with its potential, it seems probable that a slowing in M1
growth in 1985 to the area of 5-1/2 to 6 percent-as assumed for the GNP
projection and consistent with alternatives II or III--might generate
a little further upward pressure on short-term interest rates. In 1985, we
would anticipate M1 velocity growth of 2 to 2-1/2 percent associated with
the projected GNP increase of around 8 percent. The increases in velocity
of M1 over the third year of four previous expansions that have lasted at
least that long have averaged in the neighborhood of 4 percent, but they
have generally been accompanied by rather sizable interest rate increases
and occurred in an era when the underlying velocity trend was probably
higher than can now be expected. Maintenance of an M1 range of 4 to 8
percent as in alternative I--and with actual M1 growth expected to remain
above the midpoint-might involve no further upward interest rate pressures
next year.
","(13) The growth of debt is expected to moderate noticeably next
year, on the assumption of reduced merger activity and in view of the
impact on credit demands of the projected 2-1/4 percentage point slowing
in growth of nominal GNP. As demands taper off, credit at banks and thrifts
also is projected to grow more slowly, accompanied by more moderate M3
expansion. However, with both debt and M3 running above their ranges this
year, even a substantial slowing may not allow scope for more than the
one-half percent reduction in ranges suggested under alternative III, and
growth would be expected near the upper ends of these ranges. Under
alternative II the current ranges for both credit and M3 are suggested to
be retained, although this would of course represent a reduction if the
Committee chose to adjust upward the existing 1984 range.
Short-run alternatives
","(15) Shown below are three possible approaches to policy
implementation for the period immediately ahead. Specifications for
the monetary aggregates are presented for the June-to-September period,
along with proposed federal funds rate ranges. (More detailed material
can be found on the charts and table on the following pages.)
Alt. A Alt. B Alt. C
Growth from June
to September
","(16) All of the alternatives call for deceleration in growth
of M1 and M3 over the next three months from their March-to-June pace;
however, on a quarterly average basis growth in M1 would be stronger in
the third than the second quarter because of the carryover effect on the
averages of the rapid growth in money in the latter part of the second
quarter. For M1, a deceleration over the third-quarter months is
needed to keep long-run growth from the fourth quarter of 1983 base
from moving closer to the upper limit of the Committee's current 4 to 8
percent range. In the case of M3 the contemplated deceleration would
still leave that aggregate above its long-run range. In all cases, M2
remains at or a little below its midpoint.
","(17) Alternative B--which underlies the staff's GNP projection-
contemplates a marked slowing in M1 growth to around a 5-1/2 percent
annual rate over the June-to-September period in the process of bringing

growth of that aggregate closer to the midpoint of its longer-run range
by the end of the year. Such June-to-September growth, distributed
fairly evenly over the quarter, would entail a 7-3/4 percent quarterly
average increase in M1. That growth in money may not involve much, if
any, further rise of interest rates over the summer, assuming nominal GNP
grows no faster than the 9-1/2 percent annual rate currently projected
for the third quarter and given the rise of interest rates that has already
taken place.
","(18) The deceleration of M1 growth under alternative B is
not expected to be accompanied by any significant slowing of M2 from its
rate of growth of the previous three months. Growth of the latter
aggregate is likely to be sustained, given the projected reasonably
strong growth in personal income and assuming little change in the
personal savings rate. Somewhat more rapid expansion in the nontrans-
actions component is expected, partly reflecting a lagged response of
the public to the increased rate attractiveness of time deposits and
MMDAs relative to demand deposits and regular NOW accounts. However,
expansion of M3 over the summer might well slow from its unusually
rapid second-quarter pace. Banks may have less need to issue CDs as
merger-related financing demands are reduced, and in any event the
recent tightening of markets and widening of yield spreads against
banks might encourage a somewhat less aggressive posture by banks in
credit markets. Even so, with the economy and underlying credit demands
expected to be fairly strong, M3 growth would probably be high relative
to its long-run range.
","(19) Growth of domestic nonfinancial debt is expected to
decelerate moderately in the months ahead, but credit demands seem likely
to be strong enough to generate growth at around an 11-1/2 percent
annual rate pace over the third quarter, with only a small further falling
off in prospect later in the year. Although the pace of borrowing by
businesses is expected to slow, this reduction reflects only the assumed
abatement of merger activity. Underlying demands for funds by business
are expected to strengthen in the third quarter as the financing gap
(the excess of capital spending over internal funds) widens, and to be
even stronger in the fourth quarter. Federal government credit demands
are expected to moderate slightly between the second and third quarters,
but to remain relatively large over the balance of the year. The more
fundamental slowing in credit growth in prospect is in the household
sector and depends on a weakening in spending for homes and durables.
","(20) Expansion in the aggregates as specified in alternative B
would probably entail growth of nonborrowed reserves at about an 8 percent
annual rate from June to September, with borrowing continuing to average
around $1 billion. If recent experience is any guide, the federal funds
rate would probably average in the 11 to 11-1/4 percent area. However,
should investors gain more confidence in banks, and should bank attitudes
toward reserve management and the discount window become less cautious, the
funds rate could well trade consistently below 11 percent for S1 billion
in borrowing. If that occurred, it might entail greater expansion over
time in nonborrowed reserves--as banks more willingly lend and add to
deposits-and hence more money growth than assumed for this alternative.
","(21) Interest rates generally might show little net change
under alternative B, though probably edging higher from the most recent
levels if funds traded consistently around 11-1/4 percent. Speculation
about a discount rate increase could become more widespread in markets,
and this could itself add to upward pressures, at least temporarily, on
federal funds and other rates. The dollar may well remain generally firm
on exchange markets.
","(22) The degree of tightness in bank reserve positions under
this alternative would also work to restrain money and credit growth later
in the year. Thus, alternative B may be consistent with growth in M1 over
the year 1984 in the area of 6-1/2 percent with only a little further
upward movement of interest rates. Growth of M3 and credit for the year
would probably be somewhat above the upper limits of their current longer-
run ranges, though expanding somewhat more slowly in the second half than
in the first half of the year. Growth of M2 would be expected to be
around the midpoint of its long-run range.
","(23) Alternative A involves a policy approach that keeps M1
growth nearer the upper end of its longer-run range. The 7 percent
annual growth rate for this aggregate from June to September would bring
growth from QIV '83 to September to just under 7-1/2 percent. Such money
growth, when translated to a quarterly average basis for the third
quarter, implies only a small rise in the income velocity of M1 over
the months ahead and is probably consistent with some drop in money
market rates from recent levels under existing circumstances, particularly
considering the lingering restraining effects on money demand of the
rise of interest rates over recent months. Nonborrowed reserves are
likely to expand at a 14 percent annual rate under this alternative,
with borrowing about $750 million. Borrowing in that area might involve
a federal funds rate of around 10-1/2 percent-unless the recent relative
reluctance of banks to borrow from the discount window abates, in which
case the funds rate could be lower for such a level of borrowing.
","(24) Such reserve and money market conditions appear to be
on the easy side of current market expectations. Should they be sustained,
bond prices might be expected to rise, assuming the economy does not
unexpectedly strengthen, no major disappointments occur with respect to
the budget, and M1 does not grow much faster than specified. The
decline by more in such a market atmosphere. Whether these rate levels
would be sustainable or reversed later in the year or in 1985, depends
in part on the likelihood that the rate declines themselves help generate
a strengthening of money and credit growth inconsistent with the Commit-
tee's long-run objectives. A reversal of the rate declines and a
further rise seems most likely, given the projected overall strength of
money and credit demands, if such objectives encompass M1 growth in
","(25) Alternative C contemplates a very considerable decelera-
tion in M1 growth-as more consistent with growth around the midpoint
of its longer-run range over the year as a whole-and greater restraint
on growth of the broader money and credit aggregates. The 4 percent annual
rate of growth in M1 from June to September would bring expansion of this
aggregate from QIV '83 to September to 6-1/2 percent at an annual rate.
Growth at a 3-1/4 percent annual rate from September to December would
be needed to hit 6 percent for the year as a whole.
","(26) Such a deceleration of money growth over the next three
months would probably require a sharp slowing of nonborrowed reserve
growth to a one percent annual rate, assuming a rise in borrowing to
$1-1/4 to $1-1/2 billion. The federal funds rate would probably rise to
around 12 percent, and other rates would adjust sharply upwards. Quality
rate spreads-such as between bills and CDs, or high grade industrial
and bank holding company commercial paper--would probably widen. Large
banks may be viewed as coming under even more pressure because of
increasing difficulties many borrowers would have in meeting higher
debt service payments. In addition, thrift institutions-which still
have a sizable portion of their portfolio in fixed-rate mortgages--would
be moving into a negative earnings position. The dollar may rise
further on exchange markets, but this could prove to be temporary
should the market come to the view that the financial system is coming
under excessive strain.
Directive language
","(27) Given below is draft directive language related to the
Committee's decisions on the longer-run ranges (draft language for the
operating paragraph is shown in paragraph ","(28)). Suggested deletions
from the current directive are shown in strike-through form with pro-
posed additions in caps and certain alternatives bracketed. Deletion of
the two full sentences concerning M1 is suggested on the ground that
behavior of that aggregate over recent quarters has been somewhat more
""normal"" in relation to GNP and other economic variables. The consider-
able uncertainties that still remain in interpreting M1 and the other
aggregates, given ongoing adaptation to institutional changes by banks
and the public and the potential for financial market disturbances,
appear to be clearly encompassed by the language of the second paragraph
The Federal Open Market Committee seeks to foster mone-
tary and financial conditions that will help to reduce inflation
further, promote growth in output on a sustainable basis, and
contribute to an improved pattern of international transactions.
IN FURTHERANCE OF THESE OBJECTIVES the Committee AGREED AT THIS
MEETING TO REAFFIRM THE RANGES FOR MONETARY GROWTH THAT IT HAD
ESTABLISHED IN JANUARY: [DEL: established growth ranges for the
broader aggregates of] 4 TO 8 PERCENT FOR M1 AND 6 to 9 percent
for both M2 and M3 for the period from the fourth quarter of
THE COMMITTEE CHANGED THE RANGE(S) FOR 1984 TO ___________.
[DEL: The Committee also considered that a range of 4 to 8 percent
for M1 would be appropriate for the same period, taking account
of the possibility that, in the light of changed competition
of M1, its relationship to GNP over time may be shifting. Pend-
ing further experience, growth int hat aggregate will need to be
interposed in the light of of the growth in the other monetary
aggregates, which for the time being would continue to receive
substantial weight.] The associated range for total domestic
nonfinancial debt was ALSO REAFFIRMED [DEL: set] at (RAISED TO) 8 to
AGREED ON TENTATIVE RANGES OF MONETARY GROWTH, MEASURED FROM THE
FOURTH QUARTER OF 1984 TO THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 1985, OF ____ TO
____ PERCENT FOR M1, ____ TO ____ PERCENT FOR M2, AND ____ TO ____
PERCENT FOR M3. THE ASSOCIATED RANGE FOR NONFINANCIAL DEBT WAS
SET AT ____ TO ____ PERCENT.
The Committee understood that policy implementation would
require continuing appraisal of the relationships not only among
the various measures of money and credit but also between those
aggregates and nominal GNP, including evaluation of conditions in
domestic credit and foreign exchange markets.
(28) Given below is suggested language for the operating
paragraph of the directive. The specifications adopted at the meeting
on May 22 are shown in strike-through form.
In the short run, the Committee seeks to DECREASE SLIGHTLY
(ALT. A)/ maintain (ALT. B)/INCREASE SLIGHTLY (ALT. C) existing
pressures on bank reserve positions. This ACTION is expected to
be consistent with growth in M1, M2, and M3 at annual rates of
around [DEL: 6-1/2, 8 and 10] ____, ____, AND ____ percent, respectively,
during the period from [DEL: March to] June TO SEPTEMBER. Somewhat
greater reserve restraint might be acceptable in the event of
more substantial growth of the monetary aggregates, while some-
what lesser restraint might be acceptable if growth of the
monetary aggregates slowed significantly. In either case, such
a change would be considered only in the context of appraisals
of the continuing strength of the business expansion, inflation-
ary pressures, financial market conditions, and the rate of
credit growth. The Chairman may call for Committee consultation
if it appears to the Manager for Domestic Operations that pur-
suit of the monetary objectives and related reserve paths dur-
ing the period before the next meeting is likely to be associated
with a federal funds rate persistently outside a range of [DEL: 7-1/2
to 11-1/2] ____ TO ____ percent.

1984-10-02,1984-10-02,"(1) Preliminary data for September suggest a moderate rebound
in M1 to an annual growth rate of perhaps 7 percent after being about
unchanged on average in the previous two months, but growth of this
aggregate for the June-to-September period remains well below the path
of 5 percent or slightly less specified at the last Committee meeting.
The estimated level of M1 for September is at the center of its longer-
run target range. On a quarterly average basis M1 increased at about a
dictions of our quarterly model, given actual income (which turned out
to be lower than assumed at the time of the last FOMC meeting) and
interest rates.
","(2) Growth of M2 also appears to have strengthened in September,
after expanding at a sluggish pace over the previous two months. For the
June-to-September period, M2 expanded at almost a 6 percent annual rate,
well below the 7-1/2 percent objective for that period set by the Committee,
and drifted further below the midpoint of its longer-run range. Growth of
M3 over the summer slowed to a 7 percent rate, also considerably below
Committee expectations. Growth of large CDs outstanding at banks and thrift
institutions alike has weakened appreciably since July, owing partly to
diminished credit demands on depository institutions and to actual or
potential difficulties in CD markets. In particular, a large amount of
CDs ran off at the thrift subsidiary of FCA. A sharp runup in government
deposits also reduced needs at commercial banks for issuance of large CDs

year to a point close to the upper limit.
","(4) Expansion of private credit demands is estimated to have
eased a bit in July and August from the rapid pace of earlier in the year,
but this was offset by a surge in federal debt-boosting growth in total
domestic nonfinancial debt to a 13-1/4 percent average annual rate in July
and August. In private credit markets, the pace of mortgage and consumer
borrowing diminished somewhat, and merger financing abated. However,
business borrowing remained relatively strong as the financing gap widened.
Fragmentary data for September suggest no pickup in private credit flows
and a substantial reduction in the pace of federal borrowing. Neverthe-
less, growth in total debt through the third quarter remains about one-half
percentage point above its monitoring range for 1984, after subtracting
an estimate for merger-related financing.
","(5) Given the continuing shortfall in money growth relative to
the Committee's objectives., against the background of data indicating a
slowing in the pace of economic expansion in the third quarter, the Desk
aimed at a somewhat more ample provision of nonborrowed reserves than
would otherwise have been the case, with reserve paths assuming a gradually
lower level of borrowing, most recently $750 million, rather than the $1
billion initially employed. Borrowing at the discount window during the
two reserve maintenance periods ending in September in fact averaged about
$750 million. Over the three month June-to-September period, nonborrowed
reserves plus extended credit expanded by about 1-3/4 percent at an
annual rate, while total reserves contracted by about one percent.
","(6) The easing in bank reserve positions has been reflected
in a decline of the federal funds rate from the 11-1/2 to 11-3/4 percent
area prevailing immediately following the August FOMC meeting to the
area of 11 percent in the most recent reserve maintenance period, with
trading on some recent days below 11 percent. It is possible that the
extent of decline in the funds rate also has reflected some waning in the
reluctance of institutions to borrow at the window or to lend in the
funds market as perceptions about the condition of banks have improved.
Rates on private money market obligations generally have declined about
over Treasury bill rates have continued to narrow. The 3-month CD rate
was recently quoted just under 11 percent; most major banks have lowered
their prime rate to 12-3/4 percent. Treasury and corporate bond yields
have declined 5 to 25 basis points further, bringing net declines in bond
yields since their highs in late June to almost 1-1/2 percentage points.
","(7) Conditions in exchange markets have been quite volatile
over much of the period since the last FOMC meeting. Despite some easing
in U.S. money market conditions, the dollar rose sharply and by September 20
was up by 7 percent. Among the not altogether convincing reasons for the
dollar's strength advanced by market participants have been factors
weakening the mark in particular--including downward revisions in expecta-
tions for economic activity in Germany--the prospect for redenomination
of some of Mexico's debt, and apparent lack of concern by official
authorities as the dollar continued to rise beyond expectations. On
Friday, September 21, the dollar spiked a further two percent, but then
dipped upon release of a higher-than-expected CPI figure. The Bundesbank
then surprised the market with very large and visible intervention and the
dollar plunged 4 percent by the following Monday morning. The dollar has
since recovered somewhat and is currently 5-1/2 percent above its value
prior to the last FOMC meeting.
. ntervention by the
U.S. over this period totaled $185 million in sales of dollars against marks.
Prospective developments
","(8) The table below provides three alternative specifications for
growth in the monetary aggregates for the period from September to December,
with associated federal funds rate ranges. (More detailed data, including
implied growth for the QIV 1983 to QIV 1984 period, can be found in the table
and charts on the following pages.) Alternative B--which is expected to
involve continuation of roughly the current degree of pressure on bank
reserve positions--calls for growth in M1 that would keep this aggregate
at the midpoint of the Ccmmittee's long-run range, with M2 moving a
little higher in its range, though remaining below the midpoint, and M3
continuing near the upper end of its range. Alternative A calls for
somewhat faster money growth over the September-to-December period,
consistent with an easing in reserve pressures, while alternative C
contemplates somewhat slower money growth, associated with tighter reserve
conditions. Given the proximity of the end of the year, under all the
alternatives growth in M1 for the year would not be far from the 6 per-
cent midpoint of the Committee's long-run range, M2 would be expected to
remain around 7 percent--in the lower half of its long-run range-and M3
growth would stay close to the 9 percent upper end of its long-run range.

","(9) All the alternatives specify more rapid M1 growth over
the next three months relative to its sluggish behavior over the June-to-
September period. Transactions demands are expected to strengthen in
association with the projected pickup in nominal GNP growth in the
fourth quarter, while the dampening effects on money demand of earlier
increases in short-term interest rates should diminish over the quarter
and begin to be reversed by the recent moderate declines in short rates.
On a quarterly average basis, M1 in the fourth quarter would increase at
a 5-3/4 percent annual rate under alternative B, implying an increase in
velocity of around 2-3/4 percent, given the staff's GNP forecast.
","(10) Alternative B, and the other alternatives as well, also
call for somewhat more rapid growth of M2 over the September-to-December
period than in the summer. Spurred by faster income growth and a more
favorable alignment of rates on deposits relative to rates on market
instruments, the nontransactions component, along with M1, is expected to
contribute to the pickup in M2 expansion in the fourth quarter. M3
growth also is expected to quicken. Despite slower credit expansion at
thrifts projected for the fourth quarter, the recent weakness in thrift
CDs and associated rapid rise in FHLB advances is unlikely to continue,
assuming the condition of FCA stabilizes and repercussions on the access
of other thrifts to wholesale money markets remain minor. Commercial
bank CD issuance is likely to pick up as Treasury deposits decline.
","(11) Growth in debt of nonfinancial sectors is projected to
moderate over the fourth quarter to around a 10-1/2 percent annual rate,
reflecting mainly a slowing in borrowing by private sectors. Households'
mortgage and consumer credit usage is expected to weaken a bit further.
The financing gap of business is not expected to widen further in the
fourth quarter, and total borrowing by businesses may decrease if merger
and related activity continues to moderate as expected. Despite the
slowing of credit growth over coming months, for 1984 the debt of non-
financial sectors is projected to increase around 12-1/2 percent, compared
to the Committee's range of 8 to 11 percent, with about one percentage
point of this total attributable to credit associated with merger and
related activity.
","(12) The specifications of alternative B assume borrowing at
the discount window remains around the recent $750 million level. This
degree of pressure on reserve positions is likely to involve federal
funds trading in the neighborhood of 11 percent, with trading on the low
side more likely if rates on alternative sources of funds, such as CDs,
remain relatively low, and if a calmer atmosphere in money markets encour-
ages banks to tap these sources more aggressively and to be less reticent
about use of the discount window. Nonborrowed and total reserves would
each increase at close to a one percent rate over October and November.
","(13) With federal funds averaging close to 11 percent, other
interest rates are likely to fluctuate around current levels. Rates in
short-term markets already appear to have adjusted to federal funds
trading in that area, and 3-month Treasury bill rates should remain
around 10-1/4 percent, with slightly lower rates developing should funds
trade persistently below 11 percent. Further improvement, if any, in
long-term markets is expected to be quite limited, given the anticipated
strengthening of incoming economic data and the expectation that M1
growth will not fall well below the midpoint of its long-run range.
Moreover, during the intermeeting period, note and bond markets will have
to absorb a very substantial volume of Treasury issues-including both
the large end-of-quarter note and bond auctions that had to be postponed
from late September due to debt ceiling constraints, and the regular
mid-quarter .refunding scheduled for the first week of November.
","(14) The somewhat more rapid money growth specifications of
alternative A would be expected to involve a further reduction in
pressures on bank reserve positions, with discount window borrowing
declining to around $500 million. Nonborrowed reserves would increase at
about a 6 percent annual rate over October and November. The federal
funds rate would drop to 10-1/4 to 10-1/2 percent, or possibly a little
lower if the pattern of discount window borrowing evident before last May
","(15) Such an easing in bank reserve positions, which is not
now expected by market participants, would probably set off a considerable
rally in short- and longer-term markets. The Treasury bill rate might
decline into the 9-1/2 percent area, and CD rates would drop to around
Yields on long-term Treasury bonds might decrease initially by at least
markets might be underway. A portion of the gains in bond markets could
later be reversed, however, should incoming data on the economy and money
and credit show strength, and as bond issuance by corporations and state
and local governments rises further. The dollar would tend to decline on
foreign exchange markets, although any declines might be limited should
market participants anticipate a subsequent firming of interest rates.
","(16) Alternative C, which involves some tightening of money
market conditions over the intermeeting period, would be expected to
restrain M1 growth over the balance of the year to a rate below the
midpoint of its long-run range and to exert particular restraint on
credit growth. Borrowing at the discount window under this alternative
would return to around the $1 billion level prevailing over most of the
spring and summer, with nonborrowed reserves declining by around 4 per-
cent over October and November. The federal funds rate would be expected
to return to the 11-1/2 to 11-3/4 percent area, or possibly a bit higher.
The Treasury bill rate would rise to around 10-3/4 percent, CD rates
would increase by 1/2 percentage point or perhaps more, and the dollar
would probably rise, at least for a while, on foreign exchange markets.
With upward pressures reemerging in short-term markets, longer-term
yields can be expected to retrace some of the declines since early summer,
leading to further reductions in demands for mortgage credit as well as
to shifts in borrowing by businesses back toward short-term markets--and
also possibly to reconsideration of over-all borrowing and spending

only in the context of appraisals of the continuing strength of the busi-
ness expansion, inflationary pressures, financial market conditions, and

1988-02-09,1988-02-10,"(1) In the conduct of open market operations over the intermeeting
period, the Desk increasingly placed more emphasis on reserve positions when
feasible and less on day-to-day money market conditions, in accordance with
the Committee's assessment that reductions in financial market fragility
since the crash permitted a cautious return to more normal operating
procedures. Still, informal adjustments to borrowing objectives were needed
to take account of unusual borrowing behavior. After the December 15-16
FOMC meeting, reserve paths continued to be constructed assuming $300
million of adjustment plus seasonal borrowing, and the federal funds rate
was expected to remain centered on 6-3/4 to 6-7/8 percent. Despite
difficulties in estimating demands for excess reserves near the year-end,
actual borrowing, at $355 million, turned out fairly close to path in the
first reserve period. It was substantially higher in the next period at
$1,460 million, however, owing to unusually heavy borrowing over the 4-day
New Year's weekend and to subsequent borrowing resulting from a fire at a
large bank; the Desk made allowance for both developments in its provision
of nonborrowed reserves. Late in the next maintenance period ended Janu-
ary 27, with average borrowing running very low, an informal downward
adjustment in the borrowing assumption was made to avoid forcing a bulge in
borrowing in the final days of the period, and borrowing averaged $176
","(2) With incoming data suggesting some weakening in economic
expansion, the borrowing assumption for the current period was formally
reduced to $250 million, with funds expected to trade in a range of 6-1/2 to
$165 million. The low borrowing in the current and previous maintenance
periods may reflect a retrenchment after heavy discount window usage at
year-end and in early January, as well as some remaining reluctance to be
seen at the window given still unsettled financial markets and sensitivity
to the financial condition especially of large banks. The funds rate
averaged 6.82 percent over the three complete maintenance periods since the
December FOMC meeting; in recent days funds have moved down toward 6-1/2
percent. Total reserves contracted in December with the continued weakness
in transactions deposits, but rebounded strongly in January as reservable
deposits grew rapidly and excess reserves increased as well.
","(3) Year-end pressures in money markets proved much milder than
expected by many market participants. A greatly reduced need for funds
compared with the previous year, the timing of the statement date at the
beginning of a maintenance period rather than on the settlement date, more
advance planning by banks and others, and fairly generous reserve provision
all contributed to this outcome. When pressures failed to develop as
anticipated, rates on money market instruments of private issuers plummeted
in late December. Yields on Treasury securities of all maturities and on
longer-term debt of private borrowers changed little on balance over the
first few weeks of the intermeeting period, despite considerable weakness in
the dollar. More recently, rates have fallen as the dollar firmed on
evidence of improved trade data for November and as subsequent economic data
were interpreted as pointing to a softer economy and modest price pressures,
increasing the odds on a near-term easing of monetary policy. Short rates
have fallen about 1/4 percentage point since mid-January, and the prime rate
was reduced 1/4 point on February 2. Longer rates have dropped more, about
Broad equity indexes are up 1-1/2 to 3-1/2 percent on balance since mid-
December, though daily price movements still were unusually large on
occasion. Spreads between short-term private and Treasury issues narrowed
substantially with the unwinding of year-end pressures, and have fallen a
little further in recent weeks. However, these spreads remain well above
their lows of last summer.
","(4) The dollar weakened sharply on foreign exchange markets in
the last half of December.
The dollar
jumped further in mid-January with the release of better-than-expected U.S.
trade figures, and since then has traded in a fairly narrow range, even as
U.S. interest rates declined relative to those abroad. On balance, the
weighted average dollar is up about 3-1/4 percent from the time of the
December Committee meeting.
Desk's intervention accounted for nearly $2-1/4 billion
divided about equally between System and Treasury accounts.
","(5) Preliminary data show a strong rebound in money growth in
January after weakness in December. Over the two months combined, M2 and M3
grew at 6 and 5 percent rates respectively, close to the Committee's short-
run paths of 5 and 6 percent, and M1 expanded at a 5 percent pace. Demand
deposits were particularly weak late last year, reflecting in part
incentives to adjust compensating balances downward before year-end, but
other checkable deposits also fell in November and December without a
corresponding increase in other deposits in M2. The pickup of money growth
in January was widespread over various components of the aggregates.
Reasons for the extent of the weakness late last year and strength in
January are not entirely clear. However, the decline in interest rates
generally after mid-October and in private rates around year-end probably
has begun to boost money demand this year. Within M2, small time deposits
have continued stronger than the liquid components, though by a smaller
margin as their yield advantage erodes. Flows into money market mutual
funds in both M2 and M3 were especially strong in January as rates on these
funds reflected higher pre-year-end yields on short-term instruments. Even
so, for the two months combined, the non-M2 component of M3 moderated from
its rapid growth earlier in the fall, owing to slower growth in large CDs
and term RPs. Core deposit inflows quickened over the two months, and with
bank credit growth little changed on average from the previous few months,
banks reduced their reliance on managed liabilities.
","(6) Domestic nonfinancial debt is estimated to have grown at a
reduced 8 percent pace on average over December and January. In January,
business offerings of bonds rose as yields fell, while shorter-term
borrowing in the form of bank loans and paper moderated. Households stepped
up consumer credit borrowing in December while their mortgage borrowing
remained moderate. Tax-exempt bond offerings continued light, despite a
pickup in refunding issues. Federal borrowing contracted in January, as the
Treasury cut back on offerings in light of a relatively high cash balance.

Long-run alternatives
","(7) The table below gives three alternative specifications for
growth in the money and credit aggregates from the fourth quarter of 1987
to the fourth quarter of 1988. Alternative I would carry over to 1988 the
ranges that were in effect for 1987; the ranges for 1988 adopted on a
tentative basis in July are given in alternative II; alternative III would
involve a reduction in the ranges. The table includes ranges for M1 thought
to be consistent with those for the broader aggregates, should the Committee
wish to re-establish an objective for this aggregate.
Alt. I Alt. II Alt. III
Growth from QIV '87
to QIV '88
","(8) The growth in money and debt the staff considers consistent
with its forecast for the economy would be encompassed under any of the
alternatives. The greenbook forecast is for nominal GNP growth of around
lower than current reduced levels in the first half of the year when the
economy may be relatively soft, with some upward drift in the second half as
the economy strengthens. M2 velocity should decline in the first half in
response to the drop in market interest rates from October peaks and then
strengthen somewhat toward year-end. Given the pattern of interest rate
movements, changes in opportunity costs in 1988 are projected to have little
net effect on demand for M2 for the year. This aggregate would be expected
to expand about 6 percent, roughly in line with the growth in income, and
consistent with the long-run behavior of its velocity. (Charts of velocity
behavior for the various aggregates, including the velocities implied by
also presumes the absence of special factors that apparently were damping
money demand in 1987. Econometric models of M2 demand tended to over-
predict growth of this aggregate in 1987, given actual income and interest
rates, by about a percentage point; the projection for 1988 assumes any such
shortfall would be smaller. The behavior of household saving may tend to
bolster M2 growth this year; saving was especially weak last year, but is
expected to increase substantially in 1988, and some of this should find its
way into liquid forms of wealth holding. In addition, IRAs and Keoghs,
whose use in the first part of 1987 to reduce taxable income in 1986 was
still unrestricted, will be less attractive this year, perhaps bolstering
demand for savings vehicles in M2.
","(9) M3 would be expected to accelerate to around a 6-1/2 percent
rate of growth under the staff economic forecast, implying a small decline
in its velocity, nearly in line with its secular downtrend. Expansion of
bank and thrift credit is expected to moderate somewhat in 1988 relative to
assets, given pressures on capital, holding down the growth of their credit
next year. However, to fund asset growth depository institutions are
expected to rely less in 1988 than in 1987 on sources of funds from outside
M3. In part, this reflects stronger expansion of core deposits in M2, and
a reduced need to rely on managed liabilities, some of which likely would be
outside M3. For example, borrowing from foreign branches in the Eurodollar
market is expected to be less than in 1987--though still above the
relatively low totals of 1985 and 1986. In addition, Treasury deposits at
commercial banks, which increased substantially in 1987, are not expected to
rise further on balance over the year.
","(10) The growth of the debt of nonfinancial sectors is projected
to slow in 1988, to a rate of 8-1/2 percent, also within the ranges under
any of the alternatives. Consequently, debt growth would remain well in
excess of the expansion of GNP. Borrowing will continue to be boosted by
sizable net equity retirements by businesses, owing partly to a dropoff in
gross stock issuance at lower share prices, and business credit demands also
will be augmented by an increase in the financing gap. In the household
sector, the recent pattern of credit usage is projected to persist in 1988,
with sluggish consumer credit and robust growth of mortgages, some of which
would represent home equity borrowing to substitute for consumer debt.
Among governments, federal borrowing should decrease as the deficit falls on
a calendar year basis, and debt issuance by state and local entities is
projected to remain quite light as capital spending by many of these
governments is restrained by budget problems as well as the continuing
effects of tax reform. The foreign sector will remain an important source
of funds in 1988, as the current account deficit, while declining, stays
very high. The placement of foreign inflows in various financial assets
depends in part on the extent of intervention purchases of dollars and the
disposition of those funds. Implicit in the staff expectation of a lower
dollar by the end of 1988 is the view that dollar assets of a magnitude
corresponding to the projected current account deficit will not be willingly
accumulated by private investors at existing exchange rates and interest
rate differentials.
","(11) The staff's expectations for growth in money and credit
would be around the middle of the Committee's tentative ranges, given in
alternative II. They are also near the middle of the slightly lower growth
rates associated with alternative III. But the alternative III ranges would
better allow for another shortfall in money demand in 1988, if, for example,
households finance spending more from liquid assets and less from borrowing
as the tax deductibility of consumer debt interest is phased down further,
or if banks once again tap the Eurodollar market in size. The alternative
III ranges would also leave room for greater restraint on demand should the
possibility of a strengthening of inflation pressures emerge as a
substantial risk. With the economy already at higher levels of resource
utilization, such a risk could arise in the process of continuing adjustment
of our external imbalances, especially should real net exports advance more
rapidly than projected, or domestic demand be insufficiently damped to
release the needed resources. In addition, a flight from dollar assets
could cause a sharp drop in the exchange value of the dollar, boosting
expectations of future price and resource pressures. In any of these
circumstances, with fiscal policy unlikely to move toward greater restraint,
the responsibility would fall on monetary policy to promote better balance
between internal spending and production. If, for example, circumstances
called for a rise in interest rates beginning in the first half of the year,
money growth later in the year might need to be around, or even below, the
lower end of the alternative II ranges, accelerating relatively little from
reduction in ranges would underscore the Committee's intention to resist
inflation pressures, should they arise, and continue to move toward price
","(12) The more rapid growth associated with the Alternative I
ranges could be considered necessary to offset the shortfall from last year,
if that shortfall were thought to point to substantial risks on the side of
weak demands in the economy. Significantly lower interest rates might be
needed to support income growth if demands in the U.S. economy from domestic
or foreign sources were appreciably below expectations. Such a fall in
rates is likely to involve much faster M2 growth, perhaps even exceeding the
upper end of its tentative range, and a substantial decline in velocity
would be anticipated, as in 1985 and 1986. This alternative also would
allow room for a reversal of the unexplained portion of weakness in money
growth in 1987. If this were to occur, relatively high rates of money
growth might be needed to promote satisfactory economic performance.
","(13) M1 would be expected to expand around 5 percent with the
staff's economic forecast. Given the projected pattern of interest rates,
OCDs should expand about in line with income, but with domestic spending
sluggish, currency expansion might be damped. The velocity of demand
deposits should rise at a moderate pace reflecting continuing efforts to
economize on zero-interest deposits and ongoing shifts from compensating
balances to fees to pay for services. Because of the higher interest
elasticities of M1, a range about twice the width of those for M2 and M3
would be needed to encompass the same set of possible outcomes for income
and interest rates. Thus a range for M1 of 3 to 9 percent would appear
consistent with alternative II, placing expected M1 growth a little below
the midpoint of its range, as would be the case for M2 under this
alternative. Alternatives I and III would seem to be consistent with M1
ranges of a percentage point more and less, respectively.2
Short-run policy alternatives
","(14) Three short-run policy alternatives are presented for con-
sideration by the Committee. Current reserve and money market conditions
would be maintained under alternative B while alternatives A and C would
involve somewhat easier or somewhat tighter conditions, respectively. The
level of adjustment plus seasonal borrowing associated with alternative B,
$250 million, is expected to entail federal funds trading around recent
the funds rate would be broadly consistent with recent behavior but would
involve a lower amount of borrowing than indicated by model relationships,
reflecting some continued unusual reluctance by banks to borrow from the
window. Remaining uncertainties about the borrowing relationship, as well
as lingering sensitivities in financial markets, might call for some
continued flexibility in implementing open market operations. Alternative A
would be associated with a reduction in the federal funds rate of about 1/2
percentage point--achieved by a lowering of the borrowing objective to $100
million, a near-frictional level--or by a 1/2 percentage point cut in the
discount rate. Alternative C would be associated with an increase in the
borrowing objective to about $450 million and a rise in the federal funds
rate of approximately 1/2 percentage point.
","(15) Expected growth rates of the monetary aggregates from
November to March under each alternative are shown in the table below, along
with associated federal funds rate ranges. Implied December to March growth
rates, which are higher owing to the weakness in December, also are shown,
should the Committee wish to shift the base for short-run money growth from
November to December, the more usual starting point for quarterly growth
specifications. (More detailed data are shown on the table and charts on
the following pages).
Alt. A Alt. B Alt. C
Growth from November

December to March
","(16) Alternative B contemplates a continuation of reserve
conditions now expected to prevail after the recent slight easing. Although
market participants may be uncertain as to whether a reduction in reserve
pressures has already occurred, the structure of market interest rates
suggests that some easing has already been discounted. With federal funds
around the 6-5/8 percent area, the three-month Treasury bill rate would
likely fluctuate around or a little above its recent 5-5/8 percent level.
This bill rate is unusually low relative to the expected funds rate, but
public supplies of Treasury bills continue to be reduced by Treasury
paydowns. Rates on private money market instruments also would be expected
to remain around current reduced levels prompting another 1/4 percentage
point cut in the prime rate as the spread between the prime and money market
yields still remains wide after this week's reduction. The recent rally in

the long-term credit markets appears to reflect an outlook for sluggish
economic growth, broadly consistent with the staff forecast; consequently,
long-term rates are expected to vary around current levels, absent renewed
substantial downward pressure on the dollar.
","(17) Under the specifications of alternative B, M2 would be
expected to grow in February and March at nearly a 7 percent annual rate, a
little above the average pace of December and January. On a quarterly
average basis, growth would accelerate from 4 percent in the fourth quarter
to 6-1/4 percent in the current quarter as the response of demand to the
drop in interest rates since October more than offsets the effects of slower
income growth. Consequently, M2 velocity would decline at around a 1 per-
cent rate--the first drop in more than a year. From its fourth-quarter
base, M2 by March would advance at a 6-1/2 percent annual rate, the midpoint
of its tentative long-run range. Within M2, rate relationships would tend
to increase the attractiveness of the more liquid interest-earning com-
ponents owing to the stickier adjustment of their offering rates following
the recent declines in market rates. From the fourth quarter, M1 by March
would rise at a 5-3/4 percent rate.
","(18) M3, under alternative B, would advance at a 6 percent annual
rate from November to March as growth over February and March strengthens
somewhat from the 5 percent average of December and January. By March, M3
would be 6-1/4 percent above its fourth-quarter base, also near the center
of the tentative range. Inflows to core deposits at banks and thrifts are
likely to fall short of credit demands, leading both types of institutions
to issue a moderate volume of managed liabilities in M3. Credit growth at
banks is expected to slow somewhat in February and March from its
exceptional January pace, which was boosted by a resurgence of security
lending. Overall credit growth is forecast to increase slightly over coming
months, reflecting primarily a pickup in borrowing by the federal government
from its recent reduced pace. A continued wide financing gap along with a
quickening pace of corporate acquisitions and restructurings are expected to
give rise to sizable business credit demands. In addition to heavier
borrowing from banks and in the commercial paper market, businesses are
expected to tap the bond markets to avail themselves of reduced long-term
borrowing costs. By March domestic nonfinancial debt is expected to be
around 9 percent above its fourth-quarter base, also in the middle of its
tentative range.
","(19) Although some easing of reserve conditions is now thought by
market participants to be in train or at least in prospect, the reserve
specifications of alternative A embody a larger move by the Federal Reserve
than has been anticipated in market rates. The downward movement of rates
associated with this alternative might be especially large if it were
accomplished through open market operations, since the resultant narrow
spread of the funds rate over the discount rate could foster expectations
that a further easing through a discount rate cut was imminent. The easier
conditions of alternative A are likely to put considerable downward pressure
on the dollar, though the extent to which this would show through in dollar
declines over the near-term would be affected by the incoming trade data.
The response of bond yields to an easing of policies and possible drop in
the dollar would depend importantly on perceptions of the situation in the
economy at the time. If economic conditions were thought to be quite soft--
weaker than consistent with the staff forecast--and incoming price data
suggested no more inflationary pressures, the drop in the dollar would be
less likely to adversely affect the bond market, which could register
further substantial gains.
","(20) The tightening of conditions under alternative C would be
entirely unexpected, and probably would result in substantial increases in
both short- and, at least initially, long-term interest rates. Stock prices
could drop, perhaps sharply, if the higher rates were seen as contributing
to weakness in the economy as well as raising the rate at which future
earnings are discounted, and risk premiums could widen again. The effects
on long-term rates and markets might be muted over time, however, if this
policy initiative bolstered confidence in the future purchasing power of the
dollar, in circumstances in which inflation concerns had been aggravated by
strong downward pressure on the dollar or greater economic strength than now
generally anticipated.
","(21) The changes in reserve conditions under alternatives A and C
would have fairly small effects on money growth in the current quarter,
which has less than two months to run. Under alternative A, growth of the
aggregates would accelerate noticeably relative to the pace of the last two
months, leaving both M2 and M3 at or a little above the midpoints of their
tentative long-run ranges in March. The delayed effects of the declines in
interest rates contemplated under this alternative could push these
aggregates well into the upper halves of those ranges during the second
quarter, given the staff's GNP forecast. Thus, this alternative might be
considered most consistent with the higher paths for money growth envisioned
under long-run alternative I. Under the tighter reserve conditions of
alternative C, the broad aggregates would remain within the lower halves of
their tentative ranges through March. By reversing most of the interest
rate declines since October, Alternative C would tend to keep money growth
on a fairly slow path over coming months, dropping further below the
midpoint of the tentative ranges, and might be most consistent with the
growth rates in long-run alternative III.
Directive language
","(23) Presented below for Committee consideration is draft
directive language relating to the decisions on the longer-run ranges
(draft language for the operating paragraph is shown in ","(24) below). As
is now the case, a separate paragraph would be devoted to M1. The draft
assumes in light of the discussion at the December meeting that the
Committee will continue its practice of not setting a numerical range for
M1. The proposed paragraph explaining this decision is drawn from that in
the current directive, but it has been shortened and modified somewhat.
The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and
financial conditions that will foster reasonable price
stability over time, promote growth in output on a
sustainable basis, and contribute to an improved pattern
of international transactions. In furtherance of these
objectives, the Committee [DEL: agreed] at THIS [DEL: its] meeting [DEL: in
July to reaffirm the ranges] established [DEL: in February for]
growth RANGES of [DEL: 5-1/2 to 8-1/2] ____ TO ____ percent for
[DEL: both] M2 and TO PERCENT FOR M3, measured from the
aggregates around the lower ends of the ranges might be
appropriate in light of developments with respect to
velocity and signs of the potential for some strenthen-
ing in underlying inflationary pressures, provided that
econmic activity was expanding at an acceptable pace.]
The monitoring range for growth in total domestic
nonfinancial debt WAS set [DEL: in February for the year was
left unchanged] at ____ TO ____ [DEL: 8 to 11] percent FOR THE YEAR.
[DEL: For 1988, the Committee agreed in July on tentative
ranges of monetary growth, meaured from the fourth
quarter of 1987 to the fourth quarter of 1988, of 5 to 8
percent for both M2 and M3. The Committee provisionally
set the associated range for growth in total domestic
nonfinancial debat tat 7-1/2 to 10-1/2 peercent.]
With respect to M1, [DEL: the Committee recognized that,
based on experience, the behavior of that aggregate must
be judged in the light of other evidence relating to
economic activity and prices; fluctuation in M1 have
become much more sensitive in recent years to changes in
interest rates, among other factors. Because of this
sensitivity, which had been reflected in a sharp slowing
of the decline in M1 velocity over the first half of the
year], the Committee again decided [DEL: at the July meeting] not
to establish a specific target for 1988 [DEL: growth-in-M1-over
the remainder of 1987 and no tentative range was set for
ECONOMIC ACTIVITY AND PRICES HAS BECOME VERY SENSITIVE TO
CHANGES IN INTEREST RATES, AMONG OTHER FACTORS, AS
EVIDENCED BY SHARP SWINGS IN ITS VELOCITY IN RECENT YEARS.
CONSEQUENTLY, the appropriateness of changes in M1 this
year WILL would continue to be evaluated in the light of
the behavior of its velocity, developments in the economy
and financial markets, and the nature of emerging price
pressures. [DEL: The Committee welcomed substantially slower
growth of M1 in 1987 than in 1986 in the context of
continuing economic expansion and some evidence of greater
inflationary pressures. The Committee indicated in July
that in reaching operational decisions over the balance of
the year it would take account of growth in M1 in the
light of circumstances then prevailing. The-issues
involved with establishing a target for M1 will be
carefully reappraised at the beginning of 1988.]
Operational Paragraph
(24) Draft language for the operational paragraph, including the
usual options, is shown below. Should the Committee wish to retain a
sentence on its operating procedures, an updated version of the second
sentence in the current directive [shown in brackets] could be used.
In the implementation of policy for the immediate
future, the Committee seeks to DECREASE SOMEWHAT (ALT. A)/
maintain (Alt. B)/INCREASE SOMEWHAT (Alt. C) the existing
degree of pressure on reserve positions. [The Committee
agrees that [DEL: the passing of time and the year end should
permit further progress toward restoring a] THE CURRENT
MORE normal approach to open market operations REMAINS
APPROPRIATE; [DEL: although] still sensitive conditions in
financial markets and uncertainties in the economic
outlook may continue to call for some flexibility in
operations.] Taking account of conditions in financial
markets, somewhat (SLIGHTLY) lesser reserve restraint
(WOULD) (MIGHT), or somewhat (SLIGHTLY) greater reserve
restraint would (MIGHT) be acceptable depending on the
strength of the business expansion, indications of
inflationary pressures, developments in foreign exchange
markets, as well as the behavior of the monetary
aggregates. The contemplated reserve conditions are
expected to be consistent with growth in M2 and M3 over
the period from November through March at annual rates of
about [DEL: 5] ____ percent and [DEL: 6] ____ percent, respectively. Over
the same period, growth in M1 is expected to remain
relatively limited. The Chairman may call for Committee
consultation if it appears to the Manager for Domestic
Operations that reserve conditions during the period
before the next meeting are likely to be associated with a
federal funds rate persistently outside a range of [DEL: 4 to 8]
____ TO ____ percent.

1989-02-07,1989-02-08,"(1) Open market operations over the intermeeting period were com-
plicated by continuing uncertainty about the relationship between borrow-
ing and money market conditions. Following the December 13-14 FOMC meet-
ing, reserve paths initially were constructed assuming $500 million of
adjustment plus seasonal borrowing. Federal funds moved up from the pre-
vailing 8-1/2 percent level to average 8-7/8 percent in the period ending
December 28, although borrowing was only $380 million. The borrowing
assumption was raised further to $600 million on January 5, in accordance
with the Committee's decision at the December meeting, but heavy year-end
recourse to the window pushed actual borrowing for the second maintenance
period to $840 million. In mid-January, based on historical evidence that
reluctance to borrow at the window typically rises markedly in the early
part of the year, the Desk adopted an extra measure of flexibility toward
the borrowing target. Federal funds trading has centered between 9 and
maintenance period ending January 25 and around $250 million over the
first eight days of the current period.
","(2) Prior to the release of strong January employment data, Trea-
sury bill rates had risen only about 1/4 percentage point over the inter-
meeting period, as some firming in policy had been widely anticipated.
Private short-term rates were unchanged or lower, reflecting as well the
unwinding of year-end pressures. After the employment report, money mar-
ket rates rose about 5 to 10 basis points, as markets seemed to anticipate
some additional policy tightening in the near term. Longer-term interest
rates have generally fallen 15 to 40 basis points and stock price indices
have risen 7 to 10 percent on average; these markets benefited from gener-
ally strong demand for dollar assets apparently engendered in part by
damped inflation expectations against a backdrop of actual and expected
monetary policy restraint. The further flattening of the yield curve has
nearly eliminated the spread between the investment yields on 30-year and
time of the last meeting.
","(3) The strength of the demand for dollar assets bolstered the
dollar on foreign exchange markets, raising its weighted-average value by
about 6-1/4 percent since the last Committee meeting. The rise occurred
despite two releases of disappointing monthly trade data, sizable inter-
vention sales of dollars, and two rounds of increases in official lending
rates by European central banks. As a consequence of the last, the dif-
ferential between U.S. Treasury bill interest rates and a weighted average
of foreign short-term rates was little changed; foreign long-term rates
rose moderately while U.S. bond rates fell.
, with the
Desk accounting for $2.1 billion of this total.
","(4) Preliminary data indicate a pause in money growth in January
after moderate increases in December. For the two months combined, M2
growth averaged 2-1/2 percent, a bit below the Committee's expectation for
the November through March period, while M1 has been about flat.1 The
sluggish expansion of these aggregates appears to reflect recent increases
in money market yields, which have widened the opportunity costs of hold-
ing deposits; this widening has been accentuated by slower-than-usual
adjustment of most retail offering rates over recent months. Administra-
tive pressure on some thrifts to restrain deposit pricing may be holding
down their deposit rates and, by reducing competitive pressures, may be
curbing increases in deposit rates generally. Evidence of shifts from M2
balances may be seen in the large volume of noncompetitive tenders at
recent Treasury auctions and in a resumption of inflows to stock and bond
mutual funds. Reflecting less aggressive pricing of thrift deposits, and
perhaps also some concerns about the resolution of this industry's prob-
lems, retail deposit flows at these institutions, which had slowed over
the summer, have been especially weak in recent months. M3 growth has
averaged 3-3/4 percent over the past two months, falling well short of
expectations. Banks' funding needs have not increased as rapidly as pro-
jected, owing mostly to a shortfall in business loans; weakness in these
loans was accounted for partly by repayment of previous corporate restruc-
turing loans and partly by subdued credit demands for non-merger-related
purposes. At thrifts, greater reliance on Federal Home Loan Bank advances
may have substituted for deposits.
","(5) Although business borrowing at banks was less than expected,
commercial paper soared. Problems in the investment-grade industrial bond

revised data should be considered confidential until their release,

market and expectations by some issuers that longer-term interest rates
will decline may have shifted some issuers toward shorter-term debt. Junk
bond issuance has been moderate, but a heavy flow stemming from impending
deals is expected in the near future. Consumer borrowing and mortgage
activity appear to have been well maintained. Overall, domestic nonfinan-
cial debt appears to have grown in January near the pace of recent months.
Longer-run strategies
","(6) As background for the Committee's consideration of the ranges
for 1989, projected effects of three alternative longer-run monetary
policy strategies are presented below. Strategy I is a baseline, embody-
ing the monetary policy and economic outlook of the greenbook forecast,
extended judgmentally into 1991. Strategies II and III are based on
somewhat tighter and somewhat easier monetary policies, respectively, as
indexed by M2 growth that is one percentage point less and one percentage
point more than in the baseline over each of the three years. Staff
econometric models were used to derive deviations of the forecasts from
the baseline under the two alternative policy strategies.

III

","(7) Under the baseline of strategy I, policy exerts some restraint
on output, putting in place conditions that lead to some moderation in the
pace of inflation starting in 1991. Given the rise in real interest rates
over the near term to a fairly high level, nominal rates can begin to edge
off in the latter part of the forecast period, as inflation moderates.
Even so, real rates remain high enough to keen real output below its
potential. The behavior of nominal rates means that velocity will level
out, and the associated acceleration of M2 growth is still consistent with
restraint on inflation.
","(8) The tighter policy of strategy II would lead to quicker and
larger decreases in inflation. That result, however, involves still
higher real interest rates over the forecast horizon in order to induce a
substantial slowing of output growth and an appreciable rise in unemploy-
ment to well above the rate associated with steady inflation--assumed to
be around 5-3/4 percent in these simulations. The level of the unemploy-
ment rate at the end of 1991 implies even greater progress against infla-
tion in 1992, absent a sharp turnaround in policy. The dollar would be
higher under this strategy than in the staff forecast. The negative
effects of this on the improvement in trade, however, might be offset by
the additional restraint on domestic demand and the better performance of
prices and costs for U.S. producers.
","(9) The faster money growth of strategy III would avoid a marked
slowing in economic growth, keeping the unemployment rate at or a little
below its current level over the near term and allowing only a small rise
through 1991. Inflation accelerates substantially in 1990, before level-
ing out. Faster expansion of domestic demand tends to deepen external
imbalances, and the greater downward movement of the dollar contributes to
the higher inflation. Nominal interest rates initially are somewhat lower
under this strategy, but the pressure of faster income growth and higher
inflation results in nominal rates equal to those under the other two
strategies by 1991.
","(10) The table below gives inflation projections for the three M2
paths based on the single-equation model relating the level of prices to
M2 presented to the FOMC in November. In this model, M2 determines a
long-run level of prices, assuming velocity and output are at their trend
levels. Inflation would accelerate or decelerate depending on whether
actual prices were below or above this long-run level. The results of the
equation simulation tend to give a little more optimistic outlook for
inflation under the three alternatives.
Prices: Fixed-weight

Long-run ranges for 1989
","(12) The table below gives two alternative sets of ranges for
growth in M2, M3, and the debt of nonfinancial sectors from the fourth
quarter of 1988 to the fourth quarter of 1989. The ranges of alternative
I are those adopted on a tentative basis by the Committee in late June.
Alternative II would reduce the money ranges somewhat further, more com-
fortably encompassing staff expectations for growth in M2 and M3 in the
greenbook forecast, and allowing for the slower money growth strategy
outlined in the previous section.
Alt. I Alt. II Memo:
(tentative ranges) 1988 ranges
Growth from QIV '88
to QIV '89
","(13) The proposed alternatives retain the 4 percentage point widths
for all the ranges, first adopted last February.2 The rationale for
widening the range for M2 rested primarily on the combined effects of the
rather interest-sensitive nature of this aggregate over the one-year tar-
get period and uncertainty about levels of interest rates that would
accompany pursuit of policy objectives over the year. M3 and debt are
less sensitive to intermediate-term variations in interest rates. How-
ever, some special uncertainties in the financial sector in 1989 might
argue against narrowing any of the ranges. As noted below, the approach
to resolving thrift difficulties could affect both M2 and M3. In addi-
tion, the unpredictable outlook for corporate restructuring activity,
which might be affected by, among other things, actual or proposed legis-
lative action, adds to uncertainties with respect to growth of debt and
","(14) The staff expects that M2 growth of only 3-1/2 percent in 1989
will be associated with the greenbook forecast. The sluggish growth of M2
is an aspect of the tighter monetary policy in the latter part of 1988 and
the additional firming of interest rates in 1989 thought likely to be
needed to contain inflation. Although nominal GNP is projected to in-
crease 7 percent this year, the same as in 1988, the upward movement in
rates and associated rise in opportunity costs are expected to increase M2
velocity 3-1/2 percent this year, compared with 1-1/2 percent last year.
(See chart 1.) A substantial part of the velocity increase would seem
already to be in train from the lagged effects of the interest rate in-
creases that have occurred over the second half of 1988. Even with no
additional increase in rates, velocity would be expected to rise nearly
casts for this aggregate, given greenbook income and market interest
rates. This is based on the assumption that the usual relationship of
deposit to market interest rates is not restored in 1989, leaving oppor-
tunity costs a bit higher than generated by the models. Moreover, future
steps to deal with the thrift situation could further adversely affect
returns on deposits, for example through an increase in insurance pre-
miums .
","(15) M3 growth also is expected to slow substantially this year--to
about a 4-3/4 percent pace--under the greenbook forecast. This slowing
reflects a projected deceleration in asset expansion and associated fund-
ing needs at thrifts as well as greater reliance on managed liabilities
outside M3 at all depository institutions as core deposit growth moder-
ates. At banks, credit growth is expected to be supported by increased
demands from businesses, which will be funding greater external credit
needs from short-term sources in a rising rate environment. Even so,
capital requirements will foster continued securitization and sale of
loans, contributing to a slight moderation in credit growth at these
institutions in 1989. At thrifts, some easing in the demands for mortgage
credit together with administrative restraints on lending by insolvent or
undercapitalized thrifts, should depress overall thrift asset growth
appreciably. The staff forecast has thrift credit growth slowing substan-
tially in 1989--to 6-1/4 percent from 7-3/4 percent in 1988--but risks may
be on the side of even slower growth of assets and liabilities. Moreover,
Conceptually, the retirement of equity in corporate restructurings
may have boosted the demand for M2 by those receiving the proceeds.
Aside from some short-run effects as funds are held temporarily in the
process of completing these transactions, however, little effect of this
phenomenon has been apparent, and no allowance in the M2 forecast has
been made for the projected slackening of share retirements over coming
quarters this year.
assistance to troubled thrifts from the government could substitute in
part for deposit sources of funds. Thrifts already have been using FSLIC
similar effects on their appetite for deposits.
","(16) Debt of domestic nonfinancial sectors is projected to grow
moderates a little, reflecting a drawdown of cash balances rather than a
reduction of the deficit and underlying pressures on financial markets.
Overall, nonfederal borrowing is projected to be maintained at about its
somewhat as the financing gap widens and corporate restructuring and
equity retirement activity remains brisk, though trending down from the
record pace in late 1988 and early 1989. In the household sector, growth
of mortgage debt is expected to slow as higher interest rates restrain
housing activity; consumer credit expansion also should moderate, in line
with a smaller rise in outlays on consumer durables.
","(17) Although alternative I encompasses staff money growth fore-
casts thought to be consistent with the greenbook economic projection for
their ranges. Alternative II would more nearly center projected growth
within the annual ranges, although still involving some expected shortfall
from the midpoints, especially for M2. Alternative II affords more room
for unexpectedly slow money growth, for example should offering rates
adjust even more sluggishly than the staff envisions. Alternative II also
provides more scope for greater monetary policy tightening than in the
staff forecast, should additional restraint on aggregate demand be needed
to check inflation pressures or should the Committee wish to make more
progress against inflation than in the staff projection. At the same
time, should constant or moderately declining interest rates prove consis-
tent with satisfactory economic performance, the upper bound of alterna-
tive II would provide adequate room for the implied faster money growth.
","(18) On the other hand, alternative I already represents reductions
in the M2 and M3 ranges for 1989 of 1 and 1/2 percentage point, respec-
tively, from those for last year, and the Federal Reserve's resolve at
least to resist any increase in inflation is not widely questioned. More-
over, should a major initiative to close the deficit over time be forth-
coming, market interest rates would come under downward pressure, and
alternative I would better encompass the somewhat faster money growth
needed should the System wish to assure that economic growth would not
slacken over the near term. Alternative I may be a more natural transi-
tion to the appropriate sequence of monetary ranges in future years, when
nominal interest rates may not be rising and velocity would level out or
even decline. For example, in 1990 M2 and M3 are seen as accelerating to
the year. If the Committee wishes to have scope to continue reducing the
ranges in 1990 and beyond, it may be desirable to avoid larger decreases
at this time.
","(19) Under the staff forecast, M1 would be about unchanged on bal-
ance over 1989, as declines in demands for both demand deposits and NOW
accounts, stemming from the projected rise in opportunity costs and
declines in required compensating balances, are about offset by growth in
currency in line with that of nominal GNP. This currency growth would
support expansion in the monetary base over 1989 of 4-1/2 percent, 2-1/2
percentage points slower than last year.
Short-run policy alternatives
","(20) The two near-term policy alternatives presented involve
adjustment plus seasonal discount borrowing of $600 million for alterna-
tive B with funds trading at around 9 percent or a bit above, and borrow-
ing of $800 million for alternative C with funds 1/2 percentage point
higher. The funds rate that is likely to be associated with a particular
borrowing level and with the current 6-1/2 percent discount rate clearly
has become harder to predict in light of the substantial downward shift in
the borrowing relationship that started around mid-October of last year.
Additional near-term uncertainties can be identified. If the beginning-
of-year reluctance to borrow extends well into February or turns out to be
a more fundamental shift, adhering to a given borrowing objective would be
associated with somewhat higher federal funds rates. However, some tem-
porary downward pressure on the funds rate relative to staff expectations
might accompany the sizable boost to free reserves projected in coming
weeks from market factors, as currency and required reserves decline sea-
sonally and the Treasury balance runs off. In addition, massive flows of
funds through the banking system in coming weeks, associated with payment
for the RJR-Nabisco takeover and the Treasury's midquarter refunding, may
contribute to temporary volatility in money market rates. In light of
these considerations, it may be appropriate for the Desk to continue to
view the borrowing assumption with some flexibility.
ending December 14 and 28 and in the most recent period ending January
25. Anticipations of System tightening and year-end pressures in
December and a usual beginning-of-year pullback in borrowing in January
likely enlarged those shortfalls. Thus, the expected relationship
assumes that only the average downward shift of approximately $400 mil-
lion since mid-October will prove permanent.
","(21) Anticipated money growth rates from December to March are
shown in the table below for both alternatives, along with implied growth
through March from the fourth-quarter base of the annual targets. (Detail-
ed data are presented on the table and charts on the following pages.)
Under both alternatives, M2 would remain around the lower bound of its 3
to 7 percent tentative annual range by March, while M3 would stay in the
lower half of its 3-1/2 to 7-1/2 percent tentative annual range.

","(22) Short-term rates seem to have built in a further firming step
for policy in the near term. With funds continuing to trade at or a
little above 9 percent, as expected under alternative B, some of the rate
increases registered most recently may unwind, with Treasury bill rates
moving back to around 8-3/8 percent or a little below. Bond yields are
unlikely to move substantially, absent more indications of strength in the
economy or intensifying pressures on prices. As maintaining the reserve
pressures of alternative B causes international investors to begin recon-
sidering the likelihood of an imminent U.S. monetary policy tightening,
the value of the dollar could begin to slip.

","(23) Increases in short-term market rates over recent months should
restrain M2 growth through this quarter under alternative B. Some rebound
from a weak January seems in store in February and March, but M2 growth is
expected to reach only about 3 percent over the next two months, given the
glacial adjustment speed of offering rates recently, especially for liquid
February and March, M1 would decline slightly further. The 2 percent M2
growth of alternative B from December to March implies quarterly average
growth of only 3 percent for this aggregate. M2 demand is not expected to
respond to the anticipated bulge in nominal GNP in the current quarter
resulting from an imputed bounceback of farm activity from the drought
last year. Consistent with the GNP outlook in the greenbook, the income
velocity of M2 would increase this quarter at a 5-3/4 percent annual rate,
nearly twice its rate of change over the second half of 1988.
","(24) M3 growth under alternative B should strengthen from its
January lull to a 4-1/2 percent annual rate over February and March,
bringing growth from December to March to a 3-1/2 percent annual rate.
Total thrift deposits, flat in December and January, are expected to ex-
pand weakly over February and March, and S&Ls should continue their reli-
ance on new FHLB advances and other non-M3 borrowing. A bulge in bank
credit associated with financing of the RJR-Nabisco takeover, while other
LBO and merger-related lending remains heavy, should induce substantial
issuance of large CDs this month and next. Corporate restructuring
activity also will be boosting overall debt issuance by domestic nonfinan-
cial sectors for a time. The debt aggregate is projected to grow at a
are forecast at a record $200 billion annual rate for the quarter, while
the corporate financing gap holds steady at around an $80 billion annual
","(25) The rise in the funds rate to around 9-1/2 percent or slightly
higher associated with discount borrowing of $800 million under alterna-
tive C would be larger than is currently built into market rates. Short-
term rates would move up across the board, though by less than 1/2 per-
centage point, with the 3-month Treasury bill rate rising to around 8-3/4
percent. The upward pressure on bond rates from market perceptions of a
higher path for short rates in the intermediate term might be largely
offset by expectations that policy actions of this size and speed were
likely to slow growth and reduce inflation. Higher short-term rates
likely would induce some further firming of the exchange value of the
dollar. The increase in short-term rates would further damp expansion of
the monetary aggregates. The projected 1-1/2 percent growth of M2 over
the first three months of the year under this alternative would place it
in March a little below the lower bound of the cone associated with its
tentative annual range, and the upward movement of rates is likely to keep
M2 growth relatively damped into the spring. M3 growth of about 3-1/4
percent from December to March would leave this aggregate just 1/2 per-
centage point above its tentative lower bound by quarter end.
Directive language
","(26) Presented below for Committee consideration is draft language
relating to the ranges for 1989 and to the operating paragraph for the
intermeeting period. With respect to the long-run ranges, alternative
language is offered that would fold the M1 sentence into the first para-
graph and apply to the broader aggregates as well as to M1 the notion that
they are evaluated in light of conditions in the economy and financial
markets. This might be considered more consistent with the treatment of
the aggregates in the operational paragraph.
The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary
and financial conditions that will foster price stabil-
ity over time, promote growth in output on a sustainable
basis, and contribute to an improved pattern of interna-
tional transactions. In furtherance of these objec-
tives, the Committee at THIS [DEL: its] meeting ESTABLISHED [DEL: in
late June reaffirmed] the ranges [DEL: it had established in
February] for growth of ____ TO ____ [DEL: 4 to 8] percent for [DEL: both
M2 and ____ TO ____ PERCENT FOR M3, measured from the fourth
quarter of 1988 [DEL: 1987] to the fourth quarter of 1989 [DEL: 1988].
The monitoring range for growth of total domestic non-
financial debt was SET [DEL: also maintained] at ____ TO ____ [DEL: 7 to
[DEL: Per 1989 the Committee agreed on tentative ranges
for monetary growth, measured from the fourth quarter of
for M2 and 3-1/2 to 7-1/2 percent for M3. The Committee
set the associated monitoring range for growth of total
domestic nonfinancial debt at 6-1/2 to 10-1/2 percent.
It was understood that all these ranges were provisional
and that they would be reviewed in early 1989 in the
light of intervening developments.]
[No para] The Committee AGAIN DECIDED [DEL: reaffirmed its
decision in February] not to establish a specific target
[DEL:for 1988 and also decided not to set a tentative range]
for M1 GROWTH IN 1989. The behavior of this aggregate
[THE MONETARY AGGREGATES] will continue to be evaluated
in the light of movements in its velocity [THEIR
VELOCITIES], developments in the economy and financial
markets, and the nature of emerging price pressures.
OPERATIONAL PARAGRAPH
In the implementation of policy for the immediate
future, the Committee seeks to DECREASE SOMEWHAT/
MAINTAIN/increase somewhat the existing degree of pres-
sure on reserve positions. Taking account of indica-
tions of inflationary pressures, the strength of the
business expansion, the behavior of the monetary
aggregates, and developments in foreign exchange and
domestic financial markets, somewhat (SLIGHTLY) greater
reserve restraint would (MIGHT), or (SOMEWHAT) slightly
lesser reserve restraint (WOULD) might, be acceptable in
the intermeeting period. The contemplated reserve con-
ditions are expected to be consistent with growth of M2
and M3 over the period from DECEMBER [DEL: November] through
March at annual rates of about ____ AND ____ [DEL: 3 and 6-1/2]
percent, respectively. The Chairman may call for Com-
mittee consultation if it appears to the Manager for
Domestic Operations that reserve conditions during the
period before the next meeting are likely to be asso-
ciated with a federal funds rate persistently outside a
range of ____ TO ____ [DEL: 7 to 11] percent.
MONEY STOCK REVISIONS
Measures of the money stock have been revised to incorporate
the results of the annual benchmark and seasonal factor review. The
attached tables compare growth rates of the old and the revised series.
These data are to be regarded as strictly confidential until their
release scheduled for February 9.
Benchmark Revisions
Deposits of commercial banks and thrifts have been benchmarked
using call reports through June 1988 and incorporate revisions from
other sources as well. The benchmark revisions had negligible impacts
on monetary growth over 1988 and on the quarterly pattern of growth
within the year.
Seasonal Revisions
The seasonal factor review continued to employ the X-11 ARIMA
procedure. Although revisions to seasonal factors had little effects on
the broad patterns of growth in 1988, some redistribution of growth
occurred from the first to the second half of the year. Growth of M1
was increased by about 0.4 percentage point, M2 by 0.7 percent, and M3
by 0.5 percent, on a second quarter to fourth quarter basis.

1990-05-15,1990-05-15,"(1) Open market operations since the last Committee meeting have
continued to be directed toward maintaining unchanged pressures on reserve
positions, and the federal funds rate has remained in the area of 8-1/4
percent. Federal funds have tended to the soft side of this level since
late April, however, reflecting a more abundant supply of nonborrowed
reserves than expected, as shortfalls in tax receipts have shown through
to the Treasury's account at the Federal Reserve. Adjustment borrowing
has been around $100 million throughout the intermeeting period. Total
adjustment plus seasonal borrowing, which has trended up over the period
with the normal rise in seasonal borrowing, reached $257 million in the
most recently completed maintenance period. In the current period, ad-
justment plus seasonal borrowing is averaging $291 million. In recogni-
tion of rising seasonal credit needs, the borrowing allowance was raised
from $150 million immediately after the March meeting to $200 million in
late April and then to the current level of $300 million.
","(2) Responding to shifting sentiment on the strength of the
economy, inflation prospects, and the likelihood of a near-term tightening
of monetary policy, other market interest rates first rose in the inter-
meeting period and then fell sharply. On balance, bond yields have risen
The largest decreases were registered by Treasury bills; despite this
widening, quality spreads remain low by historical standards. The struc-
ture of short-term rates had suggested strong expectations of a near-term
firming of monetary policy part way through the period, but these expecta-
tions dissipated after release of the April data on employment, retail
sales, and producer prices, and market yields now embody expectations of
an essentially unchanged policy in coming months.
","(3) The dollar's weighted average exchange value has declined
about 3-1/2 percent since the last FOMC meeting, with much of the drop
occurring as interest rates in the United States began retracing earlier
increases following the release of April employment data. The dollar was
weak against the mark, which strengthened against most currencies follow-
ing publication of the plan for German monetary unification and prompt
conclusion of an important labor negotiation, both of which appeared to
relieve some concerns about the outlook for inflation. Very late in the
period the dollar dropped sharply against the yen as well. Foreign inter-
est rates showed mixed movements over the intermeeting period. Both
short- and long-term rates in EMS countries other than Germany moved
lower, prompted in some cases by cuts in central bank lending rates as
those countries reacted to the earlier weakness of the mark in the EMS.
The Japanese stock market rebounded substantially from its low in early

","(4) M2 growth slowed to a 2 percent rate in April, well below
the 6 percent path set for the March-to-June period at the last FOMC meet-
ing. Part of this weakness owed to declines in the wholesale components
of M2: overnight RPs ran off, likely associated with a contraction in
government securities held in commercial banks' trading accounts last
month, and demand deposits declined at a 6-1/2 percent rate. Growth of
the retail components of M2 also slowed, dropping to a 3-1/2 percent rate
from around 6 percent over the first quarter. M2 has been restrained by
the rise in intermediate- and long-term rates since late last year, and by
the unusually slow adjustment of rates on retail deposits.2 The conser-
vative pricing stance at thrifts, which has accompanied a shrinkage of the
industry and supervisory constraints on brokered deposit rates, has tended
to deflect deposit flows toward banks. Banks also have held down deposit
rates, as retail deposit inflows at those lower rates have been more than
sufficient to fund credit growth. With their attractiveness diminished,
small time deposits continued to increase sluggishly in April while non-
competitive tenders at bill and note auctions surged. Slow credit expan-
sion at banks in April, along with an apparently steeper contraction of
the thrift industry, held down overall needs for funds at depository in-
stitutions, and M3 grew at only a 1-1/4 percent rate in April as large CDs
continued to decline.
had risen about 3/4 percentage point; by contrast, over the same period, the
rate on 1-year small time deposits had risen only about 12 basis points at
banks and at thrifts had fallen slightly.
","(5) The growth of private domestic nonfinancial debt has moder-
ated somewhat in recent months; the slowing appears to reflect a dropoff
in credit demands, though tightening supply conditions likely have
affected some specific credit categories. Most of the deceleration in
overall credit usage reflected reduced borrowing by the household sector.
Consumer credit expanded sluggishly in the first quarter and consumer
lending at commercial banks weakened in April. The growth of real estate
loans at banks also slowed in April; the higher cost of residential mort-
gage credit and softening real estate markets may be restraining demands,
but survey data suggest that banks are tightening the terms of lending on
many types of nonresidential loans. Reluctance of banks and other lenders
to provide merger-related financing has continued to discourage net equity
retirements. Abstracting from estimated merger financing, business lend-
ing at banks was weak in the first quarter, although it strengthened in
April. Results from a May survey suggest that the weak C&I loan growth
since the turn of the year primarily reflects reduced demand, particularly
from large and middle market firms, but middle market firms and small
businesses also faced tighter credit standards and more stringent loan
terms. However, commercial paper issuance has been strong and businesses
continue to find receptive markets for investment-grade bond issues,
sustaining overall expansion of business credit. Federal debt issuance
has been boosted by RTC-related borrowing. From the fourth quarter to
March, total domestic nonfinancial debt increased at nearly a 7 percent

Policy Alternatives
","(6) Three alternatives--containing the standard differences in
associated federal funds rates--are presented below for consideration by
the Committee. Under alternative B, federal funds would be expected to
continue to trade around 8-1/4 percent, with an initial level of adjust-
ment plus seasonal borrowing of $350 million. The specifications of
alternative A call for federal funds trading around 7-3/4 percent and a
borrowing level of $300 million, while those of alternative C call for
federal funds in the 8-3/4 percent area, which is likely to involve $400
million of borrowing. Judging from the experience of recent years, it is
anticipated that seasonal borrowing will rise about $100 million over the
intermeeting period; the borrowing levels suggested above incorporate a
$50 million technical increase to take account of the expected rise in the
next few weeks, but an additional increase in the borrowing path may be
necessary under all three alternatives.
","(7) Interest rates generally would be expected to show little
net change under alternative B. Market expectations now embody federal
funds continuing to trade around 8-1/4 percent, as under this alternative.
Similarly, incoming information on the economy consistent with the green-
book forecast would be roughly in line with the continued economic growth
and moderation in measured inflation--though with little improvement in
longer-term price trends--that market participants now seem to be antici-
pating. Rates on Treasury bills and notes, however, could be subject to
transitory supply pressures if RTC activity accelerates appreciably and
with it Treasury financing needs. A breakthrough in negotiations on the
budget between the Administration and the Congress in coming weeks would
be likely to spark a rally in capital markets, which after a time might
induce a downward adjustment in the foreign exchange value of the dollar.
Absent such a breakthrough, the dollar likely would remain around recent
levels on foreign exchange markets; with the dollar stable and German
reunification impending, a tightening of monetary policy in Germany and
Japan before the next FOMC meeting appears unlikely.
","(8) Projected growth rates for the monetary aggregates from
March to June are given in the table below for all three alternatives.
(The table and charts on the following pages show more detailed data.)
Under alternative B, growth in both M2 and M3 would pick up over May and
June from the sluggish pace of April. This pickup results in part from a
cessation of the runoff of demand deposits and RPs. In addition, the
response of depositors to previous increases in opportunity costs would
begin to wane. Moreover, opportunity costs have already narrowed from
April and, with market interest rates stable, this narrowing could con-
tinue, buoying retail deposit inflows, as banks raise small time deposit
rates, albeit slowly, in adjustment to increases in market rates on bal-
ance this year. To an extent, the strengthening of M2 and M3 under this
alternative rests on a rebound in bank credit growth and associated fund-
ing needs in May and June--given the evidence that reductions in willing-
ness to lend are limited. Again, the behavior of the RTC constitutes a
major uncertainty in the outlook for money growth. To date in the second
quarter, RTC spending still has been fairly modest. We have assumed pro-
gressively more resolution activity over May and June, but well below
RTC's announced goal of 141 resolutions involving $50 billion of assets
for this quarter. A surge in RTC activity could damp M3 growth as thrift
assets end up on the government's balance sheet. And it could affect M2
as well, if large volumes of retail deposits are transferred to commercial
banks without accompanying loans and investments, reducing bank needs to
raise deposit offering rates. On balance, M2 growth is projected to
strengthen to a 5 percent pace on average in May and June, in line with
average growth over the first four months of the year. M3 growth would
remain quite sluggish as thrifts continued to shrink--through RTC resolu-
tions and through action to meet capital requirements--but would pick up a
little to about a 3-1/2 percent pace from growth of around 1 percent in
March and April.

","(9) Even with the projected strengthening in money, growth of
both M2 and M3 over the March-to-June period would be noticeably below
expectations at the time of the last meeting. Moreover, growth of M2
would be appreciably below the 6 to 7 percent rate of expansion of the
previous several quarters, leaving this aggregate only a little above the
midpoint of its annual range at mid-year. As noted, the moderation in
both M2 and M3 has resulted in part from the weakness in credit growth
at banks as well as thrifts. To a considerable extent, this weakness
seems to represent a rechannelling of credit flows involving assets, such
as mortgages and consumer receivables, that are easily securitized and
absorbed by other lenders, without materially raising costs to borrowers.
The lack of serious disruptions from this process can be inferred from
continued narrow yield spreads between mortgages and Treasury securities.
In addition, weaker bank credit growth reflects some tightening of terms
and reduction in availability of loans--including those to small business
and for construction--that are not easily transferred to other lenders.
In the staff forecast, however, the ""credit crunch"" does not deepen and,
while important in certain locales and for selected uses, does not have a
major effect on aggregate borrowing and spending. In these circumstances,
the slower money growth now forecast for the second quarter would not
signal the approach of underlying weakness in the economy, since it would
be offset by an upward shift in velocity. M2 velocity in the staff fore-
cast is projected to increase at a 2-1/4 percent rate in the second quar-
ter, following a 1-1/2 percent rise in the first quarter.
","(10) Consistent with the notion that credit remains generally
available, growth in the debt of private domestic nonfinancial sectors is
expected to continue close to the 6 percent average pace of recent months,
about in line with spending. While the less hospitable attitude of lend-
ers toward LBOs will continue to restrain corporate restructuring activity
and associated credit usage, credit availability difficulties elsewhere in
the business sector are expected to have only relatively modest effects,
and borrowing by nonfinancial businesses should continue around its recent
rate. Credit availability effects likely will continue to be more notice-
able in the construction and development area, and the rise in mortgage
rates that has occurred this year will continue to restrain household
mortgage borrowing as well. Consumer credit growth is expected to remain
subdued as spending on durables is-projected to be sluggish. Considerable
uncertainty surrounds the outlook for Treasury borrowing--both the amount
and timing--owing to RTC financing needs. While Treasury borrowing for
RTC working capital purposes would end up boosting the debt aggregate,
such borrowing would not be expected to put underlying pressure on the
general level of interest rates: federal government liabilities simply
would be replacing those of private intermediaries, which are not included
in the debt aggregate, leaving unaffected the volume of saving available
for investment. Assuming a substantial pickup in RTC-related borrowing in
the second quarter, federal government debt would increase at about an 8
percent pace over the March-to-June period. Total domestic nonfinancial
debt is projected to expand at a 7 percent rate over the three months and
by June would be 7 percent at an annual rate above its fourth-quarter 1989
base, at the midpoint of its 1990 monitoring range.
","(11) The easing of reserve conditions under alternative A would
tend to strengthen money growth over May and June to something more in
line with rates incorporated in the Committee's expectations at the last
meeting. Opportunity costs would narrow even more, boosting M2 growth to
nearly a 6 percent rate over May and June, leaving this aggregate notice-
ably above the midpoint of its annual range. M3 growth would firm to a 4
percent annual rate, keeping this aggregate a little above the lower bound
of its range. The easing of policy under alternative A would come as
something of a surprise to most market participants, and money market
rates would decline by the full 50 basis point drop in the federal funds
rate. The dollar would come under downward pressure, and, absent incoming
information pointing to a weaker economy or a distinct improvement in
underlying cost or price trends, the decline in bond rates would be
limited, resulting in a steeper yield curve. If, however, evidence sug-
gested a softening in economic activity, perhaps reflecting more powerful
credit restraint than now seems apparent, the drop in short-term rates
would feed through to bond yields. The decline in market rates would tend
to buoy borrowing and spending by those with market access, helping to
offset the effects of tighter credit availability on spenders dependent on
depository intermediaries.
","(12) The tighter reserve conditions under alternative C would be
expected to keep money growth damped. M2 would be at the middle of its
range by June and M3 just above the lower end of its range. Short-term
rates would increase by about the 1/2 percentage point rise in the federal
funds rate, and the dollar would tend to firm. Banks would raise the
prime rate, and could further tighten other credit terms. Bond yields
also would rise, at least initially, in response to the reversal of the
previous trend in Federal Reserve actions. However, in the context of
only moderate growth in the economy, the higher short-term interest rates
and slower money growth would be seen as a policy response to inflation
pressures, implying additional emphasis by the Federal Reserve on its
price stability objective. In this context, the credibility of that
objective could be enhanced, to the benefit of bond prices.

1991-11-05,1991-11-05,"(1) Over most of the interval since the October FOMC meet-
ing, the Desk sought to maintain existing reserve market pressures.
The allowance for adjustment plus seasonal borrowing initially was
kept at $325 million but over the first two complete maintenance
periods it was reduced in three technical adjustments of $25 million
each to allow for the declining trend of seasonal borrowing.1 The
federal funds rate averaged near the 5-1/4 percent level expected by
the FOMC through the first maintenance period and most of the second,
before drifting off late in that period, reflecting market anticipa-
tion of an imminent policy easing that was reinforced when a need to
drain reserves was deliberately not met on settlement day in the con-
text of an ongoing Committee consultation. In response to signs of
flagging consumer and business confidence and a weaker-than-expected
economic recovery, reviewed at that consultation, the borrowing
allowance was reduced by $25 million on Thursday, the first day of the
current period. Consistent with this change, the expected trading
area for federal funds was lowered to 5 percent, where the federal
funds rate settled late in the week. Also on Thursday, another tech-
nical reduction of $50 million was made in the borrowing allowance,
bringing the current allowance to $175 million.
","(2) Over the first three weeks of the intermeeting period,
short-term market interest rates declined somewhat, as market par-
ticipants interpreted incoming data as generally pointing to continued
economic sluggishness. Long-term market rates, by contrast, backed up
considerably over these weeks as data on consumer prices proved disap-
pointing, oil prices firmed, and discussions of possible fiscal stimu-
lus measures prompted renewed concerns about federal deficits and
borrowing. Subsequently, both short- and long-term rates moved down
appreciably in reaction to information suggesting additional economic
weakness, more favorable labor cost and GNP price data, and the
renewed anticipation of further monetary policy easing. Since the
last FOMC meeting, short rates are down 35 to 45 basis points. The
prime rate, however, remained at 8 percent. Rates on Treasury notes
also declined, but at the longest maturity, bond rates were up on
balance by around 10 basis points. Primary-market yields on mortgages
fell to their lowest levels since 1977, spurring mortgage refinanc-
ings. Although some stock price indexes touched record highs during
the intermeeting period, most indexes were up only a little on net.
","(3) The dollar's foreign exchange value on a weighted aver-
age basis is down about 1 percent on balance since the last Committee
meeting. The dollar was generally higher over the first half of the
intermeeting period but was weakened significantly by the stream of
negative reports on the U.S. economy and by the anticipated U.S.
policy easing. The yen was especially strong, bolstered by increasing
market focus on Japan's burgeoning external surpluses and possible
implications for Japanese policy. Three-month interest rates in Japan
declined about as much as U.S. rates, while German short-term rates
rose by 15 basis points. Long-term rates in both Germany and Japan
were little changed over the period. -----------------------------

","(4) M2 and M3 resumed modest expansion in October, at rates
of 3 and 1 percent, respectively, which were close to their 3 and
economic sluggishness. Long-term market rates, by contrast, backed up
considerably over these weeks as data on consumer prices proved disap-
pointing, oil prices firmed, and discussions of possible fiscal stimu-
lus measures prompted renewed concerns about federal deficits and

(4) M2 and M3 resumed modest expansion in October, at rates
of 3 and 1 percent, respectively, which were close to their 3 and
at a time of declining money-market yields. In addition, bank liabili-
ties within M3 expanded more rapidly to fund faster growth of bank
","(6) Most of the step-up in bank credit in October reflected a
pickup in securities acquisitions, although the contraction in total
loans also slowed. C&I loans expanded for the second consecutive month,
but at a much reduced rate. A recent survey of bank loan officers pro-
vided little evidence of a further tightening of business loan standards
and instead suggested that such loans continued to be held down by weak
demand. Firms with access to capital markets maintained their reliance
on proceeds of bond and equity issuance, reflecting the reduced financing
costs on such instruments as well as firms' efforts to strengthen balance
sheets. Offerings of tax-exempt bonds also continued at a rapid clip in
October, in part as a number of governmental units resorted to extraordi-
nary measures to finance budgetary shortfalls. The very limited avail-
able data pertaining to household-sector borrowing in October suggest
little buoyancy. Consumer loans at banks, adjusted for securitization,
contracted for the second month in a row, even though no surveyed loan
officers reported less willingness to extend consumer loans and some
reported more. The pickup in mortgage refinancing activity has not
translated into much of a boost to mortgage borrowing, as homeowners
appear to be motivated more by lowering interest costs than by extracting
equity. Underlying the continued light borrowing by nonfederal sectors
has been the slow pace of income growth as well as the tendency of
households and businesses to deleverage balance sheets. Federal
borrowing in October stayed heavy, however, despite a marked slowdown in
deposit insurance outlays. Total domestic nonfinancial sector debt in
October likely edged further above the 4-1/2 percent lower limit of its
monitoring range.

Policy Alternatives
","(7) Two alternatives are presented below for consideration
by the Committee. Under alternative B, federal funds would continue
to trade around 5 percent in combination with adjustment plus seasonal
borrowing of $175 million.3  Under alternative A, the federal funds
rate would move down to 4-1/2 percent, achieved either through a 1/2
percentage point cut in the discount rate with the same level of bor-
rowing as under alternative B or through open market operations that
lowered the borrowing level to $125 million. In the latter case, the
decline in the funds rate to 1/2 percentage point below the discount
rate would cause borrowing to fall to frictional levels. A bit more
volatility in the federal funds rate would be implied as the discount
window becomes a little less effective buffer to disturbances in the
reserves market.
","(8) Monetary growth rates under the two alternatives are
presented in the table below. (More detailed information is shown in
the table and charts on the following pages.) Under both alternatives
M2 would finish the year at or a shade above, and M3 a touch below,
the lower bounds of their ranges. As discussed in previous bluebooks,
growth in the broader aggregates this year is being unusually de-
pressed by the downsizing of the thrift industry, weak lending by
commercial banks, portfolio shifts by the public into capital market
instruments, and the process of deleveraging by households and busi-
nesses. Slow expansion this year in M2 and M3, combined with the
staff's forecast of 3-1/2 percent annual growth for nominal GNP,
implies increases in their velocities this year, despite the large
declines in short-term market interest rates and related opportunity
costs. M1 evidently has responded to the reduction in its opportunity
costs much more in line with historical patterns, although some of the
strength in M1 this year has come from a continuation of unusually
heavy demands for currency aboard. Narrow money is expected to grow
by at least 7-1/2 percent this year, well in excess of nominal income.

","(9) The markets appear to have built in a high probability
of a further easing move in the period just ahead, and thus with the
unchanged funds rate of alternative B, other market interest rates may
tend to firm. The reversal in yields would be modest should incoming
data on the real economy point more decisively to faltering near-term
expansion, as in the staff forecast, engendering the expectation that
the next easing has only been postponed. Any rise in long-term yields
also would be mitigated to the extent that indications of a softening
in the economic outlook were seen as improving prospects for disinfla-
tion. However, quality spreads on bank and corporate debt would widen
marginally if the market's economic outlook turns more downbeat. If
rates do firm a little, the dollar could rise a bit on foreign ex-
change markets.

M2 M3 M1
Alt. A Alt. B Alt. A Alt. B Alt. A Alt. B
","(10) M2 would be expected to continue to expand at a 3 per-
cent rate in the November and December period under alternative B, the
same as expected at the October FOMC meeting. The negative impact on
M2 of the weaker picture for income and spending growth is likely to
be about offset by the effects on opportunity costs of the most recent
policy easing and by what promises to be a larger than previously
expected slowdown in RTC resolution activity in the fourth quarter.
In October, resolutions fell to a much reduced level that now seems
likely to persist through year-end owing to legislative delays, which
largely removes one restraining influence on retail deposits. Growth
of demand deposits, however, is expected to fall back from October's
atypical surge and show through to a slowing in M1 growth to a 7-1/4
percent pace over November and December.4  In the fourth quarter of
this year, M2 expansion at a 2 percent rate on a quarterly average
basis would imply a rise in its velocity of 1-1/2 percent at an annual
rate, down markedly from the 4-1/2 percent pace of the third quarter.
Under this policy alternative, M2 would be on a trajectory to enter
of 2-1/2 to 6-1/2 percent.
","(11) M3 under alternative B is seen as continuing to grow at
a 1 percent annual rate over November and December, which would mean
this aggregate would be entering next year around the bottom of its
tentative 1992 range of 1 to 5 percent. Despite the reduced
projection for RTC activity, growth of M3 over the rest of the year is
likely to be a little slower than expected at the last FOMC meeting.
The weaker outlook for M3 stems from our anticipation that the
substitution of non-M3 liabilities for Yankee CDs at branches and
agencies of foreign banks surfacing in October probably will persist
to some degree. Projected weakness in bank credit continues to damp
the outlook for M3. Growth of C&I loans will be anemic owing to
continued restraint by banks and, more important, to weak demand.
Business outlays for fixed capital and inventories are likely to be
soft, and offerings in bond and equity markets should remain robust,
as those firms that can access these markets seek to strengthen
balance sheets. Lending for commercial properties will remain
depressed by sustained difficulties in this sector. Household mort-
gage growth will be restrained by the modest recovery in housing
activity envisioned in the staff forecast. Consumer credit should
contract further over the remainder of the year, largely reflecting
subdued spending on durables. In the aggregate, borrowing of domestic
nonfederal sectors is expected to remain sluggish through year-end.
In contrast, federal borrowing will stay brisk to finance a burgeoning
deficit. Overall debt of domestic nonfinancial sectors is expected to
register a 5 percent rate of expansion over the September-to-December
period, placing growth for the year about 1/2 percentage point above
the bottom of the FOMC's 4-1/2 to 8-1/2 percent monitoring range for
this aggregate.
","(12) The easing contemplated in alternative A exceeds that
now envisioned by the markets and thus money market interest rates
would decline, perhaps by at least 1/4 percentage point. Long-term
rates, too, would come under some downward pressure, although declines
would be muted if earlier market concerns about the stickiness of
inflation reemerge at some point. The prime rate probably would be
lowered 1/2 percentage point, still preserving the recently widened
spread over funding costs. The dollar likely would fall somewhat on
foreign exchange markets.
","(13) M2 is projected to strengthen to a 4 percent rate by
December under alternative A and would be entering the new year well
into its tentative range. Enlarged inflows to liquid deposits would
boost both its nontransactions and M1 components, as sluggish deposit
rates contribute to the attractiveness of such accounts. Tending to
limit the pickup in M2, though, would be declines in rates on retail
CDs and money funds in relation to expected returns on capital market
instruments; also, cost pressures might induce more banks to overcome
their hesitancy to lower rates on passbook and NOW accounts, which
could prompt established customers to reconsider investment options
and move account balances to market instruments.
","(14) Under alternative A, M3 would expand at a 1-1/4 percent
rate in November and December, on a trajectory to begin the new year
within its tentative range. Buoying M3 would be heightened inflows to
institution-only money market funds, whose holders would respond to
the temporary improvement in their yields relative to those of money
market instruments. In addition, banks' needs for M3 liabilities
would be raised by a little additional lending. Improvement in some
lending margins and firmer asset values would enhance access of many
banks to capital and funding markets and encourage lending to some
previously marginal credits. Nevertheless, the major credit-market
beneficiaries of the easing would continue to be those more highly
rated credits having ready access to the commercial paper and capital

1993-03-23,1993-03-23,"(1) The degree of reserve pressure was left unchanged over
the intermeeting period. The intended level of the federal funds rate
remained at 3 percent and the allowance for adjustment and seasonal
borrowing at $50 million. The federal funds rate has averaged 3.03
percent since the early February FOMC meeting, and borrowing has aver-
aged slightly above its allowance. Short-term market interest rates
were little changed over the intermeeting period.
","(2) Bond markets, however, rallied strongly over much of the
period. Prospects for significant reductions in the federal budget
deficit in coming years and the consequences for aggregate demand
appeared to be the most important influence sparking the rally. De-
mands for Treasury notes and bonds also were boosted by municipal
defeasance activity and assessments of heightened prepayment risk on
mortgage-backed securities. Toward the end of the period, however,
upturns in inflation readings prompted some backup in yields, but
renewed rate declines most recently have erased much of this backup.
On balance, most intermediate- and long-term yields have fallen 40 to
securities and fixed-rate mortgages over comparable Treasuries have
widened some; nevertheless, mortgage rates reached their lowest levels
in two decades. The drop in interest rates buoyed stock prices: Most
major indexes rose 1 to 3 percent, although the NASDAQ index declined
somewhat on net, reflecting concerns about future changes in government
policy toward certain industries, including health-care firms.
","(3) The dollar's foreign exchange value on a weighted-average
basis declined about 1-1/4 percent on balance over the intermeeting
period. During much of the period, the dollar generally rose against
European currencies, amid signs of weakening activity and easier cur-
rent and prospective monetary policy stances in those countries. But
the dollar declined against the mark and other European currencies
following the Bundesbank's cut in its discount rate on March 18 that
embodied less easing than was apparently expected by market partici-
pants. On balance, the dollar fell 1/2 percent against the mark over
the period. German short-term rates dropped 70 basis points, while the
long-term rate moved down 40 basis points. Interest rates elsewhere in
Europe also decreased. The dollar depreciated 7-1/2 percent against
the yen, as market attention focused on Japan's growing trade surplus.
In Japan, short-term rates and the bellwether bond yield declined about
","(4) The broad monetary aggregates continued to contract in
February. M2 dropped at a 4 percent rate. Its Ml component fell
slightly last month, continuing its deceleration from the double-digit
pace that prevailed over much of 1992.2 The nontransaction com-
ponent of M2 again contracted rapidly. Owing mainly to strong flows
into institution-only money funds, the decline in M3 slowed last month,
and, at a 2-1/2 percent rate, was more moderate than that in M2. The
available data for the first half of March show a less rapid outflow
from M2 but a stepped-up runoff of M3 compared with February. From
January to mid-March, the broader aggregates, especially M2, were
appreciably weaker than anticipated at the time of the last bluebook.
As of mid-March, the broad aggregates were well below their target
cones and only a little above the lower edges of their parallel bands.
","(5) Much of the recent weakness in the monetary aggregates
appears to be due to temporary factors. Some weakness in M2 associated
with seasonal adjustment distortions and a decline in deposit balances
associated with a fall in prepayments of mortgage-backed securities was
foreseen in the last bluebook.3  In the event, prepayments plunged
more rapidly than earlier projected. But not all of the shortfall of
M2 from expectations is accounted for by larger-than-anticipated
temporary factors. Thus, even abstracting from temporary depressants,
M2 appears to be fundamentally weaker than foreseen earlier, with
underlying growth from January to mid-March, while positive, quite
modest. Of the 8-1/2 percent growth rate in M2 velocity that seems to
be in train this quarter, no more than 1-1/2 percentage points can
plausibly be attributed to these temporary factors. Evidently, some of
the other persisting influences that have been boosting velocity in
recent years have intensified. Relatively attractive returns on capi-
tal market instruments likely have prompted households to divert more
funds from deposits into bond and stock mutual fund shares, which have
posted record inflows in recent months. Bank credit expansion has
slowed noticeably this year, and banks also have continued to tap
markets for subordinated debt and equity, further depressing their
needs for deposit funding. Both M2 and M3 have borne the imprint of
these developments, as interest rates on retail deposits have dropped
further in recent weeks and as large time deposits have continued to
run off. Moreover, the leveling out of short-term interest rates since
last September, as the stance of monetary policy has held steady, has
meant that earlier policy-induced stimulus to growth of the broader
aggregates has ended.
","(6) Overall private debt growth appears to be expanding
around or a bit faster than its pace over the last few months of 1992.
Businesses have drawn heavily on credit markets, as the rally in bond
prices set off another surge of corporate issuance, although the pro-
ceeds were largely used to repay business loans at banks and commercial
paper, both of which have declined a little on balance so far this
year. State and local governments have taken advantage of favorable
market conditions by selling a hefty volume of bonds, with an enlarged
proportion of the offerings earmarked to refund debt. Households seem
to have increased their willingness to take on debt in recent months:
Consumer installment credit rose in January for the fifth straight
month and, in February, bank consumer loans adjusted for securitization
rose at nearly a 9 percent annual rate. Total domestic nonfinancial
debt is estimated to have grown at about a 4-1/2 percent rate from the
fourth quarter through February, leaving this aggregate around the
lower bound of its 1993 monitoring range.

sideration by the Committee. Under alternative B, federal funds would
continue to trade around 3 percent in association with the allowance for
adjustment plus seasonal borrowing initially remaining at $50 million.
The allowance probably will need to be revised upward over the inter-
meeting period when demands for seasonal credit strengthen during the
spring. Under alternative A, the federal funds rate would decline to
the 2-1/2 percent area. This alternative could be implemented through a
borrowing allowance at the same level as in alternative B, or by
lowering the initial borrowing allowance to $25 million and leaving the
discount rate unchanged. Alternative C, involving a rise in the federal
funds rate to 3-1/2 percent, could be implemented through a boost in the
initial borrowing allowance to $75 million.
","(8) Market participants are expecting neither tightening nor
easing in the stance of monetary policy for some time. They appear to
anticipate that the recent runup in inflation will subside in large
part. The gains in stock prices and sustained narrow quality spreads
suggest that investors now also believe that the bond market rally,
together with the economy's existing forward momentum, will keep the
contractionary effects of the deficit-reduction package from derailing
the economic expansion. Thus, under alternative B, short-term interest
rates would stay around current levels. Intermediate- and long-term
rates will remain sensitive to news on the fiscal front and correspond-
ing implications for the economy, as well as reports bearing on the
inflation outlook. Bond rates could edge lower should incoming news on
prices confirm the extent of moderation in inflation embodied in the
staff economic forecast. The dollar would be expected to fluctuate
around current levels under alternative B, but could firm somewhat if
rate declines in Europe prove to be faster and larger than now expected.
","(9) The easing of policy under alternative A would surprise
market participants and would lead to a decline in short-term rates,
including the prime rate, commensurate with the 1/2 percentage point
drop in the federal funds rate. In such circumstances, bankers might be
more encouraged to ease lending standards and nonprice terms on business
loans. Rate declines at longer maturities would be muted should market
participants see the easing in the absence of weak economic data as
risking a sustained resurgence of inflation. Conversely, the tightening
of policy under alternative C, which also would come as a surprise to
market participants, would induce a rise in short-term rates comparable
to the hike in the federal funds rate. The increase in intermediate-
and long-term rates would be lessened to the degree it were seen as a
timely measure to hold inflation in check. To the extent that market
participants saw dimmer prospects for economic activity, risk premiums
incorporated in yields on private obligations would increase. The ex-
change value of the dollar would move in the same direction as domestic
interest rates under either alternative.
","(11) Monetary growth rates for the February-to-June period
thought to be consistent with the three alternatives are shown in the
table below. Despite both stronger nominal income expansion and lower
longer-term interest rates than expected previously, in all three
alternatives growth rates of M2 and M3 over this period are roughly
sions primarily reflect the weaker-than-expected underlying monetary
growth to date and the prospect that the various influences causing a
rechanneling of credit flows away from depositories will remain intense,
even if abating some from their extraordinary strength so far this year.

Growth from February

","(12) Under alternative B, M2 is expected to resume growth over
the February-to-June period. The projected 2-1/2 percent average rate
implies growth of 1-3/4 percent for the second quarter. With nominal
GDP in the staff forecast decelerating to a 5-1/2 percent pace, growth
in M2 velocity would slow to a 3-1/2 percent annual rate in the second
quarter. Slower velocity growth partly results from the positive ef-
fects on M2 of the turnaround of the temporary factors related to sea-
sonal adjustment and prepayments of mortgage-backed securities. Their
impact, which represents a diminishing drag on M2 growth in March as a
whole, acts as a stimulant to growth in the subsequent months, reflect-
ing a reversal of the effects of seasonal distortions and a resurgence
in prepayments.4 On balance, these factors raise money growth per-
ceptibly over the February-to-June period. Much of the pickup in M2
comes from its M1 component, which would expand at a 10 percent annual

rate from February to June.5 Outflows to bond funds from money
market mutual funds and nontransactions retail deposits are seen as
moderating over time if bond yields stabilize around current reduced
levels and as portfolio adjustments become more complete. The pickup in
M2 would still be limited by further downward adjustments of deposit
rates. By June, growth in M2 from its fourth-quarter base would be only
","(13) Even though M3 is seen as expanding at a 1 percent rate
over the February-to-June period, it still would be well below its
fourth-quarter base in June. The resumption in M3 expansion would
partly reflect some anticipated pickup in bank credit. In the months
ahead, banks may become a little more willing to extend business
credit--including loans to smaller firms--and, given their more comfort-
able capital positions, to retain, rather than securitize and sell,
assets. Improved balance sheet structures also imply less need for
banks to rely on capital markets to raise funds, an important substitute
for M3 funding recently. Even though some businesses are expected to
acquire additional financing from banks, others are likely to continue
to rely on bond markets, in some cases paying down bank loans and short-
term paper. Overall business borrowing is expected to strengthen with
increases in capital spending and moderation in equity financing.
Household borrowing will be bolstered by improving housing activity--as
suggested by the stronger level of mortgage applications recently--and
further advances in outlays for consumer durables. Nonfederal debt is
expected to grow at about a 4 percent pace from February to June, up a
little from growth in recent months. Federal debt expansion, while
gyrating from month to month, will remain brisk over the second quarter
to finance large deficits.6 Total debt of domestic nonfinancial
sectors is projected to grow at a 5-1/2 percent annual rate from
February to June. Such growth would place this aggregate in June 5-1/4
percent at an annual rate above its fourth-quarter base and about 3/4
percentage point above the lower bound of its monitoring range.
","(14) Under alternative A, M2 would strengthen to a 3 percent
rate over the February-to-June period. This speed-up in M2 growth,
coming mainly from its M1 component, would owe to smaller opportunity
costs, as deposit rate adjustments lag behind the decline in market
rates. Although M2 in June would still be below the lower bound of its
annual growth cone, it would be on a trajectory to reach the vicinity of
the lower bound by year-end, partly because spending would begin to
strengthen later in the year in response to the policy easing. M3 would
grow at a 1-1/4 percent pace over February to June under alternative A,
but would remain below its fourth-quarter base even by June. Under
alternative C, M2 would expand at a 2 percent rate over the February-to-
June period, as wider opportunity costs would discourage inflows to more
liquid deposits, especially M1 balances. M2 likely would not move above
the level of its fourth-quarter base until June, and with slower
spending growth later in the year, this aggregate probably would
increase only marginally over the year as a whole. M3 would expand at
only a 3/4 percent rate from February to June.
Directive language

paragraph that includes the usual options and updating. Two versions
are shown for the sentence on the growth of M2 and M3. The first would

1993-05-18,1993-05-18,"(1) The degree of pressure on reserve positions was left un-
changed over the intermeeting period. Federal funds generally traded in
the 3 percent area, despite the complications to Desk reserve management
posed by shortfalls in individual nonwithheld taxes, which showed
through to the Treasury balance, and by revisions to forecasts of re-
quired reserves. The allowance for adjustment plus seasonal borrowing
was raised $50 million in two steps to $100 million, reflecting an in-
crease in seasonal credit. After spiking at the March quarter-end,
borrowing returned to around its allowance, before moving noticeably
above it in the last complete maintenance period.
","(2) Short-term interest rates were narrowly mixed on balance
over the intermeeting period, while most longer-term market rates
increased 10 to 20 basis points. Early in the period, long rates backed
up sharply as data on hourly earnings and commodity prices sparked
inflation fears. These yields subsequently declined as signs of more
favorable price behavior and a much slower pace of economic expansion
more than countered increasing doubts about the prospects for additional
fiscal restraint. Late in the intermeeting period, bond rates again
moved higher in response to unfavorable inflation readings. On the
other hand, the interest rate on thirty-year fixed-rate mortgages has
fallen 15 basis points since the March meeting; its latest quote is only
a bit above its recent 20-year low. Quality spreads for most other
private rates were little changed, but they improved somewhat for specu-
lative-grade issues. Stock prices were mixed over the period. Bank
stocks dropped substantially, reflecting in part market perceptions that
net interest margins could narrow, especially in the absence of a pickup
in loan demands.
","(3) The dollar's weighted average exchange value declined by
almost 3 percent, on balance, over the intermeeting period, reflecting a
variety of factors, including a less optimistic view regarding the pro-
spects for U.S. economic expansion. The dollar has dropped more than 4
percent on balance against the yen. A variety of statements by offi-
cials.in Japan and the United States fostered some market confusion for
a time and contributed to a strengthening of the yen. But a little of
the weaker tone of the dollar has dissipated since April 27, when the
Desk bought $200 million against yen for the accounts of the System and
the ESF in an effort to calm the market before the G-7 meeting on April
of Japan purchased nearly $7 billion for its own account in April and
early May. Japanese short-term rates were little changed. Other short-
term interest rates continued to move lower, with three-month German
rates falling nearly 50 basis points; French rates fell dramatically
(over 300 basis points) with the passing of devaluation fears after the
French election. Long-term interest rates rose in Japan, the United
Kingdom, and Canada, were little changed in Germany, and generally
declined elsewhere. The price of gold rose 10-1/2 percent; reported
reasons for the increase include inflation concerns in the United
States, rising demand from China and elsewhere in Asia, and supply
developments in Russia and South Africa.
","(4) Over March and April, M2 fell at a 1/2 percent rate com-
pared with the 1-1/2 percent rate of growth that was projected in the
last bluebook, while M3 was unchanged, about as anticipated. Iden-
tifiable temporary factors accounted for most of the shortfall from the
M2 forecast. Rather than washing out over March and April as foreseen
in the last bluebook, these factors represented a depressant. In par-
ticular, individual nonwithheld tax payments in April came in well below
last year's level, rather than well above it, as had been expected.3
Hence, M2 was restrained by a slower buildup of liquid deposits in April
than implied by typical seasonal patterns. Abstracting from temporary
factors, the modest underlying growth of M2 over March and April was
only a bit below earlier expectations. Continued shifting to capital
market instruments doubtless held back underlying monetary expansion.
Inflows to bond and stock mutual funds were at a near-record pace in
March and reportedly were heavy in April.
","(5) Broad money has surged in the two weeks ended May 10--M2
by $35 billion and M3 by $30 billion based on preliminary data--to
levels well above those embodied in the March bluebook.4 The burst
in liquid deposits in early May in part reflected unusually small draw-
downs to pay taxes. In addition, a resurgence in mortgage refinancing
activity, which had begun to boost the aggregates in April, evidently
intensified in early May. But these factors can explain only some of
the surge. Underlying M2, which had been flat on balance from the
fourth quarter through April, thus seems to have strengthened in early
May to a level higher than anticipated in the last bluebook, despite
weaker-than-expected nominal GDP in the second quarter. Although it is
possible that the build-up is primarily noise, the burst also could
signify a waning of the forces that have contributed to the weakness in
underlying M2 relative to nominal spending in recent quarters. Even
with this early May surge, though, M2 has grown at only a 1/4 percent
annual rate from the fourth quarter of 1992 through the week of May 10,
while M3 still has fallen, leaving both aggregates below their target
cones but above their lower parallel bands. (See charts.)
","(6) Bank credit growth picked up to a 5-1/4 percent rate over
March and April, reflecting acquisitions of securities. After declining
further in March, bank lending edged higher in April. Business loans,
however, continued to fall rapidly in April, about offsetting stepped-up
offerings of commercial paper by nonfinancial firms. Larger nonfinan-
cial firms continued to draw on proceeds of brisk equity and debt
issuance to pay down loans. Business loans at small banks posted a
third month of gains in April. The May Senior Loan Officer Survey
showed some further relaxation of price and non-price terms for business
loans, as well as a modest easing of standards, including the first
signs of easier standards for large firms.
","(7) The overall net borrowing of nonfinancial businesses has
remained sluggish, owing to limited capital outlays relative to internal
funds and heavy net equity issuance. Enhanced incentives to use credit
cards for transactions may have contributed to a pickup in growth of
consumer installment credit through March and a sharp rise in consumer
loans at banks in April. State and local governments in April continued
to issue an exceptional volume of debt, mainly for refundings. Total
nonfederal debt growth, at a 3-3/4 percent rate in March, about matched
its growth from the fourth quarter to that month. Federal debt growth
has risen in recent months on a seasonally adjusted basis, reflecting
lower tax receipts this year. Total domestic nonfinancial debt is
estimated to have expanded at a 6-1/2 percent rate in March, bringing
growth from the fourth quarter through March to a 5 percent rate--a
little above the lower bound of its monitoring range for 1993.

Policy alternatives
","(8) Three policy alternatives are presented below for con-
sideration by the Committee. Under alternative B, federal funds would
continue to trade around 3 percent, in association with the allowance
for adjustment and seasonal borrowing initially being maintained at its
current level of $100 million.5 Under alternative A, the federal
funds rate would be reduced to 2-1/2 percent. This reduction could be
achieved either by lowering the initial borrowing allowance by $25
million or by reducing the discount rate 1/2 percentage point while
leaving the allowance unchanged at $100 million. Federal funds would
trade in the neighborhood of 3-1/2 percent under alternative C, in
association with an initial borrowing allowance of $125 million.
","(9) In light of recent price reports, market participants now
generally seem to expect that the next change in the stance of monetary
policy is somewhat more likely to be toward tightening than toward ease,
but few appear to anticipate any move immediately after the May FOMC
meeting. Thus, market interest rates are unlikely to react to the
implementation of alternative B. The odds are that bond yields will
retrace at least some of their recent back-up if--as anticipated in the
greenbook forecast--the news on inflationary pressures proves more
favorable. The ongoing budget debates and the prospective announcement
of the Administration's health reform plan suggest that the volatility
associated with an uncertain fiscal outlook may persist. Shorter-term
rates could rise some with the approach of larger auction volumes of
bills and shorter-term notes. The value of the dollar on foreign
exchange markets probably would remain around current levels under
alternative B.
","(10) The 1/2 percentage point reduction in the federal funds
rate under alternative A would surprise market participants and should
show through almost completely to other short-term interest rates. The
three-month bill rate would fall to around 2-1/2 percent, and the prime
rate probably would be reduced to 5-1/2 percent. With the economy
likely to exhibit a bit more strength than otherwise over the inter-
mediate run as a result of the easing, banks may feel a little more
confident about the ability of borrowers to repay loans. As a result,
banks might further ease other terms and standards on lending. Risk
premiums in short- and long-term market interest rates, already histori-
cally narrow, would probably remain around their current levels. Any
initial decline in longer-term yields could be limited by concerns that
the easier monetary policy stance indicated more emphasis on supporting
the economic expansion and less emphasis on containing inflation, par-
ticularly against the backdrop of the recent disappointing wage and
price behavior and uncertainty regarding the outcome of the fiscal
policy debate. Absent corresponding actions abroad to ease monetary
policy, downward pressure on the foreign exchange value of the dollar
would resume.
","(11) Market participants also would be surprised by the policy
tightening under alternative C at this FOMC meeting. Bond yields may
well increase, but with the rise probably tempered by the sense that the
Federal Reserve was moving promptly to head off a resurgence of infla-
tion. Bill rates likely would jump by nearly the increase of 50 basis
points in the federal funds rate, and private money market rates could
rise a bit more, reflecting widening risk premiums. Banks would likely
boost the prime rate by 1/2 percentage point. Bank stock prices, which
have benefited from wide spreads between short-term deposit rates and
rates on longer-term assets, likely would extend their recent declines.
Overall stock price indexes probably would drop as well, and the result-
ing capital losses on bonds and stocks could restrain inflows to long-
term mutual funds, at least temporarily. The dollar would strengthen on
foreign exchange markets.

Growth from April to June

","(12) The table above presents monetary growth rates over May
and June thought consistent with these three alternatives; projections
for the April-to-September period also are shown, assuming the money
market conditions of the three alternatives are maintained over the
summer. (More detailed data are presented in the table and charts on
the following pages.) Under all the alternatives, M2 would be just a
bit above its fourth-quarter level at midyear and would strengthen only
marginally further by September, thus staying noticeably below its 2 to
to show a contraction through June but little change by September under
all the alternatives, hence also remaining below its 1/2 to 4-1/2 per-
cent range.

","(13) Under alternative B, M2 is projected to increase at about
a 5-3/4 percent average rate over May and June, a considerable pickup
from recent months.6  Some of the strength in May, and to a lesser
extent in June, reflects reversals of previous temporary depressants
involving tax effects, the late-winter lull in mortgage refinancing
activity, and seasonal-adjustment distortions.7 Apart from effects
of these temporary factors, underlying M2 probably will exhibit a speed-
up over the two months, owing to an abatement of the more fundamental
influences that had boosted its velocity to a 5-3/4 percent growth rate
over the previous two quarters. Quarterly average growth of M2 for the
second quarter is projected at about a 1-1/2 percent rate, with
temporary factors having little net impact. Thus, with nominal GDP
expected to rise at about a 4-1/4 percent rate, M2 velocity would
increase at only about a 2-1/2 percent pace. If the money market condi-
tions of this alternative were maintained over the summer, M2 growth
would be expected to move up still nearer to that of nominal GDP in the
third quarter.
","(14) M3 under alternative B is seen as accelerating to about a
the pickup in M2, as managed liabilities in M3, including large time
deposits, should resume running off over the two months. Bank credit
expansion is expected to remain moderate, with loan growth quite weak,
and the balance sheets of thrift institutions are anticipated to con-
tinue to contract. While inflows of core deposits are projected to meet
most of the added funding needs of banks and S&Ls, banks are likely to
obtain some funding from abroad and from other nondeposit sources, in
part to avoid higher deposit insurance premiums. Looking further ahead,
moderate average growth of M3 during the third quarter would be expected
to accompany retention of the specifications of alternative B over that
","(15) Households and businesses are expected to stay cautious
in using credit in coming months. In the household sector, mortgage
refinancing activity is likely to remain brisk. Overall mortgage debt,
however, is expected to expand at about its first-quarter pace, as cash-
out refinancing activity continues to be limited and home purchases rise
only gradually. Growth of consumer credit is projected to remain
moderate, despite heavy promotion of credit cards with rebates and other
incentives. Given still-favorable conditions in longer-term markets
under alternative B, issuance of corporate bonds and stocks should
remain relatively heavy. With the shortfall of internal funds relative
to capital expenditures remaining small, businesses are likely to con-
tinue to use the proceeds of securities issuance to pay down higher-cost
bonds and bank loans. Treasury borrowing should pick up in coming
months to finance a widening deficit, with more issuance in the shorter
end of the market, reflecting the recent shift in debt management
policy. Domestic nonfinancial debt would be expected to move further
above the lower edge of its 4-1/2 to 8-1/2 percent monitoring range
through June.
","(16) The lower interest rates of alternative A would be ex-
pected to provide some added lift to growth of the monetary aggregates.
Banks and thrifts, while continuing to price their deposits unaggres-
sively, likely would not immediately match the downward movement in
market rates. Yields on money market mutual funds, likewise, would lag
the decline in market rates. The lower opportunity costs of deposits
and money funds relative to short-term market rates should provide a
small boost to the aggregates, even though attractive yields would
continue to induce heavy inflows into bond and stock mutual funds. M2
growth over May and June would come in at about a 6 percent rate, with
much of the additional strength resulting from its M1 component. M3
would expand at a 4-1/4 percent rate. Despite the more rapid growth,
both of the broad monetary aggregates would remain well below their
annual ranges in June. M2 growth is projected to post a 2-3/4 percent
pace from June to September, bringing the rate of expansion for the
April to September period to 4 percent. Even with the lower interest
rates and consequent economic stimulus of this alternative later in the
year, M2 would be unlikely to reach the lower end of its annual range by
the fourth quarter.
","(17) Under alternative C, the higher money market interest
rates and opportunity costs would restrain the monetary aggregates. The
restraint on the aggregates could be limited to the degree that capital
losses on bond and stock funds prompt investors to shift back into
deposits, but on balance the tighter monetary stance should act to slow
monetary growth. M2 would expand at only a 5-1/2 percent rate over May
and June, and M3 at a 3-3/4 percent pace. The moderate upward trajec-
tory of M2 expected under unchanged interest rates later in the year
would be trimmed, with growth from June to September likely at only a
range. Maintenance of the money market conditions of alternative C
probably would induce M3 to contract on the year.

tended level of 3 percent during the intermeeting period.1 In the
maintenance period spanning year-end, reserve needs were considerable,
reflecting seasonal movements in currency and required reserves as
well as an enlarged demand for excess reserves. To meet these needs,
the Desk arranged a number of rounds of term System repurchase agree-
ments and, as a result, federal funds continued to trade at around
","(2) Most other market interest rates declined 10 to 20 basis
points, and stock price indexes posted new records over the intermeet-
ing period. Market participants were encouraged by generally good
news on inflation; this information, along with a sense that the
severe weather and earthquake would make it more difficult in early
to postpone when an expected tightening of monetary policy would
occur. Still, the economy is seen as reasonably robust, and policy
firming is expected to commence within a few months to counteract a
potential buildup of inflation pressures.
","(3) The dollar's weighted-average foreign exchange value was
about unchanged on balance over the intermeeting period. The dollar
appreciated a little more than 1 percent relative to the mark and less
relative to other European currencies, against the background of
strong U.S. economic data and sluggish economic activity in continen-
tal Europe. Although the Bundesbank's stance in money markets was
unchanged, three-month rates in Germany declined 20 basis points,
while long-term rates were little changed. The dollar depreciated
about 1-1/2 percent against the yen in the context of renewed expres-
sions of U.S. concerns over bilateral trade issues with Japan.
Japanese short- and long-term interest rates rose 10 and 35 basis
points, respectively.
The Desk did not intervene.
","(4) The monetary data in this bluebook reflect annual bench-
mark adjustments and seasonal factor revisions. These data con-
firm that M2 rose 1.4 percent from 1992:Q4 to 1993:Q4, within its
downward-revised 1 to 5 percent annual range.3,4 M3 expanded
creases in both aggregates were not much different than in 1992, and
their velocities climbed considerably further, reflecting the evolving
pattern of financial intermediation: Investors diverted considerable
balances from deposits to long-term mutual funds, prompted by a still-
steep yield curve and capital gains in bond and stock markets; bor-
rowers concentrated their funds-raising in long-term markets to take
advantage of the low cost of capital, and thus relied relatively
little on bank credit. Moreover, thrift institution assets continued
to contract. Total domestic nonfinancial debt rose 4.9 percent on a
fourth-quarter-to-fourth-quarter basis, inside its 4 to 8 percent
monitoring range. Nonfederal debt growth firmed further, especially
in the second half of the year, apparently reflecting increased com-
fort with balance sheets and better prospects for employment and in-
come, but the increase in such debt still fell considerably short of
the rise in nominal spending by these sectors.
","(5) Growth of the broad monetary aggregates remained rela-
tively slow over December and January, though stronger than over 1993,
with expansion of both M2 and M3 around 2 percent at an annual
rate.5 M1 slowed to a 6 percent average rate over the two months.
In addition to a drop-off in demand deposit growth, the expansion of
M1 was depressed in January--by an estimated 5-1/2 percentage points--
as a large regional bank initiated a program to sweep balances from
some customers' NOW accounts; because such funds are swept into MMDAs,
M2 and M3 are not affected by the program. Recent data on mutual
funds are especially difficult to interpret because reported flows in
December are distorted by the effects of large year-end distributions.
Nonetheless, while flows into stock funds are estimated to have re-
mained quite strong, flows into bond funds over December and early
January seem to have been below the pace of most of last year in
apparent reaction to the backup in rates last fall. At the M3
level, growth was buoyed by large time deposits, which expanded at the
most rapid rate since last spring, perhaps in association with a
modest acceleration of bank credit, but larger runoffs in its other
components served to slow M3 on balance.7  In January, both
aggregates are within their provisional ranges for 1994.
","(6) Nonfederal credit growth seems to be maintaining the
somewhat brisker pace set this past autumn. The pickup remains most
evident among households. Consumer installment credit appears to have
expanded at a robust rate in December, and bank data for January
suggest continued strong growth. Net home mortgage borrowing likely
also continued apace: Although refinancing activity dropped sharply
as mortgage rates stabilized above their October lows, the strength in
sales of new and existing homes no doubt contributed to demand for
mortgage credit. In the business sector, credit demands may have
picked up a little. Business loans at banks are estimated to have
expanded appreciably on average over December and January,
accompanying indications of further easing of loan terms and standards
in the latest Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey. Gross issuance of
bonds by nonfinancial corporations over the past two months remained
considerably below the 1993 average, but much of the fall-off was
probably in refinancing activity. In the tax-exempt sector,
securities issuance rebounded strongly in December, but has dropped
off that pace this month. Reflecting swings in federal debt growth,
total domestic nonfinancial sector debt rose at a 7-1/2 percent rate
in December, but probably slowed this month and remained within its
provisional 4 to 8 percent range for 1994.

Long-Run Scenarios
","(7) The scenarios shown in this section are designed to
illustrate several issues related to the conduct of monetary policy
over the rest of this decade. The first set examines three alterna-
tive strategies for policy, each striking a different balance over the
intermediate run between progress toward price stability and progress
toward full employment. The baseline begins with the Greenbook pro-
jection for 1994 and 1995 and continues with a judgmental extension
out through 1999. The baseline strategy maintains a modest degree of
slack in resource utilization and thus makes a little further progress
against inflation. The tighter strategy makes more progress toward
the objective of price stability, while the easier policy moves the
economy to full employment fairly promptly and keeps it there. The
alternatives to the baseline were derived using staff econometric
models of the U.S. and foreign economies. Summary information about
these simulations is presented in the table on the next page and in
luding

remain on a moderately restrictive trajectory over the next few years,
with the structural deficit declining from 2-3/4 percent of potential
GDP in 1993 to 2 percent in 1994 and then holding at roughly 1-1/2
percent for the remainder of the projection period. Money growth is
assumed to return gradually to a more typical alignment with nominal
income growth: the forces disrupting this relationship ebb as the
yield curve returns to a more normal slope and portfolios become more
fully adjusted to the increased availability of mutual funds. 8
","(9) Under the baseline policy, the Committee holds the funds
rate at 3 percent into the summer before raising it over the next two
years. To maintain some slack in resource utilization, and thus to
keep inflation edging lower, short-term real interest rates need to
rise from their currently low levels only gradually in light of fiscal
consolidation at home and sluggish growth abroad. As foreign econo-
mies recover and fiscal consolidation comes to an end, the funds rate
rises to about 4-1/2 percent in nominal terms in 1996. Given the
inflation rate prevailing at that time, this level of the funds rate
translates to about 2 percent in real terms. In turn, this level of
the real funds rate and associated levels of long rates in real terms
are sufficient to keep inflation tilting down. By the end of the
period, inflation in the CPI excluding food and energy falls to about
shifts diminish.
","(10) The more rapid progress toward price stability under
the tighter policy involves an unemployment rate over the forecast
period that averages about 1/4 percentage point above that in the
baseline strategy. This additional slack is obtained by moving the
funds rate up more promptly than in the baseline--indeed, starting in
the current quarter. With real interest rates higher, the interest-
sensitive portion of domestic spending is damped; dollar appreciation
also checks aggregate demand and puts additional downward pressure on
prices. Inflation comes down to 1-1/2 percent by 1999 and is headed
still lower from there. If the anti-inflation resolve embodied in the
tighter policy were to reinforce the credibility of the Committee's
commitment to price stability, an even more rapid decline in inflation
might result.
","(11) The greater employment gains delivered by the easier
policy come at the expense of any further progress in reducing infla-
tion. To implement this strategy, the Committee is assumed to keep
the funds rate at 3 percent into early 1995. The dollar is lower than
under the baseline strategy, and part of the economic stimulus and of
the upward pressure on prices comes from the foreign sector. Given
the low level of short-term real interest rates, a 3 percent funds
rate probably is not sustainable, and the Committee eventually must
shift toward a more restrictive stance in order to prevent a pickup in
inflation--indeed, temporarily pushing the nominal funds rate above
that in the baseline.
","(12) The outcomes under these three strategies depend impor-
tantly on underlying judgments about the labor-market threshold for
the emergence of faster inflation and about the near-term strength of
aggregate demand. Charts 2 and 3 present scenarios based on alter-
native assumptions about these key elements of the macroeconomy. A
critical aspect in the design of each of these scenarios is the speci-
fication of the responses of monetary policy to these different macro-
economic circumstances. The responses shown are intended to be il-
lustrative of actions that might be taken by a policymaker who places
some weight on both inflation and unemployment in the intermediate
","(13) Chart 2 focuses on the implications of different levels
of the natural rate. As before, the solid lines present the baseline
scenario, which embodies a natural rate of around 6-1/2 percent. The
dashed lines present a scenario based on an assumed natural rate of
about 7 percent (just under 6-1/2 percent on the old basis). The lack
of much deceleration in wage inflation this past year may suggest that
the implications of this possibility are worth contemplating. In this
circumstance, the inflation rate currently would be under some upward
pressure, and the Committee is assumed to adopt a more restrictive
stance of policy as that pressure becomes more evident; relative to
the baseline, the funds rate is about 50 basis points higher by the
end of this year and 100 basis points higher by the end of 1995. Even
this tighter stance of policy is not sufficient to prevent a slight
pickup in inflation, given both an assumed lag in identification of
the higher natural rate and the lag in the response of the economy to
the change in policy. Nonetheless, the specified policy eventually
restores a downward tilt to inflation, albeit on a higher trajectory
than in the baseline. In contrast, if the natural rate is about
rent basis that some economists have asserted) then there is consider-
ably more slack in resource utilization than is assumed in the base-
line. In these circumstances, the Committee could maintain the funds
rate at 3 percent for longer and tighten by less. Even with lower
unemployment rates, it would still make more rapid progress toward
price stability, as illustrated by the dotted lines in Chart 2.
","(14) Finally, Chart 3 examines the implications of alterna-
tive assumptions about the strength of aggregate demand this year.
The dotted lines in Chart 3 depict a scenario in which growth of ag-
gregate demand is about 1 percentage point greater in 1994 than in the
baseline, while the dashed lines plot the symmetric case of weaker
aggregate demand. In the case of stronger aggregate demand, the Com-
mittee is assumed to begin moving the funds rate up sooner and by
considerably more this year than in the baseline, as incoming data
reveal the demand shift. Still, the unemployment rate falls fairly
rapidly--to below the natural rate until the tighter policy takes
hold--and inflation edges higher for a time. By contrast, in the case
of a shortfall in demand, the Committee is assumed to ease the stance
of policy for about a year. Nonetheless, the unemployment rate moves
up to about 7-1/4 percent and inflation slows rapidly. Eventually,
however, the lower level of interest rates supports sufficient growth
to bring the unemployment rate back down.
Long-Run Ranges
","(15) To aid the Committee in selecting its money and debt
growth ranges for 1994, presented below are the staff's projections
and the provisional ranges for 1994 that were selected by the Commit-
tee last July.9
","(16) The projections of money and credit are consistent with
the Greenbook forecast of the economy. In that forecast, growth of
nominal GDP in 1994 strengthens a touch from the pace of 1993 before
slowing some in 1995 to keep inflation pointed down, albeit modestly,
as the economy approaches its potential. As noted in the previous
section, real and nominal short-term interest rates rise beginning in
the second half of 1994. Long-term rates edge lower over the next few
quarters as economic activity decelerates and underlying inflation
remains relatively low. Long rates firm a bit subsequently along with
the upward movement of short-term rates.
","(17) With spending in the staff forecast expected to grow a
shade faster than in 1993 and impediments to borrowing and lending
considerably diminished, private credit growth over 1994 is projected
to remain around the somewhat elevated pace of the second half of
with capital outlays, as internal funds expand only sluggishly. While
financial conditions will continue to favor raising funds in capital
markets, the more willing lending posture of banks and the expanding
financing needs of those without access to open markets will boost
business loans at banks. Household borrowing should slow a little
from the brisk pace of late, in keeping with a cresting of housing
activity and less rapid growth in spending on durable goods. Mean-
while, borrowing by governments, both federal and municipal, will
moderate with the projected improvement in fiscal positions and sharp-
ly curtailed advance refundings of state and local debt. Overall debt
of domestic nonfinancial sectors is projected to grow 5-1/2 percent
this year, in line with nominal output. (See chart 4.)
","(18) M3 in 1994 should be boosted by stronger funding needs
of depository institutions. Although bank credit is expected to
continue to grow at the moderate 5 percent pace posted in 1993, the
contraction in thrift credit should cease. Moreover, banks are ex-
pected to rely less on non-M3 sources; with capital at high levels,
they are presumed to issue a smaller volume of bonds and equity, more
than offsetting further increases in FHLB advances. On balance, M3 is
projected to expand 1-1/2 percent in 1994, a percentage point faster
than in 1993.
","(19) The staff projects that M2 will grow 2 percent in 1994,
a bit faster than in 1993. M2 velocity is projected to rise by about
mutual funds, whose yields would remain well above those on deposits
and whose availability will be further enhanced by increased offerings
through banks. However, this rise in velocity would be the smallest
since 1991. Acting to boost M2 growth and slow velocity increases is
the expectation that households will show a little less appetite for
longer-term investments, especially bond and stock mutual funds. The
flattening of the yield curve and smaller capital gains may reduce
incentives to shift portfolios; greater emphasis by bank and securi-
ties regulators on disclosure of risks inherent in such instruments
might also be a factor.10  On the other hand, the drop-off in mort-
gage refinancing from the torrid pace of late 1993 will depress the
demand deposit component of M2 and limit the pickup in M2 growth this
year. In addition, the rise in short-term interest rates later this
year will restrain M2 growth, mainly through its effects on M1. M1 is
projected to slow appreciably, to 6-1/2 percent in 1994. The new
program to sweep balances from NOW accounts to MMDAs at a regional
bank will shave M1 growth by about 3/4 of a percentage point, but will
have no effect on M2. The velocity of M1 is projected to fall
only marginally in 1994, after three years of very large declines.
","(20) In 1995, debt growth is projected to grow at a pace
near that of 1994, exceeding somewhat the growth of income. The broad
money aggregates, however, strengthen a little further as intermedia-
tion patterns move closer to historic norms. Thus, despite the moder-
ation in nominal GDP in the staff forecast, M2 growth is projected to
pick up to 2-1/2 percent next year. Contributing to this pickup is
the expectation of a further reduction in the pace of household in-
vestment in competing instruments--especially bond and stock funds--as
the yield curve continues to flatten and portfolio allocations move
closer to desired alignments. Moreover, the drag on M2 in 1994 from
the slowdown in mortgage refinancing activity should not persist into
small degree of restraint on M2 but much more on its M1 component,
which is projected to grow only 2-1/2 percent in 1995. Faster growth
in M2 in 1995 is expected to show through to M3, which is projected to
pick up to 2 percent next year.
","(21) Two alternatives are shown below for ranges for the
broad monetary aggregates and debt for 1994. Even though the Commit-
tee has reduced the importance of these financial aggregates in its
conduct of policy and market participants accordingly attach less
significance to them, the selection of ranges still can convey useful
information to the public about the Committee's expectations for
growth in money and credit consistent with its outlook and intentions
for the economy and inflation. Alternative I consists of the pro-
visional ranges set by the Committee in July for 1994, which were
identical to those put in effect last summer for 1993. Alternative II
lowers the ranges for M2 and debt, centering them on the staff's pro-
Alternative Money and Debt Ranges for 1994
(Percent)
Alt. I
1993 (Provisional Memo: Staff
ranges ranges) Alt. II projection
","(22) In addition to being about centered on the staff's
projections for money and credit, alternative II might be selected as
a means of underscoring the Committee's commitment to containing and
reducing inflation. If, for example, a pickup in money growth were to
accompany a continued strong and potentially overheating economy, the
Committee might be better positioned to take and explain prompt ac-
tions under this alternative than under the higher provisional ranges.
Moreover, if the Committee tightened reserve conditions to forestall a
potential strengthening of inflation pressures or to bring inflation
down more rapidly--as in the tighter scenario above--the alternative
II ranges would allow more scope for the lower money growth that might
accompany moderate nominal GDP expansion with higher interest rates
than in the staff forecast. This alternative might also be favored if
it were thought that further large downward shifts in M2 demand are
still in prospect, posing a significant risk that M2 in 1994 could
come in below the lower end of its provisional range, even under the
staff economic forecast.
","(23) The staff's M2 forecast is in the lower half of the
alternative I range. This range allows for a greater move toward more
normal velocity behavior than the staff has assumed, should, for
example, public appetites for mutual funds fall off more rapidly than
expected. Even absent such a shift, the alternative I ranges would
not necessarily present problems should the Committee substantially
firm reserve conditions. The responsiveness of M2 to movements in
short-term rates has been muted in recent years, and growth of this
aggregate could still exceed 1 percent if short-term rates rose sig-
nificantly. In part this is because rising short-term rates are like-
ly to be accompanied by some declines in bond and possibly stock
prices, damping shifts to mutual funds from M2 and supporting the
aggregate's growth. Moreover, the M2 ranges in alternative I would be
consistent with the attainment of price stability in the context of a
return over time to a flat trend in M2 velocity, as the staff assumed
in constructing the money growth rates for the long-run strategies.
With flat velocity, M2 growth of about 3 percent--the midpoint of
alternative I--would accompany nominal income growth of the same
magnitude consistent with the staff's estimate of growth in potential
output, given the upward bias in measured inflation rates.
Short-Run Policy Alternatives
","(24) Three policy alternatives are presented below for Com-
mittee consideration. Alternative B involves a continuation of feder-
al funds trading around 3 percent and of adjustment plus seasonal
borrowing averaging initially about $50 million.12  Under alterna-
tive C, the federal funds rate would increase to around 3-1/2 percent
in association with a rise in the borrowing allowance to $75 million.
Alternative A embodies a downward adjustment of the federal funds rate
to 2-1/2 percent and of the borrowing allowance to $25 million.
","(25) Market participants now anticipate continuation of the
money market conditions implied by alternative B over the near term,
and FOMC choice of this alternative would not engender any immediate
reaction in security markets. Investors generally expect the Federal
Reserve to put off any policy tightening for a time, given
uncertainties about the extent of moderation in economic activity and
about developing price trends in early 1994--uncertainties that have
been heightened by the earthquake and severe weather. Nevertheless,
most anticipate a tightening within a few months as incoming data
suggest only a limited slowing in economic growth and a cessation of
disinflation. As the intermeeting period progresses, economic data
along the lines of the staff forecast might put modest upward pressure
on short-term interest rates as the time of expected tightening
approaches, but would induce little systematic movement in longer-term
rates. The exchange value of the dollar also is likely to trade in a
relatively narrow range around current levels.
","(26) The firming in the stance of policy under alternative C
would come sooner than now built into market quotes and would be re-
flected in increases in short-term rates nearly equal to the 50 basis
point hike in the federal funds rate. The action might help to
resolve any questions about whether the Federal Reserve would take
steps to contain price pressures in advance of actual increases in
inflation. If so, forward interest rates further out the yield curve
might eventually even adjust down slightly, tempering the ultimate
rise in longer-term rates. The exchange value of the dollar would
tend to move higher with the more attractive real returns on U.S.
versus foreign financial assets.
","(27) The easing of policy under alternative A would come as
more of a surprise to market participants. Some could interpret the
action as a response by Federal Reserve policymakers to weaker inter-
nal economic forecasts than the market consensus, perhaps owing to
concerns about upcoming fiscal drag. But others would be led to
question the Federal Reserve's anti-inflationary resolve. In those
circumstances, an adverse impact on inflation expectations could well
result, preventing much of a decline in bond yields. Even the fall in
short-term rates could be muted by the view that the policy ease would
soon have to be reversed to forestall excessive price pressures. The
dollar's exchange value could be lowered by both the reduced U.S.
short-term rates and heightened concerns about U.S. inflation.
","(28) Growth of the monetary aggregates projected under all
three policy alternatives from January to June is shown in the table
below. (More detailed data are presented in the table and charts on
the following pages.) Under all the alternatives, M2 growth is ex-
pected to be in the neighborhood of 2 percent and M3 growth a little
over 1 percent. Consequently, these aggregates would be positioned at
midyear well within their provisional ranges, with M2 in its lower
portion and M3 somewhat below its midpoint. As usual, only modest
growth differentials are envisioned across the three alternatives,
mirroring the low sensitivity to short-term rates of M2 and M3 so far
in the 1990s.
Alt. A Alt. B Alt. C
Growth from January
to June
Growth from 1993:Q4

","(29) M2 growth likely will be held down under alternative B
by a reversal of the previous bulge attributable to mortgage refinanc-
ing activity, which had boosted average M2 growth by an estimated 1
percentage point during the October through December months, before
becoming a minor drag in January. Over the February-to-June period,
falling prepayments of mortgage-backed securities are projected to
deduct 1 to 2 percentage points from M2 growth.13 Nevertheless, the
underlying trend of M2 is anticipated to strengthen enough to leave
actual M2 growth at a 2 percent rate from January to June. Inflows to
bond and stock mutual funds through June should be somewhat weaker
than the pace of last year, as a result of the flatter yield curve and
likely smaller capital gains. 14  In addition, previous declines in
offering rates on liquid deposits evidently have brought them into
full alignment with money market rates, so this drag on M2 expansion

may well have finally played itself out. Even so, the underlying
trend of M2 growth is likely to remain below that of nominal spending,
as some of the anomalous weakness relative to historical patterns that
surfaced in the 1990s is assumed to persist.
","(30) M3 is projected to expand at a 1-1/4 percent rate from
January to June under alternative B. The growth of debt of domestic
nonfederal sectors from December to June is projected at a 5-1/4 per-
cent rate, sustaining the faster growth rate recorded during the
fourth quarter of last year. The overall debt aggregate is foreseen
as expanding at a 5-1/2 percent rate through midyear, leaving this
measure somewhat below the midpoint of its provisional monitoring

ments in the economy and financial markets.
OPERATIONAL PARAGRAPH
In the implementation of policy for the immediate
future, the Committee seeks to DECREASE SOMEWHAT/main-
tain/INCREASE SOMEWHAT the existing degree of pressure
on reserve positions. In the context of the Commit-
tee's long-run objectives for price stability and sus-
tainable economic growth, and giving careful considera-
tion to economic, financial, and monetary developments,
slightly (SOMEWHAT) greater reserve restraint (WOULD/
MIGHT) or slightly (SOMEWHAT) lesser reserve restraint
(WOULD) might be acceptable in the intermeeting period.
The contemplated reserve conditions are expected to be
consistent with moderate (MODEST) growth in M2 and M3
over THE FIRST HALF OF 1994 coming months.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1994-09-27,1994-09-27,"(1) The System tightened the stance of monetary policy on
August 16 through Board approval of an increase in the discount rate
of 1/2 percentage point, to 4 percent, and a decision by the Committee
to allow the entire increase in the discount rate to show through to
interest rates in reserve markets. The latter was implemented by
leaving the borrowing assumption unchanged at $450 million.
Short-term rates, which had incorporated an anticipation of a somewhat
less aggressive policy move, backed up on the announcement of these
actions that day. Commercial banks increased their prime rates 1/2
percentage point, to 7-3/4 percent, maintaining the 300 basis point
spread over the federal funds rate that has prevailed since late 1992.
However, expectations of the level of short-term rates likely to pre-
vail beyond the next few months were revised down in response to the
accompanying announcement suggesting that the Federal Reserve would
take no further action for a time, and perhaps also to a sense that
less tightening might ultimately be required following the unexpect-
edly aggressive action. This shift in expectations was reflected in
federal funds futures rates after October, shown in the upper left
panel of Chart 1, and in declines in note and bond yields.
","(2) Short-term rates remained steady in the weeks after the
policy move. In the last few weeks, however, these rates have moved
up appreciably. Markets built back in a steeper trajectory of near-
term Federal Reserve tightening as incoming economic data were seen as
pointing to a greater risk of inflation. The initial declines in
long-term rates were rolled back within a few days of the System
action, and these rates have risen noticeably further in response to
the recent data. On balance over the intermeeting period, long-term
rates have moved up about 20 to 40 basis points. Equity markets also
declined in recent days, but advanced on net over the period.
","(3) With inflation concerns heightened, rising interest
rates in the latter part of the period did not buoy the dollar, which
declined about 1-3/4 percent, on balance. Contributing to the dol-
lar's weakness were signs of unexpected strength in the German economy
and associated increases in German interest rates: Short-term rates
moved only slightly higher, but long-term rates rose 35 basis points.
In Japan, incoming data pointed to a subdued recovery, and short- and
long-term rates showed little change. In Canada, market concerns over
a possible Quebec secession faded in the wake of the weaker-than-
expected showing of support for the Parti Quebecois in provincial
elections. Consequently, the Canadian currency rose 2-1/2 percent
against the U.S. dollar, while Canadian short- and long-term interest
rates declined 50 and 10 basis points, respectively.
","(4) The monetary aggregates declined in August and data for
early September suggest a leveling off this month, leaving M2 and M3 a
little above the lower bounds of their long-term ranges. On balance,
the aggregates have been weaker than anticipated at the time of the
last meeting, even after allowing for the effects of the recent tight-
ening of monetary policy. Weakness in August was concentrated in the
liquid components. Demand deposits, continuing to be depressed by
declines in mortgage refinancing, contracted in August, following two
months of surprising strength. Other checkable deposits and savings
deposits also ran off, reflecting the substantial gap between rates on
these and competing instruments that has opened up since the System
began to tighten in February. Some of the balances in the latter
accounts apparently have been shifted into small time deposits, which
accelerated in August. Rates on time deposits, although reacting more
slowly than usual to increases in market rates, have risen somewhat in
recent weeks, whereas returns on liquid deposits have barely budged
this year. In light of the sluggish behavior of deposit rates, the
overall weakness in M2 is roughly in line with historical rela-
tionships embodied in money demand models, given the staff forecast of
spending in the current quarter. The relative attractiveness of mar-
ket investments can be seen in the volume of noncompetitive tenders in
Treasury auctions, which was exceptionally heavy in August. Flows
into stock mutual funds continued to be strong, but outflows from bond
funds persisted; the total of the two was well below the pace of 1992
and 1993, suggesting, at most, modest net shifts between M2 and
capital market mutual funds.4  Institution-only money funds dropped
sharply in response to the rise in market yields, and as a consequence
M3 also was weak last month. The broader aggregate was buoyed by
brisk issuance of large time deposits, as banks continued to rely on
managed liabilities to fund credit growth. As in recent months,
however, banks continued to make heavy use of sources outside the
monetary aggregates, particularly borrowings from foreign offices.
","(5) Bank credit slowed in August, although loan growth re-
mained strong. Business loans expanded at an annual rate of almost 10
percent. Anecdotal evidence of further easing in the standards and
terms for business loans continued to accumulate. In recent months,
bank lending to businesses has been boosted by rising external financ-
ing needs and growing merger and acquisition activity, as well as by
shifts away from capital market financing. Consumer loan growth at
banks remained in double digits in August, suggesting that consumer
credit continued to expand briskly. Nonetheless, growth of overall
debt of nonfinancial sectors slowed in recent months, held down by
retirements of state and local obligations from the proceeds of ear-
lier advance refundings. Moreover, federal borrowing has moderated a
bit from earlier in the year on a seasonally adjusted basis. On net,
nonfinancial debt is estimated to have expanded in recent months at
less than a 5 percent annual rate, down from earlier this year,
keeping it well in the lower half of its 4 to 8 percent monitoring

Monetary Policy Alternatives
","(6) Three monetary policy alternatives are presented below
for consideration by the Committee. Under alternative B, the federal
funds rate would continue to trade around 4-3/4 percent, consistent
with retaining an allowance of $475 million for adjustment plus sea-
sonal borrowing.5 Alternative C envisages raising the federal
funds rate 1/4 percentage point, to 5 percent, in conjunction with an
increase in the borrowing allowance to $500 million. Under alterna-
tive D, the federal funds rate would be moved up to 5-1/4 percent,
achieved either by an increase in the initial borrowing allowance to
$525 million or by an unchanged borrowing allowance and a hike in the
discount rate to 4-1/2 percent.
","(7) In the Greenbook forecast, the policy restraint now in
place is not viewed as adequate to slow spending sufficiently to fore-
stall a buildup of inflation pressures, given the apparent underlying
strength of aggregate demand and the likely absence of any margin of
economic slack. The policy firming built into the staff forecast
would push the federal funds rate up around one percentage point be-
fore next spring. A tightening of about this magnitude over the next
few quarters seems to be built into the structure of market interest
rates; in contrast to the staff assumption, that structure also can be
read as implying further increases subsequently. The firming assumed
by the staff keeps short- and longer-term real interest rates high
enough to rein in output to the neighborhood of potential; core infla-
tion picks up a bit late this year, but edges down over 1995 to a rate
slightly above its recent pace.
","(8) Alternative B, which would retain current reserve condi-
tions, is not inconsistent with the staff assumption of policy firm-
ing, provided that firming resumes some time soon. Inaction might be
deemed particularly appropriate if the Committee believed that strains
on capacity could be less pressing than in the staff forecast, either
because potential output might be greater than assumed by the staff or
because more restraint on spending could be in the pipeline in view of
the substantial increases in interest rates over the past year. More-
over, slow growth of a broad array of monetary and credit aggregates
might be seen as suggesting that financial conditions are not con-
ducive to a pickup in underlying inflation. A pause would allow the
Committee to accumulate more evidence on these questions. Such a
wait-and-see posture would accord with the tone of the press statement
announcing the policy action taken at the August meeting.
","(9) Market opinions on what the Committee might do at this
meeting are split. Some analysts have interpreted the recent economic
news as implying sufficiently greater inflation potential to overcome
any presumption of a policy pause; they expect a firming action, per-
haps of 50 basis points. Others still anticipate a hiatus in the
process of policy tightening; however, even many of those in the
latter camp seem to expect some action no later than the November
meeting. While few actually foresee a 25 basis point increase, the
composite effect of these different views has produced a federal funds
futures rate for October that is 25 basis points above the current
funds rate. Nonetheless, maintenance of existing reserve conditions
under alternative B might elicit little reaction in rates beyond the
very shortest maturities because market participants would assume that
tightening had simply been postponed. In these circumstances, longer-
term instruments might trade in their current ranges at least for a
time, although security prices probably will remain quite sensitive to
news bearing on inflation pressures as market participants attempt to
gauge the extent of future policy restraint. In that regard, under
the staff forecast, economic releases over the next few months would
suggest that inflation is on a slightly higher track and that final
demand remains fairly vigorous. Absent unanticipated changes in
policy abroad, the foreign exchange value of the dollar most likely
would remain around its current level, though it could come under some
downward pressure if inflation expectations began to deteriorate
","(10) A tightening in reserve conditions at this meeting
might be favored if the Committee saw a significant risk that output
is in the process of surpassing its long-run potential. Waiting in
these circumstances might risk the development of a degree of infla-
tion momentum--partly through expectations channels--that could make
it more difficult to contain inflation at recent rates, much less
achieve the long-run goal of price stability. The 50 basis point
firming of alternative D is the most likely of the three policy
options to keep the Federal Reserve ""ahead of the curve"" of inflation
pressures and consequently to limit the extent to which policy might
later need to tighten. If the Committee were uncertain about how much
tightening would be required but wanted to respond to recent data, the
more modest 25 basis point move of alternative C might be considered
","(11) The 25 basis point tightening of alternative C is con-
sistent with the current structure of market rates, and this policy
action might well trigger only muted interest rate reactions. How-
ever, since most market participants expect either no action or a 50
basis point tightening, alternative C could raise questions about
System intentions, potentially unsettling markets. A considerable
portion of the 50 basis point increase in the federal funds rate under
alternative D would pass through to other short-term rates. In light
of recent experience and the split in market expectations, it's dif-
ficult to say what immediate impact this alternative would have on
interest rates in capital markets. Eventually, assuming economic and
price data consistent with the staff forecast, intermediate-term
yields could tend to work their way a bit higher, as market partici-
pants raised their expected path for Federal Reserve tightening in
this phase of the business cycle. But the System's evident willing-
ness to deal with inflation pressures through a 50 basis point move
should alleviate longer-run concerns in this regard, limiting any
increases in bond yields. With the rise in real interest rates, the
dollar would likely appreciate somewhat on exchange markets.
","(12) Under all three alternatives outlined above, the debt
of the domestic nonfinancial sectors should expand at about a 5 per-
cent rate over the balance of the year, placing the annual growth of
this aggregate also at 5 percent, in the lower half of its 4 to 8
percent monitoring range. With capital spending by nonfinancial
corporations anticipated to outpace their internally generated funds
by a widening margin and merger activity continuing at its more ele-
vated pace, business borrowing could strengthen some over the balance
of the year. Commercial banks are anticipated to remain aggressive
lenders to this sector, including for merger-related activity. In the
household sector, consumer credit growth is expected to remain near a
double-digit rate even as borrowing costs continue to edge up, sup-
porting solid expansion of consumer durables spending. Despite some-
what faster expansion of federal debt late in 1994, growth for the
year--projected at 5-1/2 percent--would be the slowest in fifteen
","(13) Growth of the monetary aggregates over the September-
to-December period is presented below for alternatives B and D. Any
action taken this late in the year is unlikely to have much of an
impact on the annual growth rates of the aggregates for 1994, shown in
the lower panel of the table. For illustrative purposes, the path
under alternative B was derived assuming that the funds rate would
hold at its current level for the remainder of the year. The path for
the aggregates under alternative D assumes that the funds rate moves
up to 5-1/4 percent at this meeting and stays there for the balance of
the year. Thus, neither alternative matches the assumption in the
Greenbook forecast. (The response of the aggregates under alternative
C would lie midway between the two alternatives.)

","(14) Over the September-to-December period, M2 would expand
at a 1-1/2 percent rate under alternative B. The staff has assumed
that deposit rates will continue to adjust sluggishly to market rates.

In addition, declines in mortgage prepayments will continue to depress
demand deposits. These factors will place a particular drag on liquid
accounts, and M1 will expand at only a 2-1/2 percent rate over the
period.6 While the growth of small time deposits should remain
robust, not all the funds lost from liquid deposits will remain in M2.
Direct purchases of securities, including noncompetitive tenders at
Treasury auctions, are anticipated to continue at a healthy clip. As
a result, M2 velocity is expected to continue increasing rapidly in
the fourth quarter--at a rate near 5 percent. M3 growth should pick
up a bit over the remainder of 1994, reflecting somewhat reduced
reliance of banks on nondeposit sources of funding.
","(15) Under alternative D, M2 would grow at a 1/2 percent
rate over the September-to-December period. The sluggish adjustment
of deposit rates to the rise in market rates would further widen
opportunity costs, depressing M1 and savings deposits even more.
However, should policy firming be accompanied by some price declines
in capital markets, outflows from bond mutual funds could intensify,
some of the outflows might find their way into deposits and money
market mutual funds, partly offsetting the effects on M2 of the higher
cost of holding deposits. M3 would grow at a 3/4 percent rate over
the remaining months of the year, pulled down by a runoff of institu-
tion-only money funds as their yields lag behind the increase in money
market rates that would be in train under alternative D.

1994-11-15,1994-11-15,"(1) The System left the intended degree of reserve pressure
unchanged during the period since the FOMC meeting on September 27.
Apart from some tightness in the reserves market around the end of the
third quarter, federal funds traded close to their expected level of
The allowance for adjustment and seasonal borrowing was reduced $250
million in six steps during the intermeeting period to $225 million in
view of the typical autumn decline in the demand for seasonal credit
at the discount window. Actual borrowing averaged close to its
allowance over the period.
","(2) Other interest rates rose appreciably over the intermeet-
ing period in response to economic data generally indicating sustained
momentum in aggregate demand, high levels of output relative to poten-
tial, and persistent signs of price pressures at early stages of pro-
duction. In light of these developments, market participants have
revised upward their expectations of monetary tightening as the expan-
sion proceeds. As to their near-term outlook, quotes on federal funds
futures, shown in the upper left-hand panel of Chart 1, suggest that
markets now incorporate noticeably higher federal funds rates than in
late September. Most short- and long-term term rates jumped 1/4
to 1/2 percentage point, bringing rates on thirty-year Treasuries
above 8 percent and yields on fixed-rate mortgages above 9 percent for
the first time since early 1992. The largest advances were registered
at the two- to five-year maturities, a pattern that was reflected in a
bulge in forward rates over the next few years; for example, the one-
year forward rate at the three-year mark increased 60 basis points
while the one-year forward rate ten years out rose only 35 basis
points. This pattern suggests that some of the increase in market
yields represents higher real interest rates, reflecting market par-
ticipants' presumption that the unanticipated strength in spending
implies that monetary policy will need to lean harder against building
inflationary pressures than previously thought. Some of the run-up in
nominal rates also likely owed to increased inflation expectations,
though the evidence on this is mixed. Available measures of inflation
expectations based on surveys of households and business forecasters
have suggested no recent upward trend, and the price of gold has
fallen slightly. However, broad commodity price indexes have con-
tinued to move up on balance over the last several weeks, and the
foreign exchange value of the dollar came under renewed downward pres-
sure during the intermeeting period despite considerable increases in
nominal interest rates.
","(3) After weakening over much of the period, the dollar's
exchange value recovered somewhat in November to end the period down,
on balance, 1 percent against the mark, 1/2 percent against the yen,
and 1/2 percent on a weighted-average basis. Although the dollar's
soft tone earlier appeared mostly to reflect the market's perception
of heightened inflation risks in the United States, some of the dol-
lar's weakness against the mark may have stemmed from a lessening of
political uncertainty in Germany with the Kohl coalition's reelection.
Short-term interest rates rose 15 basis points and long-term rates
edged lower in Germany; in Japan, short-term rates were about
unchanged while long-term rates rose 20 basis points. When the dollar
touched lows of DM1.4907 and Y96.12 on November 2, the Desk began to
intervene to buy dollars. On that day and the next, U.S. monetary
authorities purchased $1.3 billion against yen and an equal amount
against marks. That intervention seemed to support the dollar, per-
haps in part by reinforcing market expectations of an imminent
tightening of monetary policy. (Federal funds futures rates jumped a
few basis points during the intervention.) The dollar seemed to
receive a further boost from the U.S. election results and the release
of the PPI for October.
","(4) Ml and M2 remained weak in October, mostly reflecting the
increase in market interest rates resulting from the tightening of
monetary policy this year. M2 contracted at a 1 percent annual rate
last month after falling in the previous two months and was at the
lower bound of its 1 to 5 percent annual range. Its Ml component
dropped at a 3-1/2 percent rate. Demand deposits have been depressed
by reduced compensating balance requirements, as earnings credit rates
have risen in response to climbing market rates, and by declines in
deposit balances associated with the plunge in mortgage refinancing
activity. Interest rates on other checkable and savings deposits,
including MMDAs, have responded sluggishly, and the resulting sharp
increase in the opportunity cost of these assets has apparently
prompted some depositors to shift funds into small time deposits and
money fund shares, where yields have risen more briskly.2  Noncom-
; through October, $2.2 billion
(Footnote continues on next page)
petitive tenders for Treasury securities have strengthened during the
year, indicating the attractiveness of direct holdings of open market
instruments relative to M2 assets. Nonetheless, even after taking
into account opportunity costs, the extent of the recent weakness in
M2 has been surprising, especially in view of a sharp drop-off of net
inflows into bond and stock mutual funds in recent weeks and the
persistent strength in spending indicators. 3
","(5) M3, by contrast, was a bit stronger than was expected at
the time of the last FOMC meeting. This aggregate increased at a
fast clip to finance strong growth of loans and to replace a runoff in
nondeposit sources, which had been expanding rapidly earlier in the
year; banks also reduced their holdings of securities to fund loan
","(6) Both nonfederal sector debt and total domestic nonfinan-
cial sector debt appear to have continued to expand at only a moderate
pace over the summer months and into October, despite continued easing
of credit availability at banks. Through September, total debt
increased at about a 5 percent rate from the fourth quarter of 1993,
leaving it in the lower half of its 4 to 8 percent monitoring range.
(Footnote continued from previous page)
of balances are estimated to have been shifted out of OCDs by this
program. Partly in association with the contraction in transaction
deposits, total reserves dropped at a 6-1/4 percent annual rate in
October. Growth of currency, however, rebounded from the more
moderate rates of August and September, boosting the expansion of the
monetary base to a 6-1/2 percent rate.
With long-term rates continuing to back up, bond issuance by corpora-
tions remained near the depressed third-quarter pace in October.
However, business borrowing from banks was robust last month and
commercial paper borrowing accelerated, partly to finance impending
mergers. Issuance of bonds by state and local governments also was
damped by higher interest rates, and outstanding tax-exempt debt is
estimated to have declined as a result of heavy retirements. In the
household sector, data from banks for October indicate that consumer
borrowing was again quite rapid; however, the limited information
available for home mortgage borrowing suggests a moderate pace of
activity. On the supply side of the credit markets, the most recent
survey of bank loan officers revealed a further easing of terms and
standards on business loans and increased willingness to extend credit
to consumers. In the open markets, quality spreads on lower-rated
corporate bonds and commercial paper have remained quite narrow even
as the general level of rates has backed up.

Policy Alternatives
","(7) Two monetary policy alternatives for Committee considera-
tion are presented formally below. Alternative B would keep the
intended federal funds rate unchanged at 4-3/4 percent, in association
with retaining an allowance of $225 million for adjustment plus sea-
sonal borrowing at the discount window.4  Alternative C embodies a
accomplished either by an equal rise in the discount rate to 4-1/2
percent with the borrowing allowance kept at $225 million or by an
increase in the borrowing allowance to $275 million at the current
discount rate of 4 percent. A still larger increase in the federal
funds rate than envisioned under alternative C is also discussed.
","(8) The staff economic forecast assumes that a relatively
steep upward trajectory for the federal funds rate over coming months
will be necessary to restrain inflation next year. The Committee is
assumed to raise the federal funds rate 150 basis points by the spring
of next year and to keep it at that 6-1/4 percent level through most
of 1995. In conjunction with the earlier policy tightenings, this
path is seen as engendering financial conditions sufficiently restric-
tive to hold the growth of aggregate demand below that of potential
real GDP over next year and into 1996. The resulting return of the
unemployment rate to a level above its estimated natural rate of 6
percent or so will tend to reverse an incipient acceleration of infla-
tion and thereby keep any near-term inflationary uptick from becoming
embedded in the expectations that enter into wage- and price-setting
decisions. Market participants appear to have a trajectory for the
federal funds rate roughly similar to the staff's assumption built
into short-term spot rates and futures quotes through next spring. In
contrast to the staff assumption, however, rates further out the term
structure can be read as suggesting expectations of additional tight-
","(9) Choice of the unchanged policy of alternative B might be
based on the judgments that most of the effects of previous increases
in interest rates are still in the pipeline, that convincing signs of
higher inflation have not yet appeared, and that under these circum-
stances the Committee can await evidence indicating whether the
effects of previous monetary tightening will be sufficient to restrain
spending adequately. The weakness in the monetary aggregates and
moderate expansion of overall measures of credit may be seen as
offering support for the view that financial conditions are not con-
ducive to a sustained pickup in inflation. Indeed, even without
another tightening move, M2 seems likely to come in just below the
come in at only 2 percent.
","(10) Market expectations are for substantial increases in the
funds rate over the balance of the year. Opinions reportedly have
coalesced around either increases of 50 basis points at both the
November and December FOMC meetings, or a 75 basis point increase at
the November meeting, which would reduce the odds of a further policy
tightening this year. Thus, the absence of a tightening move at this
meeting would catch market participants off guard. Heightened con-
cerns that the Federal Reserve would not move sufficiently to contain
inflation would generate a further depreciation of the foreign
exchange value of the dollar, and probably induce a significant
selloff in note and bond markets. Some decrease in short-term inter-
est rates might accompany the decision not to adjust policy at this
meeting, although a sense that tightening action could be postponed
only for a short time would limit the decline.
","(11) The 50 basis point rise in the funds rate under alterna-
tive C could be favored on the grounds that the incoming data on
economic activity again have been stronger than expected. With the
economy perhaps overshooting its potential rather than settling into a
""soft landing,"" the risks of an associated future pickup in inflation
pressures would seem to have increased. A 1/2 point move in the
federal funds rate, perhaps accompanied by an equal increment to the
discount rate, could be seen as keeping pace with the need for policy
firming in a deliberate manner consistent with the size and frequency
of recent policy actions. The resulting real federal funds rate would
be a bit above its long-run average, but restraint of at least this
magnitude might be appropriate in light of the current pressure on
capacity and the stimulative effects of the drop in the dollar and the
easing of terms and standards of bank lending.
","(12) With market participants generally appearing to have
built in a move of at least this size, interest rates could exhibit
little initial reaction to the implementation of alternative C. The
receipt of information on output and price developments over the
intermeeting period along the lines of the relatively robust Greenbook
forecast might reinforce the market's perception that additional
System tightening is required, and interest rates could edge higher
later in the period. The foreign exchange value of the dollar could
remain around recent trading levels if nominal interest rates move
sufficiently higher to offset the effects of a heightened sense of
potential inflationary pressures.
","(13) The Committee might wish to consider an even more sub-
stantial tightening of reserve market conditions--for example, on the
order of 75 basis points. This step could be judged as more suited to
the strength of the emerging threat that the economy may be overshoot-
ing its potential, setting in motion a gradual self-reinforcing pro-
cess of increasing inflation. Under these circumstances, a more
decisive move toward restraint would be needed to avoid an upward
ratcheting of inflation. Market sentiment has deteriorated during the
hiatus in policy tightening, judging by the rise in bond yields and
weakness in the exchange value of the dollar. By more clearly notch-
ing up monetary policy to a firmer posture, a larger step might better
assure market participants that the Federal Reserve was acting force-
fully enough to head off future inflation and might forestall the
perceived need on the part of the market participants for another
tightening move this year. If so, the action could spur a near-term
rally in bond markets and strengthen the dollar. Some increases in
very short-term market interest rates would likely result, of course,
from the somewhat larger-than-expected rise in the funds rate, and
banks could immediately raise their prime rate by a comparable amount.
","(14) With regard to credit flows over coming months, the
staff sees continued moderate expansion and perhaps some slowing in
the pace at which bank lending terms are being eased. The debt of
domestic nonfinancial sectors is expected to grow during the fourth
quarter at near the same 5 percent pace averaged over the first three
quarters of the year. In the first quarter of next year, overall debt
is projected to edge up to a 5-1/4 percent rate of growth, owing to a
step-up in federal borrowing. Nonfederal debt growth is likely to
about maintain its pace of earlier this year, remaining somewhat below
the projected growth of nominal GDP. Nonfederal debt growth will
probably continue to be led by the household sector, although expan-
sion of home mortgage and consumer debt is likely to edge lower over
the next two quarters. In the corporate sector, by contrast, some
pickup in credit market borrowing may be in the offing, reflecting a
further widening in the financing gap as spending for fixed capital
and inventories increases relative to internal sources of funds. The
financing mix should remain heavily weighted toward bank loans and
short-term paper, with bond issuance staying depressed. Anecdotal
reports of recent resistance by banks to pressures for further reduc-
tions in lending spreads, along with concerns about credit quality
expressed by regulators, suggest that credit terms and standards may
not be easing quite so rapidly over coming months.
","(15) Forecasted growth rates of the monetary aggregates from
October to March and from the fourth quarter of this year through
March under both policy alternatives are shown below.5  (More
detailed data appear on the table and charts on the following pages.)
Under alternative B, offering rates through the first quarter would
continue to adjust upward in the face of steady money market rates.
As a result, retail deposit inflows are projected to strengthen
gradually, yielding growth rates for M2 of 1 percent over the October
to March interval and 1-1/2 percent from the fourth quarter of 1994 to
March. The resumption of quarterly average growth, at a 1 percent
rate in the first quarter, combined with a projected slowing of
nominal GDP, would be associated with a reduced growth rate of 4-3/4
percent of M2 velocity, down from a projected increase of 7-1/4 per-
cent in the fourth quarter. M1 is projected to decline at a 1 percent
rate from October to March under alternative B, as currency flows
abroad remain robust but demand and other checkable deposits continue
to decline. The staff does not expect banks to continue to run
off securities at the recent pace, so that the growth of bank credit
should pick up. Rapid issuance of large time deposits will continue
to fill some of the gap left by still-sluggish retail deposits, and
thus M3 is projected to outpace M2 from October to March, likely
expanding at a 2-1/2 percent rate under alternative B.

1999-03-30,1999-03-30,"(1) The Committee's decision at the February meeting to leave the intended federal
funds rate unchanged was expected by market participants and elicited little response.1 However,
interest rates on Treasury securities moved up significantly in the first half of the intermeeting
period, reflecting incoming data that suggested continued strong momentum in aggregate
spending and a perception, arising from market interpretations of the Chairman's Humphrey
Hawkins testimony, that the FOMC saw its next action as more likely to be a tightening than an
easing (Chart 1). Favorable inflation news later in the period, along with statements by policy-
makers conveying a sense that risks were more balanced, led to a reversal of some of the rise in
market yields. On net since the February meeting, interest rates on Treasury bills have changed
little, but intermediate- and long-term Treasury yields have backed up 30 to 50 basis points. A
substantial portion of the increase in nominal yields has probably reflected higher real interest
rates, at least judging from the upward movement in rates on inflation-indexed debt and the large
increase of intermediate-term forward rates relative to those further out the forward curve. This
backup in real Treasury yields likely owed in part to an unwinding of the earlier flight to safety
and liquidity, but, more fundamentally, market participants may now believe that a higher path of
real short-term rates over the next few years will be needed for the Federal Reserve to keep
inflation damped. Nonetheless, some of the increase in nominal yields apparently was also
accounted for by a rise in inflation expectations, perhaps partly in reaction to the recent increase
in oil prices. More favorable perceptions of and appetites for risk in private securities markets
have narrowed spreads on corporate bonds vis-a-vis Treasuries, but they remain well above the
unusually thin levels prevailing in the first half of 1998 (Chart 2). Indexes of equity prices have
been mixed: The Dow Jones and S&P 500 posted net gains, but lower earnings expectations,
especially for technology companies, led to a drop in the NASDAQ and the Russell 2000 index
of small-cap firms. Bank share prices have moved up sharply, notably for money center banks,
reversing earlier declines when a significant fallout from Brazil's difficulties was feared.

Japan eased monetary policy, announcing that it would guide the overnight call rate ""as low as

participants continue to expect a modest monetary policy easing by the ECB Council by the fall.
. The Desk did not intervene during the period for the
accounts of the System or the Treasury.
","(3) Financial market conditions have continued to improve in most emerging market
economies, as investor confidence evidently has been bolstered by the limited contagion from
Brazilian developments. In Brazil itself, overall financial conditions have stabilized somewhat
and the real has tended to firm in recent weeks, owing to a number of factors: The Brazilian
Central Bank demonstrated its commitment to containing inflation by raising the overnight policy
interest rate appreciably early in the period; the government struck an agreement with the IMF,
paving the way for the release of the second tranche of multilateral financial assistance;
international banks made public commitments to maintain or increase their exposure to Brazil;
and its Congress completed passage of the major elements of the fiscal austerity program. The
Mexican peso has appreciated 5 percent since the February FOMC meeting, bolstered in part by
the snapback in oil prices. Despite financial collapse in Ecuador, yield spreads over Treasuries
of Latin American Brady bonds have continued to decline, and prices in most major equity
markets in the region are up. Monetary authorities in a number of emerging Asian economies
allowed domestic interest rates to fall somewhat over the intermeeting period. The Korean won,
the Taiwan dollar, the Indonesian rupiah, and the Thai baht have depreciated between 2 and 5
percent against the dollar over the intermeeting period. In local currency terms, share prices have
risen between 5 and 22 percent in the aforementioned countries, with the exception of Indonesia,
where equity prices have registered a 3 percent decline.
","(4) The broad monetary aggregates have decelerated markedly in recent months and
by more than expected at the time of the Committee's last meeting. Data through the first half of
this month suggest that M2 growth has slowed to a 3 percent rate in March, while M3 apparently
has posted a slight decline. In part, the deceleration of M2 owed to the ebbing effects of the
policy easings of the fall, which had narrowed the opportunity cost of holding M2 assets, thereby
inducing portfolio shifts into M2. Indeed, net noncompetitive tenders for Treasury securities, an
indicator of retail demand for market securities, have been positive in March for the first time in
several months. In addition, a reduced level of mortgage refinancing activity has depressed
liquid deposits. However, slower M2 and M3 growth also likely reflected further recovery in
financial markets. Until the stock market turbulence of this week, households had resumed
substantial purchases of stock mutual funds and halted net acquisitions of money market mutual
funds. With corporations paying down bank loans out of the proceeds of security issues, banks
have had less need for the managed liabilities in M3. The velocities of M2 and M3 likely have
dropped again this quarter, but perhaps at only one-half the rates of more than 4 and 6 percent,
respectively, of the fourth quarter of last year.
","(5) Private debt growth has edged lower, but has remained quite rapid. A widening
gap between capital expenditures and internal cash flows has boosted demands for funding by
corporations. With the improved receptivity of securities markets, most of this financing recently
has occurred through issuance of bonds and commercial paper. Only a moderate amount of the
new issuance has been used to finance merger activity, as most of the recent deals have involved
the exchange of equity or acquisitions by foreign firms that have not required U.S. funding.
Lower average ratings on corporate debt, an uptick in the default rate on junk bonds, and a slight
increase in delinquencies and charge-offs on business loans suggest a little erosion of credit
quality in the business sector. With sustained strength in home purchases and durables spending,
households have continued to pile up new debt, though probably at a bit slower pace than in the
fourth quarter of last year. Measures of the quality of household loans have not evidenced much
change of late: Delinquencies on consumer loans, already elevated, ticked up in the fourth
quarter, while delinquencies on home mortgages have edged down to very low levels by
historical standards. Larger surpluses in the federal budget in recent months have held down the
growth of total nonfinancial debt to a 5-1/2 percent rate in January and February.

","(6) The staff has read incoming data since the February meeting as indicating that
aggregate demand has been more vigorous and inflation better behaved than previously expected.
However, under the maintained assumption of an unchanged federal funds rate over the balance
of this year and the next, the staff still foresees economic growth slowing and inflation picking
up. Among the forces working to slow spending are financial conditions, which are not expected
to provide the impetus that they did last year given that equity prices and long-term interest rates
are anticipated to hold close to current levels. The staff forecasts that real GDP growth will
begin to cool in the second half of 1999, to average 3 percent over the year, up 1/2 percentage
point from the forecast for the February meeting, and decline noticeably further in 2000, to about
lower this year, but retraces that decline next year. With the economy producing beyond its
potential, core inflation (on a methodologically consistent basis) is projected to pick up 1/2
percentage point from 1998 to 2000, to 2-1/2 percent, and is poised to rise faster thereafter. The
overall CPI accelerates by even more over the two years as a consequence of the rebound in
energy prices.2
","(7) Despite the likelihood that overall inflation will rise, the Committee might choose
the unchanged policy stance of alternative B at this meeting. A good part of that rise will owe to
the recent increase in oil prices; most measures of wage and price inflation have ticked lower of
late, which should help to contain inflation expectations; and the projected rebound in core
inflation is gradual. These considerations suggest that deferring action in the near term would
not unduly worsen underlying inflation trends. The Committee might see important benefits
from that delay if it thought that only a modest policy adjustment was necessary and wanted to
use the time to build a case for such action with the public, thereby fostering a more measured
reaction in financial markets than would ensue with unanticipated action. Inaction would be
particularly attractive to the Committee if it suspected that the price outlook in the Greenbook
was more likely to be subject to further favorable surprises than to adverse ones, implying that
firmer evidence of an impending acceleration in prices would be desirable before tightening
policy. Indeed, the Committee may be of the opinion that the staff has built in too large an uptick
to inflation, perhaps by placing too little emphasis on the disinflationary force of ample industrial
capacity and the market discipline now exerted on the ability of firms to pass along price
increases, or by giving too much credence to the power of oil producers to enforce their recent
curbs on supply.
","(8) Continuing the current stance of policy, as envisioned in alternative B, would
match the expectations currently embodied in financial market prices. As a result, the immediate
market reaction to no adjustment in the federal funds rate should be little movement in other
interest rates or in the exchange value of the dollar. Over time, if output were to decelerate and
underlying inflation to remain contained, as in the staff forecast, long-term interest rates should
fluctuate around their current levels, although, as Congress and the administration address budget
issues, markets might become more sensitive to developments regarding the burgeoning federal
budget surplus. With the economic environment remaining benign and concerns about near-term
monetary policy tightening mostly quiescent, major equity price indexes are likely to be little
changed on net, despite pressure on corporate profit margins.
","(9) If the Committee were concerned that inflation was likely to be on an upward
path, as in the staff forecast, it might favor the 1/4 percentage point tightening in the intended
federal funds rate of alternative C. With aggregate demand remaining strong, credit conditions
improving further, and many emerging market economies showing signs of stabilizing, the
Committee might believe that the current meeting is an appropriate time to roll back the policy
easing of last November, initiating the policy action needed to contain inflation over time. Many
on the Committee had viewed the last easing action as an insurance policy taken out as a
precaution against further financial turmoil and a significant broadening of the crises in emerging
markets. While this action may have helped to forestall these eventualities, in current
circumstances they would be unlikely to surface if that action were reversed. The desirability of
immediate tightening would be enhanced to the extent that the Committee read recent data on
spending as indicating that the growth of aggregate demand would not slow as in the staff
projection but rather would remain unsustainably strong absent a tightening of financial
conditions. With the unemployment rate already low and perhaps headed lower, real interest
rates would seem to be falling short of levels required to contain inflationary pressures.
Moreover, while domestic price increases in the past few years have run at a much slower pace
than might have been expected in light of labor market conditions, recently some of the forces
that may have been responsible for this result--declines in oil prices and inflation expectations--
show signs of reversing.
","(10) While financial market participants apparently believe that the Committee's next
move will be toward restraint, no measurable weight is placed on action at this meeting. As a
result, the 25 basis point hike in the intended federal funds rate of alternative C could spark a
substantial reaction in financial markets. Short-term interest rates would rise at least as much as
the policy rate, the prices of long-term debt instruments and equities could come under
considerable downward pressure, and the value of the dollar would probably rise sharply on
foreign exchange markets. If the Committee viewed inflation risks to be substantial, such a
market reaction might be desired as it would speed up the necessary adjustment of aggregate
demand. But if a more modest realignment of market prices were sought, the Committee could
attempt to shape market expectations through the wording of the announcement. In particular,
stressing that some of last fall's easing was no longer needed might limit the tendency of market
participants to extrapolate policy tightening into the future.
","(11) If the Committee were chiefly concerned about the risk to inflation but saw the
case for tightening as not completely convincing, it may want to consider a directive tilted toward
restraint. In that regard, the disclosure policy reaffirmed in December reserved announcement of
a change in the tilt to those occasions when Committee viewed the new directive as reflecting a
major change in the Committee's thinking that was not recognized by the market. With respect
to market expectations, the yield curve now embodies greater odds on a tightening than an
easing, but does not build in any tightening action until next year. If the Committee perceived
the selection of an asymmetric directive at this meeting only as an incremental step in the policy
process and not so much at variance with market expectations as to seriously mislead the public,
it might want to delay announcement of the directive tilt until the release of the minutes in May.
In contrast, if the Committee saw a significant possibility that it might well need to raise interest
rates before too long, it might wish to alert markets to this fact. There is little precedent to gauge
how markets would react to such an announcement, but it is likely that financial prices would
embody much higher odds that the Committee would tighten policy within a few months. The
resulting increases in market interest rates would impart restraint to the inflation process more
promptly than policy tightening later absent such an announcement.
","(12) Under any of these alternatives, the debt of the nonfinancial sectors will likely
continue to expand at a little more than a 5 percent rate in coming months, with rapid growth in
private indebtedness offset by the Treasury's paydown of debt resulting from ongoing federal
budget surpluses. Firms' reliance on borrowing should remain heavy, spurred by further
advances in capital spending and an erosion of internal funds. With purchases of consumer
durable goods expected to be strong, total household debt should continue to expand at a healthy
clip, although mortgage borrowing should cool some from its recent torrid pace. By September,
total nonfinancial debt is projected to have grown at about a 5-1/2 percent annual rate from its
fourth-quarter 1998 base, placing it in the upper half of its 3-to-7 percent annual range.
","(13) To an important extent, commercial banks provided a significant offset to the
curtailment of credit from financial markets late last year by expanding their own balance sheets
to fund firms unwilling or unable to tap markets, albeit at wider spreads. The reversal of those
market strains this year has been mirrored in some shrinkage of bank balance sheets. But that
process is anticipated to have about played itself out, implying that bank credit should resume
expanding at a pace a bit above that of total debt. As a consequence, the growth of M3 is
projected to return to around a 7-1/2 percent rate over the next six months. Investors' varying
views of risk-taking have also left their imprint on M2. The slowing of M2 in recent weeks in
part is seen by the staff as evidence that households have become more willing to hold
instruments exposing them to capital risk that are outside of the monetary aggregates. After this
once-off realignment of portfolios is over, M2 is expected to expand a little faster than nominal
income. Growth of this aggregate is likely to be especially erratic around the coming tax date,
but is expected to average around 5-1/2 percent over the next six months. Under the unchanged
stance of monetary policy assumed in the Greenbook, the staff projects that the levels of both M2
and M3 in September will be about 1 percentage point, at an annual rate, above the upper ends of
the Committee's price-stability ranges.

2000-10-03,2000-10-03,"(1) Financial conditions have registered mixed changes over the intermeeting
period.' Most short- and intermediate-term interest rates have declined as many as 30 basis
points, but most long-term yields have been about unchanged to 15 basis points higher,
major equity price indexes have shed 2-1/2 to 7 percent, and the dollar has appreciated
expectations about the near-term course of interest rates have been revised down in light of
the Committee's statement following its August meeting, which was read as indicating that
the Federal Reserve was more confident that the growth rates of aggregate demand and
supply were coming into better alignment, and subsequent data releases, which tended to
support the view that the economic expansion had slowed. Judging from futures market
quotes, investors have lowered their expected path for the federal funds rate over the second
half of 2001 by about 1/4 percentage point and now place higher odds on the next policy
action being an easing rather than a tightening. The contrary movement of a number of
long-term yields seemed to owe in part to increased uncertainty associated with volatility in
oil prices and to heavy corporate bond issuance. Heightened skepticism about the political
will to preserve projected budget surpluses also pushed up bond yields, particularly in the
Treasury market where some of the scarcity premiums at ten- and thirty-year maturities
appeared to unwind. Meanwhile, equity prices have been depressed by a larger-than-usual
number of warnings about corporate earnings and revenues.
against a basket of major currencies over the intermeeting period; a gain of around 2 percent
against the euro was offset only partially by a 1/2 percent depreciation against the Japanese
yen. European interest rates changed little relative to U.S. interest rates, even though the
European Central Bank firmed policy 1/4 percentage point on August 31. Still, over most of
the period, the dollar steadily gained ground on the euro, reportedly supported by capital
flows favoring U.S. assets and conflicting statements from European officials regarding their
attitude toward a weak euro. The slide in the euro over the intermeeting period cumulated to
intervention in the exchange market that day, initiated by the ECB and joined by the U.S.
monetary authorities and the central banks ofJapan, the United Kingdom, and Canada.
. Purchases of euros against dollars aggregated to with
the U.S. share of that totaling $1.3 billion, split evenly between the Federal Reserve and the
Treasury. This action was the only U.S. intervention in foreign exchange markets over the
intermeeting period;
","(3) The exchange value of the dollar also has posted widespread gains against the
currencies of other important trading partners, pulling the dollar's nominal value against a
basket of those currencies up about 1 percent over the intermeeting period. In general,
uncertainties associated with the effects of movements in oil prices on global economic
growth have appeared partly responsible for a weakening of emerging market asset prices.
Asian stock prices were also hurt by heightened investor concerns about progress in business
and financial restructuring. Yield spreads on emerging market debt have widened in recent
weeks, reversing a narrowing early in the intermeeting period.
","(4) Growth of debt of the domestic nonfinancial sectors slowed to a 4-3/4 percent
pace on balance in July and August, about 1-1/2 percentage points less than in the second
quarter (chart 2). This slowing was more than accounted for by a downshift in private
borrowing, which was only partly offset by a less rapid paydown of federal government debt.
Nonetheless, both household and business borrowing appear to have remained brisk, in part
reflecting continued strong expenditures on consumer durables and business capital.
Improved conditions in long-term debt markets over most of the third quarter prompted
corporations to rely less on borrowing in short-term funding markets and households to
shift mortgage borrowing toward fixed-rate instruments. Lenders continued to become a bit
more selective about higher-risk borrowers. According to the August Survey of Terms of
Business Lending, spreads charged on large loans having above-average risk were snugged
some between May and August. In the bond market, credit risk spreads for junk bonds have
risen appreciably in recent months.
","(5) M2 growth rebounded considerably in August and September from
surprisingly weak growth in June and July. This stronger expansion might in part reflect the
vigor of consumer spending of late. Growth on average for the third quarter held at a pace
well below that of the first half of the year. This slower growth is about in line with
projections from the staffs money demand model and in part reflects the lagged effects of
wider opportunity costs over the first half of 2000. M3 growth has continued to be brisk in
recent months, although it was a bit slower in the third quarter than over the first half of the

","(6) In the staff forecast, the growth rate of aggregate demand is projected to
remain below that of potential GDP through 2002, but core inflation still is seen to be on a
slight upward trajectory. This relatively moderate pace of demand growth reflects the lagged
effects of previous monetary tightening actions, the influence of some additional firming
steps assumed for late 2001 and 2002, and a falling wealth-to-income ratio stemming from a
flat stock market. Restraint from these sources is only partly offset by a projected decline in
the foreign exchange value of the dollar. Although the unemployment rate edges up to
with stable underlying inflation. Core PCE prices are projected to accelerate about 1/2
percentage point through 2002 from their pace over the past twelve months. The projected
path of oil prices is about $2 per barrel above that in the August forecast. The higher track
for energy prices boosts slightly the forecast for total PCE inflation in 2000 relative to the
August Greenbook, bringing the increase to 2-1/2 percent; the rate falls back to 2 percent later
in the projection as energy prices decline.
","(7) While the Committee may find the pickup in core inflation in the staff forecast
to be worrisome, it may still favor keeping the stance of monetary policy unchanged at this
meeting, as under alternative B. The uptrend to core inflation in that outlook is gradual and
far from certain to come to pass. Based on incoming data, the Committee might now be
even more confident that aggregate demand growth has slowed significantly, likely to below
the growth of potential supply. Moreover, with the slippage in equity prices over the
intermeeting period, the prospects have improved that pressures on resources will not
intensify and could even begin to ebb. Higher energy prices would pose a threat to longer-
term price performance if they became embedded in inflation expectations or in wage
demands, as workers attempt to preserve purchasing power. However, oil prices have fallen
from their peaks, and, to date, longer-term inflation expectations have not shown a tendency
to move higher. Moreover, the risks stemming from oil market developments are not all in
one direction. In particular, higher oil prices could restrain aggregate demand beyond the
effects of transferring income to foreign oil producers if they induced an erosion of
consumer confidence or a substantial selloff in equities in light of the reduced economic
efficiency of the existing stock of capital. Market participants, taking into account oil prices
along with other incoming information since the last FOMC meeting, have marked down the
expected path of the federal funds rate for the next few years. In these circumstances, the
Committee may see little to be lost by waiting to obtain more information on trends in
output and inflation.
","(8) Market prices incorporate the expectation that the target federal funds rate and
the balance-of-risks sentence will be left unchanged at this meeting. Consequently,
implementation of alternative B, along with the retention of the statement that the
Committee regarded the balance of risks as weighted toward increased inflationary pressures,
should have little effect on financial markets. The Committee might well see the revised
outlook for oil prices, coming at a time when it was already concerned about potential price
pressures from the unusually low unemployment rate, as reinforcing a judgment that the
balance of risks is weighted toward higher inflation. However, the Committee may now
believe that growth of aggregate demand is not likely to exceed that of potential output, that
current levels of resource utilization are sustainable, and that oil prices probably will not
leave a lasting imprint on inflation. If so, it could consider issuing a statement that indicated
balanced risks to achieving its goals for price stability and sustainable economic growth. In
this case, bond and equity markets would likely rally, as investors marked up the odds on an
easing trend in monetary policy over coming months, and the value of the dollar on foreign
exchange markets would probably edge lower.
","(9) The FOMC instead might choose the 25 basis point increase in the federal
funds rate of alternative C. Core inflation has risen and may already be above rates that
Committee members find acceptable over the long run. Moreover, although underlying
trends in aggregate demand apparently have slowed, the current and projected levels of
resource utilization may imply, based on historical experience, a likelihood that core inflation
will continue to increase, as in the staff forecast. Furthermore, the Committee may see
upside risks to inflation even relative to that forecast. While the staff has trimmed the
amount of fiscal restraint in the outlook, recent news might be read as suggesting a distinct
possibility of even greater erosion in federal budget surpluses. In addition, if oil prices do
not fall as in the staff forecast and futures market quotes, short-term inflation expectations
may deteriorate further, which, absent monetary policy firming, would reduce the real federal
funds rate. In simulations of staff econometric models, such as that shown in the
international section of Part I of the Greenbook, holding the nominal funds rate along the
baseline path in the face of an upward shock to oil prices sets in motion a process of ever-
rising core inflation relative to the baseline outcome as lower real interest rates boost output
relative to potential.
","(10) The market reaction to implementation of alternative C would likely be sharp.
With investors expecting no change in the stance of monetary policy at this meeting and
apparently anticipating that the next move will be toward easing, short-term interest rates
would probably jump by at least the 25 basis point increase in the federal funds rate.
Especially if the announcement indicated that the Committee continued to see the balance of
risks as weighted toward higher inflation, capital markets could sell off significantly, as
market participants adjusted prices to incorporate expectations of a higher path for short-
term interest rates. Any decline in inflation expectations would probably offset only part of
the effect on nominal bond yields of the higher real rates brought about by the tightening.
The value of the dollar on foreign exchange markets would firm against most currencies. An
announcement of balanced risks would likely be seen by market participants as a signal that
the Committee believed that this phase of policy tightening had been completed. In this
case, the response to a 25 basis point tightening at this meeting would be muted.
","(11) Under the interest rate assumptions of the Greenbook, the average growth of
domestic nonfinancial sector debt over the next several quarters is forecast to be a bit below
the 5-1/2 percent rate of the first three quarters of 2000. In the household sector, the rate of
borrowing is projected to remain fairly brisk, although it ebbs gradually, in line with a
slowing pace of residential investment and moderating growth of expenditures on consumer
durables. With profit growth tailing off, business borrowing stays relatively rapid to finance
strong merger activity and robust capital spending. As debt-service burdens rise in the
household and business sectors, terms and conditions available to weaker borrowers are
likely to firm a bit further. Despite the projected relaxation of fiscal discipline, federal debt
remains on a downward trajectory over the projection period.
","(12) M2 growth is projected to move lower in coming months, to an average of
around 5-3/4 percent through next March, from its unusually elevated rates of the past couple
of months. Nonetheless, the expansion of this aggregate runs at a higher rate than on
average over the third quarter, as the influence of past monetary tightenings begins to wane.
M3 growth from September to March is projected to drop back to about a 6-3/4 percent
annual. For 2000 as a whole, M2 and M3 are forecast to expand 6 and 9 percent,
respectively, compared with the 6-3/4 percent increase projected for nominal GDP.

2005-11-01,2005-11-01,"(1) With investors putting only small odds on a pause in the tightening cycle
following Hurricane Katrina, there was little market reaction to the FOMC’s decision
at the September meeting to raise the target federal funds rate 25 basis points to
growth were balanced, and to retain the “measured pace” language. 1  The expected
path for monetary policy shifted up in subsequent weeks though, as incoming data
indicated that output had been expanding briskly prior to the hurricane and that the
disruptions to economic activity from Hurricane Katrina and Rita were likely to be
less severe than initially feared.  This upward pressure on interest rates may have been
amplified by comments from a number of Federal Reserve officials that were read as
stressing inflation concerns.  By the time of the release of the FOMC minutes,
investors had reportedly anticipated their somewhat hawkish tone, and the market
response to their publication was minimal.  Current readings on futures contracts
indicate that the federal funds rate expected after the December meeting has increased
about 25 basis points over the intermeeting period to nearly 4¼ percent, consistent
with investors placing high odds on a quarter-point rate hike at each of the next two
meetings (Chart 1).2  The level of the funds rate expected to prevail by June 2006 rose
dealer survey have similarly come to expect more policy tightening, with the majority
now anticipating rate increases at the November, December, and January meetings.
Most of the respondents expect little change in the measured pace and
accommodative language, and six of twenty-two respondents indicated that recent
statements by Federal Reserve officials had influenced their interest rate forecasts.
Uncertainty about the expected path for policy over the coming six months, as
measured by implied volatility read from eurodollar options, has decreased some since
the September meeting, although it remains above its pre-Katrina levels.
","(2) Nominal Treasury yields rose 25 to 50 basis points on net, with most of the
advance accounted for by increases in near-term forward rates.3, 4  In addition to
stronger-than-expected economic data, declines in some energy prices likely
contributed to a more positive economic outlook, helping to push yields higher.
Increases at the longer end of the term structure, especially late in the period, may
have been due in part to increased mortgage hedging flows, as suggested by anecdotal
reports.  Despite a higher-than-expected reading on the overall consumer price index
for September, TIPS-based measures of inflation compensation were about
unchanged over the intermeeting period, although they remain 15 to 20 basis points
above the levels seen prior to Hurricane Katrina.
","(3) Partly in response to the rise in interest rates, major stock price indexes fell

remaining days prior to the meeting.  Federal funds futures contracts for December and 
January are currently pricing in minimal year-end pressures in the federal funds market.      
3 President Bush’s announcement on October 24 that he was nominating Ben S. Bernanke to 
succeed Chairman Greenspan was accompanied by an increase of a few basis points in 
Treasury yields and a modest rally in equity markets.   
4 Open interest in the September ten-year Treasury futures contract remained elevated 
through its final days of trading.  Nonetheless, all the deliveries were met using the August 
2012 note, which was the cheapest-to-deliver security.

been concerned about the cautious tone to corporate guidance about future earnings
growth.  Implied volatilities from equity options remained low but edged up a bit over
the period in response to several announcements of corporate distress, including the
sudden collapse of Refco, the bankruptcy filings by Delphi, Delta Airlines, and
Northwest Airlines, and the announcement of an SEC investigation into the pension
practices of General Motors (more details about the bankruptcies are provided in the
box “Credit Market Developments”).  The timing of some of the bankruptcy filings
may have been related to the implementation of new bankruptcy rules in October.  As
a result of the problems at these firms, the number of downgrades of corporate bonds
increased, as did the aggregate bond default rate.  However, corporate quality outside
of the automobile and airline sectors remained solid.  Broad indexes of investment-
and speculative-grade corporate bond yields moved largely in line with Treasury yields
over the period, leaving spreads little changed.
","(4) The dollar’s foreign exchange value against major currencies rose about
¾ percent on balance over the intermeeting period (Chart 3).5  Somewhat stronger-
than-expected U.S. economic data and the expressed resolve of U.S. officials to
combat inflationary pressures reportedly supported the dollar.  A number of foreign
central bankers conveyed similar determination, heightening expectations of monetary
policy tightening abroad.  In Canada, the Bank of Canada raised its policy rate another
economies, yields on foreign long-term government securities rose a bit less than in
the United States.   The dollar was little changed against the Canadian dollar and the
euro, but gained 1¼ percent against sterling and almost 3¼ percent against the yen.
Although recent Japanese data have been somewhat softer than during the first half of
the year, that economy apparently advanced further.  Bank of Japan officials have

Credit Market Developments
Four high-profile companies—Refco, Delphi, and Delta and Northwest Airlines—
filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in the last six weeks; corporate bonds 
with par value totaling slightly more than $8 billion were affected by these filings.  
Refco, a large derivatives broker, collapsed when clients deserted the firm following 
the revelation of accounting irregularities just two months after its initial public 
offering.  Delphi, the largest U.S. automobile parts manufacturer, cited its inability 
to reach cost-cutting agreements with unions and with General Motors—from 
which it spun off in 1999—as reasons for its filing.  Competition from low-cost 
carriers and soaring fuel prices were instrumental in the airlines’ defaults.  Some of 
these firms may have filed for bankruptcy more quickly than they otherwise would 
have in order to avoid the corporate provisions of the new bankruptcy law, which 
took effect on October 17.
Delphi’s bankruptcy filing rekindled investors’ concerns about credit quality in the 
automobile sector—where spreads on several firms, including Ford and General 
Motors, initially rose sharply and have since remained volatile.  The airlines’ 
defaults, however, elicited little reaction, as they were largely expected.  Refco’s 
collapse had no discernible effect on financial market functioning, as its wind-down 
was orderly and its accounting troubles were seen as isolated.  Overall, the impact 
of the bankruptcies on the broad credit market appears to have been limited.  In a 
sign that investors expect little spillover from the recent defaults, a measure of the 
likelihood that future defaults in the investment-grade sector will be clustered—the 
so-called implied default correlation obtained from CDS index tranches—has 
remained extremely low.  The equivalent measure for the speculative-grade sector 
has picked up, but that increase reflects in part the considerable presence of 
automobile-sector firms in the high-yield CDS index.  Even with the recent 
increase, investors apparently still judge the likelihood of correlated defaults among 
speculative-grade firms to be lower than it was last spring.
Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) Page 6 of 36
continued to hint that, given their economic outlook, the quantitative easing regime
will likely end during the first half of next year.  Share prices in Japan made solid gains
during the intermeeting period, led by banking and other financial-sector stocks that
reacted positively to passage of the postal reform bill.  Stock prices in other foreign
industrial countries recorded declines of 2 to 7 percent, broadly similar to those in
U.S. markets.
","(5) The dollar recorded a small gain against an index of currencies of our other
important trading partners over the intermeeting period.  The dollar moved up
¾ percent against the peso, as the Bank of Mexico eased its overnight lending rate
downward trend against the Brazilian real, and the Brazilian central bank surprised
markets with a 50 basis point easing of its policy rate to counter weakening domestic
demand.  Equity prices in many emerging market countries dropped fairly sharply, as
investor demand for riskier assets appeared to abate with increases in U.S. interest
","(6) Domestic nonfinancial debt is estimated to have advanced briskly in the
third quarter, rising 8¼ percent on net (Chart 4).  Growth in household debt appears
to have edged down in the third quarter owing to a slowing in mortgage debt growth,
although the forecast of the latter remains at an elevated level.  Household
bankruptcies surged in the weeks immediately before bankruptcy reforms went into
effect on October 17.  The debt of nonfinancial businesses appears to have risen in
the third quarter at a rate comparable to increases seen in the first half of the year.  In
October, bond issuance has slowed as higher yields may have discouraged new longer-
term issues.  Commercial paper, which ran off at quarter-end, bounced back in early
October.  Bank loans to businesses continued to advance briskly, and the results of
the most recent Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey show some further easing of
lending terms and standards for such loans.
Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) Page 8 of 36
","(7) M2 expanded at an annual rate of 6 percent in September, bringing third-
quarter growth to 4 percent.  The increase in September was in part attributable to a
surge in retail money market funds and to a boost to currency and liquid deposits
resulting from Hurricane Katrina.6  Growth in nominal output in the third quarter
likely exceeded that of M2, implying a further rise in velocity.
Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) Page 10 of 36
Economic Outlook
","(8) The staff has revised down slightly its projection for real GDP growth since
the September Greenbook, as the rise in longer-term yields, drop in equity values, and
appreciation of the exchange value of the dollar over the intermeeting period
established a launching-off point for the forecast consistent with more financial
restraint than in the previous projection.  The outlook is predicated on the same
cumulative amount of policy tightening, which brings the federal funds rate to
completed this year, rather than in the middle of next year.  At the time of the
September meeting, market participants had foreseen a little less tightening than the
staff; now they foresee somewhat more.  As a result, bond yields are forecast to
decline slightly as investors’ expectations for policy gradually come into line with the
lower path in the staff outlook.  As in previous forecasts, the stock market generates
risk-adjusted returns similar to those on fixed-income investments, while the foreign
exchange value of the dollar depreciates modestly.  In the context of these financial
conditions and the impetus to spending from a burst of rebuilding in the Gulf region,
GDP grows a little faster than the 3 percent expansion of potential output next year
and a little slower than that pace in 2007.  The unemployment rate in 2007 edges
slightly above the estimated NAIRU of 5 percent and the output gap widens a bit to
almost ½ percent.  Core PCE inflation picks up to 2¼ percent next year, in light of
some pass-through to inflation expectations of recently elevated headline inflation.
However, falling energy prices help bring overall PCE inflation down from
little economic slack, pull core inflation below 2 percent in 2007.
Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) Page 11 of 36
Policy Alternatives
","(9) This Bluebook presents three policy alternatives for the Committee’s
consideration, summarized by the draft statements in Table 1.  Under Alternative A,
the Committee would leave its target for the federal funds rate unchanged at
economic dislocations of the hurricanes and associated effects on consumer and
business confidence, but still signals that remaining monetary policy accommodation
could likely be removed at a measured pace.  Under Alternatives B and C, the
Committee would raise the target federal funds rate 25 basis points.  Alternative B
retains much of the statement the Committee issued after its September meeting,
including the characterization that policy remains accommodative.  Alternative C
takes a somewhat more aggressive tone and eliminates the balance-of-risks,
accommodative, and measured pace language.7
","(10) Although core inflation readings have been favorable in recent months,
Committee members may be concerned that, in light of some signs of sharply higher
near-term inflation expectations and reports of greater pricing power, elevated energy
and other costs threaten to pass through significantly to core price inflation.  If the
Committee believes that a continued measured pace of policy firming will prove
sufficient to contain these inflationary pressures, it might be inclined to raise the target
funds rate another 25 basis points at this meeting and choose language as in
Alternative B.  As seen in Chart 5, a 25 basis point increase in the target funds rate
would move the real funds rate into the range of rates estimated by the staff to be
broadly consistent with closing the output gap over the next few years.  However, the

Equilibrium Real Rate Chart: Explanatory Notes
The equilibrium real rate is the real federal funds rate that, if maintained, would be projected to return 
output to its potential level over time.  For the first three measures listed below, the short-run 
equilibrium rate is defined as the rate that would close the output gap in twelve quarters given the 
corresponding model’s projection of the economy.  For the first two measures, the medium-run concept 
is the value of the real funds rate projected to keep output at potential in seven years under the 
assumption that monetary policy acts to bring actual and potential output into line in the short run and 
then keep them equal thereafter.  The TIPS-based factor model measure provides an estimate of market 
expectations for the real federal funds rate seven years ahead.  The actual real federal funds rate shown 
in the chart employs the log difference of the core PCE price index over the previous four quarters as a 
proxy for expected inflation, with the staff projection used for the current quarter.
Measure Description
Single-Equation 
Model
The measure of the equilibrium real rate in the single-equation model is based on an 
estimated aggregate-demand relationship between the current value of the output gap and 
its lagged values as well as the lagged values of the real federal funds rate.  In light of this 
model’s simple structure, the short-run measure of the equilibrium real rate depends only 
on the recent position of output relative to potential, and the medium-run measure is 
virtually constant.
Small Structural 
Model
The small-scale model of the economy consists of equations for five variables: the output 
gap, the equity premium, the federal budget surplus, the trend growth rate of output, and 
the real bond yield.  Unlike the estimates from the single-equation model, values of the 
equilibrium real rate also depend directly on conditions associated with output growth, 
fiscal policy, and capital markets.
Large Model 
(FRB/US)
Estimates of the equilibrium real rate using FRB/US—the staff’s large-scale econometric 
model of the U.S. economy—depend on a very broad array of economic factors, some of 
which take the form of projected values of the model’s exogenous variables.  These 
projections make use of several simple forecasting rules which are appropriate for the 
three-year horizon relevant for the short-run concept but are less sensible over longer 
horizons.  Thus, we report only the short-run measure for the FRB/US model.
Greenbook-
consistent
Measures of the equilibrium real rate cannot be directly obtained from the Greenbook 
forecast, because the Greenbook is not based on a formal model.  Rather, we use the 
FRB/US model in conjunction with an extended version of the Greenbook forecast to 
derive a Greenbook-consistent measure.  FRB/US is first add-factored so that its 
simulation matches the extended Greenbook forecast, and then a second simulation is run 
off this baseline to determine the value of the real federal funds rate that closes the output 
gap.  The medium-run concept of the equilibrium real rate is not computed because it 
requires a relatively long extension of the Greenbook forecast.
TIPS-based 
Factor Model
Yields on TIPS (Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities) reflect investors’ expectations of 
the future path of real interest rates, but also include term and liquidity premiums.  The 
TIPS-based measure of the equilibrium real rate is constructed using the seven-year-ahead 
instantaneous real forward rate derived from TIPS yields as of the Bluebook publication 
date.  This forward rate is adjusted to remove estimates of the term and liquidity 
premiums based on a three-factor arbitrage-free term-structure model applied to TIPS 
yields, nominal yields, and inflation.  Because TIPS indexation is based on the total CPI, 
this measure is also adjusted for the medium-term difference—projected at 40 basis 
points—between total CPI inflation and core PCE inflation.
Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) Page 15 of 36
Committee may believe that higher real interest rates and a bit more resource slack
will be required to contain inflation, making it appropriate to issue a statement
suggesting that more tightening is likely in store.  Such a policy course might also be
favored if the Committee viewed the current rate of core inflation to be at or above
the upper limit of a range consistent with price stability.  With most measures of labor
compensation posting moderate gains and some reversal of the runup in energy prices
in prospect, members may believe that remaining firming can be done gradually,
consistent with the measured pace language of Alternative B.  While a policy hike at
this meeting would place the funds rate at the high end of the prescriptions of several
policy rules that are based on a 1½ percent objective for core PCE inflation, that is
only a matter of timing because those rules indicate a need for an even higher funds
rate by mid-2006 (Chart 6).
","(11) The Committee may wish to begin the rationale portion of the statement
for Alternative B by reaffirming the view that adverse effects of the hurricanes will
probably slow the pace of the expansion only temporarily.  Robust underlying growth
in productivity may still be seen as a support for economic activity.  The statement
could also note the boost to aggregate demand from increased private and public
spending associated with rebuilding efforts in hurricane-affected areas.  While a
range of estimated equilibrium rates, the Committee may still prefer to characterize
policy as accommodative in light of the underlying strength of demand and upward
pressures on inflation.  As for inflation, the Committee could cite indications, evident
in some producer prices and in surveys of near-term inflation expectations, that “The
cumulative rise in energy and other costs has added to inflation pressures,” while still
noting that “core inflation has been relatively low in recent months.”  The
observation that “longer-term inflation expectations remain contained” may be seen
as appropriate to convey a balanced view of the inflation outlook.

","(12) Futures market quotes suggest that investors are virtually certain of a
dealers expect little change in the nature of the statement.  Therefore, market prices
would likely be essentially unaffected by a 25 basis point increase in the funds rate and
the statement language as under Alternative B.
","(13) If the Committee wished to convey greater concern about upside risks to
inflation, it might prefer to combine a 25 basis point increase in the target funds rate
with the language included under Alternative C.  The Committee may especially
favor this alternative if increases in energy and other costs were viewed as beginning
to unmoor inflation expectations, potentially starting an upward shift in inflation
dynamics that would be hard to reverse later.  Even if inflation expectations remain
well anchored for a time, a sharper rebound in spending growth as rebuilding in the
hurricane-affected areas picks up steam may put excessive strains on resources.  The
proposed statement drops the characterization of policy as accommodative, but it
indicates in the comments on inflation (row 3) that further policy firming likely is
necessary on the thought that the Committee might soon envision moving the real
funds rate past its neutral level—that is, to impose policy restraint.  The sentence on
the balance of risks is also eliminated; the Committee might see that formula as
redundant or possibly misleading about the extent of upside inflation risks at present.
The final paragraph on the measured pace language is also dropped, allowing greater
flexibility for possible future adjustments of policy.  The Committee may see this
more forceful tone as warranted in light of the backup in market interest rates,
increase in inflation compensation, and depreciation of the dollar in recent days,
which might be viewed as signs of the emergence of inflation jitters in financial
markets.  Indeed, the Committee may prefer to raise the target funds rate 50 basis
points at this meeting in association with language similar to that under Alternative C
to underscore its determination to resist an increase in inflation.
Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) Page 19 of 36
","(14) Market participants would be surprised by the removal of the measured
pace and policy accommodation language and, perhaps, by the explicit indication that
additional firming was likely to be necessary.  With a 25 basis point move and the
language proposed under Alternative C, short-term interest rates and the exchange
value of the dollar would likely rise, while stock prices would fall.  If markets revised
down their outlook for longer-term inflation as a result of the statement, however,
longer-term interest rates might increase only a little.  With a 50 basis point firming,
market participants would likely raise their sense of inflation risks and the near-term
path of expected monetary policy substantially; short- and intermediate-term market
interest rates would jump, the dollar would rally, and the stock market could sell off
","(15) Committee members may wish to consider Alternative A if they think that
the recent moderate rates of core inflation are likely to continue and if they see the
outlook for the economy as especially uncertain because of the effects of the
hurricanes and elevated energy prices.  Particularly if the Committee, like the staff,
views the real federal funds rate as in the vicinity of its equilibrium level, a pause in
policy firming might be seen as desirable, partly to await further readings on consumer
and business sentiment and spending.  Such a pause may also be chosen if members
believe that the real estate market is in the process of softening, which heretofore has
been an important spur to household spending.  Under this alternative, the
Committee might refer to “remaining” policy accommodation in the final risk
assessment paragraph.  Markets would be surprised at the decision to leave the target
funds rate unchanged.  Short-term interest rates would probably decline considerably
as markets lowered the probability of near-term tightening moves.  Longer-term
interest rates might be little changed or even back up if investors saw the FOMC as
more tolerant than they expected of an increase in inflation.  The foreign exchange
value of the dollar would likely fall, especially if inflation expectations deteriorated.

Money and Debt Forecasts
","(17)  Under the staff forecast, M2 is expected to expand 3¾ percent this year,
almost 2½ percentage points slower than nominal GDP, owing to rising opportunity
costs (Table 2).  With short-term market rates assumed to be unchanged in 2006 and
increases in the opportunity cost of money holding.  As a consequence, M2 is
projected to accelerate to a 4½ percent pace next year and 5 percent in 2007, a little
below and above the growth rates of nominal GDP, respectively.  Domestic
Other Language Alternatives 
 
Committee members have recognized for some time that certain features of its 
policy statement would not prove durable, not the least being its characterization 
of policy as accommodative and its prediction that this accommodation can be 
removed at a pace that is likely to be measured.  The assessment that policy is 
accommodative becomes increasingly problematic as the real federal funds rate 
enters the range of plausible estimates of its equilibrium level.  Moreover, the 
Committee may feel it necessary to move the real funds rate beyond its neutral 
level to unwind inflationary pressures or to roll back some of the rise in inflation 
over the past couple of years.  In doing so, the Committee might be reluctant to 
switch its characterization of policy from accommodative to contractionary.  Two 
alternatives might be considered. 
 
For one, if it is important to convey the sense that policy action will remain 
gradual, the statement could replace the description of the stance of policy with 
words describing the direction of its likely future action.  In particular, the key 
portion of row 5 could read: "". . .  the Committee believes that policy firming can 
continue at a pace that is likely to be measured."" 
 
For another, the Committee could drop rows 4 and 5 in favor of a formula for its 
risk assessment.  One such formula, for example, was proposed in a box in the 
September Bluebook.  In that structure, the Committee would provide separate 
assessments of the risks to its two goals under the explicit assumption that the 
stance of policy remains unchanged for the next few quarters.

nonfinancial sector debt is expected to grow around 8¼ percent this year and then

2006-09-20,2006-09-20,"(1) On the eve of the August FOMC meeting, market participants were
confident—but not completely certain—that the Committee would leave the funds
rate at 5¼ percent.  As a result, the announcement of the decision to put policy on
hold after seventeen consecutive firmings pulled policy expectations a few basis
points lower (Chart 1).1  Those expectations subsequently fell further in response to
softer-than-expected inflation data for July, declines in oil prices, and the minutes of
the August FOMC meeting, which were interpreted as underscoring that Committee
members generally saw price pressures as likely to abate amid moderating economic
growth.  Futures quotes indicate that investors generally believe that the target rate
will be left unchanged at the September meeting and over the remainder of the year.
Further ahead, futures rates now imply about 50 basis points of easing next year and
point to a funds rate of about 4½ percent at the end of 2008.  Respondents to the
Desk’s survey of primary dealers also expect policy easing next year, albeit somewhat
less than that apparent in futures prices.  In addition, the dealers anticipate little
change in the wording of the September FOMC statement.  Implied volatilities
derived from options on Eurodollars futures contracts that expire over the coming
two years remain near the low end of their historical ranges.
","(2) Yields on two- and five-year nominal Treasury securities fell about 10 basis
points over the intermeeting period.  By contrast, yields on similarly dated indexed
debt rose, leaving near- and intermediate-term TIPS-based inflation compensation
considerably lower.  The appreciable decline in energy prices—spot oil prices fell by
$13 per barrel, on net—and the shortfall of readings on inflation relative to what
markets had anticipated apparently led investors to trim their expectations for near-
term inflation, which is evident in the pronounced decline in short-run inflation
compensation (see the box “Short-run Inflation Compensation”).  Further out the
yield curve, one-year nominal and real forward rates ending in ten years were down a
little, implying only small changes in inflation compensation at that horizon.2
","(3) Against the backdrop of lower oil prices, broad stock price indexes
increased about 3 percent, on net, over the intermeeting period (Chart 2).  Implied
volatility of the S&P 500 declined, and spreads of yields on investment- and
speculative-grade bonds over those on comparable-maturity Treasury securities edged
down.  Corporate risk spreads are narrow by historical standards, consistent with
continued solid credit quality and very low expected defaults for the coming year.
","(4) The trade-weighted index of the dollar versus major foreign currencies rose
about ¾ percent on net over the intermeeting period, as modest increases against the
euro and sterling and a larger advance relative to the yen were partially offset by a
small decline vis-à-vis the Canadian dollar (Chart 3).3  Nominal yields on long-term
government securities in industrial countries moved down 10 to 20 basis points over
the period, while yields on indexed debt were little changed.  As a result, most of the
decline in nominal yields was concentrated in the inflation-compensation component,
as market participants appear to have revised inflation expectations down in reaction
to the recent drop in oil prices.  In Japan, softer data on inflation and activity led
investors to trim their expectation of policy tightening by the Bank of Japan, and that
Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) Page 3 of 36
fall Short-Run Inflation Compensation  
 
The inaugural TIPS issue, which was sold in 1997, will mature in January 2007.  The 
rich schedule of issuance since then provides numerous points along the indexed-debt 
yield curve at short and intermediate maturities.  The amount of interest and principal 
that will be paid on the TIPS issue maturing in January 2007 will be determined by the 
average of the CPIs for October and November, making it relatively straightforward 
to calculate inflation compensation for the twelve months ending that period.  More 
generally, quotes on indexed debt maturing in January in each of the next three years 
can be matched up with quotes from the nominal yield curve to generate estimates of 
annual inflation compensation ending in October-November for the next two years as 
well. 
 
The chart below shows that these measures of short-run inflation compensation 
shifted lower over the intermeeting period.  The implied rate for the one-year period 
ending this autumn fell about 70 basis points to 2.45 percent,* and the rates for 
similar intervals ending in 2007 and 2008 fell 5 and 15 basis points, respectively, to 
2.80 and 2.45 percent.
* CPI up to July 2006 has been published, and as a result, most of the inflation compensation from 
October-November 2005 to October-November 2006 is already known.  According to the 
methodology employed here, the unknown portion for that period—that is, the implied monthly 
average seasonally adjusted inflation compensation between July and November 2006—is 
0.06 percentage point.
Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) Page 4 of 36
weighed on the foreign exchange value of the yen.  Stock price indexes in most major
industrial countries rose between 1 and 5 percent over the period.
","(5) On balance over the intermeeting period, the dollar was about unchanged
against an index of currencies of our other important trading partners.  The Mexican
peso edged down only slightly versus the dollar, despite lingering uncertainty created
by the recent presidential election in that country.  The Brazilian real moved up against
the dollar.  EMBI+ spreads for both Brazil and Mexico remained near record lows.
The heavily managed dollar-renminbi exchange rate moved in a wider daily range over
the intermeeting period than earlier this year, and the currency appreciated 3⁄10 percent
on net.  Some analysts interpreted the larger fluctuations as a possible prelude to
greater flexibility of the renminbi.  The People’s Bank of China increased its
benchmark bank lending rate 27 basis points on August 18, pointing to the rapid
growth of credit and investment.
","(6) Domestic nonfinancial sector debt is estimated to be increasing at a
as a projected slowing in household borrowing about offsets a more-rapid expansion
of federal debt (Chart 4).  C&I loans have picked up briskly in recent months, but net
corporate bond issuance has slowed.  On balance, growth of nonfinancial business
sector debt this quarter is expected to remain near its second-quarter pace.  Debt of
the household sector expanded at a 9 percent annual rate last quarter, slightly slower
than in the first quarter, as mortgage borrowing moderated a bit.  The limited
indicators for the current quarter, including July and August bank credit data, point to
some further slowing of household mortgage borrowing, consistent with the cooling
in the housing market.
","(7) M2 growth, at a 4 percent annual rate, remained slow in August.  In recent
months, money growth was damped by the moderate expansion in nominal income
and the lagged effects of earlier increases in opportunity cost.  Liquid deposits, whose
Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) Page 7 of 36
rates of return tend to lag rising market rates, continued to run off.  In contrast, small
time deposits and retail money funds, whose rates of return tend to adjust more
promptly, increased briskly.  The currency component continued to expand at a
sluggish rate, apparently due to weak overseas demand for U.S. currency.
The Term Structure of Interest Rates and Growth Prospects  
 
Various econometric models of future real GDP growth that include the shape of the 
term structure suggest that the expansion will slow somewhat and that the odds of an 
outright recession have increased, on net, over the course of this year.  For example, a 
model that includes the slope of the yield curve—as measured by the difference 
between three-month and ten-year Treasury yields—and an estimate of the term 
premium, estimated with data over almost the past twenty years, now implies four-
quarter-ahead expansion of just below 3 percent.  This calculation is little changed 
since the August FOMC meeting and is broadly comparable to private sector 
forecasts, such as the Blue Chip consensus.  Also, a model using the slope of the yield 
curve and the short rate suggests that the probability that the economy will be in 
recession within the next four quarters is about 40 percent.  In contrast, respondents 
to the Blue Chip survey this month reported a 25 percent probability of recession.  
Notably, however, the point estimates derived from these models are highly sensitive 
to specification and sample selection, and therefore sizable confidence intervals 
surround implied growth rates as well as recession odds.
Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) Page 9 of 36
Economic Outlook
","(8) The staff forecast for real GDP growth has been lowered somewhat, owing
to the effects of a more abrupt slowing in housing activity and lower growth in
potential output.  The stimulus imparted by the recent appreciable decline in energy
prices and by rallies in some financial markets provides only a partial offset to these
effects.  Real GDP is anticipated to expand at about a 1¾ percent annual rate on
balance over the remainder of 2006 before accelerating gradually over 2007 and 2008.
Resource slack follows the same path as in the August Greenbook, with the
unemployment rate edging up to 5¼ percent by the second half of 2008.  The staff
forecast assumes that the Committee holds the stance of policy steady through mid-
yields rise marginally from a level that is about 20 basis points lower than anticipated
in the August Greenbook, and stock prices increase at about a 6½ percent annual rate
from a starting point that is 2 percent higher than in the last forecast.  The foreign
exchange value of the dollar depreciates gradually as in previous forecasts, but along a
track that is 1 percent above that in August.  As suggested by futures quotes, oil prices
are forecast to rebound somewhat from their recent declines but to run considerably
below the path in the previous forecast.  The flattening out of energy prices and other
commodity prices helps to nudge core PCE inflation down from about 2½ percent at
an annual rate in the second half of 2006 to about 2 percent by the end of the forecast
period.  Product and labor market slack also exert a small downward influence on the
inflation outlook by 2008.  Overall PCE inflation runs at 2½ percent in 2007 and

The moderation in economic growth

Economic growth has moderated 
from its quite strong pace earlier 
this year, partly reflecting a cooling 
of the housing market.
Although core inflation remains elevated, 
recent readings have been slightly more 
favorable.  While some inflation 
pressures persist, they seem likely to 
moderate over time, reflecting reduced 
impetus from energy prices, contained 
inflation expectations, and the 
cumulative effects of monetary policy 
actions and other factors restraining 
aggregate demand.
Readings on core inflation have been 
elevated on balance, and the high levels 
of resource utilization and of the prices 
of energy and other commodities have 
the potential to sustain inflation 
pressures.  However, inflation pressures

and of the prices of energy and

the Committee believed that an 
additional firming of policy was 
appropriate to foster a decline in 
inflation.
Assessment of 
Risk
In recent weeks, the upside risks to 
inflation appear to have diminished 
somewhat and downside risks to growth 
have become more significant.  In these 
circumstances, future policy adjustments 
will depend on the evolution of the 
outlook for both inflation and economic 
growth, as implied by incoming 
information.

and B, the Committee would again leave the stance of monetary policy unchanged at
this meeting; Alternative A would suggest that the Committee now sees the risks to
growth and inflation as balanced, while Alternative B would repeat the indication
from August that the Committee is concerned predominantly with inflation risks.
Under Alternative C, the Committee would firm policy 25 basis points and, as in
Alternative B, would highlight upside inflation risks.  A few key data releases are
scheduled between the publication of this document and the Committee’s meeting,
including consumer prices for August on Friday and housing starts on Tuesday, so the
wording of the rationale portions of the various draft statements should be viewed as
more tentative than usual.
","(10)  The Committee might want to keep the federal funds rate unchanged at
relatively slow pace of growth and the gradual decline in core inflation from an
elevated level in that projection might have little appeal individually, policymakers may
feel that circumstances are such that this combination of outcomes is likely the best
that can be attained, particularly in light of the downward revision to longer-term
growth prospects.  Holding the funds rate steady at this meeting would be generally
consistent with the Committee’s past behavior as captured in the estimated policy
rules shown in Chart 5, as well as with most of the simple policy rules shown in

might be viewed as appropriate by the Committee if it saw high energy and other
commodity prices and high levels of resource utilization as implying that the upside
risks to inflation remain substantial.  Moreover, recent data on labor compensation
and productivity, while not fully congruent with other indicators of labor costs, may
also be seen as pointing to potentially substantial inflation risks, as in the “greater
wage pressure” scenario presented in the Greenbook.
","(12) The rationale wording for Alternative B could note that the moderation in
economic growth appears to be continuing.  In view of recent information on the
residential construction sector, it could indicate that the housing market is cooling,
rather than referring to a “gradual” cooling as in the August statement.  The
paragraph on inflation could be generally similar to the one in the previous statement.
However, to acknowledge that the most recent data on core inflation were lower than
those in preceding months—but not to be seen as overly optimistic in that regard—
the statement could indicate that core inflation readings have been elevated “on
balance” over recent months.  The Committee might also wish to explain more
explicitly its expectation that inflation pressures seem likely to moderate over time by
citing a reduced impetus from energy prices.
","(13) Money market options indicate that investors are quite sure that the
Committee will keep the federal funds rate at 5¼ percent at this meeting.  In addition,
the Desk’s survey of primary dealers indicates an anticipation that the statement
released after this meeting will about replicate the August announcement, apart from
some updating of the characterization of the economy and inflation.  Accordingly, the
market reaction to this alternative should be quite limited.
","(14) Judging from current financial quotes, market participants do not view
maintaining the federal funds rate at 5¼ percent for some time as an approach the
FOMC would select to balance competing macroeconomic risks.  Even though the
Committee identified upside risks as its predominant concern in the August
Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) Page 16 of 36
statement, money market futures prices suggest the anticipation of ½ percentage
point of policy easing next year, an expectation that imparts financial stimulus to the
extent that it has been incorporated in other asset values.  If that stimulus is seen as
excessive, the Committee could use the statement as a means to make plainer its
assessment that the policy rate is more likely to rise than to fall.  In particular, the
Committee could strike the reassuring phrase “on balance” about recent inflation
readings in row 2 of Alternative B and add an explicit characterization of the odds of
future action in row 4.  For example, after explaining that inflation risks remain, the
Committee could add that “. . . policy is more likely to firm than ease going forward.”
","(15) In contrast, with overall economic activity apparently decelerating further in
the current quarter, inflation data for July more favorable than in preceding months,
and energy and other commodity prices down notably in recent weeks, the Committee
may now view the upside risks to inflation as having diminished somewhat and as
roughly balanced by the downside risks to economic activity.  If so, the Committee
may be attracted to Alternative A, under which the stance of policy would be
maintained at this meeting and the statement would no longer suggest a predilection
to firm policy going forward.  While moderate economic growth may be viewed as the
modal outcome under an unchanged federal funds rate, the downside risks to growth
may seem considerable in light of the most recent data pointing to a more
pronounced slowing in housing activity, a possibility that is illustrated by the “housing
slump” scenario in the Greenbook.  Moreover, the Committee may see the recent
decline in the prices of oil and other commodities as potentially signaling a slowdown
in global economic growth.  In any case, with the real federal funds rate at the upper
end of the range of model-based estimates of its equilibrium (Chart 7), policy may
now be in a stance that is consistent with below-potential economic growth going
forward, so that resource pressures are likely to diminish some.  And, if the
Committee believes that energy prices probably will not return to their higher levels of
Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) Page 17 of 36
Equilibrium Real Rate Chart: Explanatory Notes 
The equilibrium real rate is the real federal funds rate that, if maintained, would be projected to return output to its 
potential level over time.  For the first three measures listed below, the short-run equilibrium rate is defined as the 
rate that would close the output gap in twelve quarters given the corresponding model’s projection of the 
economy.  For the first two measures, the medium-run concept is the value of the real federal funds rate projected 
to keep output at potential in seven years under the assumption that monetary policy acts to bring actual and 
potential output into line in the short run and then keeps them equal thereafter.  The TIPS-based factor model 
measure provides an estimate of market expectations for the real federal funds rate seven years ahead.  The actual 
real federal funds rate is constructed as the difference between the nominal rate and realized inflation, where the 
nominal rate is measured as the quarterly average of the observed federal funds rate, and realized inflation is 
given by the log difference between the staff’s estimate of the core PCE price index and its lagged value four 
quarters earlier.  For the current quarter, the nominal rate is specified as the target federal funds rate on the 
Bluebook publication date.
Measure Description
Single-equation 
Model
The measure of the equilibrium real rate in the single-equation model is based on an 
estimated aggregate-demand relationship between the current value of the output gap and 
its lagged values as well as the lagged values of the real federal funds rate.  In light of this 
model’s simple structure, the short-run measure of the equilibrium real rate depends only 
on the recent position of output relative to potential, and the medium-run measure is 
virtually constant.
Small Structural 
Model
The small-scale model of the economy consists of equations for five variables: the output 
gap, the equity premium, the federal budget surplus, the trend growth rate of output, and 
the real bond yield.  Unlike the estimates from the single-equation model, values of the 
equilibrium real rate also depend directly on conditions associated with output growth, 
fiscal policy, and capital markets.
Large Model 
(FRB/US)
Estimates of the equilibrium real rate using FRB/US—the staff’s large-scale econometric 
model of the U.S. economy—depend on a very broad array of economic factors, some of 
which take the form of projected values of the model’s exogenous variables.  These 
projections make use of several simple forecasting rules which are appropriate for the 
three-year horizon relevant for the short-run concept but are less sensible over longer 
horizons.  Thus, we report only the short-run measure for the FRB/US model.
Greenbook-
consistent
Measures of the equilibrium real rate cannot be directly obtained from the Greenbook 
forecast, because the Greenbook is not based on a formal model.  Rather, we use the 
FRB/US model in conjunction with an extended version of the Greenbook forecast to 
derive a Greenbook-consistent measure.  FRB/US is first add-factored so that its 
simulation matches the extended Greenbook forecast, and then a second simulation is run 
off this baseline to determine the value of the real federal funds rate that closes the output 
gap.  The medium-run concept of the equilibrium real rate is not computed because it 
requires a relatively long extension of the Greenbook forecast.
TIPS-based 
Factor Model
Yields on TIPS (Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities) reflect investors’ expectations of 
the future path of real interest rates, but also include term and liquidity premiums.  The 
TIPS-based measure of the equilibrium real rate is constructed using the seven-year-ahead 
instantaneous real forward rate derived from TIPS yields as of the Bluebook publication 
date.  This forward rate is adjusted to remove estimates of the term and liquidity 
premiums based on a three-factor arbitrage-free term-structure model applied to TIPS 
yields, nominal yields, and inflation.  Because TIPS indexation is based on the total CPI, 
this measure is also adjusted for the medium-term difference—projected at 40 basis 
points—between total CPI inflation and core PCE inflation.
Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) Page 19 of 36
earlier this year, it may view inflation pressures as likely to ebb slowly, such as in the
Greenbook forecast.  If so, the Committee may not see particularly high odds that
policy will need to be tightened further.
","(16) The rationale for Alternative A could be similar to that for Alternative B,
except that the Committee may wish to note explicitly that recent inflation readings
have been slightly more favorable than those of previous months.  In the risk
assessment, the Committee would mention downside risks to growth and indicate that
future policy adjustments, implicitly in either direction, will depend on the
implications of incoming data for the outlook.
","(17) While market participants expect no policy action at this meeting, they do
not appear to anticipate a policy statement that identifies downside risks to growth
and that no longer hints at a possible need for additional firming.  Market participants
could read such a statement simply as a step in the transition to the policy easing that
is already foreseen; in this case, there would probably be only moderate effects on
other market prices.  But market participants might instead extrapolate from this
statement, inferring that the Committee was more likely to ease rates before long.  In
this latter case, the downward tilt to the market’s expected path for policy could
steepen somewhat, and shorter-term Treasury yields could decline a little.  The value
of the dollar on foreign exchange markets would likely edge lower, and stock prices
would rally.  The implications for long-term yields could depend in part on what
investors read into the announcement about the Committee’s longer-term inflation
","(18) If the FOMC expected stronger growth or higher inflation than the staff, or
if it saw the Greenbook forecast as credible but was unhappy with the forecast path
for inflation, it might wish to take another firming step at this meeting, as in
Alternative C.   The Committee’s concerns about the inflation outlook may have
been exacerbated by recent compensation and productivity data.  Moreover, in the
Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) Page 20 of 36
staff projection, core PCE inflation is projected to remain a bit above 2 percent until
late 2008—an outcome that would mark five consecutive years of elevated core
inflation relative to the objectives cited by a number of members of the Committee.
Overall inflation likewise is forecast to remain relatively high until 2008.  Given this
forecast, members may believe that acceptable progress toward price stability will
likely involve a somewhat firmer stance of monetary policy over coming quarters than
assumed by the staff.  Even if the Committee found the rate of decline in inflation
forecast in the Greenbook to be generally acceptable, it might wish to firm policy
another step at this meeting to provide more assurance that inflation was headed
","(19) An announcement associated with Alternative C could, as in the August
statement, indicate that growth “has moderated” and, as in the other alternatives, drop
the word “gradual” in characterizing the cooling of the housing market.  The first
sentence in the inflation paragraph could also be similar to the one in the August
statement, but it might include the phrase “on balance” to acknowledge implicitly the
lower inflation figures published for July.  Rather than repeat the expectation that
inflation pressures would moderate, the Committee could state that it took the firming
action to foster a decline in inflation.  The Committee might also want to indicate
that, despite the firming step, it continued to be concerned with inflation risks, as it
was in August, and again reference the possibility of additional firming.  If, by
contrast, the Committee saw such a step as a final “insurance” move against inflation,
the risk assessment section could take a neutral position and simply indicate that
future policy adjustments will depend on the evolution of the economic outlook,
thereby suggesting that the Committee no longer had a predisposition to firm policy.
","(20) The tightening of policy and the statement shown under Alternative C of
Table 1 would come as a considerable surprise to market participants.  Investors
would likely conclude that at least one more policy firming action was in store after
Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) Page 21 of 36
the action at this meeting.  Nominal money market rates and shorter-term coupon
yields would rise sharply.  Real rates further out the curve could also increase, but
nominal long-term yields could decline if market participants concluded that the
FOMC was seeking a steeper decline and had a lower ultimate objective for inflation
than they had previously perceived.  With real rates higher, the foreign exchange value
of the dollar would likely rise, and equity prices would probably decline.  However, if
the Committee instead opted to remove the reference to future firming and to suggest
that it saw the risks as balanced after the move, these market responses would likely
be muted considerably.
Money and Debt Forecasts
","(21) Under the Greenbook forecast, M2 growth is projected to average about
expansion of nominal income and the lagged effects of past policy tightening on
opportunity costs.  The velocity of M2 is forecast to rise 1½ percent over 2006, after
increasing at an average annual rate of 1¾ percent in the previous two years.  Over
rate, about in line with nominal income, as opportunity costs level out and then
decline slightly in response to the cessation of policy tightening.
","(22) Household debt is expected to slow noticeably over the next several
quarters.  The rate of expansion of home mortgage debt declines considerably,
reflecting lower residential investment and sharply decelerating home prices.  The
growth rate of business debt is also projected to decline a little, mainly as a result of
much slower commercial mortgage borrowing compared with its torrid pace of recent
years.  Federal sector debt is forecast to expand at a bit more than a 6 percent annual
rate on average over the forecast period.  All told, the growth of domestic

2007-06-27,2007-06-28,"(1) The anticipated path of the federal funds rate embedded in financial market
prices rotated up sharply over the intermeeting period (Chart 1).  Only a small portion
of this change, however, was posted on the heels of the May 9th FOMC meeting.  The
decision to leave the federal funds rate target unchanged at 5¼ percent accorded with
market expectations, but some market participants were reportedly surprised by the
retention of the assessment that inflation was “somewhat elevated.”1  There was little
market response to the publication of the minutes of the meeting.  Over the
intermeeting period, however, investors seemed to reappraise their beliefs that the
economic expansion would slow and that monetary policy easing would be
forthcoming, based in part on monetary policy communications and the release of
some more-favorable-than-expected economic data in the United States and abroad.
","(2) Futures quotes indicate that market participants now expect the FOMC to
leave the target federal funds rate unchanged through the end of this year and see only
about 25 basis points of easing by the end of 2008, about 60 basis points less than at
the time of the May FOMC meeting.  As indicated in the Desk’s recent survey,
primary dealers also envision policy being on hold for some time, with a number of
firms abandoning their forecasts for rate cuts this year.  These revisions were
associated with a marked decline in the weight attached to lower interest rates in the
option-implied distributions of future federal funds rates, and measures of uncertainty
about the near-term path of policy narrowed to historical lows.
","(3) Yields on nominal Treasury securities rose sharply over the intermeeting
period, with two-year rates increasing 30 basis points and ten-year rates gaining about
forward rates across the yield curve, with the most pronounced gains posted in
forward rates three to five years ahead.  Real rates accounted for the bulk of the
increase.  TIPS-based inflation compensation for the next five years edged lower on
net, but five-to-ten-year-ahead inflation compensation rose about 20 basis points.
Survey measures of inflation expectations posted mixed changes.  According to staff
models, the pickup in real yields at distant horizons owed primarily to increases in real
term premiums, while about half of the increase in inflation compensation at the long
end of the curve reflected increases in inflation expectations.  (See box entitled “More
on Recent Interest Rate Developments.”)
","(4) Equity markets were volatile at times during the intermeeting period, but
broad stock price indexes gained about 1 percent, on net, as the boost from largely
favorable news on the economy and announcements of mergers and acquisitions
outweighed the drag of higher bond yields (Chart 2).  The implied volatility of the
S&P 500 edged up on net, but remained low by historical standards.  Yields on
investment-grade corporate bonds increased about in line with those on nominal
Treasury securities of comparable maturity.  In contrast, yields on speculative-grade
corporate bonds rose less, leaving risk spreads about 20 basis points narrower.
Corporate credit quality remained solid, with realized and expected default rates
staying very low.
","(5) Despite the substantial declines in bond prices posted over the intermeeting
period, fixed-income markets generally functioned smoothly, with elevated Treasury
trading volumes and normal bid-asked spreads.  However, credit conditions in
markets for assets backed by subprime mortgages deteriorated notably in some cases.
For example, spreads on indexes of subprime credit default swaps rose steadily, and
Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) Page 3 of 42
More on Recent Interest Rate Developments
 
The increase in shorter-term Treasury yields over the 
intermeeting period appeared to reflect a revised outlook for 
monetary policy.  About half of the 30 basis point move in two-
year yields occurred in the narrow windows bracketing FOMC 
communications and economic data releases.  Apparently in 
response to incoming news, as well as a more general change in 
sentiment, most of the remaining primary dealers who had been 
predicting policy easing this year threw in the towel and now 
forecast policy to be on hold for some time.  Short-term yields 
around the globe also increased, as data pointed to somewhat 
stronger growth and higher inflation in a number of countries, 
and some foreign central banks either tightened policy or 
signaled increased concern about inflationary pressures. 
 
The shift in the economic outlook was likely the prime mover of 
longer-term rates as well, but mortgage convexity hedging flows 
reportedly amplified these upward movements in rates.  Swap 
spreads widened and swaption-implied volatility rose, as 
investors sought to trim longer-dated exposures when the 
effective duration of their mortgage holdings lengthened.  
However, the rise in swap rates was considerably smaller than 
during past episodes when convexity hedging likely played a 
significant role.  Moreover, the staff estimates that only a small 
amount of mortgages was economically refinanceable even 
before the rise in mortgage rates.   
 
Over this intermeeting period, changes in option-based 
measures of interest rate uncertainty have been mixed, as 
implied volatilities on short-term rates declined and those on 
longer-term rates rose.  However, the reduced skew of the 
implied distributions of expected funds rates in the near term 
may go some way in helping to explain movements in term 
premiums.  Market participants now evidently see the risks to 
the outlook for short-term interest rates as more symmetric, as 
opposed to tilted sharply to the downside, and borrowers may 
be willing to pay a higher term premium to avoid the risk of 
having to roll over debt at higher short-term rates in the future.

some of the indexes reached new highs.  Reflecting the weakness in these markets,
and perhaps reinforcing them as well, were the well-publicized difficulties at two
medium-sized hedge funds managed by Bear Stearns Asset Management.  The funds
were positioned to gain from an improvement in subprime credit quality, and when
the market worsened instead, the resulting losses led to massive liquidity pressures on
at least one of the two funds.  Following unsuccessful negotiations to reach a
workout, some counterparties moved to take collateral and close out positions.
Actual and anticipated sales of fund assets raised concerns that the resulting
downward pressure on prices could lead to significant losses among market
participants.  These concerns were exacerbated by the high degree of uncertainty
about the valuation of subprime assets, particularly CDOs.  Spillover effects of the
funds’ difficulties have apparently been modest thus far, although spreads on some
lower-quality corporate credit derivative indexes also widened this week.  Market
participants report no other sizable hedge funds with similar problems.  Credit
exposures to the two funds are widely dispersed, and CDS spreads for the creditor
firms have generally moved up only a few basis points.  Bear Stearns’s CDS spread
has risen more, but it remains near the peak it reached during the period of volatility
in late February and early March.
","(6) The foreign exchange value of the dollar was little changed on balance over
the intermeeting period against a trade-weighted index of major foreign currencies
(Chart 3).  The dollar fell 3 percent against the Canadian dollar, but rose 3 percent
against the Japanese yen and by smaller amounts against most other major currencies.
Day-to-day movements in foreign government bond yields were highly correlated
with fluctuations in U.S. longer-term rates, with yields abroad increasing 25 to 50 basis
points, on net, somewhat less than in the United States.  As in the United States, most
of the increases in foreign nominal yields reflected changes in real yields, which were
boosted by stronger-than-expected indicators of economic growth and prospects for
Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) Page 6 of 42
tighter monetary policy.  Major foreign stock markets posted modest gains.  As was
widely expected, the Bank of England and the European Central Bank raised their
policy rates 25 basis points.  In contrast, the Bank of Canada and the Bank of Japan
left their policy rates unchanged during the intermeeting period.  However, strong
data releases and a hawkish policy statement by the Bank of Canada appeared to buoy
the Canadian dollar and fuel the relatively large advance in Canadian bond yields
relative to those in other foreign industrial countries.2
","(7) The value of the dollar was down slightly over the intermeeting period
against an index of currencies of our other important trading partners, led by a
renminbi.  Local-currency bond yields rose 30 to 60 basis points in emerging Asia and
Eastern Europe.  Spreads on dollar-denominated issues in emerging markets, much
like those in U.S. speculative-grade markets, declined slightly.  Stock prices in most
emerging-market countries recorded solid gains over the period, including in China
despite a sharp drop at the end of May related to the increase of a tax on equity
","(8) The debt of domestic nonfinancial sectors appears to be expanding at a
registered in the first quarter (Chart 4).  The slowdown is primarily attributable to a
decline in debt growth for the federal government, which has resulted from more-
than-seasonally strong tax receipts.  Business debt is estimated to be rising at a robust
Both bond issuance and growth in business loans have been brisk.  Bank lending
standards and terms remain quite accommodative, with information from the
Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) Page 8 of 42
syndicated loan market indicating narrow spreads, high leverage, and an erosion in
loan covenants.  With house prices continuing to be soft, home sales sluggish, and
mortgage rates moving higher, growth of home mortgage debt is estimated to be
slowing slightly to a 6 percent annual rate in the second quarter, while the overall
expansion of consumer credit appears modest at a 4¼ percent rate.
","(9) Smoothing through tax-related fluctuations, M2 grew at a 6 percent average
annual rate in April and May, following surprisingly strong expansion in the first
quarter.  The moderation was broad-based and led by a decline in liquid deposit
growth to a pace more in line with that of nominal income.  Retail money market
mutual funds and small time deposits also decelerated.  Currency growth continued to
be modest, likely reflecting weak foreign demand.
Economic Outlook through 2008
","(10) In response to incoming data over the intermeeting period, the staff marked
up its assessment of the pace of growth in the second quarter but changed the broad
contours of the forecast thereafter relatively little from those in the May Greenbook.
Smoothing through volatile quarterly readings, real GDP is now seen as expanding at
around a 2 percent annualized rate in the first half of this year; the pace of real GDP
growth is forecast to pick up to 2¼ percent in the remainder of 2007 and 2½ percent
in 2008.  As a consequence, the labor market is expected to be slightly tighter than in
the previous Greenbook, with the unemployment rate predicted to rise slowly, but to
remain below 5 percent―the staff’s estimate of the NAIRU―throughout the forecast
period.  The staff forecast continues to be predicated on the assumption that the
federal funds rate will be held at 5¼ percent until the end of 2008.  Following the
substantial upward shift in investors’ policy expectations over the intermeeting period,
this trajectory is now very similar to that implied by money market futures quotes.
Consequently, with little expected change in term premiums, longer-term interest rates
Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) Page 10 of 42
are projected to remain near their current higher levels.  Equity prices are expected to
rise at a rate sufficient to generate risk-adjusted returns comparable to those on fixed-
income investments.  The foreign exchange value of the dollar is assumed to
depreciate 2 percent per year―a somewhat faster pace than in the May forecast.  Spot
oil prices are still expected to move somewhat higher, as informed by futures market
quotes.  Recent favorable inflation readings led the staff to lower the core inflation
forecast slightly.  The staff now expects core PCE inflation to average 2 percent both
this year and next.  Total PCE inflation is projected to be nearly 3 percent this year,
boosted by higher energy and other commodity prices, before falling back to
","(11) In the survey of economic projections taken for the May meeting, the
central tendency of FOMC participants’ forecasts for real GDP growth was 2 to
forecasts for core PCE inflation was 2.1 to 2.3 percent this year and 1.8 to 2.1 percent
next year.  The May Greenbook projection was at the bottom of the central tendency
of FOMC participants’ forecasts for growth and the top of the central tendency of
their forecasts for inflation.
Medium-Term Strategies
","(12) To provide a longer-term perspective on the economic outlook and possible
monetary policy strategies, optimal control simulations of the FRB/US model were
conducted using the staff’s extension of the Greenbook forecast beyond 2008.3
These simulations employ a new benchmark specification of the model equation that
determines the evolution of the long-run inflation expectations of wage and price
setters, which are now assumed to respond not only to movements in actual
Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) Page 11 of 42
inflation—as in previous Bluebooks—but also to shifts in the nominal federal funds
rate and the output gap.4  Because long-run inflation expectations in the previous
specification responded quite slowly to changes in actual inflation, disinflation came
at a relatively high cost in terms of cumulative labor market slack.  In contrast,
the new specification implies that a shift in monetary policy directly affects the
public’s perception of the central bank’s inflation goal and hence their long-run
inflation expectations.  As a result, the costs of a policy-induced disinflation in
FRB/US are lower than presented in previous Bluebooks and are now in closer
alignment with the staff’s judgmental assessment.5
","(13) Chart 5 shows optimal control simulations of the FRB/US model in which
policymakers’ inflation goal is either 1½ percent or 2 percent.6  For an inflation goal
of 2 percent (the right-hand set of charts), the optimal control simulation prescribes
a federal funds rate path that remains close to 5¼ percent through early 2009 and
then declines gradually to just above 4 percent by the end of 2012; from late 2008
forward, the unemployment rate is near the 5 percent NAIRU, and core inflation
is close to the 2 percent goal (solid lines).  This optimal policy outcome is similar to
that shown in the May Bluebook (dotted lines); furthermore, the change to the
Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) Page 12 of 42
model’s specification is of little consequence in this case because long-run inflation
expectations are already aligned with both actual inflation and the inflation goal, as
they were in the May extended Greenbook baseline.  By contrast, with an inflation
goal of 1½ percent (the left-hand set of charts), the optimal funds rate rises to above
by 2012.  Core inflation beyond 2008 stays lower than in the May Bluebook, but
this difference is mainly due to the revised specification of the FRB/US model.
In particular, if the May optimal-control policy is re-computed using the new model
specification reflecting more rapid adjustment in long-run inflation expectations
(dashed lines), core inflation descends more quickly toward the 1½ percent goal than
was shown in the May Bluebook, accompanied by a virtually identical path for
the unemployment rate.  Another factor influencing inflation dynamics, the degree
of global integration in product markets, is discussed in the box on “International
Dimensions of Monetary Policy.”
","(14) As shown in Chart 6, the current level of the real funds rate, 3.3 percent,
is identical to the Greenbook-consistent estimate of short-run r*—the value of the
real federal funds rate that would put the level of real GDP at that of its potential
twelve quarters ahead—and 100 basis points or more higher than the three model-
based estimates of short-run r*.  The Greenbook-consistent and model-based r* differ
because the former incorporates the staff’s judgment on current-quarter data and
forces not captured in the three models—including staff projections of conditioning
factors that differ from the automated projections used by the three models.
The Greenbook-consistent measure has been marked up about 20 basis points over
the intermeeting period, largely in response to incoming data pointing to somewhat
stronger consumption, business fixed investment, and net exports.  Model-based
estimates of medium-run r*—the value of the real funds rate consistent with keeping
Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) Page 14 of 42
International Dimensions of Monetary Policy
 
A number of channels have been suggested through which the 
increased mobility of goods, capital, and labor may alter the 
economic landscape in which monetary policy operates, and the 
staff routinely takes these considerations into account in its current 
analysis and projections.  As an example of such a channel, in a 
more open economy, imports may better serve as a “release valve’’ 
for excess aggregate demand, damping its effects on output and 
inflation. 
 
This box explores these issues using SIGMA, a multi-country 
dynamic stochastic general equilibrium model used for policy 
analysis developed in the Division of International Finance.   
SIGMA is sufficiently rich in behavioral and sectoral detail to 
encompass a variety of mechanisms through which increased global 
integration can alter the dynamic properties of the macroeconomy.   
Based on work by Erceg, Gust, and Lopez-Salido, this box presents 
an analysis of how greater openness in product markets can alter 
the effects of domestic and foreign aggregate demand shocks on 
the U.S. economy and highlights the implications of these changes 
for the conduct of monetary policy.1 
 
Consider the macroeconomic effects of a persistent 1 percent 
autonomous rise in domestic aggregate demand in alternative 
specifications of the model that differ only in the degree of trade 
openness.  In each of the four panels to the right, the benchmark 
specification (solid line) corresponds to a trade share—the average 
of exports and imports—calibrated in the model to 14 percent of 
output, roughly in line with current U.S. data.  In contrast, in the 
nearly closed scenario (dashed red line) trade accounts for only 5 
percent of domestic output, close to the U.S. trade share of about 
forty years ago.  Finally, under the specification with higher 
openness (dotted blue line) this share climbs to 25 percent, roughly 
around the recent experience of the United Kingdom and, 
conceivably, the degree of U.S. trade openness in a few decades if 
global integration continues its post-World War II pace.  
 
In all three specifications, increased domestic spending prompts 
monetary policy to tighten, causing real interest rates to rise (first 
panel).  The combination of higher real interest rates and an 
induced appreciation of the dollar (not shown) limits the initial 
expansion of output and helps bring it back to baseline, in part 
through a decline in the trade balance (fourth panel).  However, 
consumer price inflation rises (third panel) because the Taylor rule 
employed in these simulations does not tighten policy enough to 
keep output (second panel) from expanding above potential.

As can been seen in the comparison of these three specifications in 
the previous page, the degree of openness affects the magnitude of 
the U.S. economy’s response to domestic shocks.  With greater 
openness, more of the increase in aggregate demand is satisfied 
through higher imports, implying a larger deterioration in the trade 
balance, a smaller increase in GDP, and less pressure on domestic 
resources.  Furthermore, the appreciation of the dollar reduces U.S. 
import prices, and with a larger share of trade in output, the 
resulting downward pressure on domestic prices is magnified.  
Accordingly, increased global integration of product markets helps 
monetary policy to stabilize the economy in the face of domestic 
spending shocks, as smaller hikes in interest rates are needed to 
keep output close to potential and to contain inflationary pressures.  
 
Increased openness, however, may also make the economy more 
vulnerable to external shocks.  The response to a 1 percent 
autonomous increase in foreign aggregate demand is shown in the 
four panels on this page.  Under all three calibrations, the 
combination of higher foreign activity and an induced depreciation 
of the dollar (as foreign interest rates rise relative to U.S. rates) 
stimulate U.S. real net exports, causing both U.S. output and 
inflation to rise.  The boost in exports is clearly more substantial 
the greater the openness of the economy, which also amplifies the 
effect of higher import prices on aggregate inflation.  Thus, not 
surprisingly, greater openness magnifies the effects on the domestic 
economy of an expansion in foreign aggregate demand, and 
requires a tighter monetary policy stance to keep inflation 
contained.   
 
Overall, these model simulations suggest that increased trade 
openness is likely to have modest, though noticeable, implications 
for how domestic shocks affect U.S. real activity and inflation. 
These simulations also highlight the extent to which openness 
increases the susceptibility of the economy to foreign 
developments.

output at potential at a seven-year horizon—are both around 2¼ percent, just above
the TIPS-based measure of about 2.1 percent.
","(15) The upper panels of Chart 7 depict model- and market-based assessments
of the monetary policy outlook through the end of 2012.  In the absence of shocks,
the estimated outcome-based policy rule prescribes a funds rate path that declines
gradually to about 4 percent.  Stochastic simulations of the FRB/US model indicate
a 70 percent probability that the prescriptions of the outcome-based rule will fall
in a range between 2½ and 6½ percent during 2012.  Relative to these simulations,
information from both in- and out-of-the-money interest rate caps suggests that
investors see less uncertainty but more downside skewness regarding the prospective
path of policy at longer horizons (see box entitled “Assessing the Implied
Distribution of Funds Rates at Longer Horizons using Interest Rate Caps”).
In contrast to the outcome-based rule, Taylor rules prescribe a lower funds rate
path for the near term than in the May Bluebook, reflecting a decrease in the forecast
of the core PCE inflation rate for the current quarter.
Short-Run Policy Alternatives
","(16) This Bluebook presents three policy alternatives for the Committee’s
consideration, summarized in Table 1.  Under Alternative A, the Committee lowers
the target federal funds rate 25 basis points to 5 percent.  Alternative B maintains the
target for the federal funds rate at 5¼ percent.  Alternative C envisions the
Committee tightening by 25 basis points, to bring the target rate to 5½ percent.  As
for the wording of the statement, economic growth appears to have rebounded in the
second quarter from its anemic first-quarter pace.  Accordingly, the reference in the
previous statement indicating that “economic growth slowed in the first part of the
year” is updated in all three alternatives to indicate that the economy appears to have
expanded at a moderate pace so far this year.  This assessment is intended to smooth
Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) Page 18 of 42
ExtenExad fall Assessing the Implied Distribution of Funds Rates at Longer Horizons using 
Interest Rate Caps 
 
The degree of uncertainty around the expected path of the federal funds rate can be assessed 
using implied volatilities derived from interest rate options.  Beginning with the January 
Bluebook, prices on interest rate caps, which are sequences of call options on three-month 
LIBOR, have been used to construct the confidence intervals for the funds rate shown 
through 2012 in Chart 7.1  Until this Bluebook, those estimates have been based solely on 
price quotes for at-the-money options, and following convention, it was assumed that 
interest rates were log-normally distributed.  By construction, the estimated distribution of 
interest rates was skewed somewhat toward higher rates.   
 
Recently, Board staff have analyzed in- and out-of-the-money interest rate caps to obtain 
information on the possible skew in the distribution of short-term interest rates.2  This 
analysis is broadly similar to the construction of the distribution of the expected federal 
funds rate six months ahead derived from options on Eurodollar futures that is shown in 
Chart 1.  Based on interest rate caps, the staff can now calculate risk-neutral, non-parametric 
probability density functions of future short-term rates from the near term to very distant 
horizons and monitor the width and skew of these distributions.   
 
These estimates generally suggest that the assumption that interest rates are log-normally 
distributed results in an underestimation of the weight market participants put on very low 
rates.  Over the last two years, the lower bound of the 90 percent confidence band about six 
years hence based on these density functions has been about 70 basis points below that 
derived from confidence intervals under the log-normal assumption.

balances the upside risk to inflation.

both inflation and economic growth,

through the quarterly variation that has largely been driven by transitory factors.  Core
inflation data for recent months have been benign, with the twelve-month change in
the core PCE deflator dropping to 2 percent in April for the first time since March of
last year.  The draft language for all three alternatives acknowledges these favorable
readings, but the alternatives differ notably in their assessment of inflation going
forward.  As usual, the Committee could consider combining elements from more
than one alternative.
","(17) If the Committee continues to view the current policy stance as likely to
foster a return of output to potential and sustain the recent moderation of inflation, as
in the staff forecast, then it may wish to choose Alternative B, under which the
federal funds rate is maintained at 5¼ percent.  In the staff analysis underlying the
Greenbook forecast, the real federal funds rate is seen as near its equilibrium value
(Chart 6), suggesting that the current stance of policy is likely to reduce pressures on
resources over time.  Additionally, the current target for the funds rate is very close to
prescriptions for near-term policy obtained from optimal policy simulations with a
While financial conditions tightened substantially over the intermeeting period,
Committee members may view this development as merely bringing forward an
adjustment they had anticipated would occur before long, suggesting that no policy
offset is necessary.  The Committee might also judge that maintaining its current
policy stance for the time being would provide a reasonable weighting of the risks that
weakness in housing could eventually have a more pronounced effect on overall
economic activity and that the recent moderation in inflation could prove temporary.
","(18) The draft statement accompanying Alternative B reiterates the view that the
economy seems likely to expand at a moderate pace over coming quarters.  Following
benign inflation readings, the draft language drops both the characterization of the
level of core inflation as “somewhat elevated” and the prediction that inflation seems
Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) Page 22 of 42
likely to moderate from its current level.  Instead, the statement acknowledges the
recent favorable information while expressing the view that the high level of resource
utilization has the potential to sustain price pressures.  This language would be
intended to indicate that incoming data point to a slowing in core inflation but, given
that monthly inflation readings are noisy, to suggest that the Committee is awaiting
more data before being satisfied that the moderation in inflation will be sustained.
The statement would conclude by indicating that the Committee’s predominant policy
concern remains the upside risk to inflation, with the language modified for
consistency with the inflation paragraph.
","(19) Market participants do not expect a change in the funds rate at this meeting
and judging from the Desk’s survey of primary dealers, most expect only minor
modifications to the text of the accompanying statement.  The revisions to the
inflation paragraph under Alternative B would likely garner considerable attention.
Investors would not overlook the deletion of the “somewhat elevated” language and
would probably infer that the Committee believes that its prior expectation for
moderating core inflation is on track.  Particularly in light of the revisions to the risk
assessment, markets might also interpret the overall statement as signaling that the
Committee finds 2 percent to be an acceptable level of core inflation.  Market
participants would most likely mark down their expectations for the path of the
federal funds rate.  Equities would rally, and the foreign exchange value of the dollar
would depreciate.  Long-term bond yields might edge lower, but that fall could be
tempered, or even reversed, if the statement led investors to mark up their long-run
inflation expectations.
","(20) The large rise in real yields and the resilience of equity markets over the
intermeeting period could be interpreted as an indication that investors have marked
up their growth expectations, anticipate greater pressures on resources, and
correspondingly expect a more restrictive stance of policy.  Indeed, judging from
Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) Page 23 of 42
options on Eurodollar futures, investors now place about one-third odds on monetary
policy tightening within the next year.  Under this interpretation, there is a risk that if
investors come to perceive resource markets as taut and do not see the Committee
adopting a more restrictive policy, then inflation expectations could continue to rise.
If the Committee is especially concerned by this risk, it might prefer to tighten
meeting might be seen as the best way to mitigate the risk of an updrift in inflation
expectations and reassure markets that the Committee will indeed tighten as necessary
to keep inflation contained.  Members may also be concerned about the possibility
that increases in energy and commodity prices could lead to greater price pressures
than currently foreseen by the staff.  Moreover, the optimal policy path shown in
","(22) A tightening of monetary policy at this meeting would take financial
markets aback.  Short-term interest rates and option-implied volatility of money
market rates would surely rise.  However, inflation compensation and distant-horizon
forward yields could well fall as the announcement would likely lower long-run
inflation expectations.  The net effect on long-term yields is thus ambiguous.  The
foreign exchange value of the dollar would probably appreciate, and equity prices
would likely decline.
","(23) Against the backdrop of the recent sharp rise in interest rates and an already
weak housing market and following a number of benign inflation readings, members
may feel that the risk of unacceptably sluggish economic growth is now greater than
the upside risk to inflation.  If so, the Committee might wish to lower the target
federal funds rate by 25 basis points as in Alternative A.  The Committee might view
the recent backup in long-term yields as owing mainly to an exogenous rebound in
term premiums from an abnormally low level.  A rising term premium could dampen
consumer and business spending and further weaken the housing market, a possibility
explored in the Greenbook alternative simulation “Tighter financial conditions.”  In
light of this possibility, the Committee may believe that a lower federal funds rate is
required to maintain the desired strength of aggregate demand.  Furthermore, with
low unemployment not clearly boosting labor costs, the Committee might think that
the NAIRU could well be lower than currently estimated by the staff—as in the
“lower NAIRU” Greenbook alternative scenario.  In this case, it may judge that a
slightly more accommodative stance of monetary policy would run little risk of
stoking inflationary pressures, especially since the real funds rate is now above the
range of model-based estimates of its equilibrium.
","(24) The statement in Alternative A would continue to note that the economy
seems most likely to expand at a moderate pace.  But the Committee may perceive the
downside risk to that forecast emanating from the housing sector as being greater
Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) Page 25 of 42
than it was in May, owing to the backup in mortgage interest rates.  Accordingly, the
draft language highlights this risk by placing it in a separate sentence at the end of the
second paragraph and by pointing explicitly to “ongoing weakness” in the housing
sector rather than “ongoing adjustment.”  In the inflation paragraph, the reference to
core inflation being elevated would be deleted and replaced by the assessment that
core inflation has edged lower and is likely to remain moderate, implicitly placing
considerable weight on the recent inflation news.  The statement could conclude by
noting that even after the 25 basis point easing, the downside risk to the Committee’s
growth objective is roughly offset by the upside risk to its inflation objective, and that
future policy adjustments will depend on the evolution of the outlook for both
inflation and economic growth.
","(25) An easing of monetary policy at this meeting would come as a complete
surprise to investors, particularly in the wake of the recent jump in policy
expectations.  Short-term interest rates would fall appreciably and option-implied
volatility in fixed-income markets would rise.  The effect on longer-term interest rates
is less clear.  Investors might interpret the announcement as signaling that the
economy is weaker than they had previously thought, driving long-term yields down.
Alternatively, the announcement might lead investors to mark up their expectations
for inflation and to demand a larger inflation risk premium, boosting long-term yields.
The effects on equity markets and the foreign-exchange value of the dollar are
likewise ambiguous, depending on how investors update their forecasts for inflation
and growth in light of the surprise decision.

2007-12-11,2007-12-11,"(1) After showing some signs of improvement in late September and October,
conditions in financial markets worsened over the intermeeting period.  Despite
economic data releases that were on balance only slightly weaker than expected,
Treasury yields and the expected path for the federal funds rate fell sharply amid
reports of sizable losses at several large financial institutions and increased concerns
over the economic outlook.  Short-term Treasury instruments benefited from flight-
to-quality flows as investors reduced their exposure to risky assets.  Heightened
worries about counterparty risk, as well as the effects of balance sheet constraints and
liquidity pressures, affected interbank funding markets and commercial paper markets,
where spreads over risk-free rates rose to levels that were, in some cases, higher than
those seen in August.  Strains in those markets were no doubt exacerbated by
concerns related to year-end pressures.  In longer-term corporate markets, both
investment- and speculative-grade credit spreads widened considerably; issuance
slowed but remained strong.  Equity prices declined, on net, with financial stocks
especially hard hit.  In housing finance, subprime mortgage markets stayed virtually
shut and spreads on jumbo loans apparently widened a good bit further.  Spreads on
conforming products also increased, following reports of sizable losses and
consequent reduced capital ratios at the housing GSEs.
Monetary Policy Expectations and Treasury Yields
","(2)  The FOMC’s decision at its October meeting to reduce the target federal
funds rate by 25 basis points to 4½ percent was largely expected by market
participants, although the assessment that upside risks to inflation balanced the
downside risks to growth was not fully anticipated and apparently led investors to
revise up slightly the expected path for policy.1  The release of the FOMC minutes,
including the summary of economic projections, elicited only a modest market
reaction.  Similarly, data releases—which apparently came in, on balance, only slightly
weaker than investors expected—left policy expectations little changed on net.
However, concerns about the potential adverse effects on credit availability and
economic growth of sizable losses at large financial institutions and of financial
market strains in general pushed the expected path of policy down substantially.
Market participants have priced in a total of about 150 basis points of policy easing by
early 2009 (Chart 1), about 80 basis points more than at the time of the October
meeting.  Judging from quotes on federal funds target binary options, investors are
virtually certain of a rate cut at the upcoming FOMC meeting, and assign about
easing.  Respondents to the Desk’s recent survey of primary dealers also anticipated
easing, but placed lower odds on a 50 basis point cut than suggested by market
Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) 2 of 43
quotes.  Most respondents predicted that the Committee will put more emphasis on
downside risks to growth than in the October statement.  In addition, some dealers
expect that the spread of the primary credit rate over the target funds rate will be
narrowed.  Uncertainty about the path for policy increased slightly, on net, from its
already high levels, and the option-implied distribution of the federal funds rate six
months ahead retained a substantial skew to the downside.
","(3) Yields on two-year nominal Treasury securities fell about 80 basis points, on
net, over the intermeeting period, about in line with the revision to policy
expectations.  Ten-year Treasury yields dropped about 30 basis points.  The
steepening of the yield curve owed mostly to sharply lower short- and intermediate-
term forward rates, consistent with investors’ apparently more pessimistic outlook for
economic growth.  TIPS yields fell by less than their nominal counterparts, implying
modest declines in inflation compensation at both the five-year and longer horizons.
Money Markets
","(4) After showing signs of improvement between the September and October
FOMC meetings, conditions in money markets subsequently worsened, with the
deterioration reflected partly in large premiums for funding over year-end.  (See box
“Flight-to-Quality Flows and Year-end Pressures.”)  Large financial institutions
reported an additional $35 billion in losses over the intermeeting period, and investors
appear concerned that even more writedowns may be forthcoming.  Term bank
funding markets came under considerable pressure, and spreads of term libor and
federal funds rates over those on comparable-maturity overnight index swaps widened
sharply and now exceed their September peaks.  Conditions in European interbank
money markets also deteriorated over the intermeeting period, as term spreads
expanded by about 30 basis points in euro markets and in sterling markets.  In the
United States, outstanding asset-backed commercial paper (ABCP) continued to
Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) 4 of 43
-  
Flight-to-Quality Flows and Year-end Pressures
Substantial actual and anticipated losses at financial firms increased 
pressures on institutions’ liquidity and balance sheet capacity and 
boosted investors’ concerns about counterparty credit risk over the 
intermeeting period.  These developments contributed to renewed 
flight-to-quality flows and, in money markets, generated year-end 
pressures which have largely been absent in recent years.  Investors 
have apparently shifted their demand toward safe securities such as 
Treasury bills and away from risky assets such as uncollateralized 
loans to banks.  Despite an increased supply of bills in November, 
bill yields have declined sharply over recent weeks amid heavy 
inflows to money market mutual funds that hold only Treasury and 
agency securities.  The spread of the three-month overnight indexed 
swap (OIS) rate over the comparable-maturity Treasury bill yield―a 
plausible proxy for safe-haven demands―climbed about 50 basis 
points over the intermeeting period, though it remained below the 
peak reached in August.  Meanwhile, the spread of three-month libor 
over the corresponding OIS rate―a measure of term premiums in 
short-term funding markets―widened about 60 basis points to its 
highest level during the recent period of financial market turmoil.  
Some tiering was evident in uncollateralized funding markets:  
Domestic and large European institutions were able to borrow at 
rates close to the libor fixing, but smaller European institutions faced 
a substantial premium.
While forward rates suggest that concerns about counterparty credit 
risk are expected to persist well into next year, market stress is 
particularly acute in rates that span the turn of the year.  The one-
week forward Treasury bill yield that encompasses the year-turn has 
fallen to around 1 percent, apparently reflecting financial institutions’ 
desire to show more of the safest assets on their year-end books.  
Markets expect the provision of liquidity by the Desk to be generous 
over year-end:  A comparison of futures on the effective federal 
funds rate to quotes on target funds rate options implies that 
investors expect federal funds to trade about 100 basis points below 
the target on the last day of the year.  Nevertheless, pressures on 
banks’ balance sheets and concerns about liquidity and counterparty 
credit risk have made financial institutions reluctant to lend over 
year-end and have fueled precautionary demand for such funding.  
As a result, the spread of one-month libor over the corresponding 
OIS rate jumped nearly 50 basis points as the maturity date on a one-
month deposit crossed into the new year.  The implied premium for 
funding on the last day of the year is about 700 basis points at an 
annual rate―a level that is extremely high by the standards of recent 
years, though still a little below that reached in the runup to Y2K.  
One-month libor is now 24 basis points above the primary credit 
rate, yet term borrowing at the discount window remains limited, 
likely owing in part to perceived stigma of using the primary credit 
facility.  Significant year-end pressures can be observed in the 
commercial paper market as well.
Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) 5 of 43
contract in November (Chart 2), and spreads of ABCP yields over those on
comparable unsecured CP widened considerably.  In the unsecured sector, spreads on
lower-rated thirty-day paper also increased substantially, particularly as the term
extended over year-end, but overnight spreads widened only modestly.  The shares of
unsecured CP and ABCP issued over year-end are about in line with their year-ago
levels.  The outstanding amount of European asset-backed commercial paper
declined, as some money market funds reportedly scaled back holdings of ABCP in
advance of year-end.
","(5) Money market mutual funds experienced heavy inflows over the
intermeeting period, reflecting in part safe-haven demands.  Inflows were directed
primarily toward funds that invest only in Treasury and agency obligations,
contributing to a sharp fall in Treasury bill rates.  Similarly, strong demand for
Treasury collateral drove the overnight Treasury general collateral repo rate well
below the federal funds rate.  Lending from the SOMA securities portfolio has
increased in recent weeks, and the Desk relaxed some limits on the securities lending
program in response to the reduced liquidity in Treasury markets.2
Capital Markets
","(6) Yields on investment-grade corporate bonds edged up over the intermeeting
period, while those on speculative-grade bonds increased appreciably.  As a result,
spreads on both investment- and speculative-grade bonds over comparable-maturity
Treasury securities rose markedly and are now at their highest levels in several years.
Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) 6 of 43
The higher spreads appear to reflect both a reassessment of the credit quality of
nonfinancial corporations, perhaps induced by concerns about prospects for the
economic expansion, and an increase in investors’ risk aversion.  Bond issuance
slowed in November but remained strong.  In the leveraged loan market, the pipeline
of underwritten loans awaiting syndication diminished early in the period but is still
substantial.  Secondary market bid prices for leveraged loans dropped significantly in
November and are now below their levels in early August.  An index of credit default
swaps on leveraged syndicated loans (the LCDX) rose about 40 basis points, on net,
over the intermeeting period.  Broad-based equity indexes were volatile and ended the
period down 1½ to 2 percent.  Financial stocks were especially hard hit, dropping
about 5 percent.  The spread between the twelve-month forward trend-earnings-price
ratio for S&P 500 firms and a real long-run Treasury yield—a rough measure of the
equity premium—widened, consistent with investors pulling back from risk.  Option-
implied volatility on the S&P 500 remained elevated, at times rising back to near its
August peaks.  Yield ratios for the municipal bonds moved up sharply on investor
concerns about the financial health of bond insurers and possibly the fiscal outlooks
for state and local governments.
","(7) Credit availability for jumbo-mortgage borrowers continued to be tight, and
the spread between the offer rates on prime jumbo fixed-rate mortgages and
comparable conforming loans rose from already high levels.  Rates on conforming
mortgages fell, although not as much as yields on comparable-maturity Treasury
securities, implying a widening of spreads.  Issuance of residential mortgage-backed
securities (RMBS) backed by nonconforming loans continued to fall, while issuance of
those backed by conforming mortgages was robust.  Secondary markets for non-
agency RMBS remained largely inactive.  ABX spreads for most tranches widened
further for most of the intermeeting period, as investor confidence in subprime
RMBS and associated credit ratings continued to wane.  However, ABX spreads
Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) 8 of 43
dropped sharply late in the period amid reports that a plan to freeze rates on some
subprime mortgages was close to agreement.  Spreads on agency MBS rose sharply
after Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac announced large third-quarter losses, raising
concerns about their ability to offer refinancing options to some subprime borrowers.
Subsequently, these spreads retraced a substantial part of the increase.  (See box
“Recent Developments at Housing Intermediaries.”)
Market Functioning
","(8) In addition to the short-term funding impairments noted earlier, trading
conditions were strained in a range of markets over the intermeeting period.
Functioning in the Treasury bill market was notably impaired at times, and bid-asked
spreads on bills generally remained very wide.  Bid-asked spreads widened
substantially less for Treasury coupon securities, and while investors were willing to
pay significant premiums to hold on-the-run securities, overall liquidity remained
ample in that market.  Liquidity was somewhat diminished in corporate markets:
Trading volumes declined significantly in November, a proxy for bid-asked spreads
on corporate bonds widened, and trades appeared to have a larger-than-normal
impact on prices.  Bid-asked spreads for leveraged syndicated loans rose quite sharply
over the intermeeting period but remained below the peaks reached in early August.
Judging from the abnormally wide range of quotes submitted by various dealers for
the same reference entities, liquidity and price discovery were also impaired in CDS
markets, especially for financial institutions.  The subprime RMBS market remained
shut with virtually no trading taking place.  Strains were also evident at times in the
market for agency MBS, where bid-asked spreads widened noticeably following the
reports of large losses by the housing GSEs before retracing part of that move more
recently.  That market may also have been affected by year-end pressures as some
investors are reportedly reluctant to hold mortgage products in their portfolios at the
Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) 9 of 43
Recent Developments at Housing Intermediaries
Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac reported third-quarter losses of $1.4 billion and $2 billion, 
respectively, over the intermeeting period, reflecting in part an increase in actual and projected 
credit losses on the mortgages they guarantee or hold.  On the news, credit default swap (CDS) 
spreads on the two agencies spiked and spreads on Fannie’s and Freddie’s MBS also rose 
sharply, albeit against a backdrop of heavy issuance.  Both CDS and MBS spreads later retraced 
a substantial portion of their increases as market sentiment was improved, in part, by news that 
Freddie Mac was able to raise $6 billion in fresh capital and reports of an industry agreement to 
delay by several years the reset of interest rates on certain subprime mortgages.  Fannie Mae also 
began the process of raising capital this week, and investor interest was reportedly high.  While it 
is improbable that all of the recent increase in MBS spreads will be passed on to borrowers, 
particularly because part of the increase may prove transitory, conforming borrowers may face 
higher spreads of mortgage rates over Treasuries in the future than in recent years.  Potentially 
adding further to the cost of mortgage credit is the fact that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac have 
increased the fees they charge to guarantee mortgages pooled into agency MBS.  That rise likely 
reflects waning competition from other securitizers as well as increased actual and projected 
credit losses.  The GSEs also appear to have imposed sizable additional fees on a variety of 
riskier loans, such as those with loan-to-value ratios greater than 70 percent extended to 
borrowers with lower credit scores.
Other large mortgage lenders were subject to even stronger market pressures over the 
intermeeting period.  For example, CDS spreads on Countrywide Financial Corporation spiked 
to very high levels—near 1000 basis points—as investors became concerned about the ability of 
the thrift to fund its operations and about its overall solvency.  Countrywide had borrowed in 
excess of $50 billion from the Federal Home Loan Bank of Atlanta by the end of the third 
quarter, putting it close to the limit of 50 percent of borrower assets beyond which Home Loan 
Banks are typically very reluctant to lend to their members.  CDS and debt spreads on the Home 
Loan Banks also spiked, as investors reportedly became uncomfortable with the concentration 
of their lending to a few large borrowers (especially Countrywide and Washington Mutual).  A 
higher cost of Home Loan Bank debt has the potential to translate into higher funding costs for 
their borrowers.
Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) 10 of 43
close of their fiscal year.  The FX swap market remained strained; bid-asked spreads
continued to be larger than usual, the average size of trades diminished, and the
capacity for market-making was impaired as some major market makers dropped out.
Foreign Developments
","(9) Concerns about financial fragility and its potential impacts on economic
growth appeared to affect many foreign financial markets during the intermeeting
period.  Headline stock price indexes dropped 3 to 5 percent in Europe, Canada, and
Japan, on net, with financial stocks registering especially large declines in many cases
(Chart 3).  Stock prices also fell sharply in many emerging market economies; in China
share prices dropped more than 15 percent, reacting in part to reports that additional
steps may be taken to cool the domestic economy.  Consistent with a pullback by
investors from risky positions, yields on long-term government securities in industrial
countries fell 10 to 40 basis points, while EMBI+ spreads on sovereign bonds of
major emerging market economies widened noticeably.  The trade-weighted foreign
exchange value of the dollar against major currencies moved up about 1¼ percent, on
balance, over the intermeeting period.3  The dollar rose more than 6½ percent against
the Canadian dollar on signs of slower growth in Canada; on December 4, the Bank
of Canada announced a 25 basis point cut in its target for the overnight interest rate,
citing lower inflation and concerns that effects on Canada from the U.S. sub-prime
crisis will last longer than previously thought.  The dollar gained about 2½ percent
versus the pound; late in the period, the Bank of England also lowered its target
policy rate 25 basis points.  In contrast, the dollar declined 3¾ percent and
versus the Australian dollar, as carry trade positions were reported to have been
unwound in reaction to heightened financial uncertainties.  The index of the dollar’s

value versus currencies of other important trading partners was about unchanged over
the period.
Debt and Money
","(10) Domestic nonfinancial sector debt is estimated to be increasing at an annual
rate of about 7 percent in the current quarter, almost 2 percentage points less than in
the third quarter (Chart 4).  The growth of nonfinancial business debt has slowed a bit
but remains strong on robust bond issuance and a small rebound in commercial
paper.  Growth in C&I lending also remained rapid, as some previously committed
large syndicated loan deals reportedly were taken onto banks’ balance sheets.
Household mortgage debt growth is expected to slow this quarter, reflecting the
weakness in home prices, declining home sales, and tighter credit conditions for some
borrowers.  Consumer credit appears to be expanding at a moderate pace this quarter.
","(11) M2 advanced at an annual rate of about 5 percent in November.  While
liquid deposits continued to grow slowly, heightened demand for safety and liquidity
appears to have boosted retail money market mutual funds.  Small time deposits
continued to expand, evidently owing in part to high rates offered by some depository
institutions to attract retail deposits.  Currency was about flat in November, probably
owing at least in part to an ongoing shift by some overseas investors from holding
dollars to holding other currencies.

Economic Outlook through 2009
","(12) In response to more restrictive financial conditions, higher oil prices, and
weaker-than-expected economic data, the staff has marked down its outlook for the
growth of aggregate demand and lowered its assumption for the path of the federal
funds rate.  The Committee is now assumed to reduce the target rate 25 basis points
at the December meeting and then another 25 basis points to 4 percent in the middle
of 2009, leaving the federal funds rate 75 basis points lower at the end of the forecast
period than in the October Greenbook.  Even so, the staff expects longer-term
Treasury yields to reverse much of their recent declines as investors’ expectations for
sharper reductions in the federal funds rate move into alignment with the staff’s
assumption for monetary policy.  As usual, stock prices are anticipated to rise at a
depreciate about 1½ percent per year.  The price of crude oil is expected to decline
gradually but remain above the path in the October Greenbook.  Against this
backdrop, the pace of economic expansion is projected to slow from about
housing correction deepens, growth of consumer spending slows further, and
business spending decelerates.  Thereafter, real GDP growth gradually picks up,
returning to around the rate of potential GDP growth in 2009, as the decline in
residential investment abates and the drag on spending from tighter credit conditions
and higher energy prices wanes.  The unemployment rate edges up through the
forecast period to 5 percent, a little above the staff’s 4¾ percent estimate of the
NAIRU.  Boosted by the rise in oil prices in recent months, total PCE inflation climbs
to nearly a 3½ percent rate in the current quarter but then drops to 2 percent next
year and to about 1¾ percent in 2009 as oil prices edge down.  Core PCE inflation,
which is projected to run about 2¼ percent in the current quarter and 2 percent for
Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) 15 of 43
resources ease and energy pass-through effects diminish.
Update on Medium-Term Strategies
","(13) This section provides an update of the materials on medium-term strategies
for monetary policy that were presented in the October Bluebook.  As shown in
than 4¾ percent through the end of 2009 before declining gradually to a plateau of
about 3¾ percent.  With an inflation goal of 2 percent (the right-hand set of charts),
the optimal funds rate declines to 3¾ percent by the end of 2009 and then—as the
effects of the current financial strains continue to unwind—gradually rises
to 4¼ percent by the end of 2012.  Compared with the October Bluebook, these
prescriptions are 50 to 75 basis points lower for the period to the end of 2009,
reflecting the same factors that account for the shift in the Greenbook-consistent
r* measure.  With either inflation goal, over the next couple of years the path of the
unemployment rate is slightly higher than that shown in the last Bluebook and the
path for core inflation is about ¼ percentage point higher than in October, reflecting
in part the transitory effects of higher oil prices.
","(15) As shown in Chart 7, the outcome-based monetary policy rule prescribes a
funds rate path that declines to 4 percent by the middle of next year and remains
between 4 and 4½ percent throughout the forecast period, about 25 to 75 basis points
lower than in the October Bluebook.  According to financial market quotes, investors
anticipate that the funds rate will decline to 3¼ percent by the end of 2008 and then
rise to about 4 percent by the end of 2012.  Compared with the previous Bluebook,
the 70 percent confidence interval for the funds rate path is a notch lower at the end
of 2012, suggesting a modest decline in the market’s assessment of the equilibrium
real interest rate over the medium run, and is down as much as 50 basis points over
the next two years.  The near-term prescriptions from the simple policy rules
proposed by Taylor (1993, 1999) are little changed since the October Bluebook.  The
first-difference rule—which does not require estimates of the levels of the output gap
or the equilibrium real interest rate—generates a flat funds rate path if the inflation
goal is 1½ percent or a 30 basis point cut by mid-2008 if the inflation goal is

Short-Run Policy Alternatives
","(16) This Bluebook presents three policy alternatives for the Committee’s
consideration, summarized in Table 1.  Alternative A lowers the target federal funds
rate 50 basis points to 4 percent, Alternative B lowers the target 25 basis points to
rationale paragraph, all three alternatives suggest that economic growth is slowing,
reflecting the intensification of the housing correction.  (The characterization of the
economic situation will need to be reviewed in light of the employment report for
November, which will be released on December 7, the day after the publication of
this Bluebook.)  Each of the alternatives references the recent softness in indicators of
business and consumer spending and acknowledges that strains in financial markets
have increased since the last FOMC meeting.  The alternatives also note that the
stance of monetary policy should promote moderate growth over time, but
Alternatives A and C point to increased downside risks to growth.  In light of the
leveling out of non-energy commodity prices over the intermeeting period, each
alternative suggests that “elevated” energy and commodity prices, along with other
factors, may put upward pressure on inflation, instead of referring to “recent increases
in energy and commodity prices.”  The alternatives differ regarding assessments of
risks to growth and inflation.  Alternative A characterizes the downside risks to
growth as roughly balancing the upside risks to inflation, repeating the assessment of
risks from the October statement.  Alternative B avoids an explicit assessment of the
balance of risks and instead states that recent developments have increased the
uncertainty regarding the outlook.  Alternative C concludes that the risks to growth
are the predominant policy concern and notes that “future policy adjustments will
depend on the outlook for both inflation and economic growth, as implied by
incoming information.”  As usual, the Committee could combine language from
different alternatives.

Incoming information suggests that the 
housing correction has intensified and 
that growth in business and consumer 
spending is softening.  Moreover, strains 
in financial markets have increased in 
recent weeks.  Overall, the outlook for 
the economy has weakened somewhat, 
and downside risks to growth have 
increased.  Today’s action, combined 
with the policy actions taken earlier, 
should help promote moderate growth 
over time.

for both inflation and economic growth, 
as implied by incoming information.
Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) 22 of 43
","(17)  If the Committee judges that tighter financial conditions, higher oil prices,
and soft incoming data point to a weaker economic outlook than previously
anticipated, then it may deem a more accommodative stance of policy to be
appropriate and ease policy 25 basis points, as in Alternative B.  The real federal
funds rate is nearly half a percentage point above its downwardly revised Greenbook-
consistent equilibrium value and a touch above the upper end of the range of model-
based estimates (Chart 5), suggesting that a reduction in the target funds rate may be
required to keep output near its potential.  Several policy rules (Chart 7) also suggest
that further policy easing would be appropriate.  Moreover, members might be
concerned about the risk of possible further deterioration in financial conditions,
particularly in the run-up to year-end, or about the potential for significant spillovers
from the housing sector to the broader economy.  If so, they may judge that a policy
easing at this meeting might help insure against such developments.  At the same
time, the Committee may believe that the risks to inflation associated with a 25 basis
point reduction in the target federal funds rate are modest, given recent readings on
core inflation and the current outlook for prices.
","(18) After noting that “economic growth is slowing” and that “strains in
financial markets have increased,” the statement for Alternative B suggests that the
actions, is likely to help promote moderate growth over time.  The statement notes
the modest improvement in core inflation this year but indicates that “some inflation
risks remain.”  Rather than provide an explicit assessment of the balance of risks, the
statement concludes that uncertainty around the outlook for growth and inflation has
increased and that the Committee will “continue to assess the effects of financial and
other developments” and act as needed to foster its dual objectives.
","(19)   Market participants appear to place about two-thirds odds on a 25 basis
point reduction in the target at this meeting, with most of the remaining probability
Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) 23 of 43
assigned to a 50 basis point move.  As a result, short-term interest rates would likely
rise modestly in response to Alternative B.  However, judging from the Desk’s survey
of dealers, the statement under Alternative B would likely be read as broadly
consistent with market expectations for additional policy easing.  Consequently,
longer-term interest rates, equity prices, and the foreign exchange value of the dollar
probably would be little changed.
","(20) If the Committee views the renewed deterioration in financial markets and
the sharper contraction in the housing sector as presenting a particularly severe threat
to the economic expansion, it might want to lower the target funds rate 50 basis
points, as in Alternative A.  A 50 basis point reduction in the federal funds rate
would put the real funds rate close to the Greenbook-consistent measure of its
equilibrium value (Chart 5) and thus, under the baseline projection, would be
consistent with output returning to its potential in the medium term.  A reduction of
this size would also be broadly compatible with the optimal policy simulations with a
goal (Chart 7).  Moreover, given the deterioration in term funding markets and
increased concerns about balance sheet capacity and counterparty credit risk, the
Committee might worry about the potential for substantial additional tightening of
banks’ lending terms and standards, particularly if it viewed the arrangement of swap
lines with foreign central banks and implementation of a Term Auction Facility as
unlikely to provide significant relief to funding markets.  Members might also see
incoming evidence of a deepening contraction in the housing sector, as well as the
apparent softening in business and consumer spending, as presenting unacceptably
large downside risks to overall economic activity.  By contrast, incoming core inflation
data have continued to be moderate, and the Committee may see the inflation
outlook, and the associated risks, as essentially unchanged.  In these circumstances,
members might conclude that the weaker modal outlook for growth and significantly
Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) 24 of 43
increased downside risks warrant a 50 basis point policy move at this meeting.
Members may believe that the Committee would be able to reverse the easing quickly
if appropriate.
","(21) The draft statement for Alternative A begins with a reference to the further
intensification of the housing correction and recent weakening in business and
consumer expenditures, and it also mentions increased strains in financial markets.  It
then notes that the outlook for economic growth has weakened somewhat and, unlike
Alternative B, adds that the downside risks to growth have increased.  But as in the
other alternatives, the statement suggests that the easing in policy should help foster
moderate expansion over time.  The paragraph regarding inflation is little changed
from October.  The risk assessment would indicate that the 50 basis point easing
brings the risks to inflation and growth roughly into balance.  But if the Committee
believes that, even after such a move, recent developments in financial markets have
increased the uncertainty around the outlook for growth and inflation to such an
extent that an assessment is not meaningful, it may wish instead to employ the risk
assessment language used in Alternative B.
","(22) Investors attach significant odds to both a 50 basis point easing and a
move would push very short-term interest rates lower.  However, while the magnitude
of the surprise with respect to the target funds rate would be similar to that
experienced in September, the assessment that the risks to growth and inflation are
balanced, which differs notably from the language in the September statement, might
temper the reaction in rates further out the term structure.  Indeed, if investors find
that assessment somewhat persuasive, intermediate- and longer-term interest rates
might increase as market participants revised up their outlook for the economy.  The
equity market might rally modestly in reaction to lower interest rates and an improved
Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) 25 of 43
outlook for earnings, and the foreign exchange value of the dollar could even firm a
bit if market participants revised up their outlook for the U.S. economy.
","(23) If the Committee judges that the current stance of policy is likely to foster
sustainable growth and acceptable inflation over time, then it might be inclined to
choose Alternative C.  Members might read the incoming macroeconomic data as
broadly consistent with the outlook underlying its October policy decision, including
the expectation for a period of relatively slow growth late this year and early next year.
Conditions in short-term funding markets have deteriorated notably over the
intermeeting period and credit has tightened further for some households and
businesses, increasing the downside risks to growth.  However, the Committee might
feel that the adverse effects of such developments are likely to be limited and that its
earlier easing actions—and perhaps arrangement of swap lines with foreign central
banks and implementation of a Term Auction Facility—provide ample insurance.
Moreover, members may be concerned that the unsettled state of financial markets
may make it difficult for Committee to quickly reverse further policy easing, even if
the prospects for economic growth improve.  And, although core inflation has stayed
moderate and the baseline outlook for inflation may be viewed as acceptable,
members may view elevated oil and other commodity prices and a weaker dollar as
posing large enough upside risks to inflation to make an immediate reduction in the
target funds rate problematic.  Under these circumstances, the Committee might see
maintenance of the current stance of policy for now as appropriate but judge that
downside risks to growth have become the dominant concern.  Such an approach
would leave the Committee well placed to see whether financial market strains
diminish significantly after year-end and to accumulate additional information on the
outlook for growth and inflation before deciding whether further policy easing should
be implemented.
Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) 26 of 43
","(24) The proposed statement for Alternative C acknowledges that economic
growth appears to be slowing but indicates explicitly that the softening is broadly in
line with what the Committee had anticipated.  It then notes the increase in financial
market strains and acknowledges that they pose greater downside risk to growth, but
suggests that the monetary policy easing already in place is likely to promote moderate
expansion over time.  The wording on inflation closely follows the October
statement.  The draft statement then suggests that downside risks to growth are the
predominant concern and concludes with the language used in the August and earlier
statements that “future policy adjustments will depend on the outlook for both
inflation and economic growth, as implied by incoming information.”
","(25) Market participants would be very surprised if the Committee kept the
target at 4½ percent at this meeting.  Despite the assessment that downside risks to
growth predominate, the absence of action at this meeting and the overall tone of the
policy statement would likely suggest to investors that the Committee does not expect
to lower rates to the extent currently implied by money market futures quotes, so
short-term interest rates would increase notably on the announcement.  However, the
rise in longer-term rates might be tempered if investors revised down their outlook
for economic activity and inflation.  The foreign exchange value of the dollar would
likely appreciate somewhat with the backup in interest rates.  Equity prices probably
would fall.
Money and Debt Forecasts
","(26) Under the Greenbook projection, M2 is forecast to grow at about a
from the previous forecast, reflecting in part weaker nominal GDP in the fourth
quarter.  Over 2008, M2 is projected to expand at about a 4½ percent pace, a bit
above the rate of growth of nominal GDP and slightly faster than the forecast in the
Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) 27 of 43
* This forecast is consistent with nominal GDP and interest rates in the Greenbook forecast.
Alternative Growth Rates for M2
Table 2
(percent, annual rate)
Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) 28 of 43
October Bluebook.  The upward revision reflects lower opportunity costs, given the
reduction in the federal funds rate assumed in this Greenbook, as well as somewhat
greater demand for monetary assets in view of the turbulence in financial markets.
M2 is expected to continue to advance at around 4½ percent pace in 2009, a bit above
nominal GDP growth, supported by the additional policy easing assumed in that year.
","(27)   After having expanded at an annual rate of 7½ percent in the first half of
the year, domestic nonfinancial debt is expected to increase at about an 8 percent pace
in the second half of 2007 before slowing sharply to a 4¾ percent rate in 2008 and
in borrowing across all major sectors except the federal government.  The staff
expects household debt growth to fall to 6 percent at an annual rate in the second half
of this year and to 3½ percent in 2008 and to 3¼ percent in 2009, which would be the
slowest annual rate of growth in real terms since 1991.  The slowdown reflects a
moderation in mortgage debt in response to declining home prices and a reduction in
home sales.  Consumer credit is expected to advance at a modest pace.  Nonfinancial
business debt, which expanded robustly in the third quarter, is projected to decelerate
somewhat over the forecast period, as the demand for funds to finance LBOs and
share repurchases continues to abate.
