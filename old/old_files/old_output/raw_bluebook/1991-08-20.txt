Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System.  This electronic document was 
created through a comprehensive digitization process which included identifying the best-
preserved paper copies, scanning those copies,1 and then making the scanned versions 
text-searchable.2  Though a stringent quality assurance process was employed, some 
imperfections may remain. 
 

Please note that this document may contain occasional gaps in the text.  These

MONETARY POLICY ALTERNATIVES

By the staff Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System



STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL (FR)
CLASS I - FOMC August 16, 1991

MONETARY POLICY ALTERNATIVES

Recent Developments

(1) In the weeks immediately after the July FOMC meeting,

the Desk sought to maintain existing reserve pressures, basing reserve

targets initially on an allowance for adjustment plus seasonal borrow-

ing of $325 million and expecting federal funds to continue to trade

around 5-3/4 percent. Through early August, the federal funds rate

averaged close to this expected level. Reserve conditions were

eased slightly on August 6 in response to data that raised questions

about the strength of the recovery, to indications of abating price

pressures, and to substantial declines in M2 and M3 that brought these

aggregates close to the lower bounds of their annual ranges. In that

action, the borrowing allowance was reduced $25 million, with the

expectation that the federal funds rate would trade around 5-1/2

percent. Federal funds have averaged a bit above this level in recent

days.2

(2) In response to downward revisions in market expectations

about aggregate demand and price pressures, as well as to the policy

easing, market interest rates have declined appreciably since the July

FOMC meeting. On balance, most market interest rates fell 30 to 70

1. By late July, the borrowing allowance had been raised in two
steps to $400 million to account for expected increases in seasonal
borrowing.

2. In the three maintenance periods completed since the July meet-
ing, borrowing averaged about $590 million, above the allowance, with
part of the overage reflecting special situation borrowing and part
reflecting difficulties injecting adequate nonborrowed reserves after
sizable revisions to reserve estimates late in maintenance periods.
Borrowing thus far in the current maintenance period has averaged
$334 million.



basis points over the intermeeting period; the largest declines were

in the intermediate-term area, suggesting that the market focused on

the prospects that a somewhat smaller rise in interest rates over the

next few years would be consistent with moderate economic expansion.

The prime rate, however, remains at 8-1/2 percent, widening bank lend-

ing margins. Despite the weaker economic picture, private rates fell

as much or even more than Treasury yields and broad stock indexes rose

1 to 4 percent, perhaps responding to the changed interest rate out-

look. Spreads on below-investment grade debt were relatively stable

even though insurance companies, traditional lenders in this sector,

reportedly have become very selective as they attempt to strengthen

their balance sheets and boost liquidity in view of the industry's

asset quality problems and worries about runs. Lower interest rates

and announcements of bank mergers bolstered the securities prices of

large banks: The spread between Eurodollar and Treasury bill rates

fell about 15 basis points, reaching unusually low levels, and indexes

of bank stock prices surged almost 20 percent.

(3) The exchange value of the dollar depreciated 3 percent

on a weighted average basis since the last Committee meeting, declin-

ing more against the mark, 3-1/2 percent, than against the yen,

1 percent.

More fundamentally,

changes in exchange rates reflected shifting expectations about rela-

tive monetary policies here and in Germany, which tended to be con-

firmed by subsequent actions. On August 15, the Bundesbank raised its

discount rate by 1 percentage point and its Lombard rate by 1/4 per-

centage point; the latter was less than had been anticipated by the

market, and in reaction the dollar retraced a portion of its previous

decline. Over the intermeeting period, German short-term interest



rates rose 20 basis points; long-term rates were little changed.

Japanese short- and long-term interest rates declined about 30 basis

points. (The Bank of Japan had reduced its discount rate 1/2

percentage point just prior to the July FOMC meeting.)

(4) The broad monetary aggregates were quite weak in July,

with M2 and M3 contracting at 3-3/4 and 4-1/2 percent rates, respec-

tively. Data through early August show M2 about flat and M3 declining

further, leaving them around the lower bounds of their annual ranges.

Growth of transactions deposits fell off in July, pulling the expan-

sion of M1 down to a 1-3/4 percent rate, but appears to be rebounding

in early August, and M1 seems on track to register a strong increase

this quarter. The nontransactions component of M2, which has been

decelerating steadily since March, contracted in June and ran off at a

faster rate last month. At the M3 level, declines in M2 were aug-

mented by continued runoffs of large time deposits, as bank credit

growth weakened and thrift assets dropped.

(5) Substantial downward revisions to projected nominal

income this quarter explain some--but not all--of the weakness in M2

relative to expectations at the last meeting. Even if income comes in

3. Reflecting the deceleration of Ml last month, growth of
required reserves and total reserves fell to 4-1/2 and 1-3/4 percent
rates, respectively, in July. Nonborrowed reserves contracted at a
3-3/4 percent rate as adjustment and seasonal borrowing rose.



somewhat lower than the current estimate, other factors also must be

at work to explain the large shortfall in M2. To a degree, the recent

weakness of M2 appears to reflect low yields on M2 instruments, both

relative to those to which depositors had become accustomed and--given

the steep yield curve--relative to returns on capital market instru-

ments. Supporting this view are increases in noncompetitive tenders

at Treasury auctions and anecdotal reports that households continued to

invest heavily in bond and equity mutual funds last month. Bank re-

tail CD rates have continued to drop relative to market rates. Among

senior financial officers at banks surveyed, a significant portion of

those reporting weak deposit growth had bid less aggressively for

deposits in the last few months. The recent declines in consumer

credit also suggest the wide spreads between returns on deposits and

rates on consumer loans may be leading households to pay down debts

with liquid assets and to finance expenditures out of savings rather

than taking on additional debt. However, household credit flows are

in line with model predictions based on historical relationships to

spending, and observable flows into capital market instruments fall

well short of accounting for the shortfall in M2. A complete explana-

tion for the recent performance of M2 is elusive.

(6) Private credit growth likely was quite weak again in

July: Bank loans declined at a 5 percent annual rate, public bond

offerings by nonfinancial business dropped well below their second-

quarter pace, and municipal security issuance ebbed. The overall

sluggishness likely owed predominantly to continued slack demand for

credit. Credit supply effects may have been a factor restraining debt

growth, too, but whether these effects have intensified recently is an

open question. The already-wide spreads between the prime rate and

banks' cost of funds have increased further, and insurance companies

have become more cautious in their lending. Responses to the latest



-5-

survey of senior loan officers show that the extent of credit tighten-

ing is waning appreciably, and most quality spreads in open markets

are remarkably narrow. Thus far in August, bond markets have absorbed

a surge in supply from both corporate and municipal issuers in

response to the further drop in yields. In July, total debt growth

appears to have been sustained at roughly a 5 percent rate, supported

by heavy borrowing by the federal government, leaving domestic non-

financial sector debt near the lower end of its monitoring range.

Policy Alternatives

(7) Two alternatives are presented below for Committee con-

sideration. Under alternative B, federal funds would continue to

trade around 5-1/2 percent, at the discount rate, in association with

adjustment plus seasonal borrowing of $375 million.4  Under alter-

native A, the federal funds rate would decline to 5 percent. The

money market conditions of this alternative could be achieved through

a reduction in borrowing to $325 million or through a 1/2 percentage

point cut in the discount rate, holding borrowing at $375 million.

There are no technical impediments to an easing of policy through open

market operations alone--dropping the federal funds rate 50 basis

points below the discount rate--although a little more volatility in

the funds rate likely would be a by-product, as the discount window

became a less effective buffer of reserve market disturbances.

(8) Money growth projections under the two alternatives are

presented below. (More detailed data appear in the table and charts

on the following pages.) M2 under both alternatives is expected to

decline less rapidly in August and to resume growing in September,

although unexplained recent weakness adds to uncertainty about the

extent of the rebound. The recent easing of policy and a pickup in

nominal income growth are expected to boost M2 demands in the period

just ahead. In addition, as portfolios become more fully adjusted to

the steep yield curve, outflows from M2 should diminish; the recent

drop in intermediate-term relative to short-term rates also would tend

to damp outflows to shorter maturity bond funds. Nonetheless, growth

pected to drift lower over the intermeeting period. However, such
demands are more uncertain than normal, given that the rate advantage
favoring seasonal credit has essentially disappeared.



in M2 over the June-to-September period will be well below that spe-

cified at the July FOMC meeting, and in September this aggregate would

be near the lower end of its annual range. In this projection, M2

does not recoup any of its recent shortfall; instead, growth of M2 is

assumed to move toward a more normal alignment with growth of income

and changes in interest rates, albeit with some continuing weakness

relative to model projections. Further declines in depository credit

will continue to restrain M2 and especially M3. Even with the modest

growth projected for M3 in September, this aggregate would decline

over the June-to-September period, instead of expanding at a 3 percent

rate as specified in the July directive, and would end up only about

1-1/4 percent at an annual rate above its fourth-quarter 1990 base.

M1, in contrast, is expected to expand briskly in August and Septem-

ber. A failure of M2 and M3 to pick up over the intermeeting period

would raise additional concerns about the strength of the recovery--in

particular, whether spending was increasing as expected, and whether

financial conditions, including credit availability, were compatible

with a sustained expansion of the economy.

(9) In light of persistent weakness in the broader monetary

aggregates and other indicators pointing to a sluggish recovery, mar-

kets currently see a distinct possibility of some further easing of

policy in the weeks ahead. With reserve market pressures unchanged,

as under alternative B, rates might firm a touch. Such a firming

would further diminish prospects for a cut in the prime rate. The

extent of any backup in rates, though, would depend on incoming infor-

mation: Indeed, rates might remain near current levels should M2 run

along the lower band of its annual range, as the staff expects, and if

new information casts further doubts on the strength of the recovery.

Should pressures on insurance companies mount, quality spreads on

lower-rated corporate debt could widen as insurers curtail lending to

this segment of the market. The dollar likely would trade around

current levels under alternative B, but could firm a notch if U.S.

interest rates were to back up.

(10) The 1/2 percentage point drop in the funds rate con-

templated under alternative A is larger than the easing of policy

currently anticipated in the markets; thus, short-term rates are

likely to move down under this alternative--but not by as much as the

cut in the funds rate--with the three-month bill rate drifting to near

5 percent. If this alternative were implemented through open market

operations alone, bringing the funds rate well below the discount

rate, market participants might speculate about the need for a dis-

count rate cut, and whether such a cut would be accompanied by an

additional easing. The prime rate likely would decline by the 50

basis point drop in the funds rate, leaving the spread over funding

costs at a historically high level. Bond rates initially would de-

crease a bit, but such declines might erode should incoming informa-

tion suggest that the economic recovery is more solidly under way,



-11-

along the lines of the staff forecast. The dollar would decline on

foreign exchange markets.

(11) Under alternative B, M2 would be expected to increase

over the balance of the quarter. On a monthly average basis, the

sizable decline in M2 in July would be followed by a small drop in

August and a 4 percent rate of expansion in September. Absent a

subsequent change in policy, M2 would be expected to continue to

increase at about a 4 percent pace over the fourth quarter, as the

anticipated strengthening of income offsets the waning effects of

earlier declines in rates; growth for the year would be 2-3/4 percent.

The recent easing would be expected to have its greatest effect on

liquid deposits, whose offering rates adjust especially sluggishly.

M1 is projected to increase at a 7-1/2 percent rate in August and

September, while outflows from the nontransactions component of M2

would ebb. On a quarterly average basis, M2 would be about flat in

the third quarter--well below the growth predicted by models of money

demand incorporating the staff's economic forecast--and its velocity

would rise at a 5 percent rate. M1, in contrast, would grow at nearly

a 7 percent annual rate in the current quarter and its velocity would

fall at a 2 percent rate.

(12) M3 would resume growing in September under alter-

native B, albeit at just a 2-1/4 percent pace. Still, on a quarterly

average basis, M3 would fall at a 2 percent rate, its first quarterly

decline in more than two decades. Contributing to the expected Sep-

tember turnaround in M3 is the pickup in M2 and a resumption of flows

to institution-only money funds, prompted by recent declines in market

rates. On the other hand, acting to hold down M3 growth in the months

ahead will be further large decreases in thrift assets owing in part

to fairly brisk RTC resolution activity. Moreover, banks remain quite

reluctant to lend, as suggested by recent senior loan officer survey



-12-

results and the unusually high prime rate in relation to funding

costs, and banks involved in mergers could, given various uncertain-

ties during the consolidation phase, be making more cautious credit

decisions. In addition, credit demands are expected to stay light.

Weak capital spending and fairly strong equity issuance will be acting

to hold down business credit demands in the months ahead. With bond

yields down and rate spreads quite narrow, investment-grade borrowers

are expected to continue to rely heavily on the bond market for funds.

Lower-rated firms, more dependent on banks and private placements with

insurance companies, however, are likely to encounter continued dif-

ficulties in getting credit. Borrowing by state and local governments

should remain light as these units struggle with budgetary shortfalls

and debt downgradings. Household borrowing is expected to strengthen

a bit as single-family housing activity and consumption outlays con-

tinue to firm. Growth of debt of domestic nonfinancial sectors other

than the federal government, while picking up a bit, is expected to

remain at depressed levels. In contrast, federal borrowing will be

robust as deposit insurance outlays remain substantial. Total debt of

domestic nonfinancial sectors is expected to grow at around a 7 per-

cent rate over August and September, leaving this aggregate in the

lower portion of its monitoring range in September.

(13) The easing of monetary policy under alternative A would

boost M2 to a 4-1/2 percent annual rate of expansion in September and

the pace would firm further in the fourth quarter, lifting growth of

this aggregate for the year to around 3 percent. Pacing M2 next month

would be an 8-1/2 percent rate of growth in its M1 component and more

rapid expansion in its other liquid deposits, whose opportunity costs

would diminish still further. The opening of even larger intermedia-

tion spreads on some credits would enhance bank efforts to raise capi-

tal and encourage bankers to pursue more lending opportunities. With



-13-

a little more bank credit to fund and larger inflows to institution-

only money funds, M3 would pick up to a 2-1/2 percent pace in Septem-

ber and remain around that rate early in the fourth quarter.



-14-

Directive Language

(14) Draft language for the operational paragraph, including

the usual options, is shown below. Two versions are presented. The

first retains the structure of the current directive, but it includes

possible changes in the sentence on monetary growth. The proposed

language would highlight the unusual decline in money thus far this

quarter and the expectation that the broad aggregates will resume grow-

ing in the weeks ahead. In light of the current weakness of these

aggregates in relation to their ranges, the Committee may wish to give

special emphasis to the aggregates in the directive, at least in the

period ahead. In that case, a second version is provided that enhances

the role of the aggregates in guiding intermeeting changes. However,

this version might be viewed as less relevant if the Committee decides

to ease at this meeting.

OPERATIONAL PARAGRAPH

Version I

In the implementation of policy for the immediate

future the Committee seeks to DECREASE SOMEWHAT/maintain/

INCREASE SOMEWHAT the existing degree of pressure on

reserve positions. Depending upon progress toward price

stability, trends in economic activity, the behavior of the

monetary aggregates, and developments in foreign exchange

and domestic financial markets, somewhat (SLIGHTLY) greater

reserve restraint (MIGHT/WOULD) or somewhat (SLIGHTLY)

lesser reserve restraint might (WOULD) be acceptable in the

intermeeting period. The contemplated reserve conditions



-15-

are expected to be consistent with A RESUMPTION OF growth

of M2 and M3 IN THE WEEKS AHEAD, BUT IN VIEW OF THE DECLINE

ALREADY POSTED SINCE JUNE, THE COMMITTEE ANTICIPATES THAT

M2 WOULD BE LITTLE CHANGED AND M3 WOULD BE DOWN ____ PERCENT

over the period from June through September [DEL: at annual rates

of about 5-1/2 and 3 percent respectively.]

Version II

In the implementation of policy for the immediate

future the Committee seeks to DECREASE SOMEWHAT/maintain/

INCREASE SOMEWHAT the existing degree of pressure on

reserve positions. The contemplated reserve conditions are

expected to be consistent with A RESUMPTION OF growth of M2

and M3 IN THE WEEKS AHEAD, BUT IN VIEW OF THE DECLINE

ALREADY POSTED SINCE JUNE, THE COMMITTEE ANTICIPATES THAT

M2 WOULD BE LITTLE CHANGED AND M3 WOULD BE DOWN ____ PERCENT

over the period from June through September [DEL: at annual rates

of about 5-1/2 and 3 percent respectively]. TAKING ACCOUNT

OF THE BEHAVIOR OF THE MONETARY AGGREGATES AND depending

upon progress toward price stability, trends in economic

activity, [DEL: the behavior of the monetary aggregates,] and

developments in foreign exchange and domestic financial

markets, somewhat (SLIGHTLY) greater reserve restraint

(MIGHT/WOULD) or somewhat (SLIGHTLY) lesser reserve

restraint might (WOULD) be acceptable in the intermeeting

period.
