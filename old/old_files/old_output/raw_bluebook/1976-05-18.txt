Prefatory Note 
 
 
The attached document represents the most complete and accurate version available 
based on original copies culled from the files of the FOMC Secretariat at the Board 
of Governors of the Federal Reserve System.  This electronic document was created 
through a comprehensive digitization process which included identifying the best-
preserved paper copies, scanning those copies,1 and then making the scanned 
versions text-searchable.2   Though a stringent quality assurance process was 
employed, some imperfections may remain. 
 
Please note that some material may have been redacted from this document if that 
material was received on a confidential basis.  Redacted material is indicated by

format.  All scanned images were deskewed (to remove the effects of printer- and scanner-introduced 
tilting) and lightly cleaned (to remove dark spots caused by staple holes, hole punches, and other 
blemishes caused after initial printing).

MONEY MARKET CONDITIONS

Recent Developments

(1) M1 increased at a 15,7 per cent annual rate during April,

as both currency and demand deposits rose sharply. Even though M1

expansion appears to be moderating in May, growth for April and May

combined is projected at around a 12¼ per cent annual rate, well above

the 8½ per cent upper bound of the Committee's range. Growth in M2 over

the April-May period is projected at about 12 per cent, at the upper end

of the Committee's range. Inflows to savings accounts at commercial banks

have remained strong, though continuing to decelerate from February's

extraordinary pace; growth in time deposits other than CD's has strengthened

somewhat.

(2) Following the April 20 FOMC meeting, the Desk promptly

became somewhat less accommodative in the provision of reserves and sought

a funds rate around 4-7/8 per cent, a shade above the then prevailing rate

of 4¾ per cent and equal to the mid-point of the range that had been adopted

by the Committee. Subsequently, with incoming data suggesting rates of

growth in M1 well above the Committee's desired range and M2 near the upper

end of the range, the Desk adopted successively higher funds rate objectives,

In moving to these higher rates the Desk took care in early May to avoid any

undue disruption of the Treasury's refunding operation. Most recently,

the Desk has been in process of establishing a 5¼ per cent Federal funds

rate in the market, and as of this writing funds were trading around

5-3/16--5¼ per cent.

(3) Growth in nonborrowed reserves in the April-May period,

though quite modest, has been somewhat more rapid than contemplated at

the time of the previous FOMC meeting. Such reserves increased at only a

1½ per cent annual rate, on average, during April, as the sizable decline

in CD's outstanding freed reserves to support the expansion of other

deposits, but they show signs of increasing somewhat more rapidly in early

May.1/ Member bank borrowings averaged about $40 million in the interval

between Committee meetings, little changed from the previous intermeeting

period.

(4) Since the last Committee meeting, short-term market yields

have risen 35 to 50 basis points in response to the rising funds rate, to

1/ A discussion of the expected and actual behavior of nonborrowed
reserves relative to the Committee's short-run targets for monetary
growth may be found in Appendix A.



indications of a significant pickup in growth in the key monetary aggregates,

and to further signs of vigorous economic recovery. Rates on most long-term

securities have moved up by roughly 25 to 40 basis points. Rates in the

secondary mortgage market have increased along with yields in other sectors

of the credit markets; however, primary mortgage rates have only halted

their downward trend as deposit growth continued strong at nonbank thrift

institutions.

(5) The Treasury announced that its May refunding would include an

offering of three issues, with the following amounts available to the

public: $2 billion of 1-year, 11½-month notes and $750 million of reopened

23¾-year bonds on an auction basis, as well as about $3½ billion of 10-year

notes on a fixed-price subscription basis. The 10-year notes were sub-

stantially oversubscribed, and $4.7 billion of them were allotted. As a

result, new cash raised in the refunding amounted to about $3½ billion.

The issues have been readily absorbed by the market despite the recent

rise in interest rates, and dealers have distributed nearly all of the

$1.4 billion of securities they received in the operation. Most recently,

the two notes traded about ¼-½ of a point below their average issue

price, while the bond has been near issue price.

(6) Total short-term business credit remained unchanged during

April as a $1 billion rise in outstanding commercial paper issued by non-

financial firms offset a similar decline in bank loans to businesses.

Total loans at all commercial banks are estimated to have contracted slightly



during the month, but banks' net acquisitions of U.S. Government securities

were substantial. Weekly reporting banks allowed another $3½ billion of CD's

to run-off in April, as inflows from other deposits were strong.

(7) The table on the following page shows (in percentage annual

rates of change) related monetary and financial flows over various time

periods. The data in this table and all subsequent tables except Table 2

in the back of the blue book incorporate benchmark revisions for the money

supply based on nonmember call reports for December 31, 1975. These

revisions were relatively small in magnitude, and a comparison of the

unrevised and revised data may be found in Appendix table VI.

Prospective developments

(8) Summarized below for the Committee's consideration are three

alternative sets of short-run specifications for the monetary aggregates

and the Federal funds rate. (More detailed data, as well as longer-run

growth rates, are shown in the tables on pp. 6 a and 6b, while reserve

aggregates consistent with the specifications are presented in appendix

table V.

(9) Alternative B assumes a Federal funds rate range centered

on 5-1/4 per cent, the most recent Desk objective, while alternative A

assumes some easing of the money market and alternative C some further

tightening. Under all three alternatives, the rate of growth in M1 over

the May-June period is expected to be considerably reduced from its April

pace, though remaining stronger than in the latter part of 1975 and early

1976. For instance, under alternative B growth may be in a 5-1/4 to 9-1/4

per cent annual rate range.

(10) The very rapid rate of expansion of M1 in April may have

been caused in part by a large decline in U.S. Treasury deposits. However,

the underlying demand for money also appears strong, and a relatively

rapid growth in M1 is likely to continue. Perhaps indicative of the

strength of underlying money demand, there was no significant reversal

in late April and early May of the large build-up in private demand deposits

in the first half of April.

(11) Growth in M2 over the May-June period is expected to

remain relatively rapid under alternatives A and B. Nevertheless, growth

under alternative B--as measured by the mid-point of a 7-11 per cent,

annual rate, range--is expected to be slower than during the first four

months of the year. This reflects the higher level of market interest

rates that has developed as well as some shift of funds out of savings and

time deposits in payment for the $4.7 billion of new 10-year notes recently

offered by the Treasury.

(12) Under alternative C, growth in M2 is expected to slow more

markedly over the May-June period. The further rise in the Federal funds

rate that is envisaged would lead to a continued rise in other short-term

rates, with the 3-month Treasury bill rate likely to move up to the 5-3/4-6

per cent area. This would probably lead to a considerable outflow from

savings deposits of those interest-sensitive funds that were shifted into

such accounts when short-term market rates first moved down to around 5 per

cent, the Regulation Q ceiling rate on commercial banks' savings deposits.

(13) The firming of money market conditions associated with

alternative C would also exert upward pressure on longer-term interest

rates over the next few weeks. Loan demands are still focused more on



-8-

securities markets than on banks. The corporate bond calendar has built

up further in recent weeks, partly in anticipation of higher interest rates

later, and the municipal calendar remains sizable. Moreover, the Treasury

is likely to continue raising much of its new cash in the coupon area.

Even if the Federal funds rate stabilizes around 5-1/4 per cent between

now and the next Committee meeting--as is contemplated under alternative B--

some further upward adjustment in longer-term, as well as short-term inter-

est rates may still occur, since markets probably have not yet fully

adjusted to a 5-1/4 per cent funds rate.

(14) Over the coming year, the staff expects interest rates

generally to be under considerable upward pressure, assuming M1 growth

from QI '76 to QI '77 is at a rate around the mid-point of the 4-1/2-7

per cent range adopted by the Committee. Interest rates are projected to

reach higher levels than anticipated at the time of the last meeting for

three main reasons: (a) the FOMC lowered its longer-run growth rates for

M1 and M2 slightly; (b) the staff has revised upward somewhat its projec-

tion for the rate of growth in nominal GNP; and (c) the much faster than

expected increase in the money stock apparently in store for the second

quarter probably reflects, at least in part, an increase in money demand

relative to GNP. Because the annual rate of M1 growth in the second

quarter now seems likely to be in the area of 9½-10 per cent, annual rate,

over the next three quarters the growth rate would have to be held to

about 4-1/4 per cent (annual rate) if the 5-3/4 per cent growth of the

QI '76-QI '77 range is to be achieved.



(15) The staff's longer-run projections of the Federal funds

rate under each of the three alternatives are shown in appendix table IV.

As may be seen, the staff expects that under alternative B the funds rate

would peak out at around 8-1/2 per cent early next year. However, under

alternative C, which contemplates a prompt further move toward restraint,

the funds rate may peak out at a lower 7-3/4 per cent level by the winter

of this year. A considerably higher ultimate level for the funds rate is

envisaged under alternative A, since it would be necessary to offset later

the effects of near-term easing in reserve conditions contemplated by that

alternative. In view of these interest rate expectations, we have assumed

for all alternatives an increase in Regulation Q ceiling rates in the fall

of this year of 50 basis points for certificates maturing in 4 years or

more and 25 basis points for shorter-term certificates. Even so, as

indicated in the last two lines of the table on p. 6a, over the QI '76-QI '77

period, growth in M1 at a rate equal to the mid-point of the FOMC's range

is expected to be associated with growth in M2 and M3 at rates near the

bottom of their respective ranges.

Proposed directive

(16) Given below is a proposed operational paragraph if the

Committee wishes to formulate its instructions in terms of desired growth

in monetary aggregates over the months ahead. No alternatives are pre-

sented for this formulation, in the expectation that the reference to

desired growth will be taken to apply to the longer-term targets and that

at this meeting the Committee will not reconsider those targets.

'Monetary Aggregates" Proposal

To implement this policy, while taking account of develop-

ments in domestic and international financial markets, the Committee

seeks to achieve bank reserve and money market conditions consistent

with moderate growth in monetary aggregates over the period ahead.

(17) Should the Committee desire to place main emphasis on bank

reserve and money market conditions, the language needed would depend on

the specific conditions sought. Three alternative "money market" direc-

tives intended to correspond to the similarly lettered policy alternatives

are given below.

Alternative "Money Market" Proposals

Alternative A

To implement this policy, while taking account of develop-

ments in domestic and international financial markets, the Committee

seeks to achieve SOMEWHAT EASIER bank reserve and money market condi-

tions consistent with moderate growth in monetary aggregates over the



-11-

period IMMEDIATELY ahead, PROVIDED THAT MONETARY AGGREGATES APPEAR

TO BE GROWING AT ABOUT THE RATES CURRENTLY EXPECTED.

Alternative B

To implement this policy, while taking account of develop-

ments in domestic and international financial markets, the Committee

seeks to achieve MAINTAIN PREVAILING bank reserve and money market

conditions consistent with moderate growth in monetary aggregates

over the period IMMEDIATELY ahead, PROVIDED THAT MONETARY AGGREGATES

APPEAR TO BE GROWING AT ABOUT THE RATES CURRENTLY EXPECTED,

Alternative C

To implement this policy, while taking account of develop-

ments in domestic and international financial markets, the Committee

seeks to achieve SOMEWHAT FIRMER bank reserve and money market condi-

tions consistent with moderate growth in monetary aggregates over the

period IMMEDIATELY ahead, PROVIDED THAT MONETARY AGGREGATES APPEAR TO

BE GROWING AT ABOUT THE RATES CURRENTLY EXPECTED.

agreements maturing in 16 days or more, are indicators of dealer holdings for sale over the near-term. Other security dealer positions issues

funds purchases. Weekly data are daily averages for statement weeks, except for corporate and municipal issues in syndicate which are Friday

Appendix A

Comparison of "Targeted" and Actual Reserves

The table below compares the actual average level of reserves

for the 4 week period ending May 19 with the "targeted" level that had

been thought to be consistent with the mid-points of the short-run ranges

for the monetary aggregates adopted at the last FOMC meeting.

Actual 1/  "Targeted" Difference

Nonborrowed reserves 34,136 33,886 250
Total reserves 34,190 33,964 226
Monetary base 113,870 113,234 636

1/ Includes week of May 19, which is partly projected.

As can be seen, nonborrowed reserves during the intermeeting

period turned out to be $250 million higher than "targeted." In evaluat-

ing the relationship between "targeted" and actual reserves during the

period just past, it needs to be recognized that the FOMC adopted a

Federal funds rate range--4-1/2 to 5-1/4 per cent--that was somewhat

lower than the range the staff had believed consistent with the chosen

monetary and reserve aggregates--which was 4-3/4 to 5-3/4 per cent. Thus,

the chances of hitting the nonborrowed "target" were reduced by the

particular Federal funds rate constraint adopted.

Given the actual Federal funds rate, about $50 million more

in nonborrowed reserves had to be supplied to accomodate larger

bank demands for free reserves (excess reserves minus borrowings) than the



A - 2

have had to rise sufficiently in the short run to limit expansion in

deposits and required reserves. Upward rate pressures would have been

most pronounced in pursuing a monetary base target, given the need to

reduce total reserves in order to offset the very rapid expansion in

currency that took place.



A - 3

staff had assumed. In addition, reserve demands were considerably

strengthened as required reserves turned out to be $200 million higher

than originally expected at the time of the last FOMC meeting. This

reflected stronger deposits than earlier anticipated. However, the

multiplier relationship between lagged deposits and current required

reserves turned out to be higher than anticipated, and therefore held

down the increase in required reserves that would otherwise have been

associated with deposit growth.

If the Desk had restrained nonborrowed reserves further, banks

would have been forced to borrow their required reserves and/or to reduce

deposit expansion. However, given the sgrength in deposit demand, and

assuming an orderly upward adjustment in the funds rate, the nonborrowed

reserve "target" (within a $50 million range) probably would not have

been achieved even if the upper limit of the funds rate constraint had

been as high as 5-3/4 per cent.

Actual total reserves differed from "target" by about the same

magnitude as nonborrowed reserves. The monetary base showed a much larger

overshoot, reflecting the considerably greater than anticipated rise in

currency.

In sum, if the Desk had adhered to a nonborrowed target, upward

interest rate pressures would have been stronger over the intermeeting

period. Such pressures would have been even stronger if attempts had

been made to achieve the total reserve target, since interest rates would
