MONETARY POLICY ALTERNATIVES

Recent Developments

(1) Since the Committee meeting on December 17, the federal funds rate has

averaged close to its intended level of 5-1/4 percent. Pressures in the money market built

with the approach of the turn of the year; in the event, the ample provision of reserves

through temporary transactions held the effective federal funds rate to 6-1/4 percent on New

Year's Eve. In the maintenance period ending January 29, operating balances of depository

institutions at Reserve Banks fell to an average of $17-3/4 billion, well below their lowest

level in the turbulent period of early 1991, owing to the effects of sweep activity on required

reserves amplified by seasonal declines in reserve demands. Nonetheless, the reserve market

generally has remained tranquil in recent weeks, with day-to-day and intraday variations in

the federal funds rate not discernibly affected.

(2) Other interest rates rose 5 to 15 basis points over the intermeeting period (Chart

1). Data on economic activity came in on the firm side of market expectations, leading many

analysts to boost their forecasts of near-term growth. But prices and overall labor

compensation generally continued to behave better than many market participants had

expected, limiting the uptick in rates. On balance, the configuration of futures rates suggests

that market participants have built in little likelihood that the System will tighten policy over

the first half of 1997 (chart). Survey measures of long-term inflation expectations have not

moved much of late, implying that most of the runup in nominal rates since November has

probably reflected an increase in real terms (chart). Still, real long-term rates remain below

the peak posted four months ago.1 Despite the apparent rise in real yields over the

intermeeting period, major equity indexes gained almost 10 percent. The majority of earnings

reports for the fourth quarter have proven favorable, and earnings growth prospects looking

one year ahead were mostly revised even further into double-digit territory by stock analysts.

(3) The uptick in intermediate- and longer-term rates in the United States was in

sharp contrast with declines in interest rates in many foreign markets, contributing to a 4-3/4

percent surge in the foreign exchange value of the dollar on a weighted-average basis over the

intermeeting period. In Europe, weaker-than-expected economic data fostered yield declines

of 5 to 25 basis points; in Japan, the announcement of greater-than-expected fiscal restraint

led to a 5 basis point decline in yields. The degree of dollar appreciation--6-1/4 percent

against the yen and 5-1/2 percent against the DM and other ERM currencies--seems larger

than can be explained by relative interest rate movements alone, perhaps reflecting increased

risk premiums in response to the growing pessimism about European and Japanese economies.

In Japan, renewed concerns about the financial system and the economy sparked a sharp

decline in the stock market, particularly bank stocks. In Canada, by contrast, readings on

economic activity came in on the strong side; yields there rose 10 basis points, and the U.S.

dollar depreciated 1-1/4 percent. In mid-January, Mexico repaid ahead of schedule its

remaining $3-1/2 billion outstanding debt to the Treasury's Exchange Stabilization Fund.

1 The real yield on the Treasury's new issue of ten-year indexed debt, which elicited
considerable interest at its auction earlier this week, is currently 3.35 percent. Relating that
measure to either survey-based or ex post calculations of real returns, however, will prove
problematic until additional evidence on the behavior of real yields on indexed securities
accumulates.

The Desk did

not intervene.

(4) Recent data suggest that the monetary aggregates ended the old year and opened

the new on a faster growth track than the staff had anticipated at the last Committee meeting,

likely owing in part to the unexpected strength in nominal spending late last year. The

decline in interest rates since September, on net, also may have contributed to the strength of

M2 demand by reducing its opportunity cost, a notion supported by continuing anemic

noncompetitive tenders at Treasury auctions. December's expansion of M2, at a 7-1/2 percent

rate, pulled that aggregate's growth for 1996 to 4-1/2 percent, in the upper portion of its 1-to-

5 percent range. 2 In January, the growth of M2 slowed, but only to a 5-1/2 percent rate.3

This strength in M2 apparently did not come at the expense of capital market mutual funds,

which still seem to be attracting healthy inflows. The increase of M3 in the last month of

1996, at an 11-1/4 percent rate, put its growth for the year at 7 percent, well above its 2-to-6

percent annual range. The expansion of the broader aggregate slowed in January to a 6-3/4

2 The data on the monetary aggregates in this bluebook incorporate revisions from the
annual benchmark and seasonal review. Over the four quarters of 1996, these revisions left
the annual growth of M2 unchanged and raised that of M3 by 0.3 percentage point. These
data are scheduled to be published in early February and until that time are strictly
confidential.

3 M1 expanded at a rate of 1 percent in December but then contracted at a rate of 3-
3/4 percent in January. Adjusting for the initial effects of sweep activity, which has been
relatively steady in recent months, Ml increased at rates of 9-1/4 percent and 2-1/4 percent in
December and January, respectively. The monetary base rose at a rate of 9-1/4 percent in
December, but it dropped at a 5-3/4 percent rate in January. (The comparable figures
adjusting for sweeps are 11 percent and -4 percent.)

percent rate. With bank credit growth remaining robust over the past few months, bank

funding needs were sizable. Branches and agencies of foreign banks have been particularly

active lenders, and these depositories have increasingly relied on domestic rather than foreign

financing to meet those needs, issuing large time deposits in volume.

(5) The growth of the debt of nonfederal sectors edged higher in the closing months

of 1996. Both open markets and financial intermediaries have continued to be quite

accommodative to most borrowers. Market risk spreads have remained narrow, and banks are

said to be quite aggressive in the pursuit of even highly leveraged business borrowers. In the

recent survey of senior loan officers, banks noted a slight easing of standards and a more

significant easing of terms for business loans. In contrast, most loan officers reported that

they had tightened standards on credit card accounts and other consumer loans. However,

while consumer lending by banks slowed in the fourth quarter, incoming data suggest a

rebound in recent weeks, and both banks and finance companies have increasingly marketed

home equity loans as a ready substitute for consumer credit, at least to some households.

Credit demands by the federal government have remained subdued, reflecting the continuing

low budget deficit. On net, total borrowing by nonfinancial sectors was well maintained in

the final months of 1996, with debt expanding over the four quarters of 1996 at 5-1/4 percent,

a touch above the midpoint of its 3-to-7 percent annual range.

Long-Run Scenarios

(6) To provide a longer-run perspective on the strategic issues confronting the

Committee, this section presents econometric model simulations designed to examine

alternative monetary policies as well as the effects of certain shocks to the economy. The

three policy scenarios considered first are built around the Greenbook forecast, using the

staffs new macroeconometric model to extend that forecast and to derive differences resulting

from alternative policies. These scenarios incorporate the same assumptions regarding

underlying macroeconomic factors; notably, the full-employment budget for the federal

government is on path to balance by early in the next century and the NAIRU is 5.6 percent.

Other sets of scenarios consider: (1) a favorable shock to productivity growth, (2) an increase

in the NAIRU, and (3) a significant decline in the stock market. The model's dynamic

properties are importantly affected by the level and changes in the public's expectations about

key economic variables--such as the rate of inflation likely to prevail in the long run.

Because these expectations adapt slowly and nominal wages adjust sluggishly, the sacrifice

ratio over a period of five years is about 2--in line with the historical average for the U.S.

economy. That is, reducing inflation by 1 percentage point requires unemployment to exceed

the NAIRU by the equivalent of 1 percentage point for two years.

(7) The baseline strategy, shown by the solid lines in Chart 2, is an extension of the

Greenbook forecast. By the end of the Greenbook forecast, the disequilibrium in policy and

the economy has become quite evident--the economy is producing beyond its sustainable

potential and the stance of policy is too easy to correct the situation and forestall a continuous

rise in core inflation.4 Under the baseline strategy, the Committee caps the rise in inflation

by tightening policy after 1998 by enough to bring the unemployment rate quickly up to the

NAIRU. This requires the federal funds rate to be raised by around 1-1/2 percentage points,

so that the real funds rate overshoots its equilibrium for a time.5 With this strategy, the

Committee would accept whatever rate of inflation that developed while the economy was

operating beyond its potential, and, as a consequence, core PCE inflation would ratchet up

from an average of 2 to 2-1/2 percent in recent years to a little over 3 percent.

(8) Some pickup in core inflation appears to be unavoidable in the near term given

the staff's assessment of the cyclical position of the economy, but the stable inflation strategy

limits that rise and ultimately brings inflation back down to around its recently prevailing

rate. This entails a near-term tightening, with the nominal funds rate rising to 6-1/2 percent

by the end of 1998. The effects of the unemployment rate remaining below the NAIRU until

early 1999 are tempered in the near term by the sharp slowing in real growth, which keeps

inflation expectations damped in the model (similar in result to a "speed effect" in the

4 In the charts, inflation is measured by the core PCE chain-weight price index, and
past movements in this index are used to proxy for inflation expectations in calculations of
the real funds rate. This index has a steeper upward trajectory over the next few years than
do many other broad measures of prices, because it: (1) excludes food and energy prices,
which are moderating; (2) is unaffected by the changes in BLS calculations of the CPI; and
(3) unlike a broad GDP price measure, includes import prices, which are damped at first and
boosted later by the actual and assumed gyrations of the dollar. We think it gives a clearer
view of the underlying inflation tendencies in the various scenarios, but its application in
calculating the real interest rate may exaggerate the projected drop in real rates in 1997 and
1998, especially if the public forms its expectations based on a broader set of prices than in
this core measure. The real funds rates shown in the charts are higher than those calculated
using the CPI, but would be higher through history as well because inflation as measured by
the PCE index on average has run 1/2 percentage point below the CPI.

5 That equilibrium itself is lower toward the end of the simulation than at present
owing primarily to additional fiscal consolidation.

Phillips curve), and by the rise in the dollar associated with higher interest rates. These

effects dissipate, however, and ultimately the real interest rate and the unemployment rate

must be kept above their natural levels for some time to offset the underlying inflationary

pressures built up as the economy operated above potential from 1996 through 1998.

(9) A strategy involving a sharper tightening of policy over the next two years, with

the nominal funds rate rising soon and reaching 7 percent in late 1998, would achieve price

stability in seven years or so. In this scenario, a higher real funds rate is sustained for longer

than under the stable inflation strategy to produce enough slack in the economy to keep

downward pressures on wages and prices. The sizable output loss reflects the slow adaptation

of expectations noted above. In the absence of empirical evidence that the cost of disinflation

from moderate levels is reduced by an aggressive anti-inflation program or by announced

inflation targets, we have included no special "credibility" effects from the Committee

embarking on a deliberate strategy to achieve price stability. Credibility for price stability

does develop--but "in the old fashioned way," by earning it through achieving stable prices.

This simulation also makes no allowance for enhanced productivity as price stability is

approached.

(10) Chart 3 considers the effects of higher productivity on inflation, in circumstances

in which the unemployment rate is held to its baseline--at least initially.6 In scenario 1,

productivity growth is permanently 1/2 percentage point higher. Ultimately, the higher

productivity growth will feed through to faster growth in real wages, which takes place

through some combination of lower inflation and more rapid increases in nominal wages. In

6 This set of simulations responds to a request from President Jordan, who asked at the
December FOMC meeting about what type of shock to productivity growth would be needed
to attain price stability without opening an output gap.

the model, prices react faster than wages to changes in supply and demand, so the boost to

real wage growth occurs mainly through lower price inflation. In effect, the higher

productivity initially boosts profit margins, firms respond by trying to sell more, and their

competition for market share results in lower prices. As shown by the dotted line in the

middle panel, price inflation ends lower than it started by about 1/3 percentage point. 7

Nominal wage inflation ends higher by 1/6 percentage point, bringing the increase in real

wage growth to 1/2 percentage point, matching the increase in productivity growth. Note that

to achieve this inflation outcome, the Federal Reserve must tighten monetary policy. The

productivity shock stimulates aggregate demand by raising the marginal product of capital--

thereby boosting investment demand. In the long run, real interest rates rise by about the 1/2

percentage point increase in productivity growth (top right panel). But in the short run a

pronounced investment boom occurs, and the Committee must lean against this strength in

demand to keep the unemployment rate along the baseline path, by raising the federal funds

rate to over 7 percent.

(11) If the shock to productivity growth instead is temporary--so that the growth of

productivity returns to its old rate, though the level of productivity remains permanently

higher--inflation would revert to its previous rate if monetary policy continues to hold the

unemployment rate along the baseline. In scenario 2, the productivity growth shock ceases at

the beginning of 2001. As productivity growth slows, firms attempt to maintain profit

margins by raising prices more rapidly in the face of nominal wages that continue to climb at

7 Consequently, with the unemployment rate following the baseline path, productivity
growth would need to be permanently 3 percentage points higher than is embedded in the
Greenbook to reduce long-run inflation by 2 percentage points to 1 percent--the definition of
"price stability" used in the first set of simulations.

the previous rate. But the Committee in this scenario maintains the reduced rate of inflation

by keeping the real federal funds rate above its lower equilibrium level for longer than in

scenario 1, causing unemployment to exceed the NAIRU for some years.

(12) The Committee also faces a risk that the favorable performance of compensation

and inflation over recent years is due in part to temporary factors, such as one-time savings in

benefit costs from the shift toward managed health care, or to depressed compensation growth

caused by transitory worker insecurity. The simulations in Chart 4 posit that this favorable

performance dissipates over 1997, so that the NAIRU reverts to the neighborhood of 6

percent by the end of the year. If the Committee were not to recognize the increase in

NAIRU, and kept the nominal federal funds rate along its baseline path, inflation would not

be capped at about 3 percent but would continue to accelerate--gradually at first, but more

rapidly over time--reaching 3-1/2 percent at the end of 1999 and 4 percent during 2000. If

instead the Committee adjusted the nominal funds rate in response to observed inflation to

keep the real funds rate along the baseline path, inflation would have a milder upward tilt--

rising to 3-1/2 percent in 2000. But a strategy to keep inflation on the baseline path (not

shown) would need to bring the real funds rate about 1/2 percentage point above the baseline

to constrain demand to the lower level of output now consistent with the higher NAIRU.

(13) On the demand side of the economy, an important potential risk might be

thought to be a break in the stock market. In the immediate scenario of Chart 5, the stock

market falls 25 percent in the current quarter. Aggregate demand is damped (by about 3/4

percent by the end of 1997) as lower wealth holds down consumption and higher costs of

equity financing weaken investment. (We made no special allowance for possible

extraordinary financial-market disruptions.) To mitigate the effects on output and

employment while maintaining inflation along the baseline, the nominal federal funds rate

falls in 1997 by 75 basis points relative to the baseline.8 The funds rate later rises to a level

50 basis points below the baseline, the amount needed to offset the depressing long-run effect

on aggregate demand of the lower level of wealth. In the gradual scenario, the fall in the

stock market is spread out over five years. The policy response is also spread out, paralleling

the gradual decline in the equilibrium real funds rate.9

8 To return the unemployment rate to the baseline level by the end of 1998, the funds
rate would have to fall by another 1/2 percentage point. However, the further decline in the
funds rate would bring inflation above its baseline path owing to price effects of dollar
depreciation.

9 A stock market increase, rather than a decrease, of a similar absolute magnitude
relative to the Greenbook baseline would require a policy tightening of comparable size in
order to maintain inflation around the baseline path.

Long-Run Ranges for 1997

(14) As background for the Committee's discussion of the annual ranges for 1997, the

table below presents projections for the growth of money and credit based on the Greenbook

forecast. In addition, the table shows as alternative I the provisional ranges adopted by the

FOMC last July as well as an alternative involving higher ranges for the monetary

aggregates. 10

Memo: Nominal GDP 5.2 4-1/2

(15) The staff projects that M2 will expand 4-1/2 percent over the four quarters of

1997, in line with forecasted growth in nominal income. During the early 1990s, M2 demand

had diverged significantly from its historical relationship with nominal GDP and short-run

opportunity costs, with its velocity rising well above its previous long-run average level, as

shown in Chart 6.11 Recently, however, evidence has suggested that a stable demand for M2

may have re-emerged, although the period of more normal velocity behavior has been brief.

In contrast to the early 1990s, changes in the velocity of M2 over the past 2-1/2 years or so

can be explained primarily by variations in its short-run opportunity cost, and the apparent

sensitivity of V2 to opportunity costs has been quite similar to that prevailing previously.

The staff's forecast for M2 growth during 1997 is consistent with the putative new

relationship depicted in the chart: With short-term market interest rates assumed to be about

unchanged and banks apparently comfortable with current relationships between market rates

and deposit rates, short-term opportunity costs should remain about flat during the year,

leaving M2 velocity little changed. In addition, capital gains on equity investments are

expected by the staff to be considerably smaller than the extraordinary increases of recent

years and bond rates are projected to change little on balance over the four quarters of 1997,

so that flows into capital market mutual funds should moderate and not depress M2 growth

relative to that of nominal income, as they apparently did to a small extent last year. Within

M2, patterns of growth are expected to be similar to those during 1996; in particular, M1 is

projected to continue to decline substantially, reflecting the further spread of retail sweep

accounts. 12

(16) The staff expects M3 to continue to outpace both M2 and nominal income in

1997, expanding at a 6-1/4 percent annual rate, down somewhat from last year's 7 percent

jump. (The projected decline in M3 velocity is shown on Chart 7.) In an environment of

moderate overall credit growth and of little net change in interest rates or lending conditions

that would prompt shifts in borrowing patterns, bank and thrift credit growth, adjusted for

mark-to-market accounting effects, should remain near last year's temperate pace. In funding

12 Depository institutions appear to have considerable scope to continue to implement
retail sweep arrangements, and, as a result, required reserves are likely to contract further in
1997. With foreign currency shipments assumed to remain near last year's pace, currency is
projected again to expand a little more rapidly than nominal income. The monetary base is
projected to increase 3-1/2 percent, or 5-1/2 percent adjusted for the initial effects of sweeps.

their asset growth, banks are expected to increase their large time deposits somewhat less

rapidly than they did in 1996, when they were responding to the reduction in deposit

insurance premiums beginning in late 1995. M3 likely will be buoyed again by gains in

money market mutual funds, which should continue to capture wholesale investments as

managers find it increasingly convenient to invest cash with money funds rather than place it

directly in the open market instruments, some of which are outside of M3.

(17) The staff is projecting domestic nonfinancial sector debt to rise 5 percent during

1997, slightly slower than in 1996 and a little above nominal income growth. With the

federal deficit remaining relatively modest, Treasury debt will continue its recent pattern of

deceleration, rising about 3-1/4 percent. Expansion of the debt of nonfederal sectors also is

projected to edge lower. That slowing owes entirely to the household sector, where debt

growth is projected to hold at around the reduced rates of recent months. Banks may tighten

further terms and standards for consumer loans, but the increased willingness of

intermediaries to extend home equity loans would moderate the effects on overall credit

availability to households. Even so, total residential mortgage formation is expected to slow

in association with the slackening in housing activity. Despite the downshift in household

debt growth, it is projected to continue to exceed the increase in income. In the nonfinancial

business sector, borrowing picks up; the financing gap widens as internal funds fail to keep

pace with capital spending, and the volume of net equity retirements remains large owing to

sustained merger and acquisition activity and to repurchases of outstanding equity.

(18) Under the baseline projection, M2 and M3 would finish 1997 a little below and

just above the upper ends of their respective provisional annual ranges given as alternative I

in paragraph (14), while domestic nonfinancial sector debt would be in the middle of its



- 15-

provisional range. Given these point estimates and the significant uncertainties in forecasting

money demand relationships, either or both monetary aggregates could run significantly above

their ranges under the interest rates and income growth of the baseline Greenbook projection.

Nonetheless, as in recent years when faced with similar circumstances, the Committee might

wish to retain the provisional ranges, rather than increase them. The Committee's rationale

has been that, in the context of uncertainty about money demand relationships, it has

preferred not to highlight its expectations for money growth in the upcoming period but rather

to maintain ranges that, if velocity behavior were normal, would be consistent over time with

the Committee's goal of sustained non-inflationary growth.13 The expectations for the year

ahead relative to those ranges could again be made clear in the Humphrey-Hawkins report

and testimony. If the Committee were not ready to place any heightened emphasis on M2

because it still saw considerable risk that policy could be misled by money growth, it might

be concerned that any change in the annual ranges after four years could be misinterpreted by

the public as a signal of an upgrading of the aggregates, despite Committee explanations to

the contrary. As an additional reason for preferring alternative I, the Committee might not

see as large a risk of overshooting the provisional ranges of alternative I as under the staff

forecast if it thought that monetary policy would need to tighten during 1997 to further its

objectives. For example, the staff estimates that the higher interest rates and slightly slower

nominal GDP growth of the "stable inflation strategy" in the previous section would be

associated with M2 growth on the order of 3-3/4 percent over this year.

13 Under this rationale, however, the Committee might consider reducing the range for
domestic nonfinancial sector debt, as the existing 3 to 7 percent range is unlikely to squarely
encompass the rate of debt growth consistent with price stability.



- 16-

(19) If, on the other hand, the Committee did not see interest rates as likely to rise

much over the course of 1997 and saw nominal income as coming in close to the Greenbook

projection, and it wanted the ranges to encompass more comfortably the associated rates of

money growth, it probably would prefer alternative II, which would raise the ranges for both

M2 and M3 by 1 percentage point.14 (Alternative II would retain the provisional range for

debt.) Although money growth is forecast to be in the upper halves of the Alternative II

ranges rather than in the middle, the Committee might find this to be an attractive feature,

consistent with an opportunistic approach to disinflation and the Committee's current

asymmetric directive. Both imply the Committee has a stronger predilection to tighten

aggressively in response to overshoots in nominal spending than to ease in response to

unexpected undershoots. Hence, money growth is more likely to be well below than well

above the staff projection, consistent with the staff forecast lying in the upper halves of the

alternative II ranges. Furthermore, the higher upper limits of the ranges in this alternative as

compared with those of the provisional ranges imply greater scope for the possibility of

strong money growth associated with money demand shifts that are not related to disturbances

to spending, which would automatically be accommodated under current operating procedures,

and appropriately so.

14 The central tendency of Committee members' nominal GDP projections
encompasses the Greenbook projection.

Short-run Policy Alternatives

(20) Presented below are two short-run monetary policy alternatives. Under

alternative B, the federal funds rate would kept at 5-1/4 percent. Under alternative C, the

federal funds rate would be raised by 1/2 percentage point to 5-3/4 percent, either through a

less generous provision of nonborrowed reserves or a hike in the discount rate.

(21) In the staff economic forecast, which is based on no change in the federal funds

rate, growth in output slows in early 1997 to just below the rate of increase in potential,

before picking up some. As a consequence, pressures on resources hold steady in the near

term but then intensify further. With the economy seen already to be operating somewhat

beyond its long-run potential, underlying increases in labor compensation and prices move

higher through the end of the forecast period, and would be expected to escalate at an

increasingly rapid pace thereafter, absent a policy adjustment. Over the near-term, however,

the sharp appreciation of the dollar and back-up in bond yields should help to restrain demand

and price pressures. Consequently, although the inflationary tendencies in the staff's forecast

may not be acceptable to the Committee, the extent of the pickup is gradual enough over

coming quarters that, should it occur, it probably could be reversed by policy tightening later

this year without severe economic dislocations. In these circumstances, the costs of

continuing the "wait and see" stance for a while longer may not be large even if the staff is

right about the underlying pressures in the economy, and the Committee would have more

information to assess whether additional price pressures are, indeed, likely to develop.

(22) Financial markets currently are not anticipating a change in policy at the

February meeting, and thus the choice of alternative B should initially have little impact on

interest rates or the foreign exchange value of the dollar. Over the course of the intermeeting



- 18-

period, the downshifting of growth in early 1997 in the staff forecast probably is greater than

expected by market participants and the news on inflation is a little better, and rates could

edge lower. Moreover, signs of a political deal to balance the budget, which the staff

assumes will be struck at some point, could put some additional downward pressure on long-

term rates, especially if it involved entitlements and hence trimmed deficits beyond 2002.

The course of equity prices is particularly uncertain in view of their lofty valuations. While a

correction cannot be ruled out, earnings reports, especially those still coming in for the strong

fourth quarter, should remain favorable in the period just ahead, and with little change in

interest rates, equity prices could well hold around recent levels.

(23) Although the real federal funds rate is not low by historic standards, the run-up

in share prices along with the generous provision of credit to most borrowers are seen as

contributing to unsustainably accommodative financial conditions in the staff forecast. While

inflation does not deteriorate appreciably in the near term, given the lags in the effect of

policy, the sooner the Committee begins to tighten--as under alternative C--the lower the odds

that higher inflation will become embedded in price and wage setting. The discussion in the

long-run strategies section suggested that a rise in the funds rate of 125 basis points by late

1998 would be needed to keep inflation from moving permanently higher.

(24) The tightening of policy under alternative C would surprise market participants,

and short-term interest rates, including the prime rate, would rise by the half-point hike in the

federal funds rate. In view of the shift in policy direction represented by such an action,

intermediate- and long-term rates could rise appreciably, especially if market participants

thought the Federal Reserve now saw significantly greater inflation risks than they had

inferred from recent statements by FOMC members. In this case, participants are more likely



- 19-

to extrapolate some further tightening measures. Stock prices likely would come under

selling pressure, as monetary tightenings frequently have been associated with bear markets.

Nonetheless, even a significant backup in bond yields is unlikely to push them substantially

above the trading range of late spring and summer, which in turn has seemed to be

compatible with healthy economic growth. Moreover, the extraordinary rise in equity prices

over the last several months probably would not be wholly erased given recent strong

earnings news. The extent of the backup in nominal coupon yields might be contained were

the tightening to affect inflation expectations favorably by underscoring the Federal Reserve's

determination to forestall a pickup in inflation. The dollar would tend to rise on foreign

exchange markets from its elevated level of late, as the contrast between the cyclical positions

of the United States and many of its major trading partners was sharpened even further. Of

course, such declines in bond and stock prices and rise in the dollar would be important

channels through which the Committee would achieve its desired restraint on aggregate

demand growth.

(25) Growth of the broad monetary aggregates is expected to slow under alternative B

from the very rapid pace of late 1996. Still, both M2 and M3 are projected to outpace

nominal income in the first few months of the year and to remain above the upper ends of

their provisional ranges for 1997 through March. M1, by contrast, is projected to run off in

the current quarter, owing to heavy sweep activity, but to expand moderately after adjusting

for sweeps. Growth of debt of domestic nonfinancial sectors is expected to run a little faster

in early 1997 than in late 1996, reflecting in part stronger business borrowing. Still, by

March this aggregate would be around the middle of its provisional range.

Directive Language

(26) Presented below for the members' consideration is draft wording relating to the

Committee's ranges for the aggregates in 1997 and the operational paragraph for the

intermeeting period.

The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and financial

conditions that will foster price stability and promote sustainable growth in

output. In furtherance of these objectives, the Committee at THIS its

meeting [DEL: in July reaffirmed the] ESTABLISHED ranges [DEL: it had established in

January] for growth of M2 and M3 of ____ TO ____ [DEL: 1 to 5] percent and ____ TO

____ {DEL: 2 to 6] percent respectively, measured from the fourth quarter of 1996

1995 to the fourth quarter of 1997 [DEL: 1996]. The monitoring range for growth

of total domestic nonfinancial debt was SET [DEL: maintained] at ____ TO ____ [DEL: 3 to

7] percent for the year. The behavior of the monetary aggregates will

continue to be evaluated in the light of progress toward price level

stability, movements in their velocities, and developments in the economy

and financial markets.

OPERATIONAL PARAGRAPH

In the implementation of policy for the immediate future, the

Committee seeks to DECREASE (SLIGHTLY/SOMEWHAT)/maintain/

INCREASE (SLIGHTLY/SOMEWHAT) the existing degree of pressure on

reserve positions. In the context of the Committee's long-run objectives for

price stability and sustainable economic growth, and giving careful

consideration to economic, financial, and monetary developments,



-22-

somewhat (SLIGHTLY) greater reserve restraint would (MIGHT) or

(SOMEWHAT) slightly lesser reserve restraint (WOULD) might be

acceptable in the intermeeting period. The contemplated reserve conditions

are expected to be consistent with SOME MODERATION IN THE

[DEL: relatively strong] expansion in OF M2 AND M3 over coming months.

1. Targets are for bank credit until 1983; from 1983 onward targets are for domestic nonfinancial sector debt.

2. The figures shown reflect target and actual growth of M1-B in 1980 and shift-adjusted M1-B in 1981. M1-B was
relabelled M1 in January 1982. The targeted growth for M1-A was 3-1/2 to 6 percent in 1980 (actual growth was
5.0 percent); in 1981 targeted growth for shift-adjusted M1-A was 3 to 5-1/2 percent (actual growth was 1.3 percent).

3. When these ranges were set, shifts into other checkable deposits in 1980 were expected to have only a limited
effect on growth of M1-A and M1-B. As the year progressed, however, banks offered other checkable deposits more
actively, and more funds than expected were directed to these accounts. Such shifts are estimated to have decreased
M1-A growth and increased M1-B growth each by at least 1/2 percentage point more than had been anticipated.

4. Adjusted for the effects of shifts out of demand deposits and savings deposits. At the February FOMC meeting,
the target ranges for observed M1-A and M1-B in 1981 on an unadjusted basis, expected to be consistent with the
adjusted ranges, were -(4-1/2) to -2 and 6 to 8-1/2 percent, respectively. Actual M1-B growth (not shift adjusted)
was 5.0 percent.

5. Adjusted for shifts of assets from domestic banking offices to International Banking Facilities.

6. Range for bank credit is annualized growth from the December 1981 - January 1982 average level through the
fourth quarter of 1982.

7. Base period, adopted at the July 1983 FOMC meeting, is 1983 QII. At the February 1983 meeting, the FOMC
had adopted a 1982 QIV to 1983 QIV target range for M1 of 4 to 8 percent.

8. Base period is the February-March 1983 average.

9. Base period, adopted at the July 1985 FOMC meeting, is 1985 QII. At the February 1983 meeting, the FOMC
had adopted a 1984 QIV to 1985 QIV target range for M1 of 4 to 7 percent.

10. No range for M1 has been specified since the February 1987 FOMC meeting because of uncertainties about its
underlying relationship to the behavior of the economy and its sensitivity to economic and financial circumstances.

11. At the February 1990 meeting, the FOMC specified a range of 2-1/2 to 6-1/2 percent. This range was lowered
to 1 to 5 percent at the July 1990 meeting.

12. At the February 1993 meeting, the FOMC specified a range of 2 to 6 percent for M2, 1/2 to 4-1/2 percent for
M3, and 4-1/2 to 8-1/2 percent for domestic nonfinancial debt. These ranges were lowered to 1 to 5 percent for M2,
0 to 4 percent for M3, and 4 to 8 percent for domestic nonfinancial debt at the July 1993 meeting.

13. At the February 1995 meeting, the FOMC specified a range of 0 to 4 percent This range was raised to 2 to 6
percent at the July 1995 meeting.
