of Governors of the Federal Reserve System.  This electronic document was created 
through a comprehensive digitization process which included identifying the best-
preserved paper copies, scanning those copies,1 and then making the scanned 
versions text-searchable.2   Though a stringent quality assurance process was 
employed, some imperfections may remain.

MONEY MARKET CONDITIONS

Recent developments

(1) Growth of the monetary aggregates slowed in September

to annual rates of 1.3 per cent for M1 and 2.4 per cent for M2. Taking

into account our current October estimate, which is still largely pro-

jected, money growth rates for the combined September-October period

appear to be well below the ranges of tolerance established at the last

Committee meeting, as the table shows. Expansion in the adjusted bank

credit proxy has also been well below expectations, and RPD growth has

been considerably below the lower limit of its two-month range of

tolerance.

1/ The range adopted at the meeting was 10½-12 per cent, but the lower end
was dropped to 10¼ per cent by Committee action on October 4.

(2) Evidence of sluggish growth in the money and reserve

aggregates emerged immediately following the last Committee meeting. In

responding to this weakness, the Desk moved cautiously at first, in part



-2-

to avoid encouraging an unduly rapid decline in market rates. The funds

rate declined from an average of 11 48 per cent in the week of the Committee

meeting (week of Sept. 11) to around 11 per cent in early October. On

October 4, the Committee concurred in the Chairman's view that the Federal

funds rate should be reduced to a range of 10½--10¾ per cent and in his

recommendation that the lower limit of the funds rate constraint should

be reduced by ¼ point to 10¼ per cent. In the week ending October 9,

the funds rate averaged 10.43 per cent. With nonborrowed reserves provided

more aggressively, member bank borrowing in that week (apart from Franklin)

dropped to $1.0 billion as compared with an average of about $1.9 billion

in August and September. Most recently, the Desk has been aiming at a

Federal funds rate tending toward the lower end of a 10¼--10½ per cent

range.

(3) Slow growth in the monetary aggregates and the accumulating

evidence of generally sluggish economic activity created widespread

expectations that the System would ease pressures on credit markets

somewhat further. When declines in the Federal funds rate appeared to

confirm these expectations, other short-term rates dropped sharply--in some

cases by more than 200 basis points. As rates on large CD's and commercial

paper declined, many banks lowered their prime rates to 11¾ per cent, and

most recently a few key banks have dropped the rate to 11½ per cent. The

yield on 3-month Treasury bills fell from a level in excess of 9 per cent

at the time of the last Committee meeting to a low of 6-1/8 per cent.

This change was accentuated by large foreign buying

of bills in September, reinvestment demands from holders of maturing



-3-

September tax bills, and an unexpected cut-back by the Treasury in the size

of weekly bill auctions during the period of peak quarterly income tax

receipts. Most recently, however, with the Treasury increasing--rather

than cutting--the size of its weekly bill auctions, and with large additional

Treasury cash borrowing anticipated shortly, the 3-month bill rate has

bounced back and closed Friday at around 7.65 per cent.

(4) Interest rates on long-term Treasury and State and local

government securities have declined somewhat since the last meeting--by

roughly 1/8 to 1/4 of a percentage point. Yields on new and recently

offered corporate issues have risen somewhat further on balance to new

highs, because of a sharp expansion in the prospective volume of new bond

offerings; most recently corporate bond yields have edged off. In the

stock market, price indices continued to decline over most of the inter-

meeting period, reaching their lowest levels in 12 years, but in recent

days a sharp rebound raised the Dow-Jones industrial average by about

75 points. The very recent improvement in the stock market and an

accompanying better tone in bond markets may be attributable in part to

the Administration's new economic program as well as to recent signs of

a less restrictive monetary policy.

(5) The table on the following page shows (in percentage annual

rates of change) selected monetary and financial flows over various recent

time periods. Appendix table III compares money supply growth rates computed

on a quarterly-average basis with those computed on a last-month-of-quarter

basis. Projected figures on the two bases are shown in appendix table IV

for the three alternatives presented in the next section.

Prospective developments

(6) Attached below for Committee consideration are three

alternative specifications to accompany the directive, with additional

detail presented in the table on the following page. The longer-run

targets encompass the same time period (the seven months August 1974 to

March 1975) as employed for target purposes at the September Committee

meeting.

(inter-meeting range)

(7) Of the three alternatives shown, alternative B includes the

5¾ per cent longer-run target path for M1 adopted at the last Committee

meeting. A further decline in the Federal funds rate over the next few

weeks is indicated for that alternative, at least to the mid-point of the

8¾-10¾ per cent range. The expected funds rate is lower than anticipated

at the previous meeting for two reasons: (a) M 1 growth since the meeting

has fallen short of expectations, and thus a more active provision of

reserves is required in future to move back to path; and (b) demand for

money is expected to be lower, particularly by the first quarter, in view

of the slower growth now projected by the staff for nominal GNP.

(8) Based on partial data for the early days of the month, M1

growth in October is expected to be quite slow. Growth is,expected to pick up

considerably later in the fall and early winter, partly in consequence of

the lagged impact on money demand of recent and projected interest rate

declines. Over the October-November period, M1 growth is indicated to

be in a 4¾-6¾ per cent annual rate range under alternative B. Given the

small rise in September, the 5¾ per cent growth rate from August to March

implies a 6½ per cent rate from September to March--i.e. over the fourth

and first quarters.

(9) Demand pressures on credit markets are expected to be

intense over the next few weeks. A large amount of new corporate and

municipal bond offerings is scheduled. Federal agency financing needs

remain large. And the Treasury will be raising about $4 billion of new

cash by early November--through additions to bill auctions, other

offerings of short-term instruments, and perhaps also an intermediate-term

note. The Treasury will also announce on October 30 the terms on which

it will refund $4.3 billion of maturing publicly held coupon issues.

These borrowing demands will tend to moderate the general declines in

interest rates that would otherwise be prompted by a further drop in the

funds rate to around 9¾ per cent.



-7-

(10) The additional declines in interest rates expected under

alternative B may involve a further easing in the 3-month commercial paper

rate to the 9-9½ per cent range, compared with around 9¾ per cent currently,

The 3-month Treasury bill should continue to fluctuate very widely--say,

in a 6-8 per cent range--and may average a bit below 7 per cent, although

very large additions to the supply of bills in the days immediately ahead

would likely exert upward pressure on the rate. As short-term market rates

ease off, some pick-up in net inflows of time deposits other than money

market CD's at banks are to be expected, and the position of thrift institu-

tions may show some improvement. Growth rates of 7½ and 6¼ per cent,

respectively, are expected for M2 and M3 over the fourth and first quarters,

up from the relatively low third quarter growth rates of 4-5 per cent.

(11) Bank credit growth is expected to be moderate, on balance,

over the months ahead. Some rebound is likely in business loans from the

unusually low September pace, particularly with business inventory

accumulation projected to be sizable in the fourth quarter. However, loan

growth is not expected to be as large as in earlier months. The strained

liquidity position of banks is likely to keep them from easing nonprice lending

terms significantly, although the prime loan rate may decline further.

Moreover, improved conditions in the commercial paper market should tend

to divert some corporate borrowing away from the banks.

(12) Alternative C involves a Federal funds rate range centering

on 10 per cent, the average rate prevailing in the last full statement

week, M1 expansion in this alternative is expected to be consistent



-8-

with a longer-run target rate of growth of 5 per cent, annual rate (from

Aug. '74 to March '75). Over the fourth and first quarters, the rate of

growth would average about 5¾ per cent.

(13) Given the demand pressures noted earlier and the prevailing

expectations of a further easing of monetary policy, it is likely that

some of the recent decline in short-term market interest rates would be

reversed in the weeks ahead under this alternative. The 3-month bill rate

might be expected to average around 8 per cent, and the commercial paper

rate to move back into a 10-10 per cent range. Corporate bond yields

would probably be under upward pressure, while the recent slight moderation

of mortgage market pressures would be unlikely to persist, both because of

the general market atmosphere and because inflows to thrift institutions

would be expected to show little improvement.

(14) Alternative A contemplates a more rapid growth path for

M1 than under alternative B. To achieve this growth a more pronounced

easing of money market conditions is therefore required, and we believe

that the funds rate would need to drop to 9 per cent shortly after the

Committee meeting. Such a decline would generate substantial expectational

effects, with Treasury bill rates probably dropping by more than a per-

centage point, and longer-term market rates easing off. Inflows of

consumer-type time And savings deposits at banks and thrift institutions

would improve noticeably; the thrift institutions would be in a position

to improve liquidity; and lenders would probably become more willing to

make new mortgage commitments.



Proposed directive language

(15) Presented below are three alternative formulations

for the operational paragraph of the directive, which are intended

to correspond to the similarly lettered policy alternatives discussed

in the preceding section. For all three alternatives, it is proposed

to include a reference to Treasury financing because the regular mid-

November refunding will be announced on October 30.

Alternative A

To implement this policy, while taking account of THE

FORTHCOMING TREASURY FINANCING AND OF developments in domestic

and international financial markets, the Committee seeks to

achieve bank reserve and money market conditions consistent with

SUBSTANTIAL [DEL: moderate] growth in monetary aggregates over the months

ahead.

Alternative B

To implement this policy, while taking account of THE

FORTHCOMING TREASURY FINANCING AND OF developments in domestic

and international financial markets, the Committee seeks to

achieve bank reserve and money market conditions consistent

with RESUMPTION OF moderate growth in monetary aggregates over

the months ahead.

Alternative C

To implement this policy, while taking account of THE

FORTHCOMING TREASURY FINANCING AND OF developments in domestic

and international financial markets, the Committee seeks to

achieve bank reserve and money market conditions consistent with

[DEL: moderate] MODEST growth in monetary aggregates over the months

ahead.
