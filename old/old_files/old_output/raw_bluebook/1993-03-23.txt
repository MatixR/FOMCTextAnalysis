The attached document represents the most complete and accurate version 
available based on original copies culled from the files of the FOMC Secretariat at the 
Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System.  This electronic document was 
created through a comprehensive digitization process which included identifying the best-
preserved paper copies, scanning those copies,1 and then making the scanned versions 
text-searchable.2  Though a stringent quality assurance process was employed, some 
imperfections may remain. 
 

Please note that this document may contain occasional gaps in the text.  These

scanned images were deskewed (to remove the effects of printer- and scanner-introduced tilting) and lightly 
cleaned (to remove dark spots caused by staple holes, hole punches, and other blemishes caused after initial 
printing).

MONETARY POLICY ALTERNATIVES

Recent Developments 1

(1) The degree of reserve pressure was left unchanged over

the intermeeting period. The intended level of the federal funds rate

remained at 3 percent and the allowance for adjustment and seasonal

borrowing at $50 million. The federal funds rate has averaged 3.03

percent since the early February FOMC meeting, and borrowing has aver-

aged slightly above its allowance. Short-term market interest rates

were little changed over the intermeeting period.

(2) Bond markets, however, rallied strongly over much of the

period. Prospects for significant reductions in the federal budget

deficit in coming years and the consequences for aggregate demand

appeared to be the most important influence sparking the rally. De-

mands for Treasury notes and bonds also were boosted by municipal

defeasance activity and assessments of heightened prepayment risk on

mortgage-backed securities. Toward the end of the period, however,

upturns in inflation readings prompted some backup in yields, but

renewed rate declines most recently have erased much of this backup.

On balance, most intermediate- and long-term yields have fallen 40 to

50 basis points over the period. Rate spreads on mortgage-backed

securities and fixed-rate mortgages over comparable Treasuries have

widened some; nevertheless, mortgage rates reached their lowest levels

in two decades. The drop in interest rates buoyed stock prices: Most

major indexes rose 1 to 3 percent, although the NASDAQ index declined

somewhat on net, reflecting concerns about future changes in government

policy toward certain industries, including health-care firms.

1. Financial market quotations in this bluebook reflect data avail-
able through noon, March 19.



(3) The dollar's foreign exchange value on a weighted-average

basis declined about 1-1/4 percent on balance over the intermeeting

period. During much of the period, the dollar generally rose against

European currencies, amid signs of weakening activity and easier cur-

rent and prospective monetary policy stances in those countries. But

the dollar declined against the mark and other European currencies

following the Bundesbank's cut in its discount rate on March 18 that

embodied less easing than was apparently expected by market partici-

pants. On balance, the dollar fell 1/2 percent against the mark over

the period. German short-term rates dropped 70 basis points, while the

long-term rate moved down 40 basis points. Interest rates elsewhere in

Europe also decreased. The dollar depreciated 7-1/2 percent against

the yen, as market attention focused on Japan's growing trade surplus.

In Japan, short-term rates and the bellwether bond yield declined about

20 basis points during the intermeeting period.

(4) The broad monetary aggregates continued to contract in

February. M2 dropped at a 4 percent rate. Its Ml component fell

slightly last month, continuing its deceleration from the double-digit

pace that prevailed over much of 1992.2 The nontransaction com-

ponent of M2 again contracted rapidly. Owing mainly to strong flows

into institution-only money funds, the decline in M3 slowed last month,

and, at a 2-1/2 percent rate, was more moderate than that in M2. The

2. In February, total reserves and the monetary base expanded at
5-1/2 and 8-1/2 percent rates, respectively. These figures incor-
porate revised seasonal factors and are confidential until their
publication, which is scheduled for March 25.



available data for the first half of March show a less rapid outflow

from M2 but a stepped-up runoff of M3 compared with February. From

January to mid-March, the broader aggregates, especially M2, were

appreciably weaker than anticipated at the time of the last bluebook.

As of mid-March, the broad aggregates were well below their target

cones and only a little above the lower edges of their parallel bands.

(5) Much of the recent weakness in the monetary aggregates

appears to be due to temporary factors. Some weakness in M2 associated

with seasonal adjustment distortions and a decline in deposit balances

associated with a fall in prepayments of mortgage-backed securities was

foreseen in the last bluebook.3  In the event, prepayments plunged

more rapidly than earlier projected. But not all of the shortfall of

M2 from expectations is accounted for by larger-than-anticipated

temporary factors. Thus, even abstracting from temporary depressants,

M2 appears to be fundamentally weaker than foreseen earlier, with

underlying growth from January to mid-March, while positive, quite

modest. Of the 8-1/2 percent growth rate in M2 velocity that seems to

be in train this quarter, no more than 1-1/2 percentage points can

plausibly be attributed to these temporary factors. Evidently, some of

the other persisting influences that have been boosting velocity in

recent years have intensified. Relatively attractive returns on capi-

tal market instruments likely have prompted households to divert more

funds from deposits into bond and stock mutual fund shares, which have

posted record inflows in recent months. Bank credit expansion has

slowed noticeably this year, and banks also have continued to tap

3. The staff's standard seasonal adjustment procedures have at-
tributed strong monetary growth in February in both 1991 and 1992 to
evolving seasonal patterns rather than recognizing the stimulative
effects of previous declines in short-term interest rates that
resulted from easings of monetary policy around the year-end in 1990
and 1991.



markets for subordinated debt and equity, further depressing their

needs for deposit funding. Both M2 and M3 have borne the imprint of

these developments, as interest rates on retail deposits have dropped

further in recent weeks and as large time deposits have continued to

run off. Moreover, the leveling out of short-term interest rates since

last September, as the stance of monetary policy has held steady, has

meant that earlier policy-induced stimulus to growth of the broader

aggregates has ended.

(6) Overall private debt growth appears to be expanding

around or a bit faster than its pace over the last few months of 1992.

Businesses have drawn heavily on credit markets, as the rally in bond

prices set off another surge of corporate issuance, although the pro-

ceeds were largely used to repay business loans at banks and commercial

paper, both of which have declined a little on balance so far this

year. State and local governments have taken advantage of favorable

market conditions by selling a hefty volume of bonds, with an enlarged

proportion of the offerings earmarked to refund debt. Households seem

to have increased their willingness to take on debt in recent months:

Consumer installment credit rose in January for the fifth straight

month and, in February, bank consumer loans adjusted for securitization

rose at nearly a 9 percent annual rate. Total domestic nonfinancial

debt is estimated to have grown at about a 4-1/2 percent rate from the

fourth quarter through February, leaving this aggregate around the

lower bound of its 1993 monitoring range.

excess reserves and borrowing, are calculated by prorating
averages for two-week reserve maintenance periods that overlap
months. Reserve data incorporate adjustments for discontinui-
ties associated with changes in reserve requirements.



Policy alternatives

(7) Three policy alternatives are presented below for con-

sideration by the Committee. Under alternative B, federal funds would

continue to trade around 3 percent in association with the allowance for

adjustment plus seasonal borrowing initially remaining at $50 million.

The allowance probably will need to be revised upward over the inter-

meeting period when demands for seasonal credit strengthen during the

spring. Under alternative A, the federal funds rate would decline to

the 2-1/2 percent area. This alternative could be implemented through a

1/2 percentage point drop in the discount rate, holding the initial

borrowing allowance at the same level as in alternative B, or by

lowering the initial borrowing allowance to $25 million and leaving the

discount rate unchanged. Alternative C, involving a rise in the federal

funds rate to 3-1/2 percent, could be implemented through a boost in the

initial borrowing allowance to $75 million.

(8) Market participants are expecting neither tightening nor

easing in the stance of monetary policy for some time. They appear to

anticipate that the recent runup in inflation will subside in large

part. The gains in stock prices and sustained narrow quality spreads

suggest that investors now also believe that the bond market rally,

together with the economy's existing forward momentum, will keep the

contractionary effects of the deficit-reduction package from derailing

the economic expansion. Thus, under alternative B, short-term interest

rates would stay around current levels. Intermediate- and long-term

rates will remain sensitive to news on the fiscal front and correspond-

ing implications for the economy, as well as reports bearing on the

inflation outlook. Bond rates could edge lower should incoming news on

prices confirm the extent of moderation in inflation embodied in the



staff economic forecast. The dollar would be expected to fluctuate

around current levels under alternative B, but could firm somewhat if

rate declines in Europe prove to be faster and larger than now expected.

(9) The easing of policy under alternative A would surprise

market participants and would lead to a decline in short-term rates,

including the prime rate, commensurate with the 1/2 percentage point

drop in the federal funds rate. In such circumstances, bankers might be

more encouraged to ease lending standards and nonprice terms on business

loans. Rate declines at longer maturities would be muted should market

participants see the easing in the absence of weak economic data as

risking a sustained resurgence of inflation. Conversely, the tightening

of policy under alternative C, which also would come as a surprise to

market participants, would induce a rise in short-term rates comparable

to the hike in the federal funds rate. The increase in intermediate-

and long-term rates would be lessened to the degree it were seen as a

timely measure to hold inflation in check. To the extent that market

participants saw dimmer prospects for economic activity, risk premiums

incorporated in yields on private obligations would increase. The ex-

change value of the dollar would move in the same direction as domestic

interest rates under either alternative.

(11) Monetary growth rates for the February-to-June period

thought to be consistent with the three alternatives are shown in the

table below. Despite both stronger nominal income expansion and lower

longer-term interest rates than expected previously, in all three

alternatives growth rates of M2 and M3 over this period are roughly

1 percentage point below those in the previous bluebook. These revi-

sions primarily reflect the weaker-than-expected underlying monetary

growth to date and the prospect that the various influences causing a



rechanneling of credit flows away from depositories will remain intense,

even if abating some from their extraordinary strength so far this year.

M2 3/4 1/2 1/4
M3 -1 -1 -1-1/4
M1 9 8-1/4 7-1/2

(12) Under alternative B, M2 is expected to resume growth over

the February-to-June period. The projected 2-1/2 percent average rate

implies growth of 1-3/4 percent for the second quarter. With nominal

GDP in the staff forecast decelerating to a 5-1/2 percent pace, growth

in M2 velocity would slow to a 3-1/2 percent annual rate in the second

quarter. Slower velocity growth partly results from the positive ef-

fects on M2 of the turnaround of the temporary factors related to sea-

sonal adjustment and prepayments of mortgage-backed securities. Their

impact, which represents a diminishing drag on M2 growth in March as a

whole, acts as a stimulant to growth in the subsequent months, reflect-

ing a reversal of the effects of seasonal distortions and a resurgence

in prepayments.4 On balance, these factors raise money growth per-

ceptibly over the February-to-June period. Much of the pickup in M2

comes from its M1 component, which would expand at a 10 percent annual

4. Still another factor, related to depressed individual refunds
and elevated individual nonwithheld tax payments, is expected to re-
strain M2 growth in March and May and boost it in April and June, but
to have a negligible effect over the February-to-June period as a
whole.

rate from February to June.5 Outflows to bond funds from money

market mutual funds and nontransactions retail deposits are seen as

moderating over time if bond yields stabilize around current reduced

levels and as portfolio adjustments become more complete. The pickup in

M2 would still be limited by further downward adjustments of deposit

rates. By June, growth in M2 from its fourth-quarter base would be only

1/2 percent at an annual rate.

(13) Even though M3 is seen as expanding at a 1 percent rate

over the February-to-June period, it still would be well below its

fourth-quarter base in June. The resumption in M3 expansion would

partly reflect some anticipated pickup in bank credit. In the months

ahead, banks may become a little more willing to extend business

credit--including loans to smaller firms--and, given their more comfort-

able capital positions, to retain, rather than securitize and sell,

assets. Improved balance sheet structures also imply less need for

banks to rely on capital markets to raise funds, an important substitute

for M3 funding recently. Even though some businesses are expected to

acquire additional financing from banks, others are likely to continue

to rely on bond markets, in some cases paying down bank loans and short-

term paper. Overall business borrowing is expected to strengthen with

increases in capital spending and moderation in equity financing.

Household borrowing will be bolstered by improving housing activity--as

suggested by the stronger level of mortgage applications recently--and

further advances in outlays for consumer durables. Nonfederal debt is

expected to grow at about a 4 percent pace from February to June, up a

little from growth in recent months. Federal debt expansion, while

June and total reserves at 8 percent, the monetary base is projected

gyrating from month to month, will remain brisk over the second quarter

to finance large deficits.6 Total debt of domestic nonfinancial

sectors is projected to grow at a 5-1/2 percent annual rate from

February to June. Such growth would place this aggregate in June 5-1/4

percent at an annual rate above its fourth-quarter base and about 3/4

percentage point above the lower bound of its monitoring range.

(14) Under alternative A, M2 would strengthen to a 3 percent

rate over the February-to-June period. This speed-up in M2 growth,

coming mainly from its M1 component, would owe to smaller opportunity

costs, as deposit rate adjustments lag behind the decline in market

rates. Although M2 in June would still be below the lower bound of its

annual growth cone, it would be on a trajectory to reach the vicinity of

the lower bound by year-end, partly because spending would begin to

strengthen later in the year in response to the policy easing. M3 would

grow at a 1-1/4 percent pace over February to June under alternative A,

but would remain below its fourth-quarter base even by June. Under

alternative C, M2 would expand at a 2 percent rate over the February-to-

June period, as wider opportunity costs would discourage inflows to more

liquid deposits, especially M1 balances. M2 likely would not move above

the level of its fourth-quarter base until June, and with slower

spending growth later in the year, this aggregate probably would

increase only marginally over the year as a whole. M3 would expand at

only a 3/4 percent rate from February to June.

6. Absent Congressional action to raise the $4.145 trillion debt
ceiling, the staff forecasts that the Treasury could run out of cash
in early April. However, the staff anticipates that the Congress will
raise, at least temporarily, the debt ceiling before that time, in
accordance with the Treasury's recent request.

Directive language

(15) Presented below is draft wording for the operational

paragraph that includes the usual options and updating. Two versions

are shown for the sentence on the growth of M2 and M3. The first would

return to the specification of numerical growth rate expectations, as

was the Committee's practice prior to the February meeting; the other

would retain the approach at the February meeting of not stating ex-

plicit monetary growth expectations but rather relying on a qualitative

characterization.

OPERATIONAL PARAGRAPH

In the implementation of policy for the immediate

future, the Committee seeks to DECREASE SOMEWHAT/maintain/

INCREASE SOMEWHAT the existing degree of pressure on reserve

positions. In the context of the Committee's long-run

objectives for price stability and sustainable economic

growth, and giving careful consideration to economic,

financial, and monetary developments, slightly (SOMEWHAT)

greater reserve restraint (WOULD/MIGHT), or slightly

(SOMEWHAT) lesser reserve restraint would (MIGHT) be

acceptable in the intermeeting period. The contemplated

reserve conditions are expected to be consistent with GROWTH

OF [DEL: little change in] M2 and M3 AT ANNUAL RATES OF ABOUT

____ AND ____ PERCENT RESPECTIVELY over the period from

[DEL: January to March] FEBRUARY TO JUNE.

Alternative Monetary Growth Sentence

The contemplated reserve conditions are expected to

be consistent with a resumption of moderate growth in the

broader monetary aggregates over the second quarter.
