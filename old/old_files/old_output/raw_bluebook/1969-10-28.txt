MONEY MARKET AND RESERVE RELATIONSHIPS

Recent developments

(1) Shortly after the last Committee meeting, market

expectations turned sharply in favor of a general decline in interest

rates. As a consequence, professional and retail demands for securities

pushed long-term rates markedly lower. Yields on long-term U.S. Government

bonds declined by as much as 50 basis points over a two week period, while

corporate and State and local yields dropped around 26 basis points. In

recent days, however, the bond market rally has faded, and yields have

backed up somewhat. Private short-term market rates have moved lower,

by as much as three-eights of a percentage point, since the last meeting

of the Committee. In the case of commercial paper, this decline occurred

despite a marked increase in the issuance of bank-related commercial paper.

(2) Despite two Treasury tax-anticipation bill auctions

totaling $5 billion--one on October 8 and one on October 23--Treasury

bill rates generally showed little change on balance over the last three

weeks. The market was in a fairly strong technical position as a result

of earlier foreign official bill purchases, and was readily able to absorb

the new Treasury offerings. The foreign purchases were subsequently

reversed in part, as some speculators in German marks cashed in their

gains, but the bill market was partly sheltered from the impact as the

System purchased a substantial volume of these bills, and also made

some market purchases, for reserve supplying purposes. The 3-month

bill was most recently bid at around 7 per cent, near the lower end

of the range specified in the last blue book and about the same as its

level at the time of the last meeting.

(3) In the previous blue book, total member bank deposits

in October were projected to decline in a 5 - 8 per cent annual rate

range. At present, on the basis of two weeks of preliminary and one

week of partial data for the month, we estimate the decline to be in the

slightly deeper range of 7 - 9 per cent. Euro-dollars and other non-

deposit sources of funds appear to be offsetting about 1-1/2 percentage

points of the decline in member bank deposits. A week ago, staff

estimates of the proxy had suggested an even weaker performance for

October. As a result the proviso clause of the directive was marginally

in effect in the statement week ending October 22.

(4) The performance of deposit components thus far this

month, and also currency, has differed from earlier expectations, though

most of the deposit variation has been mutually offsetting. U. S.

Government deposits are declining considerably more than previously

expected, but private demand deposits are stronger by about an equivalent

amount and now appear likely to rise somewhat on average during the

month, in contrast to a slight decline projected earlier. Reflecting

the somewhat stronger private demand deposit performance, as well as

greater growth of currency the money supply for October is now



-3-

estimated to increase in a 1 - 4 per cent annual rate range. Total

title and savings deposits have been running slightly weaker than anticipated,

with the October average rate of decline now estimated in a 2 - 5 per

cent annual rate range. All of the weakness relative to projections

was in time deposits other than large CD's.

(5) Net borrowed reserves at member banks during the past

three statement weeks have fluctuated in a fairly wide $875 million to

$1.2 billion range, and average borrowings in the $950 million to

$1.4 billion range. The Federal funds rate also showed considerable

fluctuation with the weekly average effective rate varying between 8-3/4

and 9-5/8 per cent. Money market conditions were influenced not only

by the marginal implementation of the proviso clause, but also by the

wide variations in the day-to-day needs for funds among major banks--

arising in part, of course, from the Treasury's financing operations.

For example, the basic reserve deficit of the major banks in New York

(borrowings from the Federal Reserve and net Federal funds purchases

less excess reserves) fluctuated between $650 million and $1.8 billion,

while the deficit of the 38 major banks outside New York varied from

about $2.7 billion to about $4 billion.

in major deposit and reserve aggregates during recent periods.

Prospective developments

(7) For the second paragraph of the current economic policy

directive, the Committee might wish to consider language along the following

lines (alternative A):

'To implement this policy, System open market operations until

the next meeting of the Committee shall be conducted with a view to main-

taining the prevailing firm conditions in money and short-term credit



-5-

markets; provided, however, that operations shall be modified if bank

credit appears to be deviating significantly from current projections.

This language is the same as that of the directive issued on October

7, 1969.

(8) Prevailing firm conditions in the money and short-term

credit markets might be taken to encompass ranges for the Federal funds

rate of about 8-1/2--9-1/2 per cent, for member bank borrowings of

$1--1-1/2 billion, and for net borrowed reserves of $900 million

to $1.2 billion--in each case, the approximate ranges prevailing since

the last meeting of the Committee. It should be noted that money market

conditions in the last statement week were toward the easier end of the

ranges, with the proviso marginally in effect.

(9) Given the conditions specified in paragraph (8), the

3-month bill rate seems likely to fluctuate in a 6-3/4--7-1/4 per cent

range. Market distribution of the most recent bill financing and

probable further foreign bill sales will be putting upward pressure

on the bill rate, but System reserve supplying operations--estimated

at around $800 million over the next four weeks--and the current strong

technical condition of the short bill market will work toward offsetting

these upward rate pressures.

(10) The recent $3 billion tax bill financing will be paid for

on October 29, thus giving a sizable boost to the average level of

U.S. Government deposits in November and to total member bank deposits.

The latter are expected to grow on average at an annual rate in a 5 - 8

per cent range in November, supported by a 4 - 7 per cent annual rate



-6-

of growth in nonborrowed and total reserves. Combining the member

bank deposit growth expected in November with the 7 - 9 per cent rate

of decline now estimated for October would result in little net change

on average for member bank deposits over the two month period. Out-

standing total member bank deposits also are expected to show little

net change on average in December, as the anticipated November bulge of

Government deposits fades.

(11) Continued sizable inventory accumulation by business,

in conjunction with diminishing profits and reduced liquid asset

positions, may lead to takedowns of loan commitments at banks sufficient

to keep outstanding business loans growing in November at a somewhat

faster pace than in the third quarter. Given the pick-up of business

loan demands, and with individual banksviewing the increase in U.S.

Government deposits as temporary, outstanding funds obtained from

non-deposit sources may increase over the next month; any such increase

would be accounted for mainly by further growth of commercial paper

issued by bank affiliates. The expected increase of all nondeposit

sources, including Euro-dollars, would be the equivalent of adding about

1 - 2 percentage points at an annual rate to total member bank deposits.

Thus, the bank credit proxy adjusted to include Euro-dollars and other

non-deposit sources is projected to rise on average in November in 6 - 10

per cent annual rate range.



-7-

(12) Time and savings deposits at banks are likely to decline

in a 4 - 7 per cent annual rate range in November, largely because of

continued weakness in the trend of consumer-type time deposits and in

large CD's issued to domestic business and individuals. Since mid-

September time deposits of foreign official accounts at U.S. banks

have risen about $675 million. Most of this represents a one-time

switching of BIS funds to U.S. banks. Head offices of U.S. banks can

now offer slightly higher yields on foreign official time deposits than

their branches offer on Euro-dollars, reflecting the somewhat lower

reserve requirement on head office time deposits as compared with marginal

deposits (above the base) obtained through foreign branches. As a result,

there may be some continued increase in foreign official time deposits

at head offices.

(13) The money supply is expected to show little net change,

on average, in November, Part of the October rise in the average may

have reflected greatly enlarged activity in financial markets, particularly

stock markets, during the last two weeks. The November projection

assumes a more normal level of activity.

(14) As noted in paragraph (1), sharp declines in bond yields

during the past few weeks strongly reflected market expectations. With

constraints on supplies of funds at most major types of financial

institutions expected to persist, it seems likely that interest rates
there is

will move upward again unless /strong additional evidence as to a weakening

of the economy, peace in Viet-Nam, or a shift in monetary policy.



-8-

Indeed, in the last few days, long-term rates have risen, particularly

in the minicipal bond market.

Policy alternative

(15) If the Committee should decide to move toward somewhat

less firm money market conditions, it might wish to consider directive

language along the following lines (alternative B):

"To implement this policy, System open market operations

until the next meeting of the Committee shall be conducted with a view

to achieving slightly less firm conditions in money and short-term credit

markets; provided, however, that operations shall be modified if bank

credit appears to be deviating significantly from current projections.

(16) The slightly less firm money market conditions to

be sought might involve a Federal funds rate averaging around 8-1/4 to

8-1/2 per cent, member bank borrowings around $1 billion or a little

less, and net borrowed reserves fluctuating around $800 million. Such

a move, as it becomes evident to the market, could tend to moderate or

even reverse the developing tendency of recent days for some interest

rates to rise. The 3-month bill rate would probably move down in a 6-1/2 --

7 per cent range. But the impact of so small a change in money market

conditions on monetary aggregates would likely be minor over the near-

term, unless resulting market exuberance should carry interest rates

sharply down, and the bill rate were permitted to fall well below

the range specified. Assuming the bill rate remains within the range,

however, we would not expect the November aggregatesto be more than a



-9-

percentage point or two stronger than projected under alternative A of

the directive.

(17) Even a slight easing of money market conditions would

probably lead over time to expectations of further easing and encourage

banks to add more to loans and investments than otherwise, financing

them at very short-term in the Federal funds, Euro-dollar, and commercial

paper markets. In these circumstances, as the Federal Reserve provided

the reserves to keep the Federal funds rate down, demand deposits would

also tend to become somewhat stronger than otherwise. Thus, relative

to the alternative A projections, bank credit and deposit expansion,

might show a more noticeable strengthening in December than in November.

Explanation of Projections in Table 6

1. Changes in Federal Reserve credit indicate reserves needed to offset projected changes in
required reserves and factors affecting the supply of reserves.

2. Projected changes in currency outside banks reflect seasonal movements plus an allowance for
growth of about $50 million per week.

3. Projected effects of Treasury operations, included in "technical factors," reflect scheduled
and assumed calls in current two weeks and maintenance of Treasury balances with Federal Reserve
at $1.0 billion, thereafter.

4. Projected changes in required reserves assume the existing net reserve position of banks and
the structure of interest rates in the market, as well as the current economic outlook. On
the basis of these assumptions, projections reflect expected movements in bank credit and
money in the period ahead, including the effects of such elements as the public's loan demand,
repayments of previous loans, banks' investment preferences and willingness to supply loans,
banks' desires and abilities to obtain time and savings deposits, and the Government's financing
needs. The projections thus encompass normal seasonal developments, temporary bursts of
loans demand and expected associated repayments not currently reflected by the seasonals, and
whatever cyclical and growth demands for money and credit are expected in the projection period.

Assumed Treasury financing operations include: $3.0 billion, October 29; $1.5 billion, December 3;
and $100 million addition to weekly auctions beginning November 6 over the remainder of the year.
