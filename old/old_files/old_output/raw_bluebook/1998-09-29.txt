Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System.  This electronic document was 
created through a comprehensive digitization process which included identifying the best-
preserved paper copies, scanning those copies,1 and then making the scanned versions 
text-searchable.2  Though a stringent quality assurance process was employed, some 
imperfections may remain.

MONETARY POLICY ALTERNATIVES

Recent Developments

(1) Financial markets were extremely volatile around the world over the intermeeting

period, and signs of distress mounted. In general, investors grew more pessimistic about asset

values globally and also demonstrated a reduced tolerance for assuming risk. The sell-off of

risky assets and increase in volatility was sharpest in the early part of the period, but price

movements were quite choppy throughout the interval. In many cases, prices leveled out for a

time or even rebounded some, partly in response to the growing sense that the Federal Reserve

would be easing policy. In recent days, declines have resumed in some markets following

revelations of the magnitude of positions and extent of losses of a major hedge fund, Long-Term

Capital Management. The steady drumbeat of disappointing news out of Japan and Russia,

concerns that financial strains in Latin America might intensify, and worries about the portfolios

of some large financial institutions apparently reinforced the already evident tendency for

investors to mark down their outlook for profits in the United States and to tilt their portfolios

toward safe and liquid assets. Major U.S. equity price indexes dropped 3-1/2 to 6-1/2 percent

over the intermeeting period and are off 12 to 14 percent from their July peaks (chart).' Share

prices for money center banks and investment houses were especially hard hit amid news about

1 Trading volumes on major U.S. stock exchanges were extremely heavy but apparently
posed few significant problems for clearing and settlement systems. Although intraday equity
price movements were sizable-in index-point terms larger than those that tripped major circuit
breakers in October 1997--they were not large enough in recent weeks to trigger any circuit
breakers that would halt trading. Since earlier this year, such circuit breakers have been based on
percent changes in market values rather than index points.

the extent of their trading losses and speculation about the magnitude of their exposure to

emerging markets and distressed counterparties. Prices of Treasury securities were buoyed by

the strong safe-haven demands as well as by market sentiment that financial difficulties abroad

would tend to slow U.S. economic growth and prompt easing moves by the Federal Reserve. On

balance, longer-term Treasury yields fell 40 to 95 basis points over the intermeeting period,

bringing their net declines from their recent peaks in late July to 65 to 110 basis points. 2 The

demand for on-the-run Treasuries, the most liquid of all investments, was especially intense and

their spreads to comparable off-the-run issues widened. The entire Treasury yield curve now lies

below the intended federal funds rate for the first time since 1989. Judging from this

configuration, as well as from yields on federal funds and Eurodollar futures contracts, market

participants now seem certain of at least a 25 basis point rate cut by the Federal Reserve at this

meeting and place high odds on a full percentage point of cumulative easing by the middle of

next year.

(2) Signs of investors' increased uncertainty about the prospects for the U.S. economy

and greater reluctance to bear risk were abundant. Implied volatility derived from options--

including those on the S&P 500, Eurodollar futures, and Treasury bond futures--has remained

elevated since the end of August. Spreads on swaps and mortgage securities fluctuated over a

wide range and increased considerably on balance. Corporate bond markets also appeared

2 In view of the volatility in financial markets, daily Desk operations were sensitive to
ensuring an adequate degree of liquidity in the market. The average federal funds rate over the
intermeeting period was close to its intended level. Anecdotal information suggests that intraday
demand for reserves in the turbulent market atmosphere was somewhat elevated, although much
of the actual increase in excess reserves reflected wire transfer problems in a single period.



-3-

unsettled at times. Declines in yields on investment-grade bonds over the intermeeting period,

while appreciable, did not match the fall in yields on comparable-maturity Treasuries, and

investment-grade issuers pulled back offerings as they waited for more favorable market

conditions. In contrast, yields on junk bonds moved up sharply over the intermeeting period.

Junk bond mutual funds have experienced heavy outflows on balance, and new issuance of

below-investment-grade securities has essentially dried up. In this setting, firms have been

relying heavily on shorter-term sources of financing, including bank loans and commercial paper.

However, banks appear to have become more wary of late, too. Market contacts report that

interest rates have risen in the syndicated loan market, particularly for lower-rated and leveraged

deals, and volume has dropped off. Also, a special Survey of Senior Loan Officers indicates that

a significant number of banks have tightened terms and standards for loans to larger businesses in

the last month.

(3) The announcement by the Russian government on August 17 of a unilateral

suspension of payments on ruble-denominated debt, as well as an effective devaluation of the

ruble, initiated a protracted period of heightened turmoil in foreign financial markets. Early in

the period, stripped Brady spreads for Latin American countries rose 700 to 1300 basis points,

and yields on Asian sovereign dollar-denominated bonds rose 180 to 660 basis points. For all

countries except Malaysia, more than half of these increases were reversed later in the period.

Brazilian financial markets came under especially heavy pressure as participants focused on that

country's large current account deficit and lack of progress in addressing underlying fiscal

problems. Speculative pressures abated somewhat, though, after Brazilian authorities boosted

domestic interest rates sharply and indicated that they were prepared to implement significant



-4-

policy changes and approach the IMF for a program after the presidential election. The Mexican

peso, pressured by declines in oil prices early in the period as well as by the more general

concerns about emerging markets, depreciated 10 percent against the dollar over the period in

spite of a 13 percentage point increase in one-month domestic interest rates. In East Asia,

domestic interest rates generally fell, while dollar exchange rates were about unchanged to

slightly higher. In some cases, concerns about speculative activity induced unorthodox policies.

In late August, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority purchased a substantial amount of equities on

the Hong Kong stock market, apparently because they were concerned that short-sales of equities

were contributing to pressure against the Hong Kong dollar. In early September, Malaysia

imposed comprehensive exchange controls and pegged the ringgit to the dollar. Investor

concerns about the potential for outright defaults, as in Russia, or the imposition of strict capital

controls, as in Malaysia, probably contributed to a sell-off of Latin American assets.

(4) In most foreign industrial countries, interest rates on government debt declined

substantially over the intermeeting period, but not as much as in the United States. This

divergence in part reflected the particularly strong demands for the liquidity of U.S. Treasury

securities. In addition, the anticipated path for short-term interest rates in the United States was

lowered by more than in other industrial countries, in part because the United States was seen as

relatively more vulnerable to growing problems in Latin America and thus as more likely to ease

monetary policy. These revisions to monetary policy expectations, combined with some renewed

concerns about the burgeoning U.S. current account deficit, contributed to a significant

depreciation of the dollar against the currencies of industrial nations over the intermeeting

period. The trade-weighted foreign exchange value of the dollar dropped 4-3/4 percent against



-5-

major currencies. The decline of the dollar against the yen seemed especially puzzling at times,

but it may have reflected both some tendency for investors to seek the greater perceived safety of

assets in home markets and the influence of the zero bound on nominal interest rates in

constraining further declines in nominal and real rates in Japan. With incoming data suggesting

further deterioration in the Japanese economy, the Bank of Japan announced that it would guide

the overnight call rate down to around 1/4 percent from the previous target "somewhat below"

the official discount rate of 1/2 percent. This move, which surprised investors, contributed to a

36 basis point decline in Japanese bond yields over the intermeeting period to a level of 85 basis

points. The lack of progress on legislation to reform the banking system contributed to the

negative outlook for Japan.

. The Desk did not intervene during the period for the

accounts of the System or the Treasury.

(5) The broad money aggregates expanded rapidly over the intermeeting period,

propelled largely by unexpectedly strong growth in retail and institution-only money market

mutual funds. As in some past episodes of market turbulence, money funds appear to have been

favored by investors looking to wait out the current bout of market volatility by parking balances

in relatively safe, liquid assets. In addition, many investors no doubt have found the yields on

money funds attractive given the current very flat yield curve and the decline in Treasury bill

rates. M2 and M3 are now estimated to have grown at 14-1/2 and 15-3/4 percent rates

respectively in September, placing both aggregates still further above the upper bounds of their

annual ranges. While market turbulence has certainly disrupted the composition of credit flows



-6-

of late, reasonably complete data through August show no signs of any slowing in the growth of

total domestic nonfinancial debt. Bank credit growth was quite rapid in August, with strength

evident in both securities and loans; lending continued to expand robustly in September,

especially to businesses. Based on preliminary and partial data, the staff estimates that overall

business borrowing actually picked up in September despite the tumult in financial markets and a

somewhat more restrictive lending stance by banks.

Policy Alternatives

(6) As a consequence of the financial market developments over the intermeeting

period, the staff now expects weaker foreign economies, a lower path for the U.S. stock market,

and more restrictive credit market conditions over the next few years than forecast at the time of

the August FOMC meeting. Absent offsetting policy actions, these depressing influences on

aggregate demand would result in very slow growth in U.S. output over the next few years and

further disinflation from the already-modest pace of price increases. Thus, in the Greenbook the

staff has assumed that the FOMC will initiate a series of easing moves that cumulate to 3/4

percentage point over the next six months. Still, output growth slows in the forecast to about

1-1/4 percent in 1999, and the unemployment rate rises to 5-1/4 percent by the end of that year.

Both total and core CPI inflation are projected to be about 2 percent in 1999 and 2000, held down

to an important extent by restrained inflation expectations as well as by technical changes in the

indexes that take effect in 1999. Thus, even with the easing, the staff outlook for economic

growth is noticeably weaker than the central tendency of the FOMC members' forecasts for 1999

reported in July, while that for CPI inflation next year is toward the lower end of the central

tendency range.3

(7) To begin addressing the weaker outlook for the U.S. economy, the Committee

may wish to reduce the funds rate 25 basis points at this meeting, as in alternative A. Now that

the stock market has fallen and credit terms have tightened, the real federal funds rate probably

can be reduced from its unusually high level without adding to inflation pressures. Indeed, with

3 As of the July Humphrey Hawkins report, the central tendencies of the governors' and
presidents' projections for 1999 were 2 to 2-1/2 percent for real GDP growth, 2 to 2-1/2 percent
for CPI inflation, and 4-1/2 to 4-3/4 percent for the unemployment rate in the fourth quarter of
1999.



-9-

inflation expectations possibly falling further in recent months--as suggested by a much larger

decline in the spread of nominal over indexed Treasury yields than can be accounted for by the

relative liquidity of these instruments-the real federal funds rate may even have edged higher.

Even if the Committee's outlook for spending is stronger than that of the staff, if it has been

revised down substantially, a policy ease might still be called for. Moreover, financial markets

are fragile and, in the absence of signs of economic recovery and progress on key policy reforms

in Japan and other countries, the possibilities for disappointing outcomes abroad precipitating

further contagion and restraint on spending in the United States may be seen as unacceptably

high. A 25 basis point cut in the funds rate at this point could be viewed as providing a modicum

of insurance against the risk of such very adverse outcomes. In addition to boosting domestic

demand, a lower federal funds rate could be of some limited help in relieving pressures on

emerging market countries, especially those tied to the dollar or finding themselves in need of

defending the exchange value of their currencies through tight monetary policies. Indeed, in

recent days as an easing by the Federal Reserve has come to be seen as more likely, emerging

market countries have witnessed some narrowing in spreads on their dollar-denominated debt

and some improvement in their stock markets. If foreign outcomes proved not so disappointing

or the domestic economy surprisingly resilient, the policy move could be reversed before long

without raising questions about the Federal Reserve's anti-inflation resolve. Even if the

Committee suspected that more easing might eventually be needed, it might want to move by

only 25 basis points at this time because of the residual inflation risks inherent in the unusually

low unemployment rate along with the strength to date in the economic expansion.

(8) Treasury bill rates might edge higher with a 25 basis point cut in the funds rate

because markets seem to have built in some odds that the move at this meeting might be even



-10-

larger. Despite some disappointment in the size of the move, intermediate- and longer-term rates

might not increase much, if at all, since the presumption would be that the Federal Reserve likely

would follow this rate cut with another before long. Indeed, private securities markets could

rally a bit and risk spreads narrow with confirmation of the FOMC's willingness to act.

Nonetheless, should third-quarter earnings announcements, mostly to be released in October, line

up with the staff forecast, equity prices would likely resume their downward adjustment. The 25

basis point move should have little effect on the foreign exchange value of the dollar.

(9) If the Committee believed that, as in the staff forecast, a larger policy move were

needed to have an adequate effect in forestalling oncoming weakness in economic activity or if it

wanted to take more forceful action to address the risks facing financial markets here and abroad,

it might choose to reduce the funds rate 50 basis points at this meeting (alternative A').

Depending on the wording of the announcement associated with such a move, the market might

see the FOMC as being on hold for a longer duration, eliminating for a little while market

uncertainty about whether additional easings were in the offing. Moves of 50 basis points have

been somewhat unusual in recent years, and, in volatile financial markets with largely

unanchored expectations, reactions are difficult to gauge. Most likely, equity markets would

rally and risk premiums on private debt would fall, as the FOMC was seen as taking a more

active stance in cushioning the effects of tighter financing conditions and weaker foreign demand

on economic activity. But there is some chance that market participants could interpret the larger

move as indicating that the Federal Reserve viewed the current economic situation as especially

serious, perhaps owing to fragility in the financial sector. If so, the rebound in equities could be

tempered while Treasury bond prices could be strengthened further. In any event, the value of



-11-

the dollar against major currencies would likely drop somewhat under this alternative.4 The

prime rate would likely be reduced by 1/2 percentage point.

(10) Although the staff projection embodies a substantial weakening in aggregate

demand, data to date suggest that the economy is growing near its potential rate. With labor

markets still quite tight and forecasts in recent years often underpredicting economic activity, the

Committee may wish to have more evidence in hand that growth of aggregate demand is slowing

considerably before easing policy. If so, the Committee would find the unchanged stance of

policy under alternative B appropriate. The recent tightening of credit supply conditions and

drop in equity prices toward a more realistic alignment with earnings prospects may be viewed as

necessary and overdue corrections that will help to prevent speculative and inflationary

imbalances from developing. An easing at this time might risk inhibiting those adjustments and

be viewed as an attempt to support overly optimistic investor and lender behavior. Indeed, if

corporate bond and equity prices rallied substantially, such a move could potentially court

another sharp correction at a later date.

(11) With markets betting heavily on an easing at this FOMC meeting, holding rates

unchanged as in alternative B would leave investors confused about Federal Reserve intentions

and likely engender added volatility. Short-term Treasury and private rates would back up

sharply, and longer-term rates also would rise, though perhaps not by much if, as seems likely,

market participants believed that the easing had merely been postponed. Increases in Treasury

yields might be less than in private rates, if adverse reactions in financial markets strengthened

4 The reactions in financial and foreign exchange markets might be even larger if the
discount rate were also reduced by 50 basis points, as such joint action might be seen as
suggesting that the Federal Reserve is convinced that interest rates will remain low for a
considerable period of time.



-12-

flight-to-safety motives. A part of the recent improvement in foreign financial markets, which

has been built on growing expectations of an easing in U.S. monetary policy, could be reversed,

particularly in some especially vulnerable countries. The foreign exchange value of the dollar

would likely rise, although this effect could be mitigated somewhat if the adverse effects on Latin

American markets were particularly severe.

(12) With some slowing in growth of nominal spending, expansion in the debt of

nonfinancial sectors is expected to moderate over the months ahead. Business borrowing is

likely to be restrained somewhat by less accommodative markets for securities and some further

tightening in standards and terms on bank loans beyond that indicated in the most recent loan

officer survey. While credit availability to households is expected to be affected less, household

borrowing should slow along with the projected deceleration of spending on housing and

durables. The staff forecast projects continued paydowns of federal debt. Overall nonfinancial

debt is expected to grow 5-3/4 percent this year, in the upper half of its 3-to-7 percent range, and

at about a 4-1/2 percent rate over the September-to-March period, down from the 6 percent pace

of the last few months but continuing to outpace nominal GDP.

(13) In the staff forecast, M2 growth would be supported by declines in opportunity

costs associated with the policy easings. 5 Within the aggregate, growth should be strong in liquid

deposits, whose rates adjust relatively sluggishly to declines in market rates, while small time

deposits should run off, as offering rates on these deposits tend to adjust faster. Currency

demand should remain strong, supported by ongoing turbulence abroad. Money market mutual

funds should be buoyed by the declines in market rates and continue to benefit somewhat from

5 The Greenbook projection could be considered to be consistent with a 25 basis point
easing at this meeting and a similar move toward the end of 1998. Those assumptions are used
for the projections of money growth under alternative A.



-13-

the reduced attractiveness of stock mutual funds, but to a lesser degree than over the past couple

months; the projected declines in stock prices are not as steep as those that already have

occurred, and some of the money fund inflows at the onset of the bear market were likely only

parked temporarily while in transit to alternative longer-term investments. On balance, M2 is

projected to grow at a 6-1/2 percent rate over the next six months, implying further substantial

declines in velocity. With economic growth softening and bank lending moderating, M3 is

projected to decelerate to a 7-1/2 percent pace over September to March. The broad monetary

aggregates will almost surely far exceed their growth ranges in 1998; M2 is projected to grow 8

percent this year and M3 to grow 10 percent.6 However, a good part of the recent and projected

strength in the aggregates apparently reflects shifts in money demand rather than strong spending

growth; M2 has been boosted by heightened demands for liquidity and shifts away from stock

market investments, while the elevated growth of M3 has in part reflected a substitution of bank

funding sources for market financing by lower-rated business firms.

6 The ranges for 1998 and the preliminary ranges for 1999 are 1 to 5 percent for M2 and
2 to 6 percent for M3.

Directive Language

(14) Presented below are three different wording choices for the operational paragraph.

All include the usual policy alternatives for Committee consideration. The first incorporates the

traditional wording of the directive, and the other two, Options 1 and 2, are taken from the

September 24, 1998, memo to the Committee. The Committee may, of course, decide to use

some other variant after its discussion of proposed wording changes at the meeting on Tuesday.

OPERATIONAL PARAGRAPH

Traditional Wording

In the implementation of policy for the immediate future, the Committee seeks

conditions in reserve markets consistent with maintaining/INCREASING/DECREASING the

federal funds rate at/to an average of around ____ [DEL: 5-1/2] percent. In the context of the Committee's

long-run objectives for price stability and sustainable economic growth, and giving careful

consideration to economic, financial, and monetary developments, a slightly/SOMEWHAT

higher federal funds rate WOULD/MIGHT or a slightly/SOMEWHAT lower federal funds rate

would/MIGHT be acceptable in the intermeeting period. The contemplated reserve conditions

are expected to be consistent with some moderation in the growth in M2 and M3 over coming

months.

Option 1

In the immediate future, to promote the Committee's long-run objectives of price

stability and sustainable economic growth, the Committee seeks conditions in reserve markets

consistent with maintaining/raising/lowering the federal funds rate at/to an average of around

___ percent.



-15-

1. [No tilt] Changes in economic, financial, and moetary conditions could

call for a slight increase or decrease in the federal funds rate during the intermeeting

period. [or]

2. [Tilt] In view of the currently available evidence, the Committee believes

that developments are more likely to warrant a decrease/increase than an increase/decrease in the

federal funds rate in coming months. Any potential changes in the federal funds rate objective

during the intermeeting period should be considered in that context.

The contemplated reserve conditions are expected to be consistent with some

moderation in the growth in M2 and M3 over coming months.

Option 2

In the implementation of policy for the immediate future, the Committee seeks

conditions in reserve markets consistent with maintaining/increasing/decreasing the federal funds

rate at/to an average of around percent. In the context of the Committee's long-run

objectives for price stability and sustainable economic growth, and giving careful consideration

to economic, financial, and monetary developments,

1. [Tilt] the Committee is more likely to find acceptable a slightly lower/higher

federal funds rate than a slightly higher/lower funds rate in the intermeeting period. [or]

2. [No tilt] the Committee is equally likely to find acceptable a slightly lower or

a slightly higher federal funds rate in the intermeeting period.

The contemplated reserve conditions are expected to be consistent with some

moderation in the growth in M2 and M3 over coming months.
