MONETARY POLICY ALTERNATIVES

Recent Developments

(1) In accordance with the Committee's decision at its May 17

meeting, the allowance for adjustment plus seasonal borrowing was raised

from $400 million to $500 million about a week following the meeting.

Actual borrowing averaged $530 million in the first two maintenance

periods. In the current maintenance period, with the federal funds rate

running a little above expectations even as long-term debt and equity

markets were rallying, the borrowing assumption was raised $50 million,

rather than allowing the provision of reserves under the previous speci-

fication to push the federal funds rate lower. This action was taken

against the backdrop of a directive indicating greater readiness to

tighten than to ease and of economic indicators that suggested a continu-

ing risk of inflation pressures. Over the first eight days of the current

maintenance period, adjustment plus seasonal borrowing has averaged around

$490 million. Seasonal borrowing has increased a little more than usual

in recent months, and is currently running around $320 million; overall,

the relationship between the sum of seasonal and adjustment borrowing and

the federal funds rate does not appear to have changed appreciably from

earlier this year.

(2) Responding to the further increases in reserve pressures, the

federal funds rate moved up from around 7 percent at the time of the May

FOMC meeting to the 7-1/2 percent area most recently. Other money market

interest rates increased by around 1/4 to 3/8 of a percentage point over



the intermeeting period. Despite the rise in short-term rates, substan-

tial increases in commodity prices, and evidence of stronger economies and

tighter monetary policies in some key foreign industrial countries, bond

yields fell about 1/4 of a percentage point over the intermeeting period,

and stock prices rose, with broad stock price indexes up from 4 to 8

percent. Apparently, demands for longer-term instruments were buoyed by

improved prospects for the dollar and by signs of some moderation in the

economic expansion towards a more sustainable pace, together with percep-

tions that U.S. monetary policy was being tightened in a timely manner.

(3) The dollar rose about 5-1/4 percent on a weighted average basis

over the intermeeting period, with 3-1/4 percent of that occurring in the

last few days. It moved higher in response to the better-than-expected

U.S. trade figures both for March, released on the day of the last FOMC

meeting, and for April, released in mid-June. These data apparently led

market participants to revise their expectations about the pace of U.S.

external adjustment. Indications of a tighter Federal Reserve stance also

contributed to the dollar's firmness over the period, helping to offset

the effects of monetary tightening in a number of foreign countries,

including Germany, Canada, and the United Kingdom. The firming trend has

gathered momentum in recent days, as convictions about a brighter outlook

for the dollar seem to have become more firmly entrenched.

associated with changes in reserve requirements.



(4) Expansion of the monetary aggregates slowed substantially in

May, mainly reflecting the runoff of tax-related balances. Based on

partial data through June 20, growth of the aggregates appears to have

rebounded in June. Still, expansion of M2 at 6 percent in June is slower

than earlier in the year, as demands are evidently being restrained

somewhat by the rise in opportunity costs that has resulted from the

increase in short-term market interest rates. M2 is estimated to have

increased at a 7 percent rate over the March-to-June period, in line with

the Committee's specification of 6 to 7 percent for the broader aggre-

gates. Growth of M3 over the March-to-June period is estimated at 6

percent. The moderate growth of this aggregate in the face of fairly

rapid expansion of bank credit reflected heavier reliance on nondeposit

sources--especially borrowings from foreign branches--to fund credit

growth.

(5) M1 was about unchanged in May following its April bulge, but its

growth appears to have snapped back to around a 7 percent rate in June.

OCDs, along with other liquid deposits, have remained surprisingly strong

given a steeper deposit yield curve, perhaps reflecting uncertainty about

the future course of interest rates; in addition, demand deposits have

rebounded following a decline in May. In June, Ml is estimated to be 5

percent at an annual rate above its fourth-quarter level. Growth in

required reserves has generally tracked expansion of Ml. Expansion in

total reserves from March to June at about a 4-1/4 percent annual rate was

held down to an extent by declining excess reserves. The monetary base



-5-

increased at a 7-1/2 percent rate over that period, about a percentage

point slower than over the first three months of the year, as both cur-

rency and reserves grew less rapidly.

(6) M2 and M3 are estimated to have expanded at 7-1/4 and 7 percent

annual rates, respectively, from their fourth-quarter bases through June,

leaving these aggregates in the upper halves of their annual ranges.

Expansion of M2 has been supported this year by fairly strong growth of

income. The pickup in this aggregate relative to its growth over 1987

stems in part from the turnaround in market interest rates and opportunity

costs from October through February. In addition, special factors may

have accounted for some of the relatively rapid M2 growth, at least judg-

ing by the overshoot of money growth relative to the money demand models.

M2 holders apparently found equity investments less attractive in the

aftermath of the stock market collapse--as evidenced by very weak sales of

mutual funds--and also lower incentives to shift savings to IRAs before

the April tax date depressed flows into these accounts. With respect to

M3, while credit at banks and thrifts expanded over the first half of

1988 at about the same pace as last year, it was financed to a greater

extent by liabilities included in the aggregates. In particular, inflows

to banks from their foreign branches dropped off sharply compared with

1987.

(7) Overall, domestic nonfinancial sector debt expanded at an 8-1/2

percent annual rate from the fourth quarter through May, leaving this

measure just below the middle of its annual range. In recent months,

business credit demands appear to have picked up appreciably, reflecting

continuing strong equity retirements, as well as a large shortfall of



-6-

internal funds relative to capital spending. In addition to rapid busi-

ness loan expansion, which appears to have extended into June, corporate

bond issuance has strengthened since the drop in bond yields. Household

borrowing is estimated to have been maintained at about the first quarter

pace, a shade below that of 1987. Borrowing by the federal government was

light over most of the second quarter, but the Treasury has increased the

gross sizes of coupon issues in mid-June in order to begin funding a much

higher third quarter deficit.



Long-run Ranges

(8) For 1988, the aggregates are expected to grow well within their

existing ranges. Under the staff greenbook forecast, M2 and M3 would be

around the midpoint and in the upper portion of their 4 to 8 percent

ranges, respectively, and debt in the middle of its 7 to 11 percent range.

In that forecast, the growth of M2 is projected to slow substantially in

the second half of the year from its pace of 7-1/4 percent through June.

This moderation primarily results from the effects of higher interest

rates and opportunity costs on money demand. Opportunity costs have

already risen in recent months and this increase is expected to be aug-

mented under the staff forecast by a further upward movement in market

interest rates. As a consequence, velocity is expected to increase at

about a 1 percent annual rate over the second half of the year after

falling at almost that rate in the first half. (Actual and projected

velocities of the aggregates are illustrated in the charts on the follow-

ing pages.) With nominal GNP projected to expand at a 6-1/2 percent annual

rate in the second half of the year, M2 growth would be around 5 percent

over this period, bringing growth for the year down close to 6 percent.

Were this rate of expansion of the economy to be achieved without further

increases in rates, growth in M2 for the year would probably be only about

1/4 percentage point higher.

(9) With respect to M3 and debt, the staff is projecting about the

same growth in the second half of the year as in the first. For M3 this

implies expansion of 7-1/4 percent in 1988, in the upper half of its

range, and for debt 8-1/2 percent, just below the midpoint of its moni-

toring range. Although equity retirements are projected to slow in the

second half of the year, debt growth is still expected to exceed the pace

of GNP by 2 percentage points as a widening corporate financing gap boosts

credit market borrowing. The share of bank and thrift credit in this

total is not expected to change much in the second half of the year from

the first. Rising long-term interest rates will continue to encourage

borrowers to finance through short-term or floating-rate obligations--

including ARM mortgages and business loans--which typically are held by

depository institutions. Given the slowing of core deposits, banks and

thrifts will have to rely more on managed liabilities, including those in

M3. These expectations for M2 and M3 presume that the problems of in-

dividual distressed depository institutions do not spread in such a way as

to disrupt the overall availability and terms of credit at depository

institutions and their access to regular sources of funds.

(10) For 1989, the table below gives three possible alternatives for

tentative long-run ranges for growth in M2, M3, and nonfinancial debt from

the fourth quarter of 1988 to the fourth quarter of 1989. Alternative I

would carry over the specifications of the current ranges. Alternative II

would lower the ranges by 1/2 percentage point, while alternative III

would reduce the M2 range by another 1/2 percentage point, given that any

additional monetary restraint would have a greater impact on growth of

this aggregate than on the other two. All the suggested alternatives

would retain for 1989 the wider 4 point range adopted for 1988 at the

February meeting. The aggregates are not likely to be any less interest

sensitive next year or their demand properties known with any greater

confidence than they were thought to be last February. An unusual degree



of uncertainty about the economic outlook in February also was an impor-

tant element in the decision to widen the ranges; judgement as to whether

the prospects for 1989 were clearer, thus permitting narrower ranges,

might be easier to make next February.

Alternative 1989 Ranges

Alt. I Alt. II Alt. III

(Current Ranges)

M2 4 to 8 3-1/2 to 7-1/2 3 to 7
M3 4 to 8 3-1/2 to 7-1/2 3-1/2 to 7-1/2
Debt 7 to 11 6-1/2 to 10-1/2 6-1/2 to 10-1/2

(11) The monetary policy restraint embodied in the greenbook forecast

is likely to involve a significant slowing of money growth next year. In

this forecast, given the underlying strength in demands on the economy, a

rise in interest rates of more than a percentage point from the middle of

1988 to the middle of 1989 may be required to contain nominal income

growth to 6 percent next year. This combination of rising interest rates

and resulting moderate income growth is expected to be consistent with M2

growth of 4 percent, or perhaps even a little lower. The implied

increase in velocity would be 2 percent or so, as shown in the chart

following page 7.

(12) M3 growth also is projected to slow in 1989 under the staff

forecast, though, at 5-1/2 percent, to remain well above that of M2.

1. The staff's econometric models of money demand suggest that M2 growth
on the order of 3 to 4 percent would be consistent with the combination of
interest rates and income in the staff forecast.



-10-

Velocity of M3 would be about unchanged (see chart). The decline in M3

growth would accompany an overall slowing in the growth of nonfinancial

debt to a little over 8 percent. The moderation in debt growth is

prompted by slower expansion of demand by domestic borrowers, and a drop-

off in equity retirement as interest rates rise. Of the debt growth

projected, the proportion that is intermediated may decline a little,

producing a greater deceleration in M3 than in debt. With long-term

interest rates projected to level off next year, borrowers may find bonds

and fixed-rate mortgages more attractive. In addition, banks and thrifts

will continue under pressure from capital requirements, prompting further

efforts to repackage and sell assets. However, our projections of M3 do

not allow for a major shift of bank activities--such as government securi-

ties trading--and associated funding to nonbank subsidiaries of holding

companies as a result of court, Congressional, or Federal Reserve regula-

tory actions.

(13) Of the long-run ranges, alternative III would be most appro-

priate if the risks were seen to be on the side of demands outpacing

productive capacity, threatening progress toward price stability. This is

the assessment implicit in the staff GNP forecast, and the degree of

monetary restraint needed in that forecast to damp domestic demand and

check inflationary pressures would seem to require some reduction in the

lower bound of the M2 range. Even with the one-point decrease under this

alternative, M2 would be expected to be in the lower half of its range

given the staff forecast. M3 and debt would be in the middle of their

alternative III ranges. The upper bounds of the reduced ranges of this

alternative allow some scope for less restraint and lower interest rates



-11-

if the economy turns out to be weaker than anticipated, but relative to

the other ranges would provide for fairly prompt resistance to unexpected

strength in the economy. On balance, the alternative III ranges would

seem to imply an intention that nominal income decelerate in 1989, thus

underscoring a commitment of policy to work toward gradually slowing

inflation rates in 1989 and beyond.

(14) The larger reduction in the M2 range than in the M3 and debt

ranges under alternative III recognizes the greater interest sensitivity

of M2, and hence the need to have it decelerate more markedly should

substantial restraint be appropriate. A higher range for M3 than M2 also

is consistent with a tendency for more rapid growth of the broader ag-

gregate over time--a tendency that frequently has been reflected in higher

FOMC ranges for M3 than for M2. (A history of long-run ranges--and out-

comes as they appeared at the time the results were reported to Congress--

is given in first table following the directive.) Alternative II would

reduce the M2 range by only 1/2 percentage point, thereby retaining the

current equality of M2 and M3 ranges. Alternative II further reduces

the ranges toward those more consistent with price stability, and it

allows for restraint on demand should that be needed. But there is some

greater risk than under alternative III that, should demands on the

economy prove strong, the lower end of the M2 range would not be consis-

tent with the degree of restraint the Committee might want to consider.

(15) Alternative I would be more appropriate if the risks to the

economy and inflation were seen as more balanced than underlying the staff

forecast. This might involve a judgment that there was a good chance that

the policy tightening that has already occurred along with developing



-12-

cyclical forces, such as the unsustainable pace of inventory accumulation,

were already pointing to growth in income at an acceptable pace next year,

without further monetary restraint. In these circumstances, M2 would be

expected to grow more in line with nominal GNP as the damping effects of

recent rate increases subside. On balance, M2 growth of around 5-1/2

percent in 1989 might be associated with nominal GNP growth on the order

of that in the staff forecast with no further change in interest rates.

This alternative would allow for even faster M2 growth and an appreciable

pickup from 1988 should an easier policy be needed to support the economy.

Such an outcome might be associated, for example, with a tighter fiscal

policy than markets now anticipate, resulting from credible actions this

fall to meet Gramm-Rudman targets or a major new initiative on the budget

deficit early in 1989. This alternative might also be preferred if the

Committee saw a higher path for income as desirable. More rapid GNP

expansion might be needed to keep unemployment from rising from current

levels, and would be consistent with no uptick in underlying inflation

rates if current labor market conditions were seen as consistent with an

absence of feed-through into wages of price level adjustments associated

with imports or farm commodities.



-13-

Short-run Policy Alternatives

(16) The policy alternatives presented below include the current

degree of pressure on reserve positions along with somewhat greater and

slightly lesser restraint. Alternative B would continue to specify

adjustment plus seasonal borrowing at the discount window of $550 million.

Alternative C would specify a borrowing level of $750 million. Under

alternative A, borrowing is assumed to decline only $100 million, to $450

million, reversing the most recent increase and part of the tightening

early in the period. Federal funds are expected to trade in a range

around 7-1/2 percent or a little below under alternative B and would move

up toward the 8 percent area under alternative C and down to 7-1/4 percent

or a bit below under alternative A.

(17) The table below gives June-to-September growth of the monetary

2
aggregates anticipated under the three alternatives. Under all the

alternatives, M1 and M2 would slow somewhat from their pace over the first

half of the year as the recent rise in opportunity costs takes hold.

However, M2 and M3 would remain in the upper halves of their annual ranges

through September. (More detailed data are shown on the table and charts

on the following pages.)

2. Growth rates presented in the table are measured from a June base.
Estimates of the monetary aggregates for June are a little less certain than
is typical at the mid-year Committee meeting owing to the earlier time of
the meeting this year.

funds rate range 5 to 9 5 to 9 6 to 10

(18) Market rates appear to have incorporated the recent firming of

policy, which would be retained under alternative B, and most rates should

remain near current levels over the near term. However, the prime rate may

be raised in response to recent increases in funding costs. And, the Trea-

sury bill rate could move up toward 6-3/4 percent, a more typical alignment

with the funds rate, as the Treasury resumes net issuance of bills to cover

larger financing needs. Over time, yields on long-term bonds and mortgages

could retrace some of their recent declines should incoming data fail to

show any significant easing of price pressures. A back-up in yields would

be reinforced if the dollar came under some downward pressure, for example,

because incoming data suggested a less rapid pace of reduction in external

imbalances.

(19) Under alternative B, the widening of opportunity costs over the

spring would continue to exert a restraining influence on M2 and M1 in the

months ahead. Growth in M2 would be expected to average 5-1/2 percent over

the June-to-September period. Growth of the more liquid components should

be most subdued, reflecting very sluggish adjustment of their offering

rates, while small time deposits, whose rates adjust rather promptly, would

strengthen a bit following their recent lull. In reflection of this

pattern, M1 would slow to only a 3-1/2 percent pace under this alternative.

(20) M3, under alternative B, is expected to pick up a little over June

to September from the pace of recent months as outflows from money funds

abate with the stable interest rates assumed under this alternative. Credit

demands on banks and thrifts and their issuance of managed liabilities

should remain strong. Corporate merger activity is projected to decline

appreciably, but business credit demands are expected to slow only a bit,

remaining focused on bank loans and short-term paper, as external financing

needs rise further. Household borrowing should remain moderate, but

Treasury financing will strengthen in the coming months along with the

deficit, leading to a pickup in federal debt growth. Total nonfinancial

debt is expected to expand at around an 8 percent annual rate over the June-

to-September period, about in line with that of the second quarter, placing

this aggregate 8-1/2 percent above its fourth-quarter 1987 base.

(21) The market does not appear to be anticipating an immediate further

monetary tightening as contemplated in alternative C. Thus, the half-point

increase in the funds rate under this alternative would prompt other private

short-term rates to move up by a similar amount. In view of still higher

funding costs, a boost in the prime rate of at least 1/2 percentage point

would seem much more likely. The Treasury bill rate would rise to 7 percent

or above. Such a firming in policy, at a time of market concern about

resource constraints and inflationary pressures, would tend to assuage some

inflation worries and any rise in bond rates could be quite small. Recent



-17-

firmness of the dollar could be sustained for a time unless foreign authori-

ties took this opportunity to tighten their policies substantially.

(22) The boost in opportunity costs under alternative C would reduce

monetary growth substantially below the pace of recent months. M2 would

slow to 4 percent over the June-to-September period, with inflows to its

liquid components being most affected. M1 would edge up at a 1-1/2 percent

annual rate as demand deposits declined and inflows to OCDs slowed to a

trickle. By September, M2 would be only a little above the midpoint of its

annual range and M1 would be 3-3/4 percent at an annual rate above its

fourth-quarter level. Credit demands on banks and thrifts would be damped

only a bit and these institutions would respond to smaller inflows to core

deposits by stepping up their issuance of managed liabilities. M3 should

grow at a 6-1/2 percent rate from June to September under this alternative

and drift down only slightly within its annual range.

(23) The reversal of part of the recent tightening, as envisioned under

alternative A, would result in some edging down of short-term rates, espe-

cially on private securities, perhaps heading off any increase in the prime

rate. The dollar probably would reverse some of its recent strength. The

extent and persistence of any downward movement in the dollar and the effect

of an easing in policy on bond yields would depend partly on whether such an

action raised questions about the Federal Reserve's policy intentions. M2

would slow relatively little under these conditions, leaving this aggregate

on a trajectory that would tend to keep it noticeably above the midpoint of

its annual range, while M3 would move up in its range.

Directive language

(24) Presented below for Committee consideration is draft directive

language relating to the ranges for 1988 and for 1989, and to the operating

paragraph for the intermeeting period.

The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary

and financial conditions that will foster price sta-

bility over time, promote growth in output on a sustain-

able basis, and contribute to an improved pattern of

international transactions. In furtherance of these

objectives, the Committee REAFFIRMED at its THIS meet-

ing THE RANGES IT HAD in February established IN

FEBRUARY FOR growth ranges of 4 to 8 percent for both M2

and M3, measured from the fourth quarter of 1987 to the

fourth quarter of 1988. [IN FURTHERANCE OF THESE

OBJECTIVES, THE COMMITTEE AT THIS MEETING RAISED/LOWERED

THE RANGES IT HAD ESTABLISHED IN FEBRUARY FOR GROWTH OF

M2 AND M3 TO RATES OF ____ PERCENT, MEASURED FROM THE

FOURTH QUARTER OF 1987 TO THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 1988.]

The monitoring range for growth in total domestic

nonfinancial debt was ALSO MAINTAINED set at 7 to 11

percent (CHANGED TO ____ TO _____ PERCENT) for the year.

FOR 1989, THE COMMITTEE AGREED ON TENTATIVE RANGES

FOR MONETARY GROWTH, MEASURED FROM THE FOURTH QUARTER OF

1988 TO THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 1989, OF ____ TO ____ PERCENT



-19-

FOR M2 AND ____ TO ____ PERCENT FOR M3. THE COMMITTEE PRO-

VISIONALLY SET THE ASSOCIATED MONITORING RANGE FOR

GROWTH IN TOTAL DOMESTIC NONFINANCIAL DEBT AT ____ TO

PERCENT.

With respect to M1, the Committee REAFFIRMED ITS

DECISION decided in February not to establish a specific

target for 1988 AND ALSO DECIDED NOT TO SET A TENTATIVE

RANGE FOR 1989. The behavior of this aggregate in

relation to economic activity and prices [DEL: has become very

sensitive to changes in interest rates, among other

factors as evidenced by sharp swings in its velocity in

recent years. -Consequently, the appropriateness of

changes in M1 this year] will continue to be evaluated in

the light of the behavior of its velocity, developments

in the economy and financial markets, and the nature of

emerging price pressures.

OPERATIONAL PARAGRAPH

In the initial implementation of policy FOR THE

IMMEDIATE FUTURE, the Committee seeks to DECREASE

SLIGHTLY (Alt. A)/maintain (Alt. B)/INCREASE SOMEWHAT

(SLIGHTLY) (Alt. C) the existing degree of pressure on

reserve positions. Taking account of conditions in

financial markets, the strength of the business expan-



-20-

sion, indications of inflationary pressures, develop-

ments in foreign exchange markets, and the behavior of

the monetary aggregates, [DEL: the Committee expects that a

slight-increase in the degree of pressure on reserve

positions would be appropriate in the weeks ahead.

Depending on further developments in these factors,]

somewhat (SLIGHTLY) greater reserve restraint would

(MIGHT) or (SOMEWHAT) slightly lesser reserve restraint

(WOULD) might also be acceptable later in the intermeet-

ing period. The contemplated reserve conditions are

expected to be consistent with growth in M2 and M3 over

the period from March through June THROUGH SEPTEMBER at

annual rates of about ____ AND ____ [DEL: 6 to 7] percent, RESPEC-

TIVELY. The Chairman may call for Committee consul-

tation if it appears to the Manager for Domestic Opera-

tions that reserve conditions during the period before

the next meeting are likely to be associated with a

federal funds rate persistently outside a range of ____ TO

____ [DEL: 5 to 9] percent.

n.s--not specified.
1. Targets are for bank credit until 1983; from 1983 onward targets are for domestic
nonfinancial sector debt.
2. At the February 1979 meeting the FOMC adopted a QIV'78 to QIV'79 range for M1 of 1-
1/2 to 4-1/2 percent. This range anticipated that shifting to ATS and NOW accounts in
New York State would slow M1 growth by 3 percentage points. At the October meeting it
was noted that ATS/NOW shifts would reduce M1 by no more than 1-1/2 percentage points.
Thus, the longer-run range for M1 was modified to 3-6 percent.
3. Adopted on a preliminary basis at the July 1979 meeting. In February 1980, the
monetary aggregates on which these targets were based were redefined and new target
ranges adopted.
4. The figures shown reflect targeted and actual growth of Ml-B in 1980 and shift-
adjusted Mi-B in 1981. MI-B was relabeled Ml in Janauary 1982. The targeted growth
for Ml-A was 3-1/2 to 6 percent in 1980 (actual growth was 5.0 percent); in 1981
targeted growth for shift-adjusted MI-A was 3 to 5-1/2 percent (actual growth was 1.3
percent).
5. When these ranges were set, shifts into other checkable deposits in 1980 were
expected to have only a limited effect on growth of Ml-A and Mi-B. As the year
progressed, however, banks offered other checkable deposits more actively, and more
funds than expected were directed to these accounts. Such shifts are estimated to
have decreased Mi-A growth and increased Ml-B growth each by at least 1/2 percentage
point more than had been anticipated.
6. Adjusted for the effects of shifts out of demand deposits and savings deposits into
other checkable deposits. At the February FOMC meeting, the target ranges for
observed MI-A and Ml-B in 1981 on an unadjusted basis, expected to be consistent with
the adjusted ranges, were -4-1/2 to -2 and 6 to 8-1/2 percent, respectively. Actual
M1-B growth (not shift adjusted) was 5.0 percent.
7. Adjusted for shifts of assets from domestic banking offices to International
Banking Facilities.

(Footnotes are continued on next page)



8. Range for bank credit is annualized growth from the December 1981-January 1982
average level through the fourth quarter of 1982.
9. Base period, adopted at the July 1983 FOMC meeting, is QII'83. At the February
1983 meeting, the FOMC had adopted a QIV'82 to QIV'83 target range for M1 of 4 to 8
percent.
10. Base period is the February-March 1983 average.
11. Base period, adopted at the July 1985 FOMC meeting, is QII'85. At the February
1985 meeting the FOMC had adopted a QIV'84 to QIV'85 target range for M1 of 4 to 7
percent.
12. Actual reported rates in the February 1987 Monetary Policy Report to Congress.
13. No range for M1 was specified at the February FOMC meeting because of
uncertainties about its underlying relationship to the behavior of the economy and its
sensitivity to economic and financial circumstances.
