Prefatory Note 

 
 

The attached document represents the most complete and accurate version 
available based on original copies culled from the files of the FOMC Secretariat at the 
Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System.  This electronic document was 
created through a comprehensive digitization process which included identifying the best-
preserved paper copies, scanning those copies,1 and then making the scanned versions 
text-searchable.2  Though a stringent quality assurance process was employed, some 
imperfections may remain. 
 

Please note that this document may contain occasional gaps in the text.  These 
gaps are the result of a redaction process that removed information obtained on a 
confidential basis.  All redacted passages are exempt from disclosure under applicable 
provisions of the Freedom of Information Act.    

 

                                                 
1 In some cases, original copies needed to be photocopied before being scanned into electronic format.  All 
scanned images were deskewed (to remove the effects of printer- and scanner-introduced tilting) and lightly 
cleaned (to remove dark spots caused by staple holes, hole punches, and other blemishes caused after initial 
printing). 
2 A two-step process was used.  An advanced optimal character recognition computer program (OCR) first 
created electronic text from the document image.  Where the OCR results were inconclusive, staff checked 
and corrected the text as necessary.   Please note that the numbers and text in charts and tables were not 
reliably recognized by the OCR process and were not checked or corrected by staff.

MONETARY POLICY ALTERNATIVES

Recent developments

(1) Preliminary data for September suggest a moderate rebound

in M1 to an annual growth rate of perhaps 7 percent after being about

unchanged on average in the previous two months, but growth of this

aggregate for the June-to-September period remains well below the path

of 5 percent or slightly less specified at the last Committee meeting.

The estimated level of M1 for September is at the center of its longer-

run target range. On a quarterly average basis M1 increased at about a

4-3/4 percent annual rate in the third quarter, about in line with pre-

dictions of our quarterly model, given actual income (which turned out

to be lower than assumed at the time of the last FOMC meeting) and

interest rates.

(2) Growth of M2 also appears to have strengthened in September,

after expanding at a sluggish pace over the previous two months. For the

June-to-September period, M2 expanded at almost a 6 percent annual rate,

well below the 7-1/2 percent objective for that period set by the Committee,

and drifted further below the midpoint of its longer-run range. Growth of

M3 over the summer slowed to a 7 percent rate, also considerably below

Committee expectations. Growth of large CDs outstanding at banks and thrift

institutions alike has weakened appreciably since July, owing partly to

diminished credit demands on depository institutions and to actual or

potential difficulties in CD markets. In particular, a large amount of

CDs ran off at the thrift subsidiary of FCA. A sharp runup in government

deposits also reduced needs at commercial banks for issuance of large CDs

and other managed liabilities to fund credit growth. By September, M3

had fallen from a level well over its longer-run target range for the

year to a point close to the upper limit.

(4) Expansion of private credit demands is estimated to have

eased a bit in July and August from the rapid pace of earlier in the year,

but this was offset by a surge in federal debt-boosting growth in total

domestic nonfinancial debt to a 13-1/4 percent average annual rate in July

and August. In private credit markets, the pace of mortgage and consumer

borrowing diminished somewhat, and merger financing abated. However,

business borrowing remained relatively strong as the financing gap widened.

Fragmentary data for September suggest no pickup in private credit flows

and a substantial reduction in the pace of federal borrowing. Neverthe-

less, growth in total debt through the third quarter remains about one-half

percentage point above its monitoring range for 1984, after subtracting

an estimate for merger-related financing.

(5) Given the continuing shortfall in money growth relative to

the Committee's objectives., against the background of data indicating a

slowing in the pace of economic expansion in the third quarter, the Desk

aimed at a somewhat more ample provision of nonborrowed reserves than

would otherwise have been the case, with reserve paths assuming a gradually

lower level of borrowing, most recently $750 million, rather than the $1

billion initially employed. Borrowing at the discount window during the

two reserve maintenance periods ending in September in fact averaged about

$750 million. Over the three month June-to-September period, nonborrowed

reserves plus extended credit expanded by about 1-3/4 percent at an

annual rate, while total reserves contracted by about one percent.



-4-

(6) The easing in bank reserve positions has been reflected

in a decline of the federal funds rate from the 11-1/2 to 11-3/4 percent

area prevailing immediately following the August FOMC meeting to the

area of 11 percent in the most recent reserve maintenance period, with

trading on some recent days below 11 percent. It is possible that the

extent of decline in the funds rate also has reflected some waning in the

reluctance of institutions to borrow at the window or to lend in the

funds market as perceptions about the condition of banks have improved.

Rates on private money market obligations generally have declined about

40 to 60 basis points since the FOMC meeting, and spreads of such rates

over Treasury bill rates have continued to narrow. The 3-month CD rate

was recently quoted just under 11 percent; most major banks have lowered

their prime rate to 12-3/4 percent. Treasury and corporate bond yields

have declined 5 to 25 basis points further, bringing net declines in bond

yields since their highs in late June to almost 1-1/2 percentage points.

(7) Conditions in exchange markets have been quite volatile

over much of the period since the last FOMC meeting. Despite some easing

in U.S. money market conditions, the dollar rose sharply and by September 20

was up by 7 percent. Among the not altogether convincing reasons for the

dollar's strength advanced by market participants have been factors

weakening the mark in particular--including downward revisions in expecta-

tions for economic activity in Germany--the prospect for redenomination

of some of Mexico's debt, and apparent lack of concern by official

authorities as the dollar continued to rise beyond expectations. On

Friday, September 21, the dollar spiked a further two percent, but then

dipped upon release of a higher-than-expected CPI figure. The Bundesbank



-5-

then surprised the market with very large and visible intervention and the

dollar plunged 4 percent by the following Monday morning. The dollar has

since recovered somewhat and is currently 5-1/2 percent above its value

prior to the last FOMC meeting.

. ntervention by the

U.S. over this period totaled $185 million in sales of dollars against marks.



Prospective developments

(8) The table below provides three alternative specifications for

growth in the monetary aggregates for the period from September to December,

with associated federal funds rate ranges. (More detailed data, including

implied growth for the QIV 1983 to QIV 1984 period, can be found in the table

and charts on the following pages.) Alternative B--which is expected to

involve continuation of roughly the current degree of pressure on bank

reserve positions--calls for growth in M1 that would keep this aggregate

at the midpoint of the Ccmmittee's long-run range, with M2 moving a

little higher in its range, though remaining below the midpoint, and M3

continuing near the upper end of its range. Alternative A calls for

somewhat faster money growth over the September-to-December period,

consistent with an easing in reserve pressures, while alternative C

contemplates somewhat slower money growth, associated with tighter reserve

conditions. Given the proximity of the end of the year, under all the

alternatives growth in M1 for the year would not be far from the 6 per-

cent midpoint of the Committee's long-run range, M2 would be expected to

remain around 7 percent--in the lower half of its long-run range-and M3

growth would stay close to the 9 percent upper end of its long-run range.

(9) All the alternatives specify more rapid M1 growth over

the next three months relative to its sluggish behavior over the June-to-

September period. Transactions demands are expected to strengthen in

association with the projected pickup in nominal GNP growth in the

fourth quarter, while the dampening effects on money demand of earlier

increases in short-term interest rates should diminish over the quarter

and begin to be reversed by the recent moderate declines in short rates.

On a quarterly average basis, M1 in the fourth quarter would increase at

a 5-3/4 percent annual rate under alternative B, implying an increase in

velocity of around 2-3/4 percent, given the staff's GNP forecast.

(10) Alternative B, and the other alternatives as well, also

call for somewhat more rapid growth of M2 over the September-to-December

period than in the summer. Spurred by faster income growth and a more

favorable alignment of rates on deposits relative to rates on market

instruments, the nontransactions component, along with M1, is expected to

contribute to the pickup in M2 expansion in the fourth quarter. M3

growth also is expected to quicken. Despite slower credit expansion at

thrifts projected for the fourth quarter, the recent weakness in thrift

CDs and associated rapid rise in FHLB advances is unlikely to continue,

assuming the condition of FCA stabilizes and repercussions on the access

of other thrifts to wholesale money markets remain minor. Commercial

bank CD issuance is likely to pick up as Treasury deposits decline.

(11) Growth in debt of nonfinancial sectors is projected to

moderate over the fourth quarter to around a 10-1/2 percent annual rate,

reflecting mainly a slowing in borrowing by private sectors. Households'

mortgage and consumer credit usage is expected to weaken a bit further.

The financing gap of business is not expected to widen further in the



-9-

fourth quarter, and total borrowing by businesses may decrease if merger

and related activity continues to moderate as expected. Despite the

slowing of credit growth over coming months, for 1984 the debt of non-

financial sectors is projected to increase around 12-1/2 percent, compared

to the Committee's range of 8 to 11 percent, with about one percentage

point of this total attributable to credit associated with merger and

related activity.

(12) The specifications of alternative B assume borrowing at

the discount window remains around the recent $750 million level. This

degree of pressure on reserve positions is likely to involve federal

funds trading in the neighborhood of 11 percent, with trading on the low

side more likely if rates on alternative sources of funds, such as CDs,

remain relatively low, and if a calmer atmosphere in money markets encour-

ages banks to tap these sources more aggressively and to be less reticent

about use of the discount window. Nonborrowed and total reserves would

each increase at close to a one percent rate over October and November.

(13) With federal funds averaging close to 11 percent, other

interest rates are likely to fluctuate around current levels. Rates in

short-term markets already appear to have adjusted to federal funds

trading in that area, and 3-month Treasury bill rates should remain

around 10-1/4 percent, with slightly lower rates developing should funds

trade persistently below 11 percent. Further improvement, if any, in

long-term markets is expected to be quite limited, given the anticipated

strengthening of incoming economic data and the expectation that M1

growth will not fall well below the midpoint of its long-run range.

Moreover, during the intermeeting period, note and bond markets will have

to absorb a very substantial volume of Treasury issues-including both



-10-

the large end-of-quarter note and bond auctions that had to be postponed

from late September due to debt ceiling constraints, and the regular

mid-quarter .refunding scheduled for the first week of November.

(14) The somewhat more rapid money growth specifications of

alternative A would be expected to involve a further reduction in

pressures on bank reserve positions, with discount window borrowing

declining to around $500 million. Nonborrowed reserves would increase at

about a 6 percent annual rate over October and November. The federal

funds rate would drop to 10-1/4 to 10-1/2 percent, or possibly a little

lower if the pattern of discount window borrowing evident before last May

reemerges.

(15) Such an easing in bank reserve positions, which is not

now expected by market participants, would probably set off a considerable

rally in short- and longer-term markets. The Treasury bill rate might

decline into the 9-1/2 percent area, and CD rates would drop to around

10-1/2 percent, exerting further downward pressure on the prime rate.

Yields on long-term Treasury bonds might decrease initially by at least

1/2 percentage point on expectations that a sustained easing in credit

markets might be underway. A portion of the gains in bond markets could

later be reversed, however, should incoming data on the economy and money

and credit show strength, and as bond issuance by corporations and state

and local governments rises further. The dollar would tend to decline on

foreign exchange markets, although any declines might be limited should

market participants anticipate a subsequent firming of interest rates.

(16) Alternative C, which involves some tightening of money

market conditions over the intermeeting period, would be expected to

restrain M1 growth over the balance of the year to a rate below the



-11-

midpoint of its long-run range and to exert particular restraint on

credit growth. Borrowing at the discount window under this alternative

would return to around the $1 billion level prevailing over most of the

spring and summer, with nonborrowed reserves declining by around 4 per-

cent over October and November. The federal funds rate would be expected

to return to the 11-1/2 to 11-3/4 percent area, or possibly a bit higher.

The Treasury bill rate would rise to around 10-3/4 percent, CD rates

would increase by 1/2 percentage point or perhaps more, and the dollar

would probably rise, at least for a while, on foreign exchange markets.

With upward pressures reemerging in short-term markets, longer-term

yields can be expected to retrace some of the declines since early summer,

leading to further reductions in demands for mortgage credit as well as

to shifts in borrowing by businesses back toward short-term markets--and

also possibly to reconsideration of over-all borrowing and spending

programs.

Directive language

(17) Proposed language for the operational paragraph, with

alternatives, is shown below.

OPERATIONAL PARAGRAPH

In the implementation of policy in the short run, the Committee

seeks to DECREASE SOMEWHAT (ALT. A)/ maintain (ALT. B)/ INCREASE SOMEWHAT

(ALT. C) existing pressures on reserve positions. This action is expected

to be consistent with growth in M1, [DEL: at an annual rate of around 5 percent

or slightly less, and in] M2, and M3 at annual rates of around [DEL: 7-1/2 and 9]

____, ____, AND ____ percent respectively during the period from [DEL: June to]

September TO DECEMBER. Somewhat greater reserve restraint would be accept-

able in the event of more substantial growth of the monetary aggregates,

while somewhat lesser restraint would be acceptable in the event of signifi-

cantly slower growth. In either case, such a change would be considered

only in the context of appraisals of the continuing strength of the busi-

ness expansion, inflationary pressures, financial market conditions, and

the rate of credit growth. The Chairman may call for Ccmmittee consulta-

tion if it appears to the Manager for Domestic Operations that pursuit of

the monetary objectives and related reserve paths during the period before

the next meeting is likely to be associated with a federal funds rate

persistently outside a range of [DEL: 8 to 12] ____ TO ____ percent.
