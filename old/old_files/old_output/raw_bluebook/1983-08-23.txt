Prefatory Note 

 
 

The attached document represents the most complete and accurate version 
available based on original copies culled from the files of the FOMC Secretariat at the 
Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System.  This electronic document was 
created through a comprehensive digitization process which included identifying the best-
preserved paper copies, scanning those copies,1 and then making the scanned versions 
text-searchable.2  Though a stringent quality assurance process was employed, some 
imperfections may remain. 
 

Please note that this document may contain occasional gaps in the text.  These 
gaps are the result of a redaction process that removed information obtained on a 
confidential basis.  All redacted passages are exempt from disclosure under applicable 
provisions of the Freedom of Information Act.    

 

                                                 
1 In some cases, original copies needed to be photocopied before being scanned into electronic format.  All 
scanned images were deskewed (to remove the effects of printer- and scanner-introduced tilting) and lightly 
cleaned (to remove dark spots caused by staple holes, hole punches, and other blemishes caused after initial 
printing). 
2 A two-step process was used.  An advanced optimal character recognition computer program (OCR) first 
created electronic text from the document image.  Where the OCR results were inconclusive, staff checked 
and corrected the text as necessary.   Please note that the numbers and text in charts and tables were not 
reliably recognized by the OCR process and were not checked or corrected by staff.

MONETARY POLICY ALTERNATIVES

Recent developments

(1) Growth of M2 and M3 slowed appreciably in July to annual

rates of about 6-1/4 and 5 per cent respectively, well below their June-

to-September path rates of 8-1/2 and 8 per cent set at the last FOMC

meeting. The slowing of growth in the broader aggregates last month

reflected reduced reliance by banks on funds borrowed through managed

liabilities-overnight RPs and Eurodollars, term RPs and large CDs-prob-

ably in response to the unusually large increase in the availability of

funds from U.S. Government balances. This led to a substantial deceler-

ation in growth of the nontransaction component of the broad aggregates,

even though growth of the total of savings and small time deposits (includ-

ing MMDAs) slowed only marginally last month. The composition of inflows

into that grouping shifted dramatically, however, as MMDAs were little

changed on balance while small time deposits, mainly 6-month MMCs, surged

with the recent rise in short-term market interest rates. By July, M2

stood at the center of its 7 to 10 per cent long-run growth cone and M3

was in the upper half of its longer-run range.

(2) A more rapid growth of the broad aggregates is anticipated

in August partly on the grounds that banks may borrow more aggressively

in the market through managed liabilities to compensate for an expected

drop in U.S. Government funds. Nonetheless, given the partial data avail-

able through the first half of the month, growth rates of M2 and M3 may

not be so strong in August as to bring these aggregates above the FOMC's

short-term target path, and they, particularly M2, might remain below.

3. Includes special borrowing and other extended credit from the Federal

4. Thus far in August (through August 17) borrowing and excess reserves
have averaged $993 and $409 million, respectively.



(3) M1 decelerated a bit further in July, to about a 9 per

cent annual rate-which was slightly below expectations for July thought

at the time of the last meeting to be consistent with the 7 per cent

growth rate specified for the June-to-September target period. Data for

early August suggest some further deceleration in growth. Owing to rapid

expansion in the latter half of the second quarter, the level of M1 in

the first half of August remained above the upper limit of its 5 to 9 per

cent monitoring range.

(4) Borrowing by domestic nonfinancial sectors is estimated

to have decelerated to about an 8-3/4 per cent annual rate in July from

the 11-3/4 per cent second-quarter pace, largely reflecting reduced borrow-

ing by the Federal Government. Although July growth in bank credit-at

9-3/4 per cent-was about unchanged from June, a further acceleration in

lending offset a marked decline in acquisitions of Treasury securities.

Lending to businesses strengthened to a 12 per cent annual rate, reflecting

the curtailment in long-term bond issuance as long-term rates backed up

further, and consumer lending accelerated to a 20 per cent rate as the

bank share of this market evidently continued to grow. Thus far in

August, data from large banks suggest that business loan demand may be

moderating, but borrowing in the commercial paper market has picked up.

(5) Growth in total reserves decelerated to a 6 per cent annual

rate in July, reflecting a slowing in growth of required reserves against

deposits in Ml. Growth in the monetary base also slowed markedly in

July, as currency expansion dropped off considerably following many

months of strong expansion. Nonborrowed reserves plus extended credit



-4-

were unchanged in July as adjustment plus seasonal borrowing rose.

Over the intermeeting period, borrowing ran somewhat in excess of the

Committee's $600 to $800 million assumed range, reflecting a tendency

for borrowing to be strong early in the statement week and for excess

reserves to run slightly higher than expected. Net borrowed reserves

have averaged about $515 million over the intermeeting period, at the

high end of expectations for the period implied in the Committee's

discussion of operating targets at the last meeting.

(6) Over the intermeeting period, the federal funds rate rose

from around 9-1/4 per cent to the 9-1/2 to 9-5/8 per cent area, with

trading in the first half of August mainly around the latter rate or a

bit higher. This rise was accompanied by fairly marked increases in

short- and particularly longer-term interest rates-which moved upward by

about 40 and 80 basis points respectively from the time of the Committee

meeting to peaks in the second week in August. Longer-term rates may

have been influenced by heightened concerns about the conflict between

federal and private credit demands in a strengthened economy--concerns

that may have been manifested in the initial lukewarm investor reception

of the record-size mid-August Treasury refunding. In recent days, both

short- and long-term interest rates have declined from earlier peaks,

reflecting slower than expected money growth, a more moderate retail

sales figure than many anticipated, and a slight easing in pressures on

the funds market. On balance, since the previous FOMC meeting, short-term

rates have risen about 10 to 20 basis points and longer-term market rates

about 20 to 25 basis points. Mortgage rates have risen about 60 basis

points.



-5-

(7) The rise of U.S. interest rates, together with indications

that rates abroad would not be lifted, apparently spurred strong demand

for the dollar on foreign exchange markets in the first half of August,

and at its peak the dollar had risen by about 4-1/2 per cent on a weighted

average basis.

intervention by the

United States-

marked the first U.S. intervention since October 1982. More recently, as

interest rates in the U.S. have eased off, the dollar has dropped on ex-

change markets, by about 2-1/2 per cent from its peak.

(9) The monetary aggregates of alternative B most nearly

correspond to the specifications for the third quarter adopted at the

last Committee meeting; they differ only by a slightly higher growth

for M1 balanced by a slightly lower growth for M2, a change in relation-

ship suggested by incoming data. Such growth rates are likely to be

achieved without further significant change in money market conditions.

Alternatives A and C would call for somewhat easier and tighter money

market conditions respectively. Because the bulk of the third quarter

is now behind, specified money growth rates over the June-to-September

period do not differ greatly from alternative B, but the emerging differ-

ence in money market conditions would more significantly affect develop-

ments in the fourth quarter.

(10) Under all the alternatives growth in M2 and M3 is expected

to quicken in August and September from the July pace, largely for the rea-

son noted in paragraph (2), though these aggregates are expected to remain

within the FOMC's longer-run range. M1, on the other hand, is expected

to grow more slowly in August and September than in July as the rise in

market interest rates that has already occurred contributes to moderation

in demands for this aggregate.

(11) Under alternative B, the federal funds rate would be

expected to trade around 9-1/2 per cent (the 6 to 10 per cent funds rate

range shown for that alternative retains the specification of the current

directive). Recent strength in demands at the discount window suggest

that borrowing would range between $700 and $900 million. Total and

nonborrowed reserves would be expected to show little change, on balance,

over August and September-with a small decline in August offset by a

rise in September.

(12) Other short-term market interest rates, which have declined

some in recent days partly as expectations of a further tightening in

monetary policy abated, should remain around current levels. A little

further drop in long-term rates could develop, however, particularly if

stability in the funds rate is accompanied by additional evidence of less

rapid economic expansion along with moderate money growth in or approach-

ing the Committee's longer-term ranges.



-9-

(13) The debt of nonfinancial sectors is expected to increase

over the third quarter at a considerably slower pace than in the second.

The moderation in growth reflects a sharp drop off of bond issuance by

state and local governments and a slowing of borrowing by the Treasury,

following the rapid build up of its cash balance in early summer. Even

so, the federal government's demands on credit markets remain quite large,

with its outstanding debt projected to increase at around a 16 per cent

annual rate in the third quarter. Household borrowing is expected to

continue close to the stronger pace of the second quarter. Net busi-

ness needs for external finance are expected to remain relatively small,

as the effects of a turn to inventory accumulation are about offset by

strong growth of internal funds.

(14) Looking into the fourth quarter, and assuming sane slight

further tightening of money market conditions in the fall as well as re-

duced growth of nominal GNP in line with staff projections, the expansion

of M1 may slow somewhat further. Growth in that aggregate for the year

would then be in the upper half of the Committee's longer-run range-which

would be consistent with a slight further pick-up in velocity growth

during the fourth quarter from the about 1 to 1-1/2 per cent expansion

that appears in store for the third quarter. Growth rates in M2 and M3

over the year 1983 are expected to be around the midpoint, and in the

upper half, of their longer-run ranges respectively, assuming as noted

above some slight further tightening of money markets in the fourth

quarter and also a moderation of loan demands at banks and thrifts.

(15) Alternative A contemplates some easing in money market

conditions, with federal funds in an 8-1/2 to 9 per cent area and borrow-

ing declining to the $400-$600 million range. Nonborrowed reserves would



-10-

be expected to expand at about a 6 per cent annual rate from July to

September. Market interest rates would probably decline substantially

in response to the unexpected easing of money markets, with the 3-month

Treasury bill rate falling to the 8-1/2 per cent area. A considerable

rally probably would develop in bond markets. With bond rates falling,

business issuance of long-term obligations would burgeon once again,

while borrowing from banks and in the commercial paper market receded.

In foreign exchange markets, the dollar would tend to weaken, probably

falling below levels prevailing around the time of the July FOMC meeting.

(16) While growth in the monetary aggregates in the June-to-

September period may be only a little stronger under alternative A than

alternative B, the easing in bank reserve positions, if sustained through

the fourth quarter, would involve a greater chance as the year progresses

that M1 growth would accelerate, at least a bit, from what is currently

expected to be a moderate August pace and tend to stay above its longer-run

range. An acceleration could reflect both the reduced opportunity cost

of holding NOW accounts as well as any greater than projected expansion

in nominal GNP should an easing of interest rates lead, through a favor-

able impact on attitudes among other things, to greater consumer and

business spending. Growth in M2 and M3 would tend to be somewhat higher

for the year as money market conditions remain easier than under alter-

native B, but they are likely to remain within their longer-run ranges.

(17) Alternative C contemplates a near-term tightening in

money market conditions with a view to gaining greater assurance that

all of the aggregates, including Ml, would end 1983 within their longer-

run ranges. The federal funds rate under alternative C might trade in



-11-

the 10 to 10-1/2 per cent range through the end of the quarter. Discount

window borrowing would tend toward the area of $l-1/4 billion at the

current 8-1/2 per cent discount rate, raising questions about the level

of that rate. Assuming no discount rate change, nonborrowed reserves

might decline at about a 6 per cent annual rate from July to September.

(18) The size and speed of the tightening in money market

conditions contemplated under alternative C is probably not currently

anticipated in the market. As a result, interest rates in both short-

and long-term markets would be likely to rise appreciably. Bond issuance

by corporations and state and local governments is already quite low com-

pared to earlier in the year, but it could drop off even more. In the

mortgage market rates on conventional fixed rate mortgages would climb

above 14 per cent, with pressure on these rates accentuated by effects of

rising MMDA costs on the willingness of thrifts to extend mortgage loans.

The dollar would come under considerable upward pressure on foreign ex-

change markets, especially if foreign central banks continued to demonstrate

a reluctance to raise their domestic interest rates.

(19) Under alternative C, M2 and M3 growth over the June-to-

September period might be somewhat below objectives specified at the

last Committee meeting, though M1 growth may be close to its 7 per cent

third-quarter objective. However, should the higher interest rates cause

sizable shifts of saving funds out of NOW accounts into instruments bear-

ing market-related interest rates, M1 growth could slow substantially

in September and also into the fourth quarter. Growth in M2 and M3

would also tend to slow, though perhaps not as markedly as M1, in the

fourth quarter. The probable dampening effect of these higher interest



-12-

rates on growth in money and income as the year progresses suggests the

likelihood that attaining longer-run money and credit targets for 1984

would involve a substantial easing of interest rates later this year or

early next year from the alternative C levels.



Directive Language

Given below is a suggested operational paragraph for the directive,

with the numerical specifications adopted at the meeting on July 12-13 shown

in strike-through form.

OPERATIONAL PARAGRAPH

The Committee seeks in the short run to (increase slightly further

MAINTAIN/DECREASED SLIGHTLY) the existing degree of reserve restraint. The

action is expected to be associated with growth of M2 and M3 at annual rates

of about [DEL: 8-1/2] ____ and 8 ____ per cent respectively from June to September,

consistent with the targets established for these aggregates for the year.

Depending on evidence about the strength of economic recovery and other

factors bearing on the business and inflation outlook, lesser restraint

would be acceptable in the context of a significant shortfall in growth of

the aggregates from current expectations, while somewhat greater restraint

would be acceptable should the aggregates expand more rapidly. The Committee

anticipates that a deceleration in M1 growth to an annual rate of around

[DEL: 7] ____ per cent from June to September will be consistent with its third-

quarter objectives for the broader aggregates, and that expansion in total

domestic nonfinancial debt would remain within the ranges established for

the year. The Chairman may call for Comittee consultation if it appears

to the Manager for Domestic Operations that pursuit of the monetary objectives

and related reserve paths during the period before the next meeting is likely

to be associated with a federal funds rate persistently outside a range of

[DEL: 6 to 10] ____ TO ____ per cent.
