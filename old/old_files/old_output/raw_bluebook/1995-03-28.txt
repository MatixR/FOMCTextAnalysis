MONETARY POLICY ALTERNATIVES

Recent Developments1

(1) The System tightened the stance of monetary policy fur-

ther on February 1 to contain inflation pressures amid indications

that the economy was continuing to advance at a substantial pace,

boosting rates of resource utilization from already high levels. The

Board approved a 1/2 percentage point hike in the discount rate, to

5-1/4 percent, and the FOMC allowed that increase to show through

fully to reserve markets, raising the intended federal funds rate to

6 percent. Federal funds generally traded a little below the intended

level during the intermeeting period.2 Unusually low demands for

excess reserves appear to have contributed to softness in the federal

funds rate at times during the intermeeting period.

(2) The firming of reserve market conditions was anticipated

by market participants and prompted little response in market rates;

the prime rate, however, was hiked another 50 basis points, to 9 per-

cent. As the period progressed, most market yields moved down con-

siderably in reaction to data indicating that the pace of economic

expansion was slowing appreciably, as well as to testimony and other

comments by Federal Reserve officials that were interpreted as sug-

gesting that, as a consequence, the period of policy tightening might

be drawing to a close. The revision to expectations was reflected in

a substantial downward movement in futures rates on federal funds and

2. The allowance for adjustment and seasonal borrowing was left
unchanged over the period at $75 million. Actual borrowing averaged
slightly below its allowance.



Eurodollar deposits (chart); making some allowance for liquidity pre-

miums, the structure of these rates suggests that market participants

now expect little if any further tightening in monetary policy. Most

short-term rates fell 15 to 30 basis points over the period, while

intermediate- and longer-term yields declined 30 to 60 basis points.

Broad stock price indexes climbed 5 to 7 percent to record levels in

response to heightened prospects for sustained moderate economic ex-

pansion with low inflation and the associated fall in interest rates

and to earnings reports that were generally stronger than expected.

U.S. capital markets were relatively undisturbed by several poten-

tially disruptive events. The failure of Baring Brothers appeared to

have few spillover effects domestically. News of large trading losses

at Bankers Trust reduced the price of its shares and increased the

spread on its uninsured debt, but left the prices of the securities of

other institutions unaffected. Spreads on private paper more general-

ly stayed narrow over the intermeeting period. A plunge in the for-

eign exchange value of the dollar did not appear to push up bond

yields on balance, because it seemed attributable largely to the sof-

tening economic outlook. However, on days when the dollar's decline

was sharpest, bond rates and their implied volatility moved up tem-

porarily.

(3) The dollar's foreign exchange value fell 4-3/4 percent

on a weighted-average basis against other G-10 currencies over the

intermeeting period. It fell especially steeply around the time of

the defeat of the Balanced Budget Amendment, perhaps suggesting erod-

ing confidence in the ability of the U.S. government to address some

of its serious economic concerns. Declines against the mark and the

yen were particularly large--7 and 10-1/2 percent, respectively.

Long-term interest rates declined about 25 basis points in Germany,

about half of the fall in the United States. The mark may have bene-

fitted as well from stronger demands arising from political uncer-

tainties in several European countries, notably Italy and Spain. The

extent of the yen's strength against the dollar was somewhat puzzling;

Japanese bond rates declined somewhat more than U.S. rates. The de-

terioration of the Mexican political and economic situation led to a

sharp depreciation of the peso against the dollar and appeared to

weigh on the dollar vis-a-vis major currencies. Intervention activity

was substantial: U.S. monetary authorities purchased $1,420 million

against marks and yen, split evenly between the System and the Trea-

sury.

The Bank of Mexico drew $1 billion on its swap line with the

Federal Reserve early in the intermeeting period and later repaid $500

million out of the proceeds of a medium-term drawing of $3 billion on

its swap line with the ESF. At this time, Mexico has outstanding

drawings of $4 billion on the ESF and $1 billion on the Federal

Reserve.

(4) Following a burst of growth in January, M2 has been

nearly flat on net over the past two months, falling short of the

1-1/4 percent growth projected by the staff in the previous bluebook

and leaving this aggregate a little above the lower bound of its 1-to-

5 percent annual range. The weakness in M2, particularly in money

market funds, was mirrored by strengthening demands for investments

3. M1 also was about flat on net over February and March, although
currency expanded at a 8-1/4 percent annual rate. Total reserves have
declined at a 5-1/4 percent rate over the last two months, holding
down expansion of the monetary base to a 6-1/4 percent pace.

outside of the monetary aggregates. Investors have resumed net

purchases of shares in bond funds after a year of redemptions, and

purchases of stock funds have been brisk.5 Also, noncompetitive

tenders for Treasury securities have been heavy in recent months.

Nonetheless, as in 1994, the growth of M2 has tracked that projected

by the standard staff demand model. Based on the Greenbook projection

for nominal GDP, the velocity of M2 has continued to increase in the

first quarter, but less rapidly than last year.

(5) M3 has remained more robust than M2 in recent months,

expanding at a 4 percent average pace over February and March, a

little stronger than the staff expected. This aggregate in March is

estimated to be slightly above its 0-to-4 percent range for 1995. The

elevated growth of M3 appears to be associated with bank needs to fund

loan growth. Large time deposits have been issued at a particularly

rapid clip, and term Eurodollars and RPs have also been strong.

(6) Debt growth was relatively brisk on balance over the

first few months of the year. Overall business borrowing has picked

up in recent months, perhaps reflecting a widening financing gap.

Business loans at banks surged at a 22 percent annual rate in February

on the heels of similar growth in January; some deceleration, though

to a still-hefty pace, seems to be in train in March. Commercial

paper issuance also has been strong, while issuance of corporate bonds

in public markets has picked up a little. By contrast, household

borrowing is estimated to have moderated. Growth of consumer credit

4. M1 and M2 appear to have been depressed slightly in February and
early March by delays in processing income tax refunds, which owed to
stepped-up efforts by the IRS to curb fraud.

5. M2 plus stock and bond funds is estimated to have increased over
February and March after declining since September.



-5-

in January was held down by weakness in auto loans. Consumer borrow-

ing from banks slowed substantially in February, owing importantly to

the virtual absence of tax-refund loans this year, but appears to have

rebounded this month. In the tax-exempt sector, the volume of bonds

outstanding likely has contracted, as bond issuance has been quite

weak while retirements remain large. Total domestic nonfinancial

sector debt is estimated to have expanded at a 6 percent pace through

February, leaving this aggregate in the upper half of its 3-to-7 per-

cent monitoring range.

Policy alternatives

(7) Three policy alternatives are considered below. Under

alternative B, federal funds trading would continue around 6 percent,

in association with adjustment plus seasonal borrowing of $75 mil-

lion.6 Under alternative C, the federal funds rate would be in-

creased to 6-1/2 percent by raising either the borrowing allowance to

$125 million or the discount rate by 50 basis points. Alternative A,

involving a reduction of the intended funds rate to 5-1/2 percent,

could be effected by lowering either the borrowing allowance to $50

million or the discount rate by 50 basis points.

(8) A key element in assessing the appropriate stance of

policy going forward is the interpretation of the causes and conse-

quences of the sizeable movements in prices on securities and foreign

exchange markets over recent months. As discussed in paragraph 2, the

drop in dollar interest and exchange rates seemed primarily a response

to the perceived softening in aggregate demand. The question is

whether the market reaction has been appropriate to the new informa-

tion in the sense of leaving rates at levels consistent with the Com-

mittee's objectives for the economy and prices. With an unchanged

federal funds rate in the staff forecast, interest and exchange rates

close to recent levels are associated with activity growing slowly

enough to move the economy back to the neighborhood of its potential

and core CPI inflation flattening out at a somewhat higher rate than

in 1994. If the Committee believes such an outcome were both likely

and acceptable, then it may be inclined to leave the current level of

the federal funds rate in place, as under alternative B, unless and

6. Over the upcoming intermeeting period, the borrowing allowance
likely will have to be raised to reflect the normal upturn in seasonal
credit in the spring of the year.



until incoming economic data or a clarification of prospective fiscal

policy begin to point to a different outlook.

(9) The softer cast to recent economic data along with

statements by Federal Reserve officials have led market participants

to the virtually unanimous opinion that the FOMC will keep its policy

stance on hold at this Committee meeting. Consequently, there would

likely be little change in interest rates in response to the choice of

alternative B. While sentiment in foreign exchange markets has proven

difficult to predict, no clear rationale presents itself for signifi-

cant further dollar depreciation over the intermeeting period.

(10) A case for the 1/2 percentage point increase in the

federal funds rate of alternative C could be made on the grounds that,

with economic activity having already overshot its potential and the

persistence of the slowdown in economic growth not yet firmly estab-

lished, more insurance should be taken out against a serious deterior-

ation in inflation trends. The risk of such an outcome would seem

even greater if it were judged that markets have overreacted, implying

undesirable additional stimulus from the declines in interest and

exchange rates and the rise in stock prices. The need for prompt

further policy firming would be especially pressing to the extent that

the Committee were dissatisfied with the prospects in the staff fore-

cast for a sustained higher level of core inflation. Judging from the

alternative simulations in the Greenbook, even a 50 basis point in-

crease in the federal funds rate would leave the core CPI inflation

rate in 1996 above that in 1994 and might not be sufficient to restore

a downward tilt in subsequent years.

(11) With financial markets having built in no near-term

monetary policy tightening, choice of alternative C would come as a



surprise. Market participants might alter their perceptions of the

Federal Reserve's longer-term intentions and likely reactions to

future economic data. The resulting higher expected path of short-

term interest rates over the intermediate term would act to raise bond

rates, especially in real terms. But for nominal yields, the more

favorable inflation prospects for the out years, and the associated

reduction in expected short-term interest rates for those years, would

serve as a partial offset. The unexpected rise in U.S. real interest

rates across the term structure, other things equal, would provide

support for the dollar on foreign exchange markets.

(12) The easing in reserve market conditions under alterna-

tive A could be justified if the unexpected weakness in the recent

economic data were read as indicating that previous policy tightenings

risked an unacceptably sharp slowdown in spending later this year--

especially since a real federal funds rate remaining above its longer-

term average might add to the restraint on demand already in the pipe-

line. Concerns in this regard might be accentuated by the further

deterioration in the Mexican situation and repercussions on U.S. net

exports. In this view, with pressures on resources possibly abating

appreciably, the risks of worsening inflation would seem minimal. In

effect, choice of alternative A would imply a view that not only have

longer-term interest and exchange rates not overshot on the downside,

but that policy may still be too tight to allow markets to compensate

fully for oncoming economic weakness.

(13) The 50 basis point easing of the federal funds rate

under alternative A also would surprise market participants. Both

long- and short-term rates are likely to fall substantially as a

result, as would the foreign exchange value of the dollar. Although



-10-

the Federal Reserve's anti-inflationary credibility has apparently

increased over the last few months, it could begin to erode if incom-

ing data were to indicate that inflation pressures were not abating,

prompting the market to judge that the easing had been unwarranted.

Under those circumstances, long-term rates would begin to retrace

their initial declines, particularly if the dollar came under persist-

ent, intense downward pressure.

(14) The table below shows staff projections of money and

debt aggregates through September under the unchanged reserve market

conditions of alternative B. (More detailed data, including money

growth rates under alternatives A and C, are shown in the table and

charts on the following pages.) From a March base, average M2 growth

would pick up to a 2-1/2 percent rate, while average M3 growth would

slow to a 3 percent pace. The projected strengthening in M2

growth, despite the staff's forecast of weaker nominal GDP expansion,

reflects both a continued rise in the offering rates on deposits and

the reduced attractiveness of financial assets of longer maturities

8
owing to the lower bond yields. Diminishing M3 growth mirrors the

7. Over the six months ending in September, M1 would be little
changed. Total reserves would decline at a 4 percent pace, reflecting
a runoff of transactions deposits. With further rapid expansion of
currency, however, the monetary base is expected to grow at about a
7 percent rate over the period. This projection does not take into
account implementation of an additional sweep program from OCDs to
MMDAs that recently came to the attention of the staff. The actual
implementation is uncertain both in size and timing, but as planned,
would occur May 1 and involve about $3 billion. This would reduce the
growth rate of M1 from March to September by 1/2 percentage point, but
would have no effect on M2.

8. The staff expects that individual nonwithheld payments over the
April tax season will be substantially larger than in recent years.
Considerable volatility in the monthly growth rates of liquid deposits
in April and May is possible, depending upon individuals' behavior in
building up liquid balances in advance of the April 17 tax date and
the timing of clearings of tax checks against those accounts. On

anticipated moderation in bank funding needs following the outsized

burst in lending activity over the first quarter of the year. The

bulk of this slowdown in M3 is expected to be concentrated in large

time deposits. By September, M2 would be in the lower half, and M3

near the top, of their respective 1-to-5 percent and 0-to-4 percent

annual growth ranges. Somewhat slower growth in the monetary aggre-

gates would result from the higher opportunity costs of alternative C,

while somewhat faster growth would occur under alternative A. The

the growth of the broader aggregates be expected to breach the upper

or lower bands of their annual ranges, although M3 is virtually at the

upper end of its range under alternative A.

(15) Consistent with the forecasted moderation in nominal

spending, the debt of domestic nonfinancial sectors is expected to

slow to around a 4-3/4 percent pace from February to September, bring-

ing its rate of growth from the fourth quarter of last year to 5 per-

cent--the mid-point of its monitoring range. Its nonfederal component

is projected to follow a virtually identical pattern. Borrowing by

nonfinancial businesses is likely to edge off; enlarged bond issuance

brought about by declines in long-term interest rates should be more

than offset by an ebbing of bank lending and commercial paper issu-

ance. Household borrowing should moderate with spending, led by a

reduction in flows of consumer credit, which might also be affected by

increased interest charges. The tendency toward increasingly generous

provision of credit by banks and other institutional lenders might

well draw to a close as rising debt service burdens and the economic

slowdown begin to raise some cautionary flags about prospective credit

quality.

Directive Language

(16) Presented below is draft wording for the operational

paragraph that includes the usual options for Committee consideration.

OPERATIONAL PARAGRAPH

In the implementation of policy for the im-

mediate future, the Committee seeks to DECREASE SOME-

WHAT/MAINTAIN/increase somewhat the existing degree of

pressure on reserve positions, [DEL: taking account of a

possible increase in the discount rate.] In the con-

text of the Committee's long-run objectives for price

stability and sustainable economic growth, and giving

careful consideration to economic, financial, and

monetary developments, somewhat (SLIGHTLY) greater

reserve restraint (WOULD) (MIGHT) or somewhat

(SLIGHTLY) lesser reserve restraint would (MIGHT) be

acceptable in the intermeeting period. The contem-

plated reserve conditions are expected to be consis-

tent with moderate growth in M2 and M3 over coming

months.
