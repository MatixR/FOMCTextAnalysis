Prefatory Note 

 
 

The attached document represents the most complete and accurate version 
available based on original copies culled from the files of the FOMC Secretariat at the 
Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System.  This electronic document was 
created through a comprehensive digitization process which included identifying the best-
preserved paper copies, scanning those copies,1 and then making the scanned versions 
text-searchable.2  Though a stringent quality assurance process was employed, some 
imperfections may remain. 
 

Please note that this document may contain occasional gaps in the text.  These 
gaps are the result of a redaction process that removed information obtained on a 
confidential basis.  All redacted passages are exempt from disclosure under applicable 
provisions of the Freedom of Information Act.    

 

                                                 
1 In some cases, original copies needed to be photocopied before being scanned into electronic format.  All 
scanned images were deskewed (to remove the effects of printer- and scanner-introduced tilting) and lightly 
cleaned (to remove dark spots caused by staple holes, hole punches, and other blemishes caused after initial 
printing). 
2 A two-step process was used.  An advanced optimal character recognition computer program (OCR) first 
created electronic text from the document image.  Where the OCR results were inconclusive, staff checked 
and corrected the text as necessary.   Please note that the numbers and text in charts and tables were not 
reliably recognized by the OCR process and were not checked or corrected by staff.

Recent developments

(1) Following a sharp September increase, M-1 slowed to a

3¼ per cent annual rate of growth in October, and appears to be

expanding at a 2¼ per cent rate in November. The slower growth of M-1

this month reflects the impact on the daily average November level of

what appears to be a transitory drop in demand deposits in late

October; in addition, the introduction of Automatic Transfer Service

(ATS) is also dampening M-l growth.1/ For October and November

combined, growth is projected at a 2¾ per cent annual rate, well below

the limit set by the FOMC. M-2 appears to be expanding at about

a 7½ per cent annual rate, the midpoint of its FOMC range. Growth

in small time deposits picked up in October, reflecting record

inflows of the 6-month certificates, but savings deposits declined

1/ Data from a sample of member and nonmember banks suggest that ATS

balances at all commercial banks had risen to $765 million by Nov.

8. Respondents estimated that between 50 and 60 per cent of these
balances came from demand deposits, and that only about 3 per cent
came from thrift deposits. The average size of the ATS accounts was
just over $6,000.

and growth of large-denomination time deposits included in this

measure, while accelerating at month-end, moderated on a daily

average basis. Total deposit growth at nonbank thrift institutions

also moderated a bit in October, despite increased issuance of the

new money market time deposit.

(2) Following the October FOMC meeting, the Account Manage-

ment raised its funds rate objective to the 9 per cent mid-point of

the 8¾ to 9¼ per cent range specified by the Committee. Funds generally

traded around the upper limit of this range, however, as the Desk first

encountered difficulty in providing reserves because of a shortage of

collateral and then in the last days of October was reluctant to take

aggressive action to reduce the rate in view of conditions in the

foreign exchange market. To strengthen the dollar in foreign exchange

markets and counter inflationary pressures, on November 1 the discount

rate was raised one percentage point to 9½ per cent,1/ reserve require-

ments on large denomination time deposits were increased 2 percentage

points, and up to $30 billion of foreign currencies were mobilized for

intervention in foreign exchange markets. The FOMC also raised its

funds rate range to 9½ to 9¾ per cent. In light of the volatile

conditions in foreign exchange markets, the Desk limited its reserve

supplying actions in the days immediately following the announcement,

and funds traded at rates somewhat above the upper end of the new

range. In recent days, though, Federal funds have traded at rates within

the Committee's new range--mainly within the upper part of the range.

1/ In the week following the discount rate action, member bank borrowing
--which had averaged $1.3 billion in October--fell to $698 million;
in the most recent statement week, borrowing averaged $631 million.

(3) The trade-weighted exchange value of the dollar and the

value of the dollar against key currencies have risen substantially

since the November 1 announcement and, as can be seen in the table below,

the value of the dollar has recovered to its August-September levels

(with the exception of the mark). Operations in foreign exchange

markets on behalf of the Treasury and System accounts since the

November 1 announcement have resulted in net sales of $2.4 billion

of German marks, $350 million of Swiss francs, and $200 million of

Japanese yen.

(4) Private short-term interest rates generally rose

following the October FOMC meeting and then increased further in

response to the System's tightening moves in early November, recording

gains of 1 percentage point or more over the intermeeting period. Rates

have been under less upward pressure in the Treasury bill market, with

the 3-month Treasury bill rate about unchanged on balance over the

period and longer-term bills up 35 to 55 basis points. The



difference in movement between Treasury and private rates appears mainly

to reflect the impact of international financial flows. Foreign official

institutions have made substantial purchases of bills over this

period.1/ At the same time, it seems likely that private capital

outflows have added to upward pressures on private short-term rates.

For example, it appears that a substantial part of the large CD

issuance by U.S. banks has been undertaken to finance both loans

to foreign banks and advances to their own foreign branches.

1/ Since the October FOMC meeting, foreign central bank holdings of
marketable Treasury securities in custody at the Federal Reserve
Bank of New York have increased by about $8 billion, mainly in
the form of Treasury bills, while foreign official holdings of
nonmarketable debt have risen about $3 billion.



(5) The November 1 announcement had a constructive

impact on bond markets. Treasury bond yields dropped rather sub-

stantially immediately after the announcement. They have fluctuated

around these lower levels in subsequent market trading, although the

Treasury has in recent weeks raised $2.7 billion in new cash through

1/
coupon issues.- Municipal yields have also declined, though by

less than Treasury yields, while corporate bond rates have stabilized.

(6) Although bond yields have declined or shown little

change since the beginning of the month, mortgage yields have risen.

By mid-November the average yield on new mortgage loan commitments at

savings and loan associations had moved to over 10 per cent, despite

constraints imposed by usury ceilings in some States. The increase in

yields reflects both the recent slowing of thrift deposit inflows and

the continued strong demands for credit. Savings and loan associations

increased outstanding mortgage commitments again in September, and

growth in their mortgage holdings is estimated to have increased

somewhat in October.

(7) The table on the next page shows percentage annual

rates of change in related monetary and financial flows over various

time periods.

1/ The bulk of this new money was raised in the mid-November quarterly
refunding in which the Treasury auctioned $2.5 billion of 3½-year
notes, $2.5 billion of 10-year notes, and $1.75 billion of 30-year
bonds. Record yields were set in the auction for each issue, but

all issues are now trading at substantial premia.

Prospective developments

(8) Two alternative specifications for the monetary

aggregates and the Federal funds rate for the November-December period

are shown below for Committee consideration. Both are believed con-

sistent with the longer-run growth ranges adopted by the Committee

last month for the QIII '78 to QIII '79 policy period. Alternative A

calls for no near-term change in the Federal funds rate, while

Alternative B increases policy restraint in coming weeks. (More detailed

and longer-term data are contained in the tables on pp. 8 and 9).

Addendum:

Federal funds rate

(9) Alternative A contemplates a Federal funds rate

between now and the next meeting centered in the prevailing 9½ to 9¾

per cent range. Growth in M-1 over the November-December period is

expected to be in a 1 to 6 per cent annual rate range--assuming that

transfers to savings deposits because of ATS will reduce M-1 growth

over these two months by 3 to 5 percentage points. Some acceleration

in M-1 growth is anticipated in December. The relatively slow growth

of October-November in part represented the public's adjustment to

the very rapid expansion in money that occurred in September. In

December, we expect the relatively strong underlying demand for money

1/ The staff has assumed that over the longer-run policy period from QIII '78 to QIII '79
M-1 growth will be reduced 3 percentage points by ATS. In projecting GNP, monetary
aggregates, and interest rates the staff has carried forward the assumption in most recent
Bluebooks that M-l, in the absence of ATS, would increase at a 6k per cent annual rate over
the longer-run. Thus, the observed growth of M-I is expected to be 3% per cent over the
QIII '78 to QIII '79 period.

to reassert itself. Over the fourth quarter as a whole, M-1 growth

is expected to be 6¼ per cent on the assumption that ATS effects

reduce growth by 1 percentage point for the period.

(10) The specifications in the table on page 7 also show

the supplementary aggregate M-1+, should the Committee wish to provide

additional quantitative guidance to the Desk during a period when

measured M-1 growth will be reduced to an uncertain extent by ATS.

Over the two-month policy period, this supplementary aggregate is

expected to increase in a 2 to 6 per cent annual rate range--the

midpoint of which is below the 6 per cent average annual rate of

growth of this aggregate since mid-year.

(11) Expansion of M-2 under alternative A is likely to be

in a 6½ to 10½ per cent annual rate range over the November-December

period. The interest-bearing component of this aggregate will be

buoyed by shifts from demand to ATS savings accounts, as well as

by some expected shifts of funds from thrift accounts and other

nonbank sources as the public attempts to meet minimum balance require-

ments on the new transactions accounts. The total of other interest-

bearing deposits in M-2 is expected to moderate slightly from the third

quarter pace, despite the recent higher level of market rates of

interest. Issuance of 6-month money market time deposits (MMTDs)

and large-denomination certificates is expected to offset a further

contraction of nontransferable savings accounts and fixed ceiling

rate time deposits. Banks are likely to continue offering MMTDs

and large-denomination time deposits aggressively in order to finance



-11-

their lending. MMTDs are particularly attractive to large banks

since their effective cost is currently below that on large-

denomination CD's by about 1 percentage point.

(12) The staff has reduced somewhat its projection of

thrift flows for the current quarter in view of their recent slowing

as well as the higher than previously assumed level of market rates.

There may be some continuing tendency for thrifts to reduce promotion

of MMTDs or to cease offering ceiling rates on such certificates, but

by and large the institutions are expected to be under competitive

pressure to continue offering ceiling rates, particularly after

December 1 when outstanding MMTDs begin to mature. Furthermore, the

FHLBB has made it known to S&Ls that advances will not be liberally

available to institutions that do not make reasonable efforts to roll

over maturing 6-month certificates.

(13) If the Federal funds rate remains around the 9½ to 9¾

per cent level over the intermeeting period, as envisioned under

alternative A, short-term market rates may show mixed changes.

Private short-term credit demands are expected to remain relatively

strong in coming weeks. Nonetheless, the relatively wide spread between

rates on private short-term instruments and the Federal funds rate

may tend to narrow as it becomes clear that the System is not tightening

its policy stance further. The Treasury is expected to offer a

sizable volume of cash management bills in early December and to

continue to put more emphasis on 3-month bills in its weekly bill

offering. Thus, rates on shorter-term Treasury bills may tend to



-12-

move up somewhat from current relatively low levels, unless foreign

central bank acquisitions of these instruments once again become

sizable. With regard to longer-term markets, the expected issuance

of foreign-currency denominated securities will likely reduce the

volume of debt issued in the U.S. market over the next few months.

With a modest calendar of corporate and tax-exempt issues also in

prospect, bond yields are unlikely to rise from current levels and

may even decline. Mortgage rates, on the other hand, can be expected

to move higher as demands for loans continue strong at a time when

the thrift inflows are expected to slow.

(14) Under alternative B, the Federal funds rate would

rise by mid-December to the midpoint of a 9¾ to 10½ per cent range.

M-1 growth would likely be in a ½ to 5½ per cent annual rate range

over November-December, and M-1+ and M-2, respectively in 1½ to 5½

and 6 to 10 per cent ranges. The further increases in short-term

rates would slow M-2 and M-3 growth only modestly, as more aggressive

offerings of 6-month certificates and large-denomination time

deposits could be expected partly to offset weakness in other deposits.

(15) A further increase in the funds rate against a

backdrop of recent slow growth in the aggregates would add support to

the view that the Federal Reserve is committed to an aggressive

policy to counter inflation and support the dollar. In reaction,

short-term interest rates would likely adjust promptly to the



-13-

higher funds rate. However, the impact on bond yields is less clear.

Although capital and money market yields generally tend to move

together, they might not in this case if the inflation anticipations

of market participants are lowered by this action. The dollar would

also be expected to improve somewhat further in exchange markets.

(16) Appendix I shows the expected Federal funds rate

ranges over the QIII '78 to QIII '79 policy period. In view of the

monetary restraint already in train, the midpoint of the alternative

A path would call for no further increase in the funds rate over this

period. The alternative B pattern contemplates that the increase

in the funds rate in the intermeeting period would be maintained

through the first quarter of 1979. This additional restraint on

monetary expansion implies that the funds rate could be lower than

the alternative A path by next summer while still achieving the

same growth in the aggregates over the QIII '78 to QIII '79 period.



-14-

Directive language

(18) Given below are suggested operational paragraphs

for the directive. The language added last month "giving due

regard . . . to uncertainties associated with the introduction of

ATS" has been retained. The form of the first paragraph below

is similar to the directive adopted at the last meeting, while

additional alternative language is provided for placing main

emphasis either on monetary aggregates or on money market conditions

should the Committee wish to return to a formulation similar to that

used for some time before the October meeting. Should the Committee

wish to employ M-1+ as a guide for operations, appropriate language

is shown in brackets. The specifications adopted at the September

meeting are shown in strike-through form.

In the short run, the Committee seeks to achieve bank

reserve and money market conditions that are broadly consistent

with the longer-run ranges for monetary aggregates cited above,

while giving due regard to developing conditions in domestic

and international financial markets/more generally and to

uncertainties associated with the introduction of ATS. Early

in the period before the next regular meeting, System open

market operations are to be directed at attaining a weekly

average Federal funds rate

(A) AT ABOUT THE CURRENT LEVEL.
(B) slightly above the current level.

Subsequently, operations shall be directed at maintaining the

weekly average Federal funds rate within the range of [DEL: 9¼ to



-15-

9¾] ____ TO ____ per cent. In deciding on the specific

objective for the Federal funds rate, the Manager is to be

guided mainly by a range of tolerance for the annual rate of

growth [DEL: in M-2] over the [DEL: October-November] NOVEMBER-DECEMBER

period of [____ TO ____ PER CENT IN M-1+ AND] [DEL: 5½ to 9½]

NOTE: Government security dealer trading positions are on a commitment basis. Trading positions, which exclude Treasury securities financed by
repurchase agreements maturing in 16 days or more, are indicators of dealer holdings available for sale over the near-term. Underwriting syndicate
positions consist of issues still in syndicate, excluding trading positions. The basic reserve deficit is excess reserves less borrowing at Federal
Reserve less net Federal funds purchases. Weekly data are daily averages for statement weeks, except for corporate and municipal issues in syndicate
which are Friday figures.

* Strictly confidential.
** Monthly averages for excess reserves and borrowings are weighted averages of statement week figures.

tively, following the end of the statement week. Column 14 is an average of contract interest rates on commitments for conventional first mortgages with 80
per cent loan-to-value ratios made by a sample of insured savings and loan associations on the Friday following the end of the statement week. Column 15 gives
FNHA auction data for Monday preceding the end of the statement week. Column 16 is a 1-day quote for Monday preceding the end of the statement week. The FNMA
auction yield is the average yield in hi-weekly auction for short-term forward commitments for Government underwritten mortgages. GNMA yields are average net
yields to investors on mortgage-backed securities for immediate delivery, assuming prepayment in 12 years on pools of 30-year FHA/VA mortgages carrying the
coupon rate 50 basis points below the current FHA/VA ceiling.
