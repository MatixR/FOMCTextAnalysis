Prefatory Note 

 
 

The attached document represents the most complete and accurate version 
available based on original copies culled from the files of the FOMC Secretariat at the 
Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System.  This electronic document was 
created through a comprehensive digitization process which included identifying the best-
preserved paper copies, scanning those copies,1 and then making the scanned versions 
text-searchable.2  Though a stringent quality assurance process was employed, some 
imperfections may remain. 
 

Please note that this document may contain occasional gaps in the text.  These 
gaps are the result of a redaction process that removed information obtained on a 
confidential basis.  All redacted passages are exempt from disclosure under applicable 
provisions of the Freedom of Information Act.    

 

                                                 
1 In some cases, original copies needed to be photocopied before being scanned into electronic format.  All 
scanned images were deskewed (to remove the effects of printer- and scanner-introduced tilting) and lightly 
cleaned (to remove dark spots caused by staple holes, hole punches, and other blemishes caused after initial 
printing). 
2 A two-step process was used.  An advanced optimal character recognition computer program (OCR) first 
created electronic text from the document image.  Where the OCR results were inconclusive, staff checked 
and corrected the text as necessary.   Please note that the numbers and text in charts and tables were not 
reliably recognized by the OCR process and were not checked or corrected by staff.

CLASS I - FOMC December 17, 1982

MONETARY POLICY ALTERNATIVES

Recent developments

(1) Following an 8-1/4 percent annual rate of expansion in

October, M2 growth accelerated to near an 11-3/4 percent rate in November.

However, M2 expansion slowed considerably in late November and the first

half of December, so far as can be judged from available data, as growth

in its nontransactions component was weaker than anticipated. This

slowing brought M2 growth into line with, indeed a bit below, the path

for this aggregate consistent with the FOMC's 9-1/2 percent growth rate

objective for the September-to-December period.

(2) While growth in the total of nontransaction accounts seems

to have slowed in recent weeks, expansion of savings deposits remained

generally strong. This has been accompanied by strength in NOW accounts

(and also demand deposits), suggesting that the public has been positioning

itself in anticipation of the availability of new deposit accounts in mid-

December and early January. Such positioning would appear to have con-

tributed to a greater than expected expansion of M1 in late November and

the first part of December, with November growth at almost a 17 percent

annual rate and December possibly also double digit (currently estimated

at around an 11 percent rate.)

(3) Given the level of M2 now estimated for the fourth quarter,

growth over the QIV '81 to QIV '82 period is likely to run about 9-3/4

percent, compared to the 6 to 9 percent range set by the Committee. This

growth, which is a little higher than registered in 1981, implies a 5-1/2

percent drop in M2 velocity over the year, the largest four-quarter decline

in the postwar period. As for M1, growth from QIV '81 to QIV '82 will

probably be about 8-1/2 percent, well above the Committee's longer-run

range of 2-1/2 to 5-1/2 percent. The income velocity of M1 declined by

4-1/2 percent over the year, also a postwar record.

(4) Bank credit growth weakened further in November, when out-

standing business loans (and also total loans) contracted. With core deposit

flows more than adequate relative to credit demands, banks have let large

CDs run off. This, together with the weakness of institution-only money

funds, has contributed to restraining M3 growth to around a 9-1/4 percent

annual rate in November and to a considerably slower pace in December. For

the year M3 growth would be about 10-1/4 percent, compared to the FOMC's

longer-run range of 6-1/2 to 9-1/2 percent.

(5) Nonborrowed and total reserves expanded at about 15 and 18

percent annual rates respectively in November, reflecting the strength

of transactions balances. However, the monetary base expanded at a

moderate 6-1/2 percent annual rate, as currency growth was unusually slow.

The level of borrowing implied by the intermeeting nonborrowed reserves

path was $250 million initially, but most recently the level of implied

borrowing fell to $230 million in reflection of the slowing of M2 growth

late in the intermeeting period.1/ In the statement week ending December 15,

however, actual adjustment and seasonal borrowing came to $514 million, as

a shortfall in reserves on the last day of the statement week and unusually

strong bank demand for excess reserves led to over $3 billion of borrowing

on Wednesday.

(6) Reflecting two further 1/2 percentage point cuts in the

discount rate to a level of 8-1/2 percent, the federal funds rate has

fallen to the 8-1/2 to 9 percent area in recent days compared to around

9-1/2 percent through the previous intermeeting period. Other short-term

interest rates generally have dropped 35 to 75 basis points on balance

since mid-November. Bond yields, however, are a little higher on balance

over the intermeeting period, reflecting unusually heavy borrowing by

businesses and governments. Yields in primary mortgage markets edged down

further in response to earlier declines in bond rates, and activity in

these markets continued to show signs of reviving.

(7) The weighted-average value of the dollar has depreciated

by 4 percent since the November FOMC meeting, mainly in association with

heightened market awareness of the growing U.S. trade and current account

deficits. Bilateral dollar exchange rates have shown divergent movements,

with the yen strengthening more than the mark against the dollar, while the

pound weakened.

Prospective developments

(8) The specification of policy alternatives for the Committee

over the period immediately ahead is complicated by the uncertainties

surrounding the behavior of the monetary aggregates in the transition period

to the new deposit instruments authorized by the DIDC. Uncertainties

appear greatest with respect to M1. The behavior of M1 over the next

three months, and over the year, will depend considerably on how depository

institutions price and advertise the new accounts, as well as on how the

public's management of cash balances is influenced by interest rates and

convenience factors in managing one or several accounts. At one extreme,

super-NOW accounts, available beginning January 5, could receive the great

bulk of shifting funds, causing M1 to rise sharply. At the other extreme,

money market deposit accounts (MMDAs), available since December 14, could

dominate, retarding M1 growth sharply. We have tentatively assumed that,

on balance flows into super-NOWs from non-M1 sources will tend to be

greater than flows out of M1 into MMDAs, with an upward impact on M1 growth

over the first three months. However, there is also a distinct possibility

that the net flows of funds will work to depress M1 growth.1/

(9) Uncertainties surrounding M2 may be less than M1 because

much of the shifting of funds in response to the availability of the new

accounts will represent a redistribution of funds among the component assets

of M2. However, M2 is by no means free of uncertainties in the transition

because of the unknown degree to which funds will shift out of market

instruments into the newly authorized deposits. We have assumed that such

shifts in the first quarter (when much of the adjustment to the new accounts

aggregates over the first three months of 1983 and for the year as
a whole are given in Appendix III.



may take place) will increase M2 growth on the order of 3 percentage points

at an annual rate and that the impact for the year may be on the order

of 1-1/2 percentage points--with relatively wide margins of error around

those estimates. M3 growth would probably be less affected than M2 by

shifts, as banks tend to reduce issuance of large CDs in response to the

availability of additional funds through MMDAs and super-NOWs.

(10) Alternative specifications for policy in the first quarter

are based on an underlying growth of M2 (abstracting from shifts) consistent

with the FOMC's tentative 6 to 9 percent range for 1983. However, all of

the alternatives, as shown in the table below, involve actual M2 growth

above the longer-run range in the first three months of the year, assuming

that shifts into M2 develop in the dimension noted in the previous paragraph.

M2 should move closer to, or perhaps within, its tentative longer-run range

as the year progresses, as shifts abate and the underlying demand for

liquidity remains below last year's exceptional pace relative to GNP.

(More detailed data for the alternatives are shown in the table and charts

on the next few pages. The quarterly interest rate path consistent with

the staff's GNP projection is contained in Appendix II.)

1/ For purposes of constructing this tablewe have assumed that growth of M1 will be boosted by 3 per-
centage points at an annual rate in the December to March period as a result of shifts related to the
new money market accounts. As discussed in Appendix III, the staff believes that the actual shifts
could have an effect on M1 growth of from -4 to +10 percentage points at an annual rate over this period.

-8-

would represent a substantial slowing from 1982's pace in underlying

M2 expansion (abstracting from the impact of shifts associated with the

new accounts). Such a slowing would appear to be consistent with little

change in short-term interest rates from current levels despite an expected

acceleration in the rate of growth of nominal GNP. M2 balances grew

unusually rapidly relative to GNP in 1982, and we would anticipate an abate-

ment of such liquidity demands in the course of 1983 as economic activity

begins to rise and consumer and business confidence is restored.

(12) It would appear that alternative B would be consistent

with a federal funds rate around the current 8-1/2 percent discount rate,

or edging down further, and other market interest rates generally little

changed. The 3-month Treasury bill rate may continue in a 7-1/2 to 8 per-

cent range, with private rates running about 1/2 to 3/4 of a percentage

point higher; however, a failure of the economy to show generalized signs

of a revival in aggregate demand--as the market might infer from weak

retail sales and similar incoming data for December, should that develop--

could well lead to anticipatory rate declines. The prime loan rate could

drop somewhat from its current 11-1/2 percent level, given its spread

over prevailing open market rates. Mortgage rates might come under some

further downward pressure if inflows into the new accounts at thrifts

induce these institutions to step up their new commitment activity.

(13) The growth of credit to domestic nonfinancial sectors is

likely to moderate a little over coming months, although continuing to

outpace the increase in GNP. The slowing in credit expansion is expected

to be concentrated in the state and local sector, where borrowers have

advanced their offerings in anticipation of registration requirements

after year-end. Consumer installment loan growth also may slow, reflecting



-9-

the shift in auto purchases to the current quarter to take advantage of con-

cessionary loan rates. Treasury borrowing is expected to remain close to

the rapid fourth-quarter pace in order to finance the massive federal

deficit. In mortgage markets, lending should continue to recover, stimu-

lated by the declines in interest rates since mid-year. Overall business

financing needs may be a little higher in the first quarter than in the

fourth. With bond rates expected to stay close to current levels, business

borrowing in long-term markets should remain quite strong, as corporations

continue to attempt to strengthen balance sheet structures; bank business

loans probably will continue to be fairly weak.

(14) Total reserve growth at about a 6-1/2 percent annual rate

over the December '82 to March '83 period would probably be consistent with

the M2 and M3 specifications of alternative B. The relation of reserves

to M2 is more uncertain than usual, however, because of the wide range

of possible shifts of funds into or out of deposit accounts included in M1,

which bear sizable reserve requirements. If more funds than expected move

into super-NOW accounts, a larger growth in total reserves would be con-

sistent with any given growth of M2-and vice versa if more funds than

anticipated move out of M1 into MMDAs. For purposes of an initial estimate

of total reserves, we have assumed M1 growth from December to March at

about an 8 percent rate on the assumption, noted earlier, that shifts into

super-NOWs dominate shifts from Ml into MMDAs. We would anticipate non-

borrowed reserve growth under alternative B at about 8 percent over the

next three months, assuming borrowing from the discount window in the

neighborhood of $250 million.



-10-

(15) Alternative A calls for a more rapid expansion in aggregates

during the first quarter of the year. It would accommodate a rise in M2

at about a 12 percent annual rate (including assumed shifts). Such an

approach may make it a bit more difficult than under alternative B to

keep M2 growth over the year as a whole within its longer-run target range.

Since alternative A would probably be associated with a drop in short-term

rates over the near-term--typified by federal funds falling to around

7-1/2 percent and a 3-month Treasury bill to around 6-3/4--it is possible

that a fairly substantial reversal of interest rates as the year 1983

progresses may be required under this alternative to restrain M2 growth

to its longer-term range (assuming that economic activity improved in the

course of the year).

(16) Total reserves might increase at a 9-1/2 percent annual

rate over the first three months of the year under alternative A and

nonborrowed reserves at a 12-1/2 percent annual rate, assuming adjustment

borrowing of around $100 million or so. The discount rate would come under

further downward pressure. The further easing in short-term markets con-

templated by this alternative may be associated with additional declines in

longer-term rates, particularly if signs of economic recovery remained

weak or scattered and if a revival of upward price and wage pressures was

not apparent. On the other hand, signs of an easing in reserve availability,

particularly against a backdrop of continued relatively rapid money growth,

might intensify inflationary concerns, exerting upward pressure on bond

yields.

(17) Alternative C involves slower growth in the monetary

aggregates than alternatives A or B, with M2 growth specified at 10 percent



-11-

over the first quarter. This would probably require restraining total

reserve growth to about a 4 percent annual rate, and nonborrowed reserve

growth by even more to a one percent rate. Borrowing would probably be

around $700 million.

(18) Under those conditions, the federal funds rate might be

expected to rise to a level about a percentage point over the present

discount rate. With funds around 9-1/2 percent, or possibly a bit higher,

the 3-month bill rate could move up to the 8-1/2 to 9 percent area, and

private short-term rates of similar maturity to the 9 to 10 percent range.

Bond rates are likely to increase in sympathy, though their rise would be

moderated by substantial postponements of corporate and state and local

issues. Further declines in the exchange value of the dollar may be

moderated, at least in the short run, under this alternative. It is possible,

that the increase in short- and also long-term rates would not be sustainable

over a long period, however. The greater borrowing costs for businesses and

in the mortgage market, in conjunction with possible adverse effects on

business and consumer psychology from a turn-about in credit conditions

while confidence was still fragile, could damp economic activity and private

credit demand significantly.

Directive language

(19) Given below are suggested operational paragraphs for the

directive, with proposed deletions of language adopted on November 16 shown

in strike-through form. The suggested language (with bracketed options)

makes an effort to provide sufficient operating flexibility in light

of the considerable uncertainties about deposit shifts in the period

immediately ahead, while still retaining a directive structure keyed to

monetary aggregates.

Specification of the behavior of M1 over the [DEL: balance of the

year] MONTHS AHEAD remains subject to substantial uncertainty because

of special circumstances in connection with [DEL: the reinvestment of funds

from maturing all savers cerfiticates and] the public's response to

the new [DEL: account] DEPOSIT ACCOUNTS AVAILABLE AT DEPOSITORY INSTITUTIONS

[DEL: directly competitive with money market funds mandated by recent

legislation]. The difficulties in interpretation of M1 continue to

suggest that much less than usual weight be placed on movements

in that aggregate during the [DEL: current] COMING quarter. THE INSTITUTIONAL

CHANGES ALSO ADD A DEGREE OF UNCERTAINTY TO THE BEHAVIOR OF THE

BROADER MONETARY AGGREGATES.

In all the circumstances, the Committee seeks to maintain

expansion in bank reserves [DEL: needed for an orderly and sustained flow

of-money-and-credit,] consistent with growth of M2 [DEL:(and M3)] of around

[DEL: 9-1/2] ____ percent at an annual rate, AND OF M3 AT ABOUT A ____ PERCENT

RATE, from [DEL: September to] December TO MARCH. [DEL: Somewhat-slower-growth

bringing those aggregatres around the upper part of the ranges set

for the year, would be acceptable and desirable in a context



-13-

of-declining interest rates. Should economic and financial

uncertainties-lead-to-exceptional liquidity-demands, somewhat

more rapid growth int he broader aggregated would be tolerated.]

THESE SPECIFICATIONS TAKE INTO ACCOUNT THE LIKELIHOOD THAT GROWTH

IN THE BROADER AGGREGATES, AND PARTICULARLY M2, WILL BE TEMPORARILY

AUGMENTED BY [AROUND ____ PERCENTAGE POINTS AT AN ANNUAL RATE BY]

INFLOWS INTO THE NEW MONEY MARKET ACCOUNTS FROM SOURCES OUTSIDE

OF THAT AGGREGATE. IN THIS CONTEXT, THE COMMITTEE INDICATED THAT

VARIATIONS AROUND THE SPECIFIED GROWTH RATES WOULD BE ACCEPTABLE

IN LIGHT OF INCOMING INFORMATION RELATED TO THE IMPACT OF THE NEW

ACCOUNTS [AND TO UNDERLYING DEMANDS FOR LIQUIDITY]. The Chairman

may call for Committee consultation if it appears to the Manager

for Domestic Operations that pursuit of the monetary objectives

and related reserve paths during the period before the next meet-

ing is likely to be associated with a federal funds rate persistently

outside a range of [DEL: 6-to 10] ____ TO ____ percent.

(20) The preceding language is designed to accommodate a relatively

high number for M2 growth so as to encompass a sizable expected shift into M2

as a result of the new accounts. If the Committee wished to specify a lower

number for M2 growth, and did not wish to refer specifically to a "shift

adjusted" growth rate, the following language might be considered for the

second of the two operational paragraphs.



-14-

In all the circumstances, the Committee seeks to maintain

expansion in bank reserves [DEL: needed for an orderly and sustainted flow

of money and credit,] consistent with growth of M2 [DEL: (and-M3)] of around

[DEL: 9-1/2] ____ percent at an annual rate, AND OF M3 AT ABOUT A ____ PERCENT

RATE, from [DEL: September to] December TO MARCH. [DEL: Somewhat-slower-growth

bringing these-aggregates around the upper part of the ranges set

for the year, would be acceptable and desirable in a context of

delcining interest rates. Should economic and financial uncertainties

lead to exceptional liquidity demands;somewhat more rapid growth in

the broader aggregates would be tolerated.] THE COMMITTEE INDICATED

THAT GREATER GROWTH WOULD BE ACCEPTABLE IF THERE WERE EVIDENCE OF

SUBSTANTIAL SHIFTS OF FUNDS INTO BROADER AGGREGATES BECAUSE OF THE

NEW MONEY MARKET ACCOUNTS [OR SIGNS OF EXCEPTIONAL LIQUIDITY DEMANDS].

The Chairman may call for Committee consultation if it appears to the

Manager for Domestic Operations that pursuit of the monetary objectives

and related reserve paths during the period before the next meeting is

likely to be associated with a federal funds rate persistently outside

a range of [DEL: 6-to-10] ____ TO ____ percent.

APPENDIX III

EFFECTS OF THE MONEY MARKET DEPOSIT ACCOUNT
AND SUPER-NOW ACCOUNT ON GROWTH OF

THE MONETARY AGGREGATES

Growth of the monetary aggregates may be affected considerably in

1983 by the process of deposit rate deregulation. Commercial banks and

thrift institutions already are issuing the new money market deposit

account (MMDA) and can begin offering the Super NOW account on January

5, 1983.1 The impact of these two innovations on the various monetary

aggregates is potentially sizable and difficult to predict. There is a

large pool of liquid assets that could be shifted, perhaps in a short

period of time. The allocation of funds among various instruments will

depend, of course, on the price and nonprice features of the accounts

and depositors' responses to these features. In addition, the impor-

tance of the new accounts for the behavior of the monetary aggregates

will be influenced by the level of market rates.

The staff estimates that by the end of 1983, MMDA balances could be

between $170 and $330 billion and Super NOWs could total between $60

and $120 billion. However, most of these balances will reflect shifts

that would be internal to the various aggregates. This appendix focuses

only on shifts in asset holdings that affect the growth of the aggre-

gates, and thus ignores the bulk of the transfers that will occur, such

as shifts from savings to MMDAs.

1. In addition, this coming March, the Depository Institutions
Deregulation Committee (DIDC) will consider authorizing interest-
bearing checking for businesses by modifying the MMDA rules to allow
unlimited transfers for such deposit holders. Moreover, during 1983
the DIDC will review proposals to deregulate interest ceilings on all
deposit accounts.

I. EFFECT ON MI OF THE MMDA AND SUPER NOW

It is unclear at this point whether the combined effect of the new

accounts will be to raise or to lower M1. The MMDA, which presumably

will be in M2 but not M1, will draw funds from demand deposits and other

checkable deposits, while the Super NOW likely will attract nontransac-

tion balances and boost M1 growth.

To estimate the volume of business transaction balances that might

be expected to shift to the MMDA, the staff assumed that this account

would be used as a cash-management device that allows a depositor to more

closely match the timing of deposits and redemptions.1 Staff analysis

concerning business accounts suggest that holders of transaction accounts

with average balances of $12,500 or more could benefit from the MMDA as

a cash-management device, and that such holders could reduce average

transaction balances by perhaps 20 percent.2 Information on the distri-

bution of commercial demand deposit balances by size of account suggests

that about three-fourths of the balances are in accounts of $12,500 or

1. The MMDA also might generally depress M1 since the account allows
checks and other third party transfers and, thus, funds in MMDA would
not have to go through a demand deposit or NOW account to complete a
transaction.
2. The number of deposits to business demand accounts is estimated to
average about nine per month. The MMDA allows for up to six auto-
matic transfers per month. However, some of these transfers likely
would substitute for the nine deposits that would be made in any case,
and, thus, the net increase in the number of deposits would be less
than six. Assuming that expenditures are made at a constant rate and
that the number of deposits is distributed evenly over a month, and if
the MMDA allows a representative business depositor to increase the
average deposits per month by 2 or 3, his transaction balance could be
reduced by about one fifth. A depositor would have to have a trans-
action account with an average balance of $12,500 or more in order for
20 percent of the total to equal the minimum of $2,500 required for
the MMDA.

more.1 Applying this fraction to the projected level of nonhousehold

demand deposits for the fourth quarter of 1983 results in an estimate

$125 billion that would be owned by nonhousehold depositors that might

use MMDAs for cash-management purposes. If the MMDA allowed depositors

to pare their balances by 20 percent, this could mean a $25 billion

reduction in M1. However, since flexible cash-management tools

already exist that these depositors have not chosen to use, the

staff thinks that only a fraction, say 10 percent to 20 percent or $3

to $5 billion, of the $25 billion would actually shift as a result of

the introduction of the MMDA (see top row, table 1).

Similar incentives for using the MMDA exist for household demand

deposit holders. However, with the availability of a Super NOW account,

it is even more unlikely that households would view the MMDA as a cash-

management device. Using the same approach for households as busi-

nesses-but assuming that with the option of the Super NOW only 5

to 10 percent of the household demand balances that could be shifted

actually would shift to MMDAs-it is estimated that no more than $1

to $2 billion would be diverted from household demand deposits

to MMDAs (see second row, table 1).

The MMDA would be a particularly attractive substitute for those

OCD balances held for savings or precautionary motives. Data used to

shift-adjust M1 in 1981 indicate that perhaps one fourth of OCDs were

transfered from non-transaction balances. Assuming that the proportion

of savings to transaction balances is uniform across all OCD accounts,

only those accounts with at least $10,000 would have sufficient savings

balances to meet the minimum required balance on the MMDA. Since assets

could be consolidated to open an MMDA, it is assumed that savings in OCD

accounts of $7,500 or more could shift. We estimate that 70 percent

of OCD balances are in accounts of $7,500; if one fourth of these balances

represent savings, a maximum of $20 billion of OCD balances could shift to

MMDAs. Depending on the difference in rates offered on the Super NOW and

the MMDA, staff judges that one fourth to one half of those deposits, or

$5 to $10 billion, could move out of M1. In addition, perhaps $1 to $2

billion could be shifted from the transaction portion of OCDs, reflecting

the use of the MMDA as a cash-management tool.

M1 would be boosted by depositors combining their transaction bal-

ances and liquid assets in a Super NOW in order to meet minimum balance

requirements and to obtain the convenience of a single high-yielding

account. The liquid assets most likely to be shifted to Super NOWs-

and hence to add to M1 growth--are savings deposits, short-term small-

denomination time deposits, and general purpose and broker dealer money

fund shares. It is estimated that over 80 percent of savings deposit

are in accounts of $2,500 or more.1 Since savings can be combined with

other assets in Super NOs, perhaps as much as 85 to 90 percent the

savings balances, or $300 billion, should be viewed as a potential

source of Super NOWs. However, since most of such balances are presumed

to be held for savings purposes, they are more likely to shift to MMDA's

and hence, the shifts affecting M1 shown in table 1 assume that only

one to five percent of the $300 billion would shift to Super NOWs.2

1. Estimates are based on results from surveys of depository institutions.
2. In the case of conventional NOW accounts, it is estimated that about
three percent of savings shifted to NOWs in 1981.



-6-

Even with the small proportion of savings deposits estimated to shift

to Super NOWs, the large amount of "eligible" savings balances makes

them the largest single source of increase to M1 shown in table 1.

If rates on Super NOWs are close to other short-term rates on aver-

age, time-deposit and money fund share holders would also likely choose

to shift some of their resources to the Super NOW, probably relatively

less than in the case of savings accounts. Consequently, staff assumed

that about one to two percent of short-term small-denomination time

deposits and general purpose and broker dealer money fund shares would

shift to Super NOWs.

II. EFFECT ON M2 OF THE MMDA AND THE SUPER NOW

The uncertainty associated with growth of M2 in 1983 should be

somewhat less than in the case for M1, since much of the shifting of

funds to both the MMDA and the Super NOW is expected to be internal to

M2. Even so, the range for the estimated effect on M2 is still fairly

wide, in part owing to uncertainty concerning the size of the flows from

market and market-type instruments to the new accounts. The MMDA, for

example, could substitute for large CDs or term RPs and Eurodollars

because the new instrument permits depository institutions to offer

market-rate deposits with immediately available funds and time deposits

with maturities as short as one day.1 The projected flows from large

1. Currently, all MMDAs-regardless of the size of account or whether
there is a specific term to maturity-are reported as savings deposits.
It has been proposed that data for MMDAs issued with fixed maturities
of seven days or more and with denominations of $100,000 or more be
collected weekly from large commercial banks, and that such data be used
to estimate MMDAs that are very similar to large CDs. These estimates
could be used to interpret movements in M2 and M3, or to exclude from
M2, but not M3, MMDAs that represent M3-type assets.



-7-

CDs to MMDA in table 2 assume that about one tenth to one fourth of

commercial bank large CDs estimated to have maturities of 14 to 30 days

would shift, but only one to five percent of the other large CDs. The

exact distribution of term Ps and term Eurodollars by maturity is not

known, but it is assumed that no more than one to five percent of the

total balances would shift.1 The staff expects the flows from other

market instruments to be modest compared to total shifts to MMDAs and

Super NOWs, only $5 to $15 billion.

In addition, it is not known to what extent changes in holdings

by money market mutual funds of bank overnight RPs and Eurodollars

(which are netted out of M2) will be offset by changes in the outstand-

ings of those liabilities. If money market funds reduce their holdings

by more (or less) than banks reduced their gross issuance, M2 growth

could be raised (or lowered). As indicated in table 2, it is expected

that the consolidation of overnight RPs and Eurodollars would have

only a minor impact on M2.

III. EFFECT ON M3 OF THE MMDA AND THE SUPER NOW

The introduction of the MMDA and the Super NOW should enhance M3

growth in 1983 to a small degree because the new accounts will likely

attract some funds from non-M3 investments and encourage greater inter-

mediation through the institutions encompassed by the aggregate. However,

because of the consolidation adjustments made to avoid double counting

in the aggregates, M3 could be affected by portfolio adjustments made

1. Staff would expect most of the shifting to be from term RPs and
Eurodollars with maturities of 2 to 14 days, since investors holding
assets with longer maturities already could shift to domestic deposit
if they wished to do so.

by money market funds and depository institutions. For example, if

money fund holdings of large CDs, RPs, and Eurodollars were to decline

by less than the fall in the total issuance of these instruments, M3

growth would tend to be damped, and there is an arithmetic possibility

that, despite flows from market instruments to MMDAs and Super NOWs,

there would be a net reduction in M3 growth in 1983 as a result of the

inter-institutional flows associated with these instruments. This is

shown in table 3 for the estimate of the lower bound impact on M3. In

the third column of the table it is assumed that money market funds

react to the loss of shares by reducing all their assets proportionately,

while gross large CDs, RPs and Eurodollars decline by twice the amount

of the reduction in the money fund holding of those assets. The staff

views this possibility as unlikely, however, and expects that the net

impact on M3 growth will be slightly positive. As an upper end of the

range of possible impacts, the estimates in the fourth column assume

that gross large CDs, RPs and Eurodollars are reduced by only half as

much as the fall in the holdings of these assets at money funds.

IV. SUMMARY: IMPACT ON GROWTH RATES OF M1, M2 and M3

A summary of our estimates of the combined impact of MMDAs and

Super NOWs on the aggregates is presented in table 4. In the upper

panel of the table, the lower bound for the effect on M1 growth for all

of 1983 of minus 2 percentage points was derived by combining the high

shift out of M1 to the MMDA with the low shift to Super NOWs in M1 (see

table 1). The upper estimate for M1, plus 5 percentage points, reflects

a combination of the low flows out of M1 and the high flows into M1.

M2 growth is expected to be increased by 1/2 to 3 percentage points in

1983, and M3 growth will be virtually unchanged to 1 percentage point

higher in 1983.

The NOW account experience in 1981 might suggest that a very

high share of the shifting to MMDAs and Super NOWs could be completed

in a few months. The staff chose a somewhat slower rate of shifting

than estimated for the NOW account experience because of the larger

number of instruments out of which a substantial volume of funds

could shift and because the cost of delaying a decision for many

investors would be low.1 The bottom panel of table 4 shows that

the impacts of the new accounts-and the degree of uncertainty sur-

rounding these impacts-is considerably magnified for the December

1982 to March 1983 period relative to the estimates for the year as

a whole.

1. Specifically, the staff assumed that about half of the year's impact
on M1 growth would occur in the first quarter, and about 40 percent of
the year's impact on M2 and M3 growth.

1/ Represents borrowing in remaining statement weeks (as intermeeting period progresses) implied by
each weekly updating of the 5-week average nonborrowed reserves path. The movement in implied
borrowing represents deviations in total reserves from target as well as any compensation for misses
in nonborrowed reserves from target in earlier weeks of the intermeeting period.
2/ Total and nonborrowed reserves paths adjusted upward by $80 million due to changes affecting the
reserves multiplier.
3/ Total and nonborrowed reserves paths adjusted upward by $53 million due to changes affecting the
reserves multiplier.
4/ Nonborrowed reserves path adjusted downward by $26 million to take account of the increased demand
Tor borrowing in the week of December 1.
5/ Total and nonborrowed reserves paths adjusted upward by $157 million due to changes affecting the
reserves multiplier.
6/ Nonborrowed reserves path adjusted downward by $30 million in light of unanticipated strength in bor-
rowings in earlier weeks of the intermeeting period and disparate behavior in the monetary aggregates.

7/ Total and nonborrowed reserves paths adjusted upward by $75 billion due to changes affecting the
reserves multiplier.
8/ Nonborrowed reserves path adjusted downward by $49 million in light of unanticipated strength in bor-
rowings in earlier weeks of the intermeeting period and disparate behavior in the monetary aggregates.
