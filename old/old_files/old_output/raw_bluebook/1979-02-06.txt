Recent developments

(1) M-1 is estimated to have declined at a 5 per cent annual

rate in January, and at a 1½ per cent annual rate over the December-

January period, considerably below the range specified by the FOMC

at its December meeting,1/ as demand deposits have weakened much

more than anticipated. Over the two months, shifting of funds from

demand deposits into Automatic Transfer Service (ATS) savings

accounts and NOW accounts in New York State reduced M-1 growth by

about 3 percentage points. In addition to the impact of ATS and

NOW's, and the usual lagged effect of higher interest rates, demand

deposits may be declining as a result of greatly increased public

awareness of options for holding precautionary and transactions

balances in various interest-bearing forms in the wake of recent

2/
publicity associated with ATS and similar accounts.

1/ These figures do not incorporate the benchmark revisions based on
recently available June 1978 Call Report data for nonmember banks;
the revised aggregates will be published on February 8. As
shown in Appendix III, the benchmark revision was negligible
for M-1; however, the benchmark revision increased M-2 growth
by 0.5 per cent, with most of the increase occurring in the
second half of the year. The revision in the aggregates for the

June benchmark will also incorporate revised seasonal factors.
All tables on subsequent pages of the Bluebook (with the excep-
tion of the first two tables following the appendices) are based on

the revised series.

2/ In December and January, for example, money market funds--both

open- and closed-end--increased by about $2.5 billion per month

on average, following average increases of about $950 million a

month in the preceding two months.

(2) M-2 is estimated to have shown virtually no growth over

December and January, and it, too, was much weaker than the low end of

the range set by the FOMC in December. Growth in the interest-bearing

component of M-2 slowed over the past two months, with outstanding

deposits subject to fixed rate ceilings actually declining in continuing

adjustment to higher market rates. Net inflows of deposits to

savings and loan associations in December-January were only a shade

below the October-November pace, as these institutions continued

aggressively to offer money market certificates (MMC's). Deposit

inflows to mutual savings banks were at a considerably reduced pace

over the past two months.

(3) With the total inflows of funds to deposit accounts

subject to interest rate ceilings remaining weak in December and

January, banks issued additional large time deposits--some of which are

included in M-2--and probably increased their RP's with nonbank



investors. Growth in bank credit slowed to only a 1 per cent annual

rate in December, following rapid expansion in the two preceding

months, but partial data for large banks suggest that growth in bank

credit has picked up in January.

(4) Following the December FOMC meeting, the Account Manage-

ment immediately raised its Federal funds rate objective from 9-7/8

per cent to 10 per cent or a bit higher. Funds generally traded at

rates significantly above this level in the latter part of December

and early January, however, as the Desk encountered difficulties in

supplying reserves because of a shortage of readily available

collateral. On December 29 and on January 12, the FOMC decided

that, despite the relatively weak growth of the aggregates,

the Desk should continue to seek a funds rate of 10 per cent or a

bit higher, and the funds rate has remained around this level since

early January.

(5) With the funds rate of about 10 per cent, reserves of

the banking system changed little on balance over the December-January

period. Nonborrowed reserves contracted at about a 1½ per cent annual

rate, and total reserves increased at a 2¾ per cent rate; over the first

three quarters of 1978, when deposit growth had been strong, these aggre-

gates had grown at 7 to 8 per cent annual rates. Member bank

borrowings rose from $700 million in November to about $1 billion

in January, as the spread of the funds rate over the discount rate

widened slightly. With growth of currency remaining strong, the

monetary base continued to rise about a 9 per cent annual rate



over the past two months on average, but the rate of growth diminished

in January.

(6) After coming under renewed selling pressure in the

last half of December, the foreign exchange value of the dollar

steadied in early January, and has risen considerably in recent days.

In early February, the weighted average dollar exchange rate was

about 8 per cent above its late October level and more than 2 per cent

above its level at the time of the December FOMC meeting.

. Toward the end of the

period, the United States purchased $2 billion equivalent of foreign

currencies, net, virtually all of which was used to repay swap debt.

(7) While interest rates rose somewhat further in the

weeks immediately following the December FOMC meeting, these increases

have been generally more than offset by declines in January. Interest

rates on short-term private obligations, in particular, have fallen

considerably on balance since the December meeting--generally about

40 to 50 basis points.1/ Mortgage yields have edged up slightly,

1/ The largest declines in short-term yields were those on CD's

which, despite large offerings of these instruments, fell 60 basis

points in the primary market since the December FOMC meeting. CD

rates had increased sharply just before the meeting and the recent

declines bring them into more characteristic alignment with other
short-term rates. With their costs of funds falling, two large

banks have lowered their prime lending rate 1/4 of a point to 11.50

per cent.



but bond yields have dropped 10 to 20 basis points. The decline

in market interest rates reflected market perceptions of a

reduced likelihood of a further tightening of monetary policy in

light of the recent performance of the dollar in exchange markets,

the slow growth of the monetary aggregates, and the recent modest

growth of total business credit demands. An exception to the general

pattern of declining market rates has been the behavior of yields

on short-dated (3 months or less) Treasury bills, which have changed

little on balance since the December meeting. These yields did not

decline in association with falling private rates owing to large

Federal Reserve sales of bills, the continuation of larger Treasury

auctions of 3-month bills since November, and, after mid-January, a

shift by foreign official institutions from purchases to sales of

bills.

Prospective developments: long-run

(9) Alternative longer-run growth ranges for the monetary

aggregates and bank credit over the one-year QIV '78 to QIV '79

period are shown in the table below for Committee consideration.

Alt. A Alt. B Alt. C Current Range

M-1 2½ to 5½ 1½ to 4½ ½ to 3½ 2 to 6

M-2 5 to 7½ 4½ to 7 4 to 6½ 6½ to 9

M-3 6½ to 9 6 to 8½ 5½ to 8 7½ to 10

Bank Credit 8 to 11 7½ to 10½ 7 to 10 8½ to 11½

(10) Alternative B is based on the FOMC's current

expectation that M-1 growth over the QIII '78 to QIII '79 period

would be around the upper limit of a 4 to 6½ per cent range in the

absence of new transactions accounts, such as ATS. At its October

meeting, the Committee expected that M-1 growth over the longer-run

would be in a 2 to 6 per cent range, which allows for a potential

downward effect on M-1 from ATS of 1/2 to 4-1/2 percentage points.

On the basis of experience gained with ATS and NOW accounts in

New York since that time, the staff believes that it is now rea-

sonable to assume that growth in such accounts will reduce M-1

growth over the QIV'78 to QIV '79 period from what it other-
1/

wise would have been by 3 to 3-1/2 percentage points. Given

that assumption, alternative B proposes a 1-1/2 to 4-1/2 per cent

range for M-1; this range assumes--unlike recent M-1 ranges--that

the more likely growth of M-1 is at the mid-point rather than near

1/ Including a small allowance for introduction of POA accounts
at S&L's this spring.



the upper end.1/ The range is narrower than that adopted in October

but remains a little wider than earlier M-1 ranges to reflect some

continued uncertainty about ATS effects. Alternatives A and C are

more and less expansive, respectively. Proposed ranges for the

broader aggregates have been lowered, for reasons discussed in

paragraphs (13) and (14) below.

(11) Expansion of nominal GNP over the longer-run policy

period, while projected to moderate, is still expected to be around

10 per cent, and M-1 growth is likely to resume as the public brings

its cash balances back into line with growing transactions needs.

However, the staff expects that the demand for M-1 will not be so

strong over the year, on average, as to require a significant change

in the prevailing Federal funds rate if M-1 growth at the midpoint of

the alternative B range is to be achieved over the year 1979. With

nominal GNP projected to expand more rapidly in the first half of

1979 than in the second, short-term rates could edge higher over the

next few months and then recede later in the year. Alternative C, on the

other hand, would probably involve an increase in the funds rate from

current levels to nearly 11 per cent in the course of the year. By contrast,

alternative A would imply a reduction in the funds rate, reaching

year-end levels about ¾ of a percentage point below the current level.

The staff projection of the quarterly pattern of the funds rate for

each alternative is shown in Appendix I.

1/ A return to this more usual interpretation of the M-1 range may be
a desirable simplification as reporting under the Humphrey-Hawkins
Act is initiated. The 3 per cent midpoint of this range,plus allowance
for a 3 to 3½ per cent effect on M-1 from ATS and similar accounts,
yields the 6¼ per cent rate of growth that has been the FOMC's
basic assumption.



(12) The specifications imply further rapid increase

in the velocity of M-1, even abstracting from ATS effects, as shown in

Appendix II. The recent weakness in M-1 at a time of strong economic

growth is considerably larger than can be explained by standard

econometric specifications of the relationship between interest rates

and money demand and by the shift of demand balances to ATS and NOW

accounts. The shortfall in money demand apparently reflects a

wider adoption and more intensive use of techniques to economize

on cash, induced in part by the sustained high interest rate levels,

and the staff has assumed that a downward shift in money demand is

likely to continue over 1979. The shift is projected to reduce M-1

growth (and thus increase V-l) by about 2 percentage points over

the longer-run policy period.

(13) Under alternative B, M-2 growth for the year ahead

is expected to be in a 4½ to 7 per cent range and M-3 growth in a

6 to 8½ per cent range, 2½ percentage points lower, respectively,

than their current longer-run ranges for the QIII '78 to QIII '79

period. This reduction reflects the slower rate of growth in the

time and savings deposit component of these two aggregates that

is now expected on average over the course of the year, given recent

experience. The public has been diverting larger amounts of funds

than expected from deposits subject to fixed ceiling rates to market

instruments. Our projections assume a pick-up in growth of such

deposits, but not to the pace earlier expected. Growth of the



-10-

broader monetary aggregates is, of course, slower under alternative C

and more rapid under alternative A.

(14) The range for bank credit growth for alternative B

has been reduced to 7½ to 10 per cent--1 percentage point lower than

its current range, reflecting the slowing of economic activity, the

sustained higher level of interest rates, and the cumulative

reduction in bank liquidity. To sustain such credit growth in the

face of slower inflows of demand and consumer-type time and savings

deposits, banks would have to rely increasingly on large negotiable

time deposits, nondeposit borrowings, including Eurodollars, and to

reduce further their holdings of liquid assets. Thrifts are also

likely to have to rely on FHLB and other borrowings, as well as

reductions in their liquidity position, to fund their mortgage lending.

Prospective developments: short-run

(15) Three alternative short-run specifications for the

monetary aggregates and the Federal funds rate are presented below

for Committee consideration. Alternative I calls for a reduction

in the Federal funds rate by ½ percentage point from the current

level; such a decline over the intermeeting period would be most

consistent with the alternative A longer-run range. Alternative II

calls for no change in the current 9¾ to 10½ per cent funds rate range,

with a midpoint near the present Desk objective. This alternative

would be consistent with both the alternative B and C longer-run

ranges. Alternative III, which calls for increases in the funds

rate to around the midpoint of a 10¼ to 11 per cent range, is most



-11-

consistent with longer-run alternative C. (More detailed and

longer-run data are shown in tables on pages 12 and 13).

M-2 5½ to 9½ 5 to 9 4½ to 8½

(16) In considering short-run alternatives, the FOMC may

wish to take into account the growth rates for the aggregates from

the estimated January levels that would be required to reach levels

in March and June that are implied by the longer-run ranges. The

table on page 14 provides such information for longer-run alternative B.2/

As shown by the middle column of the table, M-1 would have to grow

at a 8-1/4 per cent annual rate from January--and M-2 by a 10-1/4

per cent annual rate--to reach the level in March that is implied

by growth along the midpoint path of the longer-run QIV '78 - QIV '79

range. Growth for M-1 would have to be about 3 percentage points

lower to reach the low end of the alternative B range of growth,

and 3 points higher to reach the upper end. Over the five months

from January to June, M-1 would have to expand at a 5 per cent annual

rate and M-2 at a 7 per cent annual rate to reach midpoint paths.

1/ Ranges for the forthcoming short-run policy period expressed as
three-month growth ranges are shown in Appendix V for comparison
purposes.

2/ Similar information for alternatives A and C are shown in Appendix

VI.

I/ The staff has assumed that over the longer-run policy period from QIV '78 to QIV '79
M-l growth will be reduced 3 to 3 percentage points by ATS. In projecting GNP, monetary
aggregates, and interest rates the staff has carried forward the assumption in most
recent Bluebooks that M-l, in the absence of ATS, would increase at a 6% per cent annual
rate over the longer-run. Thus, the observed growth of M-l is expected to be 3 per cent
over the QIV '78 to QIV '79 period.

(17) The staff believes that if the 13-1/4 per cent annual

rate of growth of nominal GNP projected for the current quarter

develops, it will call forth a substantial increase in M-1 in

February-March. Under alternative II, M-1 is projected to increase

in a range centered on a 7 per cent annual rate, which would put M-1

just below the midpoint of the alternative B long-run path by March.

Even such a resurgence in growth would bring the growth rate of M-1

for the first quarter (quarterly average basis) to only a 3/4 per cent

annual rate, and would imply another substantial increase in V-1,
2/

at about a 12 per cent annual rate, as shown in Appendix II.

(18) Under alternative II, M-2 is expected to expand at

a 5 to 9 per cent annual rate range in February-March, considerably

1/ This, of course, represents the end-point of the long-run policy
period.

2/ Adjusted for the retarding effects of ATS on M-1, the velocity
increase would be 8 per cent annual rate.



-15-

more rapidly than in the previous three months, but growth at the

7 per cent midpoint would be a little less than needed to bring

M-2 up to the low end of the range specified under alternative B.

The acceleration of this aggregate reflects the expected strengthening

of both M-1 and the interest-bearing component of M-2, with much of

the strength in the latter likely to result from a slowing of re-

cent unusually rapid savings account withdrawals.

(19) At thrift institutions, the rate of deposit inflows

may edge off from the recent pace. Sizable net issuance of 6-month

money market certificates (MMC's) is expected, as in recent months,

to account for all of the growth of S&L and MSB deposits, as these

certificates continue to be marketed rather aggressively in response

to relatively strong demand for mortgage loans and in order to compete with

both other depository institutions and alternative financial instruments

paying high market rates of interest. With some moderation in total

thrift deposit inflows, and a continuing shift in the deposit mix

at thrifts toward high cost MMC's, mortgage markets conditions

are expected to tighten somewhat further in the intermeeting

period.

(20) If Federal funds continue to trade at a rate of 10

per cent or slightly higher over the intermeeting period, as con-

templated under alternative II, other short-term rates are also likely

to remain about unchanged, as recent market rate declines appear to

reflect full adjustment to the weak growth of the aggregates. Business



-16-

short-term credit demands may strengthen a bit in coming weeks, and

the Treasury is expected to offer a sizable block of cash management

bills in early March. But these short-term demands are likely to be

accommodated without significant upward pressure on rates unless a

resurgence in growth of the monetary aggregates causes adjustments in

market expectations about the future course of monetary policy.

(21) Yields on longer-term securities would also be expected

to remain at about current levels over the intermeeting period under

alternative II. Security offerings by corporations, state and local

governments, and the U.S. Treasury are expected to be moderate. In its

mid-February refunding, the Treasury has announced that it intends to

auction $2¼ billion and $2 billion of 8 and 29¾ year securities,

respectively, in order to rollover maturing debt and raise about

$1.25 billion of new money. Following this operation, the Treasury

can raise the additional $10 billion of new cash needed by the end of

the quarter through sale of cash management bills and routine offerings

of short- and intermediate-term notes.

(22) The foreign exchange value of the dollar over coming

weeks may be sustained, under money market conditions implied by

alternative II, as banks obtain more funds from abroad to meet

relatively strong credit demands in a period of modest growth in

domestic deposits. The relatively high interest rates in the U.S. and

recent evidence of strength in the dollar may also encourage investment

in the dollar-denominated assets by private market participants. Of

course, the behavior of the dollar on exchange markets will also depend



-17-

on a number of other factors, including future developments in the

Middle East.

(23) Under alternative III, the Federal funds rate would

be expected to rise to the midpoint of a 10 to 11 per cent range.

Growth in M-1 would likely be in a 4 to 9 per cent and M-2 in 4 to 8

per cent annual rate range, respectively. A tightening action at

this time is likely to come as a surprise to the market in light of

the recent weakness in the aggregates. As a result, market participants

might conclude that a further tightening could follow and thus a

comparatively sharp increase in short-term interest rates could occur.

The higher level of money market rates would further encourage out-

flows of deposits subject to fixed rate ceilings, induce even more

aggressive offerings of MMC's and large denomination time deposits,

and foster a firming of bank lending terms--with the prime rate moving

up to record levels of over 12 per cent. The dollar would tend to

move higher in foreign exchange markets. In bond markets, interest

rates would rise, but both the moderate volume of new security

offerings and strengthened market expectations that inflation will

be curbed would tend to limit such movements. In the mortgage market,

however, rates would likely move significantly higher in response to

reduced deposit inflows at thrifts and the further rise in the cost

of their MMC's.

(24) Alternative I involves a decline in the funds rate

over the intermeeting period to the midpoint of a 9¼ to 10 per cent

range. In response to the reduction of the System's funds rate



-18-

target, short-term rates would decline further, and a sizable short-

term rally is likely to develop in bond markets, as investors

come to believe that interest rates may have peaked. At the same

time, the decline in interest rates--if not accompanied by indications

of weakening economic activity--may lead to a significant drop in the

foreign exchange value of the dollar if market participants become more

concerned about the outlook for inflation in this country.



-19-

Directive language

(25) Given immediately below are suggested operational

paragraphs for the directive in the customary form. (An alternative

formulation with money market emphasis is shown in paragraph (26)).

In the short run, the Committee seeks to achieve bank

reserve and money market conditions that are broadly consistent

with the longer-run ranges for monetary aggregates cited above,

while giving due regard to the program for supporting the

foreign exchange value of the dollar, to developing conditions

in domestic financial markets, and to uncertainties associated

with the introduction of ATS. Early in the period before the

next regular meeting, System open market operations are to be

directed at attaining a weekly average Federal funds rate

(I) slightly below the current level.
(II) AT ABOUT THE CURRENT LEVEL.
(III) slightly above the current level.

Subsequently, operations shall be directed at maintaining the

weekly average Federal funds rate within the range of [DEL: 9¾ to 10½]

____ TO ____ per cent. In deciding on the specific objective

for the Federal funds rate the Manager shall be guided mainly

by the relationship between the latest estimates of annual

rates of growth in the [DEL: December-January] FEBRUARY-MARCH period

of M-1 and M-2 and the following ranges of tolerance--2 to 6

TO per cent for M-1 and [DEL: 5-to-9] ____ TO ____ per cent

for M-2. [DEL: If, giving approximatety equal weight to M-1 and M-2,

their rates of growthappear to be significantly above the



-20-

midpoints of the indicated ranges, the objective for the funds rate

shall be raised in an orderly fashion within its range, if their

rates of growth appear to be approaching the 1ower limits of the

indicated ranges, the funds rate sha11 be lowered in an orderly

fashion within its range.]

IF, WITH APPROXIMATELY EQUAL WEIGHT GIVEN TO M-1 AND M-2, THEIR

RATES OF GROWTH APPEAR TO BE

Monetary aggregates emphasis

SIGNIFICANTLY ABOVE OR BELOW THE MIDPOINTS

Money market emphasis

CLOSE TO OR BEYOND THE UPPER OR LOWER LIMITS OF THE

INDICATED RANGES, THE OBJECTIVE FOR THE FUNDS RATE IS TO BE

RAISED OR LOWERED IN AN ORDERLY FASHION WITHIN ITS RANGE.

If the rates of growth in the aggregates appear to be

falling [DEL: outside the limits] ABOVE THE UPPER LIMIT OR BELOW THE

LOWER LIMIT of the indicated ranges at a time when the objective

for the funds rate has already been moved to the corresponding

limit of its range, the Manager will promptly notify the Chairman,

who will then decide whether the situation calls for supplementary

instructions from the Committee.

(26) In view of uncertainties about interpretation of the

aggregates, presented below is an alternative formulation of the

operational paragraphs with primary emphasis on money market conditions.

The role of the aggregates in this formulation is through a proviso

clause, which permits the funds rate to move up if growth of the



-21-

aggregates is excessively strong.

In the short run, the Committee seeks to achieve bank

reserve and money market conditions that are broadly consistent

with the longer-run ranges for monetary aggregates cited above,

while giving due regard to the program for supporting the foreign

exchange value of the dollar, to developing conditions in

domestic financial markets, and to uncertainties associated with

the introduction of ATS. In the period before the next regular

meeting, System open market operations are to be directed at

attaining a weekly average Federal funds rate (A) at about the

current level of (B) slightly above the current level, provided

that over the February-March period the annual rates of growth

of M-1 and M-2, given approximately equal weight, appear to be

no higher than ____ per cent and ____ per cent, respectively.

If growth of M-1 and M-2 for the 2-month period appears to be

in excess of the indicated limits, the objective for the Federal

funds rate is to be raised in an orderly fashion up to a maximum

of ____ per cent.

If the rates of growth in the aggregates appear to be

falling above the indicated limits at a time when the objective

for the funds rate has already been moved to its limit, the

Manager will promptly notify the Chairman, who will then decide

whether the situation calls for supplementary instructions from

the Committee.

APPENDIX III

Revisions in the Monetary Aggregates

Benchmark adjustments for domestic nonmember banks and revised

seasonal factors have been incorporated into the money stock series and

related data. The benchmark adjustments are based on the June 1978 call

report and go back to March 1978. Seasonal factors have been revised to

incorporate an additional year of data and adjustments resulting from the

Board staff's annual review of these factors. Growth rates for the revised

M-1 and M-2 in 1978 are 7.3 and 8.5 per cent, respectively. M-1 growth was

about unchanged for the year, but M-2 growth was raised percentage point.

The impact of benchmark and seasonal factor changes on monthly, quarterly,

and annual M-1 and M-2 growth rates for 1978 are shown in Tables III-1 and

111-2.

The benchmark adjustments are based on data for the universe of

domestic nonmember banks for June 1978. The adjustments added $100 million

to the level of M-1 in June 1978 and about the same amount at the end of

1978. The level of M-2 was raised by $2.0 billion in June 1978 and by $4.4

billion at the end of the year. As shown in column 4 of Tables III-1 and

III-2, the benchmark adjustment had minimal impact on M-1 growth but added

0.5 percentage point to M-2 (QIV'77 to QIV'78).

Impacts of seasonal factor revisions, shown in the last column

of Tables III-1 and III-2, were minor. April M-1 growth was lowered

about 3-1/4 percentage points and November growth was raised by about the

same amount. Impacts on M-2 growth rates were generally about one-third

the effect on M-1.

APPENDIX V

Alternative Short-Run Growth Rates and Federal
Fund Rate Ranges

The table below shows growth rate ranges for M-1 and M-2 expressed

as the growth from the average of the three-months ending in December to

the average of the three-month ending in March. These ranges are based on

the same staff projections of February and March as appear in the present

two month ranges shown in paragraph 15 of the text. This three month

averaging process--which, as explained in Appendix IV of the December

Bluebook, changes the growth rates, narrows the ranges, and reduces the

difference in growth rates between alternatives--was proposed for con-

sideration by the Subcommittee on the Directive in its December 13, 1978,

memorandum to the FOMC.

NOTE: Government security dealer trading positions are on a commitment basis. Trading positions, which exclude Treasury securities financed by
repurchase agreements maturing in 16 days or more, are indicators of dealer holdings available for sale over the near-term. Underwriting syndicate
positions consist of issues still in syndicate, excluding trading positions. The basic reserve deficit is excess reserves less borrowing at Federal
Reserve less net Federal funds purchases. Weekly data are daily averages for statement weeks, except for corporate and municipal issues in syndicate
