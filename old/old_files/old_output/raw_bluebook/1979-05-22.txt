Prefatory Note 

 
 

The attached document represents the most complete and accurate version 
available based on original copies culled from the files of the FOMC Secretariat at the 
Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System.  This electronic document was 
created through a comprehensive digitization process which included identifying the best-
preserved paper copies, scanning those copies,1 and then making the scanned versions 
text-searchable.2  Though a stringent quality assurance process was employed, some 
imperfections may remain. 
 

Please note that this document may contain occasional gaps in the text.  These 
gaps are the result of a redaction process that removed information obtained on a

1 In some cases, original copies needed to be photocopied before being scanned into electronic format.  All 
scanned images were deskewed (to remove the effects of printer- and scanner-introduced tilting) and lightly 
cleaned (to remove dark spots caused by staple holes, hole punches, and other blemishes caused after initial 
printing). 
2 A two-step process was used.  An advanced optimal character recognition computer program (OCR) first 
created electronic text from the document image.  Where the OCR results were inconclusive, staff checked 
and corrected the text as necessary.   Please note that the numbers and text in charts and tables were not

Recent developments

(1) M-1 grew at a 17½ per cent annual rate in April, with

somewhat more than half of the acceleration estimated to be related to

the processing of tax payments and refunds. Deposit data for early

May indicate that these temporary influences are unwinding, and for

the April-May period, M-1 is projected to expand at about an 8 per cent

annual rate, above the 4 to 8 per cent range adopted by the FOMC. M-2 is

projected to grow at a 9¼ per cent rate for the 2-month policy period,

also above its 4 to 8½ per cent range selected at the April FOMC meeting.

The interest-bearing component of M-2 grew more rapidly in April than

expected, as sales of money market certificates (MMCs) by banks spurted

and outflows of savings and other small time deposits included in this

aggregate slowed markedly. The success of banks in attracting MMCs during

the first full month since the elimination of the differential ceiling

rate on such deposits apparently came at the expense of reduced growth of

MMCs at thrift institutions. In part reflecting this shift, thrift deposit

inflows fell to a 2 per cent annual rate in April on a month-end basis,

compared to an average 9 per cent annual rate over the first quarter.

(2) Growth in commercial bank credit picked up sharply in April

to a 13 per cent annual rate, led by a rebound in business lending. Banks,

nonetheless, reduced their outstanding amount of large time deposits, financing

their asset growth with the increased inflows of demand deposits, MMCs, and

funds borrowed from abroad.

(3) The Manager of the System Open Market Account continued to

seek reserve conditions consistent with a Federal funds rate of 10 per cent

or a bit higher early in the period after the April FOMC meeting. In late

April, projections for the monetary aggregates suggested that growth of M-1

and M-2 would be at or above the upper ends of their respective ranges for

the April-May period. Following a telephone conference of the Committee

on April 27, the Manager began aiming for a Federal funds rate of 10¾ per

cent. On May 11, the FOMC concurred in the Chairman's view that, though

the growth of the monetary aggregates had been revised up somewhat further,

this funds rate objective remained consistent with the prevailing directive

after taking account of overall financial market conditions and uncertainties

in projections of the aggregates in this period.

(4) Required reserves declined in April and are expected to

fall further in May despite the pronounced strengthening in monetary

growth. The disparate movements of reserves and money are explained

mainly by the release of required reserves associated with the substantial

run-offs of large denomination time deposits. In addition, the growth

in demand deposits at nonmember banks and currency is estimated to account



for half of the projected expansion of M-l in the April-May period. Pro-

vision of reserves via the discount window has risen with the widening

of the spread between the Federal funds rate and the discount rate. Member

bank borrowing has averaged a little over $1 billion thus far in May, up

from an average of just under $1 billion during the first four months of

the year. Given the increase in borrowing, nonborrowed reserves are expected

to fall at about a 13 1/4 per cent annual rate over the April-May period while

total reserves are projected to decline at only a 5 per cent annual rate.

Growth in currency continues to account for all of the growth of the monetary

base. Growth of the base is expected to remain around the 4 1/4 per cent annual

rate that prevailed over the first three months of the year.

(5) Short-term interest rates are little changed on balance from

their mid-April levels. They declined around the time of the FOMC meeting

but then rebounded in late April and early May in response to the System's

move toward additional money market restraint. The 3-month bill rate

was most recently quoted around 9.7 per cent and the 3-month commercial

paper rate about 10 per cent. Longer-term interest rates have risen 10

to 25 basis points, though, in part reflecting increased inflationary

expectations by market participants. With thrift deposit flows slowing

further, mortgage yields continued to rise to new highs.

(6) The dollar has continued to show strength in the exchange

markets, reflecting stronger U.S. trade figures, further indications of a

slowdown in U.S. economic expansion, and continued acceleration of inflation

abroad. The dollar's average exchange value has risen a bit more than

1 per cent since the April FOMC meeting,

Prospective developments

(8) The table below presents for Committee consideration three

alternative specifications for the monetary aggregates and the Federal

funds rate for the May-June period. Alternative B would maintain the

Federal funds rate at the current 10-1/4 per cent level, while alternatives

A and C, respectively, would ease and tighten money market conditions in

coming weeks. (More detailed and longer-term data are contained in the

tables on pp. 7 and 8.)

Federal funds rate
(Intermeeting period) 9-1/2 to 10 10 to 10-1/2 10-1/2 to 11

(9) The unwinding of the Treasury lag in processing April

individual income tax payments and of the recent bulge in the payment of

tax refunds will be retarding the growth rate of M-1 over the balance of

the current quarter. Partly because of these special factors, M-1 growth

is expected to be quite slow in the May-June period. Under alternative B,

with the funds rate remaining at the prevailing level of around 10-1/4 per

cent cent, M-1 is likely to increase over the two-month policy period in

a 1/2 to 4-1/2 per cent annual rate range.

(10) As illustrated in the upper panel of the chart on page 10,

the April increase in M-1 raised the level of that aggregate to just above

the low end path of its longer-run QIV '78 to QIV '79 range. Growth in

M-1 at the lower end of its projected May-June alternative B range would

place the level of this aggregate by June around the lower limit of its

longer-run range while growth at the upper end of the range would move the

aggregate higher in the range, though not quite to the midpoint. (The

table on p. 11 shows growth rates from April required to achieve levels

implied by the FOMC's longer-run ranges).

(11) Under alternative B, the staff expects M-2 to expand in

a 4 to 8 per cent annual rate range in May-June. Growth at the midpoint

of that range would bring M-2 to the low-end path of the Committee's QIV '78

to QIV '79 objective for this aggregate by mid-year.

(12) Although growth in M-2 over the balance of this quarter will

be retarded by the slowing of M-1 growth, the interest-bearing component is

expected to remain relatively strong. Not only is the decline in savings

deposits likely to remain more modest than earlier this year, but

also banks are expected to retain an enlarged share of the MMC market

in view of the recent elimination of the rate ceiling differential on these

deposits. Large denomination time deposits are not expected to contribute

to growth in M-2 in the near-term because banks will probably continue to

rely on Eurodollar and other nondeposit funds to finance their credit

expansion.

(13) Looking ahead to the whole QIV '78-QIV '79 policy period,

the staff expects growth in both M-1 and M-2 to be within the Committee's

longer-run ranges, on balance, with little change in interest rates,

given the GNP projection. With respect to M-1, this assumes further that

in the second half of 1979 demand deposits shift to ATS accounts at a rate

that depresses M-1 growth by about 2 percentage points (annual rate) and

that the public also continues to economize on M-1 holdings through shifts

to other assets, though at a slower pace than seems to have been the case

thus far this year. There is substantial uncertainty about both of these

assumptions, however, in part because of possible repercussions on bank

and public attitudes toward ATS and similar accounts of the recent court

ruling that would forbid such accounts after the end of this year unless

the Congress acts to authorize them. Bank credit growth over the year

may be slightly above the targeted range. At present, bank credit

appears to be running well above the upper end of its longer-run range;

however, loan demand is projected to be lower in the second half of the year

as the economy grows at a slow pace, and this should work to bring bank

credit growth down closer to its longer-run range.

(14) In contrast to banks, thrift institutions' deposit flows

are expected to remain relatively weak, although above the exceptionally

low April rate of growth. The mid-March regulatory actions have apparently

had a larger than expected impact on the ability of thrifts to issue

MMCs--the major vehicle through which their deposit inflows had been

maintained since mid-1978. Despite the lower than expected thrift deposit

inflows, the more rapid growth of the commercial bank deposit component of

M-3 is likely to keep the rate of expansion of this aggregate near the

low-end of its longer-run range, as shown in the chart on page 13.

(15) Under alternative B, market interest rates are expected

to show little net change,although markets remain highly sensitive to

incoming information on prices, economic activity, energy, and the money

supply. Short-term credit demands from business may remain fairly strong

over the next few weeks but--with the exception of a very short-term cash

management bill offering in early June--the Treasury is not expected to raise

any new cash in the bill market over the balance of the quarter. In the

long-term area, offerings of corporate and State and local government

bonds are expected to be moderate for the rest of the quarter. The Treasury

will likely be out of the longer-term market over the balance of the

quarter, meeting its needs in coupon markets with comparatively small

additions to the regular 2-year note cycle offerings. In the mortgage market,

however, yields can be expected to continue rising as available supplies

of credit are constrained by the reduced deposit flows to thrift institutions.

(16) Alternative C contemplates a rise in the Federal funds

rate to the midpoint of a 10 to 11 per cent range. Growth in M-1 and

M-2 would likely be in an annual rate range of 0 to 4 and 3 to 7 per

cent, respectively. Short-term interest rates would increase as the funds

rate rises. Treasury bill rates could come under particular upward

pressure if the dollar strengthens on exchange markets and foreign

central banks in consequence engage in substantial support operations.

In the short-run, long-term rates would also likely rise; however, such

increases might be moderated if the market came to believe that a tightening

action now will hasten the ultimate peak in interest rates.

(17) Alternative A calls for a decline in the funds rate over

the intermeeting period to the midpoint of a 9 to 10 per cent range.

Growth in M-1 and M-2 would likely be in annual rate ranges of 1 to 5

and 4½ to 8½ per cent, respectively. An easing action at this time would



-15-

be unexpected by the market and hence could induce a sharp decline in

short-term interest rates. On the other hand, market concerns about the

inflationary outlook might moderate the impact of an easing action on

longer-term yields. Similar concerns might also induce some weakness of

the dollar in exchange markets.



-16-

Directive language

(18) Given below are suggested operational paragraphs for

the directive in the customary form. Alternative language consistent

with the short-run specifications of the alternatives discussed in the

preceding section is shown for the Committee's objective for the Federal

funds rate early in the period. At a later point, alternative language is

also provided for placing main emphasis either on monetary aggregates

or on money market conditions. The specifications adopted last month are

shown in strike-through form.

In the short-run, the Committee seeks to achieve bank reserve

and money market conditions that are broadly consistent with the

longer-run ranges for monetary aggregates cited above, while giving

due regard to the program for supporting the foreign exchange value

of the dollar and to developing conditions in domestic financial

markets. Early in the period before the next regular meeting,

System open market operations are to be directed at maintaining

the (or ATTAINING A) weekly average Federal funds rate

(A) SLIGHTLY BELOW THE CURRENT LEVEL.

(B) at about the current level.
(C) SLIGHTLY ABOVE THE CURRENT LEVEL.

Subsequently, operations shall be directed at maintaining the

weekly average Federal funds rate within the range of [DEL: 9¾ to 10½]

____ TO ____ per cent. In deciding on the specific objective for

the Federal funds rate the Manager shall be guided mainly by the

relationship between the latest estimates of annual rates of growth

in the [DEL: April-May] MAY-JUNE period of M-1 and M-2 and the following

ranges of tolerance: [DEL: 4-to-8] ____ TO ____ per cent for M-1 and



-17-

[DEL: 4 to 8½] ____ TO ____ per cent for M-2. If, with approximately equal

weight given to M-1 and M-2, their rates of growth appear to be

Monetary aggregates emphasis

SIGNIFICANTLY ABOVE OR BELOW THE MIDPOINTS

Money market emphasis

close to or beyond the upper or lower limits

of the indicated ranges, the objective for the funds rate is to be

If the rates of growth in the aggregates appear to be above the

upper limit or below the lower limit of the indicated ranges at a

time when the objective for the funds rate has already been moved

to the corresponding limit of its range, the Manager will promptly

notify the Chairman, who will then decide whether the situation calls

for supplementary instructions from the Committee.

Appendix II

Revisions in the Monetary Aggregates

Benchmark adjustments for domestic nonmember banks have been in-

corporated into the money stock series and related data. The benchmark adjust-

ments are based on the September 1978 call report. The adjustments were

minor, lowering the level of M1 about $200 million in September 1978 and by lesser

amounts in earlier and subsequent months.1/ The benchmarking also lowered the

level of M2 about $600 million in September 1978 and $300 million in April 1979.

The impacts of the benchmark adjustments on monthly, quarterly and

annual growth rates are shown in Table II-1. In general, monthly growth rates

were lowered slightly in the third quarter of 1978 and were unchanged or raised

somewhat in the fourth quarter of 1978 and the first quarter of 1979. M1 growth

for the year 1978 was reduced 0.1 of a percentage point from 7.3 to 7.2 per cent

and M2 growth was reduced from an 8.5 per cent annual rate of growth to 8.4 per

cent.

1/ The benchmark adjustments also incorporate estimates of the level of domestic

nonmember bank deposits in December 1978 and March 1979 derived from the
FDIC's sample of insured nonmember banks. Data from this sample are

available only with a lag and are not incorporated into published money
stock measures on a regular basis.
