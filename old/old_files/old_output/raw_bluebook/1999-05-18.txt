Prefatory Note 

 
 

The attached document represents the most complete and accurate version 
available based on original copies culled from the files of the FOMC Secretariat at the 
Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System.  This electronic document was 
created through a comprehensive digitization process which included identifying the best-
preserved paper copies, scanning those copies,1 and then making the scanned versions 
text-searchable.2  Though a stringent quality assurance process was employed, some 
imperfections may remain. 
 

Please note that this document may contain occasional gaps in the text.  These

MONETARY POLICY ALTERNATIVES

Recent Developments

(1) The Committee's decision at its meeting on March 30 to leave the intended

federal funds rate at 4-3/4 percent was fully anticipated and elicited little market response.' On

balance, yields on Treasury coupon securities have increased 25 to 35 basis points over the

intermeeting period, while bill rates have risen somewhat less. The runup in rates has

occurred since late April, responding to strength in U.S. economic data, improved prospects

in many foreign economies and the associated increases in commodity prices, as well as the

Chairman's comments on May 6 warning of possible inflation risks. Favorable readings on

prices and wages over most of the period partly offset these forces, but today's data showing

greater-than-anticipated increases in the CPI, industrial production, and consumer sentiment

pushed yields up appreciably. Federal funds futures rates, after allowing for term premiums,

now indicate that market participants see better than even odds of a quarter-point firming of

the intended federal funds rate by the October meeting (Chart 1). Further out the yield

curve, implied one-year forward rates have risen the most--35 to 45 basis points--at the two-

to five-year maturities, consistent with the view that prospective economic developments

1 The federal funds rate averaged 4.76 percent over the intermeeting period, but it
varied substantially around this level as reserve management was complicated by tax-season
uncertainties. Initially, slower-than-projected tax receipts contributed to more plentiful-than-
planned reserve supply and pushed the funds rate below target; however, in the final week of
April, a surge in receipts produced unexpectedly large reserve drains, as some of these
receipts spilled into the Treasury's Federal Reserve account, imparting a firm tone to funds
trading in late April and early May.

over the intermediate term will ultimately put substantially more pressure on short-term

interest rates than had previously been expected. Yields on inflation-protected Treasury

securities have declined slightly over the period, widening their spreads below comparable

nominal issues. However, this widening seems to have stemmed from investors' heightened

willingness to hold less-liquid assets and from some improvement in this market's liquidity as

well as from some increase in inflation expectations. The rise in nominal Treasury yields

over this intermeeting period has extended the upward movement that began in early

February on mounting evidence of the continuing strength of the U.S. economy and

diminishing concerns about difficulties overseas. Nominal Treasury coupon yields now

stand 70 to 100 basis points above their levels prevailing at the end of January.

(2) Optimism about the economy and generally favorable earnings reports have

engendered confidence about the financial condition of private borrowers, apparently

inducing investors to reduce their assessment of and aversion to risk. Over the intermeeting

period, rates on private investment-grade bonds have registered smaller increases than those

on comparable Treasury securities, while rates on below-investment-grade bonds have fallen

modestly despite heavy issuance. Business borrowers have seen little change in the terms and

standards on loans from commercial banks since late January following some tightening last

fall. Broad stock market indexes have posted gains of 1 to 11 percent over the intermeeting

period, at times touching record highs. Since late January, measures of credit spreads

generally have fallen 30 to 105 basis points, placing these spreads at or somewhat above the



-3-

levels prevailing before the financial turmoil of midsummer, and major equity indexes have

risen 1 to 17 percent.

(3) The foreign exchange value of the dollar has depreciated somewhat on a

weighted-average basis against a broad set of currencies over the intermeeting period as the

outlook for economic and financial conditions in many emerging market countries

brightened. Relative to major foreign currencies, the dollar has declined 1/4 percent, on

average, over the period, primarily owing to sizable depreciations against the Canadian and

Australian dollars. The recovery in commodity prices has supported both currencies, and the

Canadian dollar has remained firm even after two 25 basis point cuts in the Bank of Canada's

key bank rate. By contrast, the dollar has appreciated 1/2 and 2-1/2 percent against the euro and

yen, respectively, over the intermeeting period. Longer-term interest rates in Europe have

been about unchanged, but short-term rates have fallen in response to the 50 basis point

paring of the European Central Bank's refinance rate. Political turmoil in Russia and the

negative outlook for resolving the Kosovo conflict also are said to have contributed to the

euro's weakness. In Japan, the yield on ten-year Japanese government bonds has shed 55

basis points, supporting a rally in equity prices that also was reportedly abetted by substantial

stock purchases by foreign investors.

(4) Over the intermeeting period, the dollar has declined about 1-1/4 percent against

the currencies of our other important trading partners. In Mexico, the peso and equity prices

have been buoyed by the sharp rise in oil prices and lower-than-expected inflation. In Brazil,

markets also have rallied, and the dollar fell 7 percent against the real, even as the Brazilian



-4-

central bank lowered the overnight rate from 42 percent to 27 percent. In Asia, share prices

in many countries have risen more than 20 percent, and the dollar has depreciated 1 to 11

percent against the floating currencies of emerging Asia. Credit spreads on emerging market

debt have continued to narrow over the intermeeting period (Chart 2). Since their recent

peak in late January, when Brazilian prospects seemed at their worst, these spreads have

fallen about 400 basis points on average, but for most countries they have remained

appreciably above their levels of last summer.

(5) Growth of the broad monetary aggregates surged in April, as households

evidently built up liquid balances to meet a larger-than-usual increase in nonwithheld tax

payments. The bulge in M2 was reversed in late April and early May, after tax payments

cleared, and, as a consequence, M2 growth in May is expected to slow appreciably.

Averaging through April and the current projection for May, M2 is estimated to be growing

at a 5/4 percent rate, about in line with the expansion seen in the first three months of the

year and well below the pace of late last year.2 The moderation in growth this year stems

from the waning effects of factors that lifted M2 in the latter part of 1998--the three policy

easings, the wave of mortgage refinancings, and the heightened preference for holding liquid

money balances in response to the turmoil in financial markets. M3 is also growing at a more

moderate pace this year, as the contraction in bank credit since December has enabled banks

2 The notable exception to this slowing was currency, which has advanced at an 11
percent pace, on average, since December. This robust growth cannot be attributed to
foreign demand but rather appears to reflect strong domestic spending and perhaps some
initial stockpiling ahead of the century date change.

to pare back their use of managed liabilities included in M3. Nevertheless, the velocities of

both M2 and M3 extended their declines in the first quarter, each falling at a 1/4 percent

annual rate.

(6) The debt of nonfederal sectors has expanded vigorously in recent months;

from the fourth quarter through March, this measure grew at an 8-1/4percent rate, and partial

data suggest a slightly quicker advance in April. Heavy business borrowing has been

concentrated in the bond market, in part boosted by attractive yields. Households have

continued to accumulate mortgage and consumer debt in keeping with strength in home sales

and spending on consumer durables. Robust tax inflows have held back the borrowing

needs of state and local governments and have allowed the Treasury to pay down more debt.

The cutback in federal debt issuance has restrained the growth of total domestic nonfinancial

debt, which expanded at a 5-3/4 percent pace from the fourth quarter through March.

Policy Alternatives

(7) Recent economic activity has once again proven more robust than expected,

and the staff has boosted its forecast of both aggregate demand and supply. The staff

forecast carries forward some of the surprising strength in productivity growth, which buoys

profits and equity prices; the higher equity prices have added to the growth of aggregate

demand relative to the outlook in the March Greenbook. Still, productivity growth is

anticipated to slow from its extraordinary pace of recent quarters, and profits are expected to

flatten out at their recent higher level over the forecast period. Although investors could get

frustrated at the failure of earnings to rise further, the staff expects that share prices will not

deviate greatly, on a sustained basis, from where they have been in recent days. With other

financial conditions, including real interest rates and the exchange value of the dollar, also

essentially unchanged through next year, real spending slows to a pace more in line with the

growth of potential output. Even though the unemployment rate tracks a bit below the path

in the March Greenbook, and retail energy prices move higher in the near term than

previously projected, core inflation is a tad lower over the forecast period than in the

projection in March.3 The better inflation outlook reflects in part the staffs judgment that

restraint on costs associated with greater productivity gains will exert countervailing

3 The staff now projects CPI inflation of 2-1/4 percent over this year, which is at the
midpoint of the central tendency of FOMC members' projections of 2 to 2-1/2 percent as of
the February Humphrey-Hawkins report. Real GDP growth is expected to be around 3-1/2
percent over 1999 in the Greenbook, above the central tendency of 2-1/2 to 3 percent, while
the fourth-quarter unemployment rate, at 4 percent, is below the central tendency of 4-1/4 to
4-1/2 percent.



-8-

downward pressure on prices. Even so, taut labor markets begin to lift core inflation next

year in the staff forecast, and the FOMC is assumed to firm the nominal funds rate a little

next year, which keeps the real funds rate about unchanged.

(8) If the Committee believes that inflation pressures could well be damped for

some time, it might prefer to keep the federal funds rate unchanged at this meeting, as in

alternative B. The staff forecast shows only a gradual pickup in core inflation to a relatively

low level, at least through 2000. In that environment, and in light of the considerable degree

of uncertainty regarding the economy's supply side, the Committee may want to wait to get a

firmer handle on the likely extent of price pressures before acting. The Committee might see

a significant probability of more restraint on cost pressures going forward than in the staff

forecast from, for example, a lesser slowing in productivity growth or an extension of the

recent subdued pace of wage gains. The Committee might also be encouraged by the

behavior of bond rates over recent weeks, which suggests that investors respond promptly to

signs the economy might begin to overheat and, by anticipating future monetary policy

firming, impart some restraint to spending before the Federal Reserve takes action.

(9) The response of financial markets to the continuation of an unchanged policy

stance, as under alternative B, would depend importantly on whether the Committee

announces a change in the tilt of the directive. Especially after the publication today of a

surprisingly large rise in the CPI in April, market participants reportedly see a good chance

that the Committee will announce a directive tilted toward tightening. Against that

backdrop, debt and equity markets could rally some if there were no announcement



-9-

regarding the symmetry of the directive; market participants would conclude that the

Committee chose a symmetric directive and probably would see a reduced likelihood of

future action. Over time, longer-term yields would fluctuate near these lower levels as

incoming output and price data in line with the Greenbook forecast suggest a slowing

economy and damped inflation but still the possibility of eventual tightening. Under these

conditions, the average value of the dollar should not move far from its recent range. If, on

the other hand, the Committee decided to adopt and announce a tilt in its directive toward

tightening, market participants probably would place slightly higher odds on a policy

tightening sometime over the next few meetings, pushing up interest and exchange rates

modestly further. Also, with the Committee seen as more inclined to act, markets could well

become more sensitive to information bearing on the price outlook.

(10) If the Committee saw a pickup in underlying inflation as likely, it might favor

the 25 basis point firming of alternative C. Even with what would seem to be a generous

allowance for expected productivity growth and with relatively restrained pressures on

nominal and real wages at projected labor resource utilization rates, the staff still foresees a

gradual uptrend in core inflation. The forecast implies that financial conditions must tighten

appreciably to contain inflation. Moreover, the April CPI may be a sign that the tendency

for higher inflation is stronger than contemplated in the Greenbook forecast. Although

most bond yields have backed up since late last fall, in other respects financial market

conditions have eased since the Committee's last reduction in the federal funds rate, and

economic activity both here and abroad has proven more buoyant than anticipated. The



-10-

renewed appetite for risk in financial markets and apparently relentless upward march of the

stock market in recent months may suggest the possibility that financial conditions will be

more accommodative than in the staff outlook. In this context, the Committee may believe

that tightening policy now would be prudent in light of the significant risk that substantial

economic imbalances would build if the Committee postponed action until higher inflation

became more evident in the data.

(11) Financial market prices embody little expectation of a policy firming at this

meeting. As a consequence, the immediate 25 basis point increase in the funds rate of

alternative C would trigger a similar rise in short-term interest rates. The extent of the

response of other U.S. financial markets would depend on the outlook for further policy

firming, which would be importantly affected by the wording of the announcement. Longer-

term rates should go up significantly less than short rates, as some later rise in short-term

nominal rates already has been built into market prices, and investors might be more

confident of the outlook for subdued inflation with such a preemptive move by the Federal

Reserve. However, if market participants were to decide that several additional tightening

moves were likely, long rates would increase more substantially, as they often have in the past

when policy has turned in a firming direction. Some adverse reaction would be expected in

foreign financial markets, but absent a steep sell-off in domestic markets, the fallout should

be limited, given the recovery in overseas markets and their modest response to the recent

increases in U.S. interest rates.



-11 -

(12) With the projected deceleration in nominal spending under any of the policy

alternatives, growth in the debt of nonfederal sectors is expected to soften in the remainder

of this year. A slowing in the pace of housing activity and in the growth of household

spending on durable goods should lead to a moderation in the recent robust rate of

accumulation of mortgage and consumer debt. Business debt growth is expected to edge

down even as the financing gap widens owing to a slowdown in cash-financed mergers and

share repurchases. Credit supply conditions are likely to remain rather favorable for most

borrowers in the months ahead, though they could tighten somewhat later on as earnings

prove sluggish. The default rate on lower-rated debt issues is likely to stay near its recently

elevated level, and spreads on such issues should hold steady. Lending standards and terms

on business loans at banks are also likely to remain stable for a while. The staff projects

rising paydowns of federal debt, despite additional spending for the conflict in the Balkans.

Total nonfinancial debt is expected to grow 5-1/2 percent over the four quarters of 1999,

placing it in the upper half of its annual range.

(13) Abstracting from the estimated effects of refunds and nonwithheld tax

payments in recent months, M2 growth has slowed considerably, even relative to the

projected deceleration in nominal spending for the second quarter. Some of the fall-off in

M2 growth has likely been temporary, reflecting the recovery of financial markets and the

unwinding of the general buildup of liquidity that occurred in the last several months of

1998. After softening substantially in May owing to the clearing of tax checks, M2 growth is

projected to pick up in the months ahead under alternative B, extending the trend decline in



-12-

velocity evident since mid-1997, and leaving growth of this aggregate for the year at about 6

percent, somewhat above its annual range of 1 to 5 percent. The recent sluggish behavior of

bank credit also appears to reflect an unwinding of the developments of last fall; as bank

credit growth steps up in the months ahead, banks should again need to turn to managed

liabilities for financing, and M3 growth should rebound as well. For 1999 as a whole, M3 is

projected to post a 6-1/2 percent growth rate, placing it a little above its annual range of 2 to 6

percent.

Directive Language

(14) Presented below is draft wording for the operational paragraph that includes

the usual options for Committee consideration.

OPERATIONAL PARAGRAPH

To promote the Committee's long-run objectives of price stability and sustainable

economic growth, the Committee in the immediate future seeks conditions in reserve

markets consistent with maintaining/INCREASING/DECREASING the federal funds rate

at/TO an average of around ____ [DEL: 4-3/4] percent. In view of the evidence currently

available, the Committee believes that prospective developments are equally likely to warrant

an increase or a decrease [MORE LIKELY TO WARRANT AN INCREASE/A

DECREASE THAN A DECREASE/AN INCREASE] in the federal funds rate operating

objective during the intermeeting period.

NOTE: Weekly data for columns 1 through 13 are week-ending averages. As of September 1997, data in column 6 are interpolated from data on certain commercial paper trades settled by the Depository Trust Company; prior
to that, they relect an average of offering rates placed by several leading dealers. Column 14 is the Bond Buyer revenue index, which is a 1-day quote for Thursday. Column 15 is the average contract rate on new
commitments for fixed-rate mortgages (FRMs) with 80 percent loan-to-value ratios at major institutional lenders. Column 16 is the average initial contract rate on new commitments for 1-year, adjustable-rate mortgages
(ARMs) at major institutional lenders offering both FRMs and ARMs with the same number of discount points.
