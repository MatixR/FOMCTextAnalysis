MONETARY POLICY ALTERNATIVES

Prepared for the Federal Open Market Committee

By the staff Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System



STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL (FR)
CLASS I - FOMC February 1, 1991

MONETARY POLICY ALTERNATIVES

Recent Developments

(1) Immediately after the December FOMC meeting, the discount

rate was cut 1/2 percentage point and Desk operations were adjusted so

that about half of this decline would show through to the federal funds

rate. Another easing step of 25 basis points was taken in early Janu-

ary, with the funds rate expected to decline to 6-3/4 percent in response

to indications that the monetary aggregates were very weak at a time when

the economy was continuing to exhibit considerable softness. 2 Most

recently, after the employment data for January and other indicators

portrayed the economy as slackening further and inflation pressures as

abating, the discount rate was lowered another 1/2 percentage point, to 6

percent, with the expectation that all of this decline would be trans-

mitted to the federal funds rate.

(2) The actual funds rate fluctuated widely around its intended

levels, however, with rates as high as 100 percent and as low as zero

registered during the period. An important factor in the additional

volatility was the phase-out of the nontransaction reserve requirement,

which reduced required reserve balances to levels that proved at times to

be insufficient for clearing purposes--that is, to avoid overnight over-

drafts. At those times, for many banks the marginal dollar of reserve

in this action.



balances was held to meet clearing needs, leaving banks less willing to

arbitrage the funds rate across time and demanding additional excess re-

serves. This phenomenon has seemed especially important in the current

maintenance period as required reserve balances reach their seasonal low.

Other forces contributing to volatility in earlier maintenance periods

were balance sheet maneuvering around year-end and occasional shortfalls

of reserves near the ends of maintenance periods. On a maintenance-period

average basis, the federal funds rate ranged only from a high of 7-1/4

percent in the period ended December 26 to a low of about 6-3/4 percent in

the subsequent period. So far in the current maintenance period, clearing

demands for balances have pulled the funds rate up to an average of about

7-1/4 percent.

(3) The monetary policy easings and the passing of year-end

were the dominant influences on other short-term credit markets over the

intermeeting period. Treasury bill rates have fallen about 75 basis

points since mid-December, somewhat less than the size of the System's

easing actions. Private money market rates are down by more, reflecting a

reduction in the pronounced risk premiums that had been built into them

ahead of year-end. Long-term markets, by contrast, were more affected by

developments surrounding the outbreak of war in the Middle East. Prices

in bond and stock markets declined appreciably in the weeks leading up to

3. In the first eight days of the current maintenance period, adjust-
ment plus seasonal borrowing has averaged $240 million. In general
since the last meeting, borrowing has averaged well above the levels
built into the reserve paths, owing to a minor degree to special situa-
tion borrowing and to a major degree to reserve shortfalls against the
background of the lower required reserves and the need for additional
balances to meet clearing needs.



the U.N. deadline on January 15. Those losses were reversed in a single

day when initial reports engendered optimism that the war would be brief

and have minimal impact on global oil supplies. Broad indexes of stock

prices have risen about 4 percent on balance over the intermeeting period.

Treasury bond yields, however, are down only 8 basis points since the

December meeting, despite both a $6 net drop in oil prices and the

System's easing actions. Some of the stickiness in yields may reflect

concerns about upcoming supplies of Treasury securities, given upward

revisions to expected federal deficits, as well as a sense that, partly

because of Federal Reserve actions, the length and depth of the recession

will be limited.

(4) Dollar exchange rates fluctuated widely over the intermeet-

ing period. The dollar's weighted average exchange value rose about

3 percent from the December meeting through mid-January, primarily on the

basis of safe-haven demands associated with developments in the Middle

East and turmoil in the Soviet Union. In the flush of optimism generated

by reports out of the Persian Gulf on the first day of the war, the dollar

declined by 2 percent as the safe-haven effect diminished. After drifting

lower in subsequent days, the dollar dropped sharply following the Bundes-

bank's 1/2 percentage point increase in its official lending rates and the

next day's cut in the Federal Reserve's discount rate. Only the Nether-

lands and Austria followed the German rate action, and short-term market

rates abroad remain down about 35 basis points on average over the period,

helping to limit the dollar's decline to just 1-1/4 percent on balance.

Foreign long-term rates fell about 30 basis points, on average.



(5) M2 growth remained weak, at a 1-1/4 percent annual rate in

January, off a bit from the 1-3/4 percent rate registered in December;

this aggregate thus is running below the 4 percent rate that the Committee

had expected for the November-to-March period. The aggregate was held

down by declines in RPs and demand deposits, both of which were affected

by an unusually pronounced seasonal pattern around year-end. On the other

hand, currency increased sharply, likely owing to stepped-up shipments

overseas. M2 growth excluding these items (and Eurodollars holdings as

well) picked up to roughly a 3 percent rate in December and 3-3/4 percent

in January, buoyed by narrowing opportunity costs. Even so, growth likely

was held down by heightened concerns both about the Bank Insurance Fund,

and about depository institutions generally, in the wake of the closing of

privately insured banks and credit unions in Rhode Island and the failure

of the Bank of New England. Noncompetitive tenders at Treasury auctions

have been unusually strong in recent weeks, and, within M2 (as adjusted

above), all the increase was accounted for by money funds, which grew at a

30 percent pace. Core deposits remained stagnant last month, despite the

downward movement in market interest rates.

(6) Although bank credit edged lower in January, M3 growth

picked up to a 4 percent rate. Over the last two months, M3 has grown at

4. The money data presented in this document reflect the results of
the annual benchmark and seasonal review--discussed in Appendix A--and
should be treated as confidential until their release to the public,
planned for February 7.
5. The surge in currency lifted growth of the monetary base to a

16-1/4 percent rate in January. The drop in transaction balances, how-
ever, restrained M1 growth to a 1-1/4 percent pace and led to a 6 per-
cent rate of decline in total reserves. (Reserves have been adjusted to
remove the effects of the change in reserve requirements.)

about a 2 percent average rate, compared with the Committee's expectation

of 1 percent for the November-to-March period. The strength in M3 rela-

tive to M2 resulted from a pickup in large CD issuance, reflecting a

shifting of bank funding patterns, and from very rapid inflows to money

funds.

(7) Preliminary data indicate that bank loans contracted in

January, with the drop most evident in the C&I category. To an extent,

this decline may be the paydown of business loans taken out late last

year, when some corporations that faced a cool reception from the commer-

cial paper market ahead of year-end turned to their backup lines of credit

at banks. Also likely contributing to the reduction in C&I loans were

weak loan demand related to the slump in economic activity and tighter

loan supply conditions, as reflected in responses to the Federal Reserve's

latest survey of senior loan officers. On average in December and Janu-

ary, bank business loans fell at a 1-3/4 percent rate. The prime rate was

lowered by 1/2 percentage point after the turn of the year, and many banks

reduced it again when the discount rate was cut to 6 percent; neverthe-

less, the prime rate remains exceptionally high relative to other short-

term interest rates. Outstanding commercial paper of nonfinancial firms

moved lower on balance over the last two months; bond offerings became

scarcer in January, but surged as the market rallied on February 1. Long-

term issuance by state and local governments in recent weeks has been

quite limited. Consumer debt growth slowed in the fourth quarter and bank

data for January suggest continued weakness. The survey of lending

officers conducted last month showed still small, but growing, reluctance



-6-

to lend to consumers and a tightening of standards in home mortgages.

Federal borrowing, by contrast, has remained quite robust and is estimated

to be supporting total debt growth through January at around the midpoint

of its 4-1/2 to 8-1/2 percent provisional monitoring range.

Long-Run Strategies

(8) Three long-run strategies are presented in the table below

as background for Committee consideration of ranges for money and credit

growth for 1991. The first, or baseline, strategy takes the staff's

greenbook forecast of output and inflation over 1991 and 1992. The eco-

nomic indicators received since the greenbook would seem to suggest

slightly greater weakness currently, but the half-point reduction in the

funds rate should be sufficient to offset that weakness and to restore

output to its greenbook level by the latter part of this year. Indeed, to

hold GNP to the greenbook path in late 1991 and 1992, interest rates need

to begin to edge higher later this year, reaching the levels assumed in

the greenbook. For 1993-1995 the baseline strategy extends the logic of

the greenbook forecast--the maintenance of a small margin of slack in the

economy to achieve a gradual deceleration of prices--out for three more

years. Strategy II embodies a tighter monetary policy, as indexed by

1 percentage point slower M2 growth each year, while strategy III involves

an easier policy, indexed by 1 percentage point faster M2 growth. The

baseline forecast for years beyond 1992 is based on simulations using the

Board's large-scale econometric model; the other strategies are derived

from the baseline using that econometric model.

(9) In all of these strategies, growth of M2 remains restrained

in 1991 and 1992 relative to income after allowing for the influence of

market interest rates, owing to continued contraction in depository credit

and investor concerns about the health of the banking system. Subse-

quently, with the economic recovery progressing and unusual restrictions



on credit availability and credit terms gradually lifting, bank lending

strengthens and banks begin to compete more actively for retail deposits.

As a result, M2 quickens after 1992 in each of the strategies as growth of

this aggregate returns to a more normal relationship with the expansion of

income. The effects of the easing of credit stringency in the last three

years are offset by tighter fiscal policy--as war-related outlays diminish

and the budget procedures adopted last fall take hold--leaving, on bal-

ance, a small damping influence on the economy in these years.

staff's estimated rate of growth of potential GNP. The modest amount of

slack that accompanies this strategy, as indicated by the 6 percent

unemployment rate--about a half percentage point above the estimated

natural rate--is sufficient to yield a deceleration of costs and prices of

about 1/4 percentage point per year; the inflation rate drops to 3 percent

in 1995. After 1992, nominal interest rates drift lower in line with the

decline in inflation and increased fiscal restraint. This decline in

interest rates buoys M2 growth relative to that of nominal GNP, and the

abatement of the velocity shift keeps M2 growth steady even as nominal

income slows with inflation.

(11) Under the tighter strategy II, the drop in inflation is

more pronounced, to below 2 percent in 1995. Slower M2 growth is achieved

by higher nominal and real interest rates than in the baseline in the

first couple years. These higher rates and the accompanying firmer dollar

damp the economic recovery sufficiently to raise the unemployment rate

through 1994, putting additional downward pressure on inflation. Nominal

interest rates, while higher than in the baseline in the first two years,

thereafter move below those in the baseline as inflation comes down more.

This scenario, along with the others, assumes that the public's outlook

for inflation is based on current and recent inflation experience and does

not allow for credibility effects. To the extent that the public believes

the Federal Reserve's commitment to a disinflation policy, lower inflation

would come with less slack in resource markets.

(12) Under the easier strategy III, output growth would be fast-

er until late in the period but inflation would edge higher. The upward



-11-

tilt to inflation owes to the stronger economy which pushes the unemploy-

ment rate below the natural rate. The pickup in nominal income boosts

demands for M2; to hold M2 growth at only 1 percentage point above the

baseline, interest rates need to rise later in the period, to well above

current levels. This easier strategy thus leads to appreciably higher

nominal interest rates than those embodied in strategies I and II,

although real interest rates remain lower.

(13) The next table presents inflation rates derived from two

different sets of simulations using the P* model, which has been augmented

with a relative price of oil variable. The upper panel uses the P* model

with historical long-run equilibrium velocity, V*, to derive the inflation

implications of the M2 growth rates used in the large-scale model simula-

tions above. These money growth rates, fed through the P* model, yield

greater restraint on prices because this P* simulation, unlike the above

simulations, assumes the recent and prospective unusual strength of

velocity associated with the disruption of the depository intermediation

process is transitory, and velocity returns to an unchanged V* over time.

In contrast, the P* simulations presented in the lower panel assume that

the velocity shifts built into the greenbook and into the large-scale

model exercise are permanent, i.e., imply rising V*. The results are very

close to those of the large-scale model simulations for strategies I and

II. For the easier strategy III, however, the adjusted P* model suggests

noticeably less inflation pressure, perhaps reflecting the more disinfla-

tionary starting point for the P* simulation; P* is appreciably below P at

the end of 1990 even with the upward adjustment to V*.

Long-Run Ranges

(14) The table below presents three alternative sets of ranges

for growth of money and debt over 1991. (Appendix B gives the ranges and

outcomes for money and debt growth since 1979.) Alternative I represents

the provisional ranges selected by the Committee last July; the staff

projections for M2 and debt growth consistent with the greenbook forecast

fall at the midpoint of these ranges. The staff projection of M3, how-

ever, is lower in the provisional range. Alternative II allows for a

somewhat tighter policy stance by reducing the ranges uniformly by 1/2

percentage point. This alternative could be interpreted as more consis-

tent with the 1 percentage point slower M2 growth of longer-run strategy

II in the preceding section. Alternative III permits a somewhat easier

policy through comparably higher limits for money and debt growth. This

-14-

alternative could be viewed as more consistent with longer-run strategy

III discussed above, which embodies M2 growth 1 percentage point faster

than in the staff forecast.

(15) The staff forecast of 4-1/2 percent M2 growth over the four

quarters of 1991 implies a pickup in growth of the aggregate after the

weak expansion evidently in train for the first quarter. Expansion for

the year as a whole is a little higher than last year, given the stimulus

from more rapid nominal GNP growth that is projected and from the recent

policy easings. Even so, M2 growth will be limited by similar influences

as last year. The sum of bank and thrift assets should decline even more

than last year; RTC activity is projected to pick up further and bank

caution in the latter part of 1990 is carried over into 1991, with perhaps

added restraint on the pricing of retail deposits. Higher premiums or

special assessments on deposits to replenish the FDIC fund would reinforce

this tendency. In addition, depositors probably will remain chary about

the health of depository institutions, at least for a time.6 Thus,

despite the drop in interest rates, M2 growth is expected to fall short of

nominal GNP growth by about 1-1/2 percentage points in 1991, as shown by

the increase in M2 velocity on the chart.7

(16) The speed-up in M2 does not show through to M3 because of

the steeper decline in depository credit. Hence, M3 growth is expected at

around 2 percent again in 1991. Many of the retail deposits coming from

thrifts will be picked up by banks, who will use them mainly to pay down

6. Their concerns might be intensified by legislative proposals to
significantly restrict deposit insurance coverage.
7. Projected M2 in 1991 is about 1-1/2 percentage points below that of

the staff M2 demand model--a bit less than the 1990 model miss.

high cost managed liabilities rather than expand their own lending as they

continue their efforts to bolster capital ratios and limit risk exposure.

The ongoing contraction of depository credit in the face of accelerating

income growth is mirrored in an even more rapid gain in M3 velocity (see

chart).

(17) Growth of domestic nonfinancial debt is projected at 6-1/2

percent over 1991. Federal government debt is anticipated to expand

around 12 percent, up a bit from last year, with about 3 percentage points

of this total accounted for by RTC-related outlays. Growth of the debt of

nonfederal domestic sectors this year is likely to decline to a 4-3/4

percent rate, unusually slow relative to GNP. This configuration follows

in part from the prominence of net exports and thus spending by foreign

sectors in projected GNP; nominal gross domestic purchases rise only 1

percent this year, with credit restriction damping borrowing and credit-

intensive spending by domestic sectors. The moderation in debt growth is

particularly marked for households, accompanying weak housing activity and

slow spending for durables. In the nonfinancial business sector, borrow-

ing at banks and in the commercial paper market also will continue to be

damped in part by cautious lender attitudes. Issuance of long-term debt

is anticipated to edge up slightly, and be tilted toward higher quality

issuers in a less favorable environment for restructuring activity. The

worsening credit market situation of many states and localities is

expected to restrain their offerings of debt instruments.

(18) As noted above, the provisional ranges of alternative I

would seem to be broadly consistent the money and debt paths embodied in



-16-

the staff economic forecast. This alternative already represents a

reduction from the ranges of 1990 for M2 and debt. Should the Committee

wish to signal an even stronger commitment to an anti-inflation policy,

alternative II would reduce the ranges a further 1/2 percentage point.

The lower ceilings under this long-run alternative would call for a

prompter tightening of policy should the rebound in economic activity and

associated inflation outcome prove stronger than now anticipated by the

staff and carry through to more rapid money growth. The upper bounds of

this alternative also would inhibit a very vigorous easing in response to

an unexpectedly weak economy. At the same time, the reduced floors for

money growth would indicate a willingness of the Committee to tolerate

rather slow monetary expansion.

(19) Alternative III reverts to the M2 and debt ranges used for

1990, rather than affirming the 1/2 percentage point reductions agreed

to in July, and contains an M3 range 1/2 percentage point higher than the

range used last year and tentatively set for this year. This alternative

would seem most appropriate if the Committee were primarily concerned

about the risk of a deep and sustained recession, especially if that risk

were seen to arise from disruptions to the credit intermediation process

and the associated shortfall in M2 last year. Raising the lower bounds

would suggest a greater willingness to ease policy in the event that slow

M2 and M3 growth were to continue. The upper bounds would ensure more

scope for a pickup in money growth in response to any additional policy

easing that may be warranted by economic developments. And, as the

economy recovers this year, the higher ranges would allow more scope



-17-

before policy tightening were called for in case money growth should

return to a more normal relationship with movements in income and oppor-

tunity costs, reversing the largely inexplicable weakness of recent

quarters. The increases in all the ranges from their tentative specifica-

tion last July could raise questions about Federal Reserve resolve to

contain inflation, though such questioning would be muted in the context

of a recession.



-18-

Short-Run Policy Alternatives

(20) Two near-term policy alternatives are presented below for

Committee consideration. Under alternative B, federal funds trading would

be expected to average around 6-1/4 percent, with the assumption for ad-

justment plus seasonal borrowing remaining at $100 million. Under alter-

native A, the funds rate would decline to the area of 5-3/4 percent.

Alternative A could be implemented by a reduction of the borrowing assump-

tion of $25 million to $75 million.8  Such an approach, while technically

feasible, would place the funds rate below the discount rate and the low

levels of borrowing could add marginally to funds rate volatility. An

alternative approach to achieving the money market conditions of alterna-

tive A would be through another half-point cut in the discount rate com-

bined with maintenance of the borrowing assumption at $100 million. Bor-

rowing has been running somewhat higher, partly as difficulties in adapt-

ing to lower reserve requirements more often necessitated use of the

discount window on non-settlement days to avoid overdrafts. Some of these

difficulties will be alleviated as required reserve balances rise sea-

sonally and banks opt for higher required clearing balances. Still, the

Desk will have to take account of the possibility that demands for excess

reserves could continue to be high and variable. At least for a time,

such demands are likely to continue to be rather unpredictable day to day,

8. Because of the low levels of borrowing at present, the difference
in borrowing between alternatives A and B remains unusually small.
Seasonal borrowing is expected to remain low through much of the inter-
meeting period, but an adjustment to the borrowing assumption may be
needed in March as seasonal borrowing begins its yearly uptrend.



-19-

implying more frequent spikes in borrowing and volatility in the federal

funds rate.

(21) Following the recent series of policy moves by the Federal

Reserve, market participants probably are not anticipating much if any

further easing in the near term. Consequently, maintenance of current

reserve market conditions under alternative B likely would have relatively

little impact on interest rates. The dollar would remain around the lower

levels reached recently, though subject to an unusual extent to political

and military developments. Over a more extended period, however, long-

term interest rates could back up a bit if information suggesting some

revitalization of the economy, as in the staff forecast, led market par-

ticipants to conclude that the easing of monetary policy had run its

course for the current business cycle.

(22) With little market anticipation of an immediate further

easing, money market rates under alternative A are likely to fall roughly

in line with the decline of the federal funds rate. The decrease of pri-

vate rates could be a bit larger than that for Treasury bill rates, as

market participants viewed the policy easing process as providing

increased assurance of a near-term resumption of economic growth and

improved creditworthiness of borrowers in the foreseeable future. The

prime rate would be lowered another 1/2 percentage point, helping to

stimulate growth of bank credit. Judging from recent experience, bond

rates might not decline very much. The dollar would come under signif-

icant further downward pressures.

(24) While money growth will continue to be damped by the

restructuring of depository institutions, the staff expects the lower

market interest rates and opportunity costs of recent months to begin

providing some lift to monetary growth in the near term. Some hints of a

pickup of M2 were already in evidence in January, and an acceleration to

an average pace of about 4-1/2 percent over February and March would be

expected under alternative B. Under the lower money market rates of al-

ternative A, the acceleration would be even greater, to 5-1/2 percent over

the two months. To a large degree, the greater flows into M2 would be

direct toward money market funds, as investors likely will continue to

look askance at depository institutions and the institutions themselves

continue to post relatively unattractive rates. Alternative B would leave

M2 in March only a little above the lower bound of its 2-1/2 to 6-1/2

percent provisional target range. However, given the lags between changes

in interest rates and money demand, the effects of the recent policy eas-

ings still would be boosting money growth through the second quarter,

bringing M2 closer to the middle of its provisional range by June. Under

alternative A, M2 still would be in the lower portion of its range by

March, but would be on a trajectory to move around the midpoint by June.

(25) M3 would be expected to expand at a 3-3/4 percent pace over

the December-to-March period under alternative B and a little more under

alternative A. In both cases this would represent a considerable pickup

from its pace over the previous three months and would leave this aggre-

gate 3 percent at an annual rate above its fourth-quarter base, in the

middle of its 1 to 5 percent provisional range for 1991. The acceleration

mainly reflects greater flows to both M2- and M3-type money funds, given

the temporary boost in their returns relative to market rates. Bank

credit is projected to remain sluggish, increasing at only about a 2 per-

cent rate in the first three months of the year. Thrifts, in turn, are

expected to continue to shrink, though at a slower pace given constraints

on RTC resources. These constraints will hold down Federal debt growth

relative to late last year, and expansion of nonfederal debt is projected

to remain depressed. Overall, the debt of domestic nonfinancial sectors

should increase in the middle portion of its provisional 4-1/2 to 8-1/2

percent range.

Directive Language

(26) Presented below for Committee consideration is draft

language relating to the Humphrey-Hawkins ranges for 1991 and to the

operating paragraph for the intermeeting period.

1991 RANGES

The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and

financial conditions that will foster price stability,

promote A RESUMPTION OF SUSTAINABLE growth in output on a

sustainable basis, and contribute to an improved pattern

of international transactions. In furtherance of these

objectives, the Committee at THIS [DEL: its] meeting [DEL: in July

reaffirmed the range it had] established RANGES [DEL: in February]

for GROWTH OF M2 AND M3 OF ____ TO ____ PERCENT AND ____ TO ____

[DEL: growth of 3 to 7] percent, RESPECTIVELY, measured from the

fourth quarter of 1990 [DEL: 1989] to the fourth quarter of 1991

[DEL:1990]. The [DEL: Committee in July also retained the] monitoring

range [DEL: of 5 to 9 percent for the year that it had set] for

growth of total domestic nonfinancial debt WAS SET AT

____ TO ____ PERCENT FOR THE YEAR. With regard to M3, the

Committee ANTICIPATED [DEL: recognized] that the ongoing restruc-

turing of thrift depository institutions WOULD CONTINUE TO

DEPRESS [DEL: had depressed] its growth relative to spending and

total credit [DEL: more than anticipated. Taking account of the

unexpectedly strong M3 velocity, the Committee decided in

July to reduce the 1990 range to 1 to 5 percent. For



-24-

1991, the Committee agreed on provisional ranges for

monetary growth, measured from the fourth quarter of 1990

to the fourth quarter of 1991, of 2-1/2 to 6-1/2 percent

for M2 and 1 to 5 percent for M3. The Committee

tentatively set the associated monitoring range for growth

of t o tal domestic no nfinancial debt at 4-1/2 t o 8- 1 /2

percent for 1991.] The behavior of the monetary aggregates

will continue to be evaluated in the light of progress

toward price level stability, movements in their

velocities, and developments in the economy and financial

markets.

OPERATIONAL PARAGRAPH

In the implementation of policy for the immediate

future, the Committee seeks to decrease slightly

(SOMEWHAT)/MAINTAIN/INCREASE SLIGHTLY (SOMEWHAT) the

existing degree of pressure on reserve positions, [DEL: taking

account of a possible change in the discount rate.]

Depending upon progress toward price stability, trends in

economic activity, the behavior of the monetary aggre-

gates, and developments in foreign exchange and domestic

financial markets, slightly (SOMEWHAT) greater reserve

restraint (WOULD) might or (SLIGHTLY) somewhat lesser

reserve restraint would (MIGHT) be acceptable in the

intermeeting period. The contemplated reserve conditions

are expected to be consistent with growth of [DEL:both] M2 and



-25-

M3 over the period from DECEMBER November through March at

annual rates of about ____ AND ____ [DEL: 4 and 1] percent, respec-

tively.



APPENDIX A

MONEY STOCK REVISIONS

Measures of the money stock have been revised to incorporate
the results of the annual benchmark and seasonal factor review. The
attached tables compare growth rates of the old and revised series.
These data should be regarded as strictly confidential until their
release scheduled for February 7.

Benchmark Revisions

Data for the monetary aggregates have been benchmarked using
call reports through June 1990 and other sources. These benchmark
revisions boosted growth rates of all three monetary aggregates by about
1/4 point over 1990 but had only minor effects on the quarterly pattern
of growth within the year. Also, estimates of deposits at institutions
that do not file deposits reports were revised back to 1984, resulting
in minor changes to annual growth rates of the monetary aggregates back
to that year.

Seasonal Factor Revisions

Seasonal factors for the monetary aggregates continued to be
estimated by the X-11 ARIMA procedure. Beginning with January 1990, the
deposits components of the monetary aggregates--OCDs, savings deposits,
MMDAs, small time deposits, and large time deposits--have each been
adjusted with seasonal factors computed from data aggregated over banks
and thrifts. Our previous procedure had been to seasonally adjust the
deposit components at banks and thrifts separately, and add up the
adjusted bank and thrift series to arrive at seasonally adjusted deposit
totals. This remains the procedure used for computing seasonal factors
applied to historical deposits data up to December 1989. The new
procedure is applied to data after that month because (1) transfers of
deposits from thrifts to banks have distorted bank and thrift deposit
data individually more than their sum, and (2) staff analysis reveals
that the seasonal patterns of nontransactions deposits at banks and
thrifts are much more similar in the 1980s than they were in earlier
years. Under the new procedure, the same seasonal factors are applied
beginning in January 1990 to both the commercial bank and thrift
components of the following series: MMDAs, other savings deposits,
small time deposits, and large time deposits. With OCDs, where seasonal
patterns show more differences between banks and thrifts, commercial
bank data are seasonally adjusted directly, and seasonally adjusted
thrift OCDs are computed as a residual between the seasonally adjusted
bank OCD series and seasonally adjusted total OCDs.

Overall, revisions to seasonal factors had little effect on the
broad pattern of growth during 1990. For M1 and M2, the new seasonal
factors shift growth into the second quarter of 1990, while M3 growth is
boosted in the fourth quarter and slightly reduced over the balance of
the year.

2. At the February 1979 meeting the FOMC adopted a QI'78 to QIV'79 range for M1 of 1-1/2
to 4-1/2 percent. This range anticipated that shifting to ATS and NOW accounts in New
York State would slow M1 growth by 3 percentage points. At the October meeting it was
noted that ATS/NOW shifts would reduce M1 by no more than 1-1/2 percentage points. Thus,
the longer-run range for M1 was modified to 3-6 percent.
3. The figures shown reflect target and actual growth of M1-B in 1980 and shift-adjusted
M1-B in 1981. M1-B was relabeled M1 in January 1982. The targeted growth for M1-A was 3-
1/2 to 6 percent in 1980 (actual growth was 5.0 percent); in 1981 targeted growth for
shift-adjusted Mi-A was 3 to 5-1/2 percent (actual growth was 1.3 percent).
4. When these ranges were set, shifts into other checkable deposits in 1980 were expected
to have only a limited effect on growth of Mi-A and Ml-B. As the year progressed,
however, banks offered other checkable deposits more actively, and more funds than
expected were directed to these accounts. Such shifts are estimated to have decreased Ml-
A growth and increased M1-B growth each by at least 1/2 percentage point more than had
been anticipated.

(Footnotes are continued on next page)



5. Adjusted for the effects of shifts out of demand deposits and savings deposits into
other checkable deposits. At the February FOMC meeting, the target ranges for observed
M1-A and M1-B in 1981 on an unadjusted basis, expected to be consistent with the adjusted
ranges, were -4-1/2 to -2 and 6 to 8-1/2 percent, respectively. Actual M1-B growth (not
shift adjusted) was 5.0 percent.
6. Adjusted for shifts of assets from domestic banking offices to International Banking
Facilities.
7. Range for bank credit is annualized growth from the December 1981-January 1982 average
level through the fourth quarter of 1982.
8. Base period, adopted at the July 1983 FOMC meeting, is QII'83. At the February 1983
meeting the FOMC had adopted a QIV'82 to QIV'83 target range for M1 of 4 to 8 percent.
9. Base period is the February-March 1983 average.
10. Base period, adopted at the July 1985 FOMC meeting, is QII'85. At the February 1985
meeting the FOMC had adopted a QIV'84 to QIV'85 target range for M1 of 4 to 7 percent.
11. No range for M1 has been specified since the February 1987 FOMC meeting because of
uncertainties about its underlying relationship to the behavior of the economy and its
sensitivity to economic and financial circumstances.
12. At the February 1990 meeting the FOMC specified a range of 2-1/2 to 6-1/2 percent.
This range was lowered to 1 to 5 percent at the July 1990 meeting.
