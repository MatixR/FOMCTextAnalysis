of Governors of the Federal Reserve System.  This electronic document was created 
through a comprehensive digitization process which included identifying the best-
preserved paper copies, scanning those copies,1 and then making the scanned 
versions text-searchable.2   Though a stringent quality assurance process was 
employed, some imperfections may remain. 
 
Please note that some material may have been redacted from this document if that

format.  All scanned images were deskewed (to remove the effects of printer- and scanner-introduced 
tilting) and lightly cleaned (to remove dark spots caused by staple holes, hole punches, and other 
blemishes caused after initial printing). 
 
2 A two-step process was used.  An advanced optical character recognition computer program (OCR) 
first created electronic text from the document image.  Where the OCR results were inconclusive, 
staff checked and corrected the text as necessary.  Please note that the numbers and text in charts and

MONEY MARKET AND RESERVE RELATIONSHIPS

Money markets

Recent developments. After exhibiting considerable tautness

over the first half of January, the general tone of the money market

became somewhat less tight after mid-month. Two developments contributed

to this result. First, there was a sharp swing from a large deficit

to a small surplus in the basic reserve position of major New York City

banks, in response to some seasonal loan repayment, some liquidation

of investments and an enlarged net inflow of CD money. Second, there

has been a continued strong demand for Treasury bills, which has also

tended to spill over into other short-term debt markets.

The recent abatement of pressures in the central money market

has been reflected in some easing of the Federal funds rate, which had

held mainly at 4-5/8 per cent during the first half of January, and

some reduction in dealer financing costs. Treasury bill rates and other

short-term rates extended their earlier advance through mid-January,

but since then bill rates have receded from their peaks. CD rates

posted by several major banks in New York have recently tended to

stabilize at 5 per cent on maturities of around 3 months.

In contrast with the lessening of money market pressures,

yields on intermediate- and long-term Treasury securities have risen

recently after declining in the first half of January. These yields

are currently close to their peaks previously reached around the turn

of the year. Yields in other sectors of the capital market have

shown small mixed changes recently, with municipals relatively stable

but upward pressures developing in the corporate market.

CONFIDENTIAL (FR) -2-

In the four statement weeks ending January 26, net borrowed

reserves averaged almost $50 million, but week-to-week fluctuations

have been exceptionally large. Member bank borrowings averaged $430

million over this period, about the same as in December. Borrowings

were very high in the first half of the period, but dropped sharply

after mid-month.

Prospective developments. While the general economic outlook

and associated credit demands suggest that debt markets may come under

considerable pressure in the months ahead, the near-term outlook indicates

some offsetting influences at least in the shorter-end of the market,

particularly if some seasonal bank loan repayments and demands for short-

term securities continue in evidence. The Treasury's current combination

refunding-pre-refunding operation can also be expected to add to the

seasonal demand for bills. The rate impact of this additional demand

may by now have been discounted by the market, however, as indicated

by the decline of the 3-month bill to 4.56 per cent on January 27, the

day after the financing was announced.

Assuming that net borrowed reserves average around $100 million

during the next four weeks, the 3-month bill rate may average within a

4.55-4.65 per cent range, a set of money market conditions likely to be

construed in the market as consistent with an even keel policy. Departures



CONFIDENTIAL (FR) -3-

from this rate range are distinct possibilities, however, as markets

continue to adjust to a new structure of interest rates in an environ-

ment marked by uncertainties relating to Viet Nam--which may give rise

to short-run interest rate fluctuations over a wider range than has

generally characterized recent years.

In early February, during the period of Treasury financing

and heavy System buying for reserve purposes, the 3-month bill may remain

in the lower end of the range noted. Afterwards the rate might tend to

rise, although that will be strongly influenced by the strength of business

credit demands and the consequent aggressiveness with which banks are

led to bid for CD money.

Treasury financing operations may exert less upward pressure

on short-term markets over the remainder of the current fiscal year.

The Treasury has indicated that it would need to raise only $500 million

of additional new cash in the market, while $7.5 billion of tax bills

will be retired in March and June (typically about two-thirds of these

are turned in for taxes).

In the long-term market, the outlook points to upward pressures

on bond yields. The new 5 per cent coupon offered by the Treasury for

a 4-3/4 year issue may induce some further swapping out of longer-term

Governments. It may also attract investor funds that might otherwise have

gone into private long-term markets, either directly or through financial

intermediaries. The key factors in the bond market, however, will be the

size of the corporate calendar, which appears to be building up, and the

extent to which banks make further portfolio adjustments in Governments

and municipals.



CONFIDENTIAL (FR)

Reserve flows, bank credit, and money

Recent developments. Total and nonborrowed reserves of banks

continued to rise in January, but the annual rates of increase--estimated

at 5.3 per cent and 5.9 per cent, respectively--were lower than the ex-

ceptional December rates. The expansion in reserves supported a 10 per

cent growth in total member bank deposits, slightly less than in December.

U.S. Government deposits showed a substantial increase during the month

as the Treasury raised about $3 billion in new cash. Private time and

savings deposits increased less in January than in December. Private

demand deposits reached a peak in early January and have since declined;

their increase in the month as a whole was less than in December.

Prospective developments. During the first two statement weeks

ending in February, according to projections, the System will have to

supply about $1 billion in reserves through open market operations to

offset reserve drains principally from float and currency movements.

In the following weeks the System is likely to be a small net seller

of securities of about half that amount.

Assuming business loan demand remains basically strong, non-

borrowed reserves in February may increase at a higher rate than in

January, though still below December. Banks may demand more reserves

next month partly because excess reserves had been worked down to

unseasonably low levels in January.



CONFIDENTIAL (FR) -5-

Over the next few months, private demand deposits may increase

at an appreciably slower pace than the 6.4 per cent rate of January,

perhaps between 4 and 5 per cent. In February, Government deposits are

expected to rise further as a result of growing tax receipts and this

will tend to restrain private deposit growth in that month.

Time and savings deposit growth, which was relatively slow

in January, could pick up somewhat in February if the very recent

increased availability of CD money to large city banks continues. But

the new Treasury offering of a 4-3/4 year note with a 5 per cent coupon

could make it harder for banks to attract and retain savings deposits.

All in all, no substantial change is likely in the annual rate of in-

crease for time and savings deposits in the months ahead from the 10

per cent December-January average.

The developments described above would imply a growth rate

over coming months in the daily average bank credit proxy somewhat below

the 9 per cent average of last year.

Explanation of Projections in Table B-1

1. Changes in Federal Reserve credit indicate reserves needed to offset projected changes in
required reserves and factors affecting the supply of reserves.

2. Projected changes in currency outside banks reflect seasonal movements plus an allowance
for growth of about $30 million per week.

3. Projected effects of Treasury operations, included in "technical factors," reflect scheduled
and assumed calls in current two weeks and thereafter, maintenance of Treasury balances with
Federal Reserve at $700 million.

4. Projected changes in gold stock reflect assumed outflow after January at the rate of about
$50 million per month.

5. Projected changes in required reserves reflect estimated seasonal movements in private
deposits, except as indicated in projections in Table B-2, and projected movements in U.S.
Government demand deposits. Government deposit projections are based on anticipated Treasury
receipts and expenditures and the following assumed financing operation: a $100 million
increase in the weekly Treasury bill auction from February 3 to March 31.
