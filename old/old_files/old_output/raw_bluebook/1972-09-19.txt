The attached document represents the most complete and accurate version available 
based on original copies culled from the files of the FOMC Secretariat at the Board 
of Governors of the Federal Reserve System.  This electronic document was created 
through a comprehensive digitization process which included identifying the best-
preserved paper copies, scanning those copies,1 and then making the scanned 
versions text-searchable.2   Though a stringent quality assurance process was 
employed, some imperfections may remain. 
 
Please note that some material may have been redacted from this document if that

MONETARY AGGREGATES AND
MONEY MARKET CONDITIONS

Recent developments

(1) In recent weeks, credit markets have been in a highly sensitive

state, while monetary and reserve aggregates have run ahead of paths indicated

at the last Committee meeting. Since mid-August Treasury bill rates have

risen from 60-80 basis points, and yields on longer-term Treasury and Federal

agency issues have moved up as much as 35 basis points. In other markets,

changes have been more moderate, with increases in short rates ranging up to

38 basis points and in long rates from 10 to 15 basis points.

(2) The sharp rise in Treasury bill rates reflected the cessation

of special demands associated with the Treasury's August refinancing, a shift

of foreign central banks from the buy to the sell side of the market, and

sales of bills in connection with the Treasury's September deficit, including

sales by the Federal Reserve to offset the reserve effect of a sharp decline

in the Treasury cash balance at the Fed. The influence of this large increase

in bill supply was accentuated in late August and early September when the

Federal funds rate broke through 5 per cent. Market expectations turned

bearish, and upward rate adjustments spilled over into non-Treasury markets.

(3) Soon after the last FOMC meeting, RPD growth appeared to be

moving toward the high end of the 5--9 per cent range adopted by the Committee,

and the Desk operated to provide reserves more cautiously. However, because

credit markets proved to be so sensitive to the resulting firmer money market

conditions, the Desk felt compelled to supply some reserve cushion even though



-2-

RPD growth rose above the target range. Desk operations helped to calm

market unsettlement. The average funds rate dropped to about 4.70 per cent

in the statement week ending September 13, although this partly reflected

a sharp drop in bank demand for excess reserves following a bulge in the

week of the Labor Day holiday. Most recently, with security markets more

stable, the Desk has tightened up on supplying reserves with the expectation

that the Federal funds rate might move to around 5 per cent,

(4) Reserves available to support private nonbank deposits now

appear to be growing at about a 12 per cent annual rate for the August-September

target period. Roughly 2 percentage points of the difference between 12 per

cent and the 7 per cent mid-point of the target range is attributable to

larger average excess reserves at banks than had been assumed in the initial

projection. Most of the enlargement of excess reserves occurred during the

Labor Day statement week, when precautionary member bank borrowing over the

holiday period produced average excess reserves for the week totaling $838

million. About 1/2 percentage point of the difference reflects changes in the

multiplier as a result of shifts in the mix of deposits.

(5) Expansion of M1 and M2 in August exceeded growth rates thought

to be consistent with policy alternative B in the last Blue Book by 1/2 to

1-1/2 percentage points (after adjusting for a decrease in the July base).

In the case of M 1 the annual growth rate for August was 6 per cent, as shown

in attached Table 2. However, data for early September suggest that growth of

M1 will be rapid from August to September, and is thus likely to be stronger

in the third quarter than thought at the last FOMC meeting.

(6) The following table compares seasonally adjusted annual rates

of change in major financial aggregates for recent periods with the year

ending in August and with the preceding two calendar years.

Prospective developments

(7) The ensuing paragraphs present various trade-offs between

interest rates and growth in monetary and reserve aggregates. At one limit,

(alternative A), we have shown an expansion in monetary aggregates that involves

essentially no change between now and the first quarter of 1973 in money

market conditions from those recently prevailing. At the other limit

(alternative D), we have shown an M1 path under which growth is curtailed

to a 6 per cent annual rate by the first quarter of next year; this path

implies a full percentage point rise in the Federal fund rate between now

and the next meeting. There are a number of possibilities in between.

Alternative B and C are two, and they involve both a more gradual slowing in

the monetary aggregate and a more gradual tightening of money market con-

ditions.

(8) For each of the four alternatives noted above, the following

table shows RPD growth rates and associated money market conditions that

might be used as operating targets between now and the next meeting of the

Committee. (The tables in paragraph (11) and on pp.8-9 give longer-run paths

for monetary aggregates.) A single maximum likelihood estimate is shown for

the Federal funds rate. At any given RPD target, the strength of demand for

reserves, as well as technical market factors, will of course generate

fluctuation around the funds rate shown. The Committee presumably will wish

to specify a range of fluctuation to be tolerated by the Desk.

1/ Annual rates of growth calculated after adjusting required reserves
component of the RPD series to eliminate the discontinuity from the
change in reserve requirements resulting from the effectuation of
Regulations D and J.

(9) The changes in Regulations D and J, effective September 21,

affect the multiplier relationship between reserves and deposits, and in

the transition period immediately ahead makes that relationship more

uncertain than usual. For one thing, the ability of banks to waive

penalties on reserve deficiencies (up to $433 million initially) will

affect excess reserves to an unknown degree. To the extent that these

potential waivers are not used (either to run deficiencies or to reduce

normal excess reserves), excess reserves will rise. 1/ We have

assumed that 50 per cent is used in the first week and that use

increases to 80 per cent by the end of four weeks. For another thing,

the effect on required reserves resulting from Regulations D and J is

particularly complicated. Though Regulations D and J together will

lower required reserves for a given level of gross deposits, banks as a

1/ In our figures excess reserves, RPD, total reserves, and nonborrowed
reserves have been adjusted to include the $433 million of potential
waivers, since these are in effect reserves that can be utilized by the
banking system.



-6-

whole will have greater required reserves from the effect of Regulation J

alone, because faster reserve crediting will reduce cash items and hence

increase required reserves. 1 / But we cannot be very certain at this point

as to the distribution by individual banks of the Regulation J effect on

reserves and, therefore, of the effect on the reserve-deposit multiplier--

particularly given a totally new reserve requirement structure to evaluate.

(10) Money market conditions will also be affected by other

transitional uncertainties affecting the behavior of banks themselves. The

long lead time between announcement and effectuation of the new regulations

and the intensive educational work undertaken by Federal Reserve officials

would suggest a relatively smooth transition. But it is likely that banks

may hold somewhat more excess reserves than normal for a while in

adapting to the faster inflow and outflow of reserve funds under Regulation J

and also in not fully adjusting immediately to the reduction in requirements

under Regulation D. There may also be money market churning, and perhaps

more volatility in member bank borrowings, if inflows and outflows of

reserve funds differ from bank expectations in the initial stages of the new

regulations.

(11) Paths for the monetary aggregates consistent with the initial

RPD and money market conditions shown in paragraph (8) are indexed below

by rates of change (SAAR) for M1. Detailed figures for all the usual

monetary aggregates, including various measures of reserves, are shown in

the tables on pages 8 and 9.

1/ The disappearance of cash items on banks' books (and also of float
on Fed Books) as a result of new Regulation J will also result in an upward
level adjustment in measured money supply. This adjustment will be made at
the time of our annual revision. The adjustment will not affect growth rates.

(12) Under alternative A, the Committee would be aiming at a

constellation of reserve and money market conditions--essentially involving

no change through the first quarter of '73 in money market conditions from

those prevailing on average in the past few weeks--that would reduce M1

growth only modestly from the rapid 10-1/2 per cent rate expected in the

third quarter. Some slowing in M1 demand in the fourth and first quarters

would be in prospect from the lagged effects of the recent rise in short-

term rates. But by the end of the first quarter, operations under alternative A

would probably have set in train forces leading to quite rapid M1 growth as

1973 progresses, assuming the rate of expansion in nominal GNP remains strong.

(13) The monetary aggregates under alternative B and C are con-

sistent with progressive firming in reserve and money market conditions over

the months ahead; however, alternative B moves in this direction more

gradually than alternative C. The first stage of firming, between now and

the next meeting of the Committee, would probably result in a Federal funds

rate moving up to a range around 5-1/8 per cent under B and around 5-3/8 per

cent under C. But the funds rate would probably need to rise in added stages

1/ The dollar level of the reserve series includes $433 million of potential
reserve deficiencies on which penalties can be waived for a transition period
in connection with bank adaptations to revised Regulation J.

2/ For ease of analysis, annual rates of growth have been calculated after
adjusting the required reserve component of the reserve series to eliminate
the discontinuity from the change in reserve requirements resulting from
the effectuation of Regulations D and J. The amount of adjustment for the
RPD series is $815 million in September, $2,740 million in October, and
$2,700 million in November.

NOTE: The level of the reserve series in September and ensuing months is
not comparable with previously projected figures for those months since
they are now projected to reflect the impact of Regulations J and D.
Rates of growth are also not comparable because we have now included the
estimated impact on excess reserves of potential waivers of deficiency in
connection with Regulation J. Old figures are still shown in the appendix
tables.



-10-

to around 5-3/4 and 6 per cent, respectively, under the two alternatives

by mid-December, as RPD growth was further restrained to reduce M1 expansion

to the annual rates shown for the first quarter in the table in paragraph (11).

(14) Alternative D sets a path which is expected to result in a prompt

upward move of interest rates. The funds rate, for example, would probably

rise to around 6 per cent within a month and then level off. Such a rise

in interest rates would permit a reduction in the growth of M1 to about a

6 per cent annual rate by the first quarter of next year.

(15) The behavior of monetary aggregates other than M1 is shown,

as noted earlier, in the tables on pages 8-9. Key developments affecting

these aggregates are: (a) a slowing in the growth of time deposits other

than large CD's in reflection of recent rises in market interest rates and,

particularly in the cases of alternatives C and D, of further rises; and

(b) continued sizable demand by banks for large CD funds associated with

sustained strong loan demand.

(16) With respect to interest rate developments in the period

before the next Committee meeting, any further increases may be quite modest

if recently prevailing money market conditions were continued. Short-term

rates have adjusted to a more normal relationship to the recently prevailing

funds rate, and the prospective volume of new security offerings in corporate

and municipal bond markets appears moderate. However, bill rates may be

affected by the forthcoming monthly Treasury auction raising $600 million of

new cash, by anticipations of cash borrowings in October and November, and

also by increased foreign central bank selling of bills if a sizable reflow

of dollars should develop.



-11-

(17) Recent investor hesitancy and a still relatively large

overhang of dealer bill positions suggest that credit market conditions

remain quite sensitive to indications of change in monetary policy. A

rise in the Federal funds rate to somewhat above 5 per cent, as contemplated

in alternatives B or C, would very likely lead to further upward adjustments

in short-term rates, with the 3-month bill rate moving up in a 4-3/4--5-1/2

per cent range. Short rate increases would be greater under alternative C

than under B, and the probability of reviving expectations of a discount

rate increase would also be commensurately greater. Long-term market rates

would probably rise somewhat, particularly if a rising funds rate were

viewed as the beginning of a more sustained tightening in monetary policy.

Upward market rate adjustments would, of course, be quite sharp under

alternative D.



-12-

Prooosed directives

(18) Presented below are four alternative formulations for the

operational paragraph of the directive, which might be taken to correspond

to the similarly lettered policy alternatives discussed in the preceding

section:

Alternative A

"To implement this policy, while taking account of developments

in [DEL: capital] CREDIT markets, [DEL: and] international developments, AND THE

EFFECTS OF BANK REGULATORY CHANGES, the Committee seeks to achieve

bank reserve and money market conditions that will support [DEL: moderate]

SOME MODERATION OF growth in monetary aggregates over the months

ahead."

Alternative B

"To implement this policy, while taking account of developments

in [DEL: capital] CREDIT markets, [DEL: and] international developments, AND THE

EFFECTS OF BANK REGULATORY CHANGES, the Committee seeks to achieve

bank reserve and money market conditions that will support SOMEWHAT

MORE moderate gr wth in monetary aggregates over the months ahead."

Alternative C

"To implement this policy, while taking account of developments

in [DEL: capital] CREDIT markets, [DEL: and] international developments, AND THE

EFFECTS OF BANK REGULATORY CHANGES, the Committee seeks to achieve

bank reserve and money market conditions that will support MORE

moderate growth in monetary aggregates over the months ahead."



-13-

Alternative D

"To implement this policy, while taking account of developments

in [DEL: capital] CREDIT markets, [DEL: and] international developments, AND THE

EFFECTS OF BANK REGULATORY CHANGES, the Committee seeks to achieve

bank reserve and money market conditions that will support moderate

growth in monetary aggregates over the months ahead."

(19) In all four alternatives it is proposed to indicate that

account is to be taken of "credit" rather than "capital" market developments

in order more explicitly to encompass short- as well as long-term interest

rates in the instruction. This is proposed on the assumption that the

Committee would want the Manager to modify his operations in the event

some unusual combination of factors subjects bill and other interest rates

to undesired upward pressure. In alternative D (and also to lesser extents

in C and B) the same language could be interpreted as calling for adapting

Desk operations as necessary to facilitate orderly market adjustments to

the higher interest rate levels foreseen.

(20) The Committee has often interpreted an instruction to take

account of "international developments" as calling for the use of operating

techniques designed to minimize downward pressures on short-term interest

rates. At times, however, some members have favored retaining such an

instruction for other reasons, such as to avoid the inference that might

be drawn from its deletion that the Committee had decided to give less

weight to international considerations. If the reference is retained at

this time, it presumably would be for the latter type of reason, particularly

with the forthcoming IMF meeting in view.



-14-

(21) It is proposed in all four alternatives to add "the effects

of bank regulatory changes" to the list of considerations to be taken into

account, in view of the uncertainties surrounding bank response to the

announced revisions of Regulations D and J.
