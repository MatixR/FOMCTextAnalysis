MONETARY POLICY ALTERNATIVES 

Recent Developments 

(1) The FOMC’s decision at its September meeting to leave the federal funds 

rate target unchanged at 5¼ percent was largely anticipated by financial market 

participants.  Similarly, the wording of the accompanying statement roughly matched 

the market consensus, leaving the expected path of interest rates little changed in 

response. 1  Over the intermeeting period, investors remained virtually certain that the 

federal funds rate target would hold steady for the remainder of this year.  

Expectations for policy further ahead, though, moved as much as 30 basis points 

lower early in the period in response to a few data releases with a weakish cast.  In 

recent weeks, however, those declines were rolled back in the wake of speeches by 

FOMC members and the minutes of the September meeting—which were reportedly 

read as emphasizing the risks to inflation—as well as stronger-than-expected 

economic data.  The market response to these releases was probably heightened by 

the monetary policy communications.  Futures quotes currently indicate that investors 

expect about 50 basis points of easing during 2007, about what had been anticipated 

before the September meeting (Chart 1).  Respondents to the Desk’s survey of 

primary dealers also expect the FOMC to ease policy during 2007, although by 

somewhat less than implied by futures market quotes.  Investors became a bit more 

confident in their expectations about monetary policy in that the implied probability 

distribution for the federal funds rate from options on Eurodollar futures contracts 

maturing in about six months narrowed further, with about 20 percent probability 

                                           
1 The effective federal funds rate averaged near its intended level over the intermeeting 
period.  The Desk purchased $1½ billion of Treasury coupon securities in the market and 
redeemed $3¾ billion of coupon securities.  The volume of outstanding long-term RPs 
increased by $2 billion.

weight now being placed on tightening and 45 percent being placed on easing by then.  

Forward-looking implied volatilities derived from longer-term interest rate derivatives 

also remain near historical lows (see box on following page). 

(2) Yields on nominal and inflation-indexed Treasury coupon securities rose 

slightly, on net, over the intermeeting period.  Inflation compensation for next year 

declined modestly, likely reflecting a further fall in spot energy prices, but was largely 

unchanged at longer maturities.  Survey data pointed to a decline in household short-

term inflation expectations.  Trading conditions in the Treasury securities market 

remained healthy despite reports of substantial liquidations of short positions in 

Treasury issues by some large hedge funds (Chart 2).  Similarly, the winding down of 

Amaranth, a hedge fund that posted losses in excess of $6 billion in energy trading 

and that had positions in several other markets, left no discernible imprint on the 

functioning of markets.   

(3) Broad equity indexes rose 4 to 5 percent over the intermeeting period.  

Investor optimism was reportedly buoyed by a relative paucity of profit warnings 

ahead of scheduled third-quarter earnings announcements and, in the event, by 

aggregate earnings news that has thus far outstripped expectations with about one-

fifth of the S&P 500 firms having reported; analysts’ estimates now suggest that 

earnings for the third quarter will come in 15 percent above the levels of a year ago.  

The drop in oil prices may also have supported share values.  Equity implied 

volatilities remain near historical lows.  Spreads of investment-grade corporate bond 

yields over those on comparable Treasury securities held steady, while those on 

speculative-grade corporate bonds narrowed a little.  Corporate credit quality 

remained solid, with expected and realized bond default rates staying very low.   

(4) The trade-weighted index of the dollar versus major foreign currencies rose 

about 1 percent on balance over the intermeeting period, with the gains spread evenly

Implied volatility, realized volatility, and turning points in monetary policy 
 
Measures of interest rate uncertainty have stayed near historical lows during the past 
few months.  For example, implied volatilities derived from options on two- and ten-
year swap contracts, shown by the black lines below, remain near lows observed in 
the past six years.   
 
Implied volatility could reflect both expected volatility over the horizon of the option 
and a premium for volatility risk.  Past volatility likely informs investors’ expectations 
of future volatility, and realized volatilities on two- and ten-year swap rates are still 
near sample lows after having edged a bit higher over the intermeeting period.  The 
subdued level of realized volatility notwithstanding, some commentators find 
currently low implied volatilities particularly puzzling given that monetary policy 
might be at a “turning point,” denoted by the shaded regions below.*  However, 
reduced-form econometric models that include realized volatility and other variables 
generally indicate that implied volatility is not greater during the periods between 
easing and tightening cycles.  
 
 

* Historical turning points refer to periods between the last increase (decrease) in the target of a tightening (easing) 
cycle and the first decrease (increase) in the target of a subsequent easing (tightening) cycle.  For the purposes of this 
analysis, the period after the June 2006 FOMC meeting is presumed to be a turning point, although the results reported 
here are insensitive to that assumption.

against most currencies (Chart 3).2  Both nominal and real yields on long-term 

government bonds in foreign industrial countries moved roughly in tandem with 

those on comparable U.S. securities.  Major foreign stock markets also recorded gains 

similar to those in the United States.  On October 5, the European Central Bank 

raised its main policy rate 25 basis points, the fifth such increase in the present round 

of tightening.   

(5) The dollar was down slightly over the intermeeting period against an index 

of currencies of our other important trading partners, led by declines of 2 and 

1 percent against the Brazilian real and the Mexican peso, respectively.  Stock prices in 

most Latin American and Asian markets recorded solid gains over the period.  Prices 

of Thai financial assets dropped after the September 19th coup, but they ended the 

period higher on balance.  More recently, South Korean equity prices fell somewhat 

on news of the nuclear test in North Korea and have since only partially recovered. 

(6) Domestic nonfinancial sector debt is estimated to have expanded at an 

annual rate of 6½ percent in the third quarter, in line with the second-quarter pace, as 

a pickup in government debt growth was likely offset by a moderation in business and 

household debt growth (Chart 4).  Consumer credit slowed noticeably over the 

summer, and mortgage debt growth is anticipated to have dropped further in the third 

quarter, owing largely to an expected further deceleration in house prices.  In the 

business sector, growth in C&I loans weakened substantially in September but was 

quite strong for the third quarter as a whole.  Bank lending to businesses through 

commercial real estate loans slowed during August and September, a pattern 

consistent with results from the October Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey, which 

indicated a weakening of demand and a tightening of credit standards for such loans.

(7) M2 grew modestly in the third quarter, evidencing the lagged effects of 

prior increases in opportunity costs and slow growth in nominal spending.  Strong 

advances in small time deposits and retail money funds offset a runoff in liquid 

deposits.  The stock of currency was about flat, owing to continuing weak overseas 

demand for U.S. banknotes.  

Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) Page 9 of 42



Medium-Term Strategies 

(8) Over the intermeeting period, incoming data on economic activity and 

inflation were mostly consistent with the staff’s September projection.  Accordingly, 

the latest Greenbook forecast continues to point to below-trend economic growth 

and gradually ebbing core inflation.  As in September, the forecast is predicated on an 

assumption that the Committee maintains the current stance of policy through mid-

2008 and then eases slightly.  Long-term Treasury yields follow a path similar to that 

projected in September, that is, rising marginally as investors come to realize that 

policy is unlikely to be eased next year.  Stock prices once again are anticipated to 

increase at about a 6½ percent annual rate, but from a level that is about 3½ percent 

higher than anticipated in the previous forecast.  The foreign exchange value of the 

dollar is again assumed to depreciate gradually.  Given recent developments in energy 

markets, oil prices in the near term are assumed to be about $5 per barrel lower than 

in the September projection, but that difference largely unwinds over the next two 

years.  Against this backdrop, real GDP growth is expected to slow to around a 

1½ percent annual rate in the second half of this year, just a touch softer than in the 

September Greenbook.  Thereafter, economic growth picks up gradually to about a 

2½ percent pace in 2008, which brings it up to the staff’s estimate of the expansion of 

potential GDP.  The sluggish performance over the next few quarters pushes the 

unemployment rate up to a little above 5 percent.  The flattening out of energy and 

other commodity prices, combined with an expected deceleration in import prices and 

slight cooling in product and labor markets, nudges core PCE inflation down from an 

annual rate of around 2¼ percent in the second half of 2006 to close to 2 percent by 

the end of the forecast period.  Headline PCE inflation is projected to slow to an 

annual rate of less than 1 percent in the second half of this year, reflecting the recent 

sharp declines in consumer energy prices, but to rebound to 2.7 percent in 2007 and 

2.1 percent in 2008. 

Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) Page 10 of 42



(9) To shed light on the economic outlook and policy strategies at a longer 

horizon, the FRB/US model was used to construct an illustrative extension of the 

Greenbook forecast beyond 2008 based on a set of medium-term assumptions 

together with some judgmental adjustments.  Important influences on the inflation 

outlook include trend multifactor productivity growth of about 1¾ percent per year, 

approximately flat energy prices, and a pickup in real dollar depreciation to an average 

rate of 3 percent per year.  Based on these assumptions, the unemployment rate 

would need to be a bit above the staff’s assumed long-run NAIRU of 5 percent to 

keep the core PCE inflation rate stable.  The illustrative extension also assumes that 

the unified federal budget deficit rises gradually from just under 2 percent of GDP in 

2008 to a little over 2½ percent by 2012 and that the assumed pace of dollar 

depreciation and steady growth abroad are sufficient to stabilize the current account 

deficit at just below 8 percent of GDP.  Further assuming that both term and risk 

premiums on bonds gradually move back to their historical norms, the real funds rate 

would need to decline to around 2 percent to keep output expanding along its 

potential path. 

(10) The value of the equilibrium real federal funds rate (r*) is subject to 

substantial uncertainty, which can be seen in the range of different estimates reported 

in Chart 5.  The Greenbook-consistent measure of short-run r*—the value that would 

close the output gap over the next twelve quarters—has remained around 2½ to 

2¾ percent since the June Bluebook, reflecting the relatively small revisions since the 

start of the summer in the staff’s assessment of the strength of aggregate demand 

relative to potential output.  This judgmental estimate currently lies just above the 

range of the three model-based measures of short-run r*.  Model-based estimates of 

the medium-run value of r*—the real rate consistent with output at potential at a 

horizon of about seven years, on the assumption that monetary policy acts to close

the output gap over the next several years and keep it closed thereafter—are also close 

to the value implicit in the illustrative Greenbook extension. 

(11) Medium-term implications of alternative monetary policy strategies  

can be assessed using optimal control simulations of the FRB/US model.  In these 

simulations, policymakers and participants in financial markets are assumed to 

understand fully the forces shaping the economic outlook (as summarized by the 

extended Greenbook projection), whereas households and firms form their 

expectations using more limited information.  The optimal path of policy balances 

three stabilization objectives:  keeping core PCE inflation close to a specified goal; 

keeping unemployment close to the long-run NAIRU; and avoiding sharp changes in 

the nominal federal funds rate.  The optimal policy and associated macroeconomic 

outcomes depend on the level of the inflation goal and the weights assigned to the 

stabilization objectives; these paths also reflect both the structure of the FRB/US 

model and the specific assumptions embedded in the extended Greenbook outlook. 

(12) The first set of simulations, shown in Chart 6, explores the implications of 

alternative goals for core PCE inflation, assuming that policymakers place equal 

weights on the three stabilization objectives.  With an inflation goal of 2 percent 

(denoted by the solid lines), the optimal control simulation prescribes a nominal funds 

rate of about 5¼ percent through the end of next year followed by a gradual decline 

to about 4¼ percent by the end of the decade.  Unemployment remains a bit above 

the long-run NAIRU of 5 percent and core inflation remains slightly above the 

2 percent goal through 2012, reflecting the balancing of the inflation and employment 

objectives in an environment in which steady dollar depreciation is generating 

persistent upward pressure on domestic inflation.  With an inflation goal of 

1½ percent (the dashed lines), the optimal policy prescribes a funds rate path that 

rises to nearly 6 percent next year before declining to about 3½ percent by 2012.  In 

this case, the unemployment rate peaks at about 5½ percent later this decade while

core inflation declines gradually towards its goal.  The slow pace of disinflation is 

importantly shaped by the high output costs associated with lowering long-run 

inflation expectations in FRB/US and by the relative weights that policymakers are 

assumed to place on their inflation and unemployment objectives. 

(13) Chart 7 depicts two alternative scenarios that illustrate, for an inflation goal 

of 1½ percent, how policymaker preferences and the costs of disinflation influence 

the policy path in optimal control simulations.  In the first scenario (the dashed lines), 

policymakers place considerably greater relative weight on achieving the inflation 

objective, rather than placing equal weight on inflation and unemployment 

stabilization as in the benchmark scenario (the solid lines).  With a greater focus on 

the inflation objective, the optimal funds rate path continues to rise well into 2008 

and remains on a track about 50 basis points higher than in the benchmark scenario 

for several years thereafter.  As a result, the unemployment rate rises to nearly 

6 percent, helping push core inflation closer to the 1½ percent goal by the end of the 

decade.  The second scenario maintains the baseline assumption that policymakers 

place equal weights on the three stabilization objectives, but departs from the model’s 

standard equation for the evolution of long-run inflation expectations; in particular, 

this scenario posits that unexpectedly tight monetary policy directly induces wage and 

price setters to mark down their assessment of the policymakers’ inflation goal, 

thereby diminishing the amount of economic slack needed to reduce actual and 

expected inflation in the FRB/US model.3  The optimal policy in this case (the dotted 

                                           
3 More specifically, the learning mechanism assumes that wage and price setters believe that 
monetary policy is determined by a Taylor rule for which all the parameters are known 
except the inflation goal.  The level of the nominal funds rates therefore provides a signal of 
the inflation goal that wage and price setters use to update their expectations of long-run 
inflation—a channel that is absent from the other model simulations in which wage and 
price setters use only past inflation to update their assessment of long-run inflation.  This 
change in the learning mechanism lowers the sacrifice ratio—the cumulative amount of 
excess unemployment needed to lower inflation one percentage point—from over 6 in the

lines) prescribes a near-term rise in the funds rate to about 6¼ percent by mid-2007, 

with subsequent policy easing as long-term inflation expectations converge to the 

inflation goal.  The more favorable policy tradeoff is readily apparent in this scenario:  

Core inflation descends more quickly towards the 1½ percent goal even though the 

unemployment rate is only modestly higher than the long-run NAIRU. 

(14) These optimal control policies prescribe broadly similar and relatively stable 

funds rate paths over the next two years, in part because all of the simulations are 

premised on the same set of assumptions regarding the medium-term outlook.  The 

upper portion of Chart 8 provides some information on the extent of uncertainty 

about the future course of monetary policy.  The left panel depicts confidence 

intervals for the range of federal funds rate outcomes implied by stochastic 

simulations of the FRB/US model, assuming that monetary policy is well-

characterized by an estimated outcome-based rule and that the shocks hitting the 

economy are typical of the experience over the past two decades.  In the absence of 

any shocks, the outcome-based rule (denoted by the dashed line) prescribes a funds 

rate path that remains between 5¼ and 5½ percent through mid-2007 and then 

declines gradually to about 5 percent.  The stochastic simulations indicate a 70 percent 

probability that the prescriptions of the outcome-based rule will fall in the range of 

4 to 6½ percent during 2007.  By comparison, confidence intervals implied by options 

prices on federal funds and Eurodollar futures contracts (right panel) point to 

noticeably less uncertainty in financial markets regarding the prospective path of 

policy over the next two years. 

(15) While optimal control analysis necessitates the use of a macroeconomic 

model such as FRB/US, simple policy rules based on a limited set of variables can 

serve as benchmarks for monetary policy strategy, and the near-term prescriptions of

of the early 1980s.

such rules can be obtained without specifying any particular model.  As shown in the 

lower portion of Chart 8, the rules proposed by Taylor (1993, 1999) prescribe a funds 

rate of about 4½ to 4¾ percent, depending on the inflation objective (either 2 or 

1½ percent).  A higher funds rate of 5¼ to 5½ percent is prescribed by a variant of 

the Taylor (1999) rule—introduced in the August Bluebook—that incorporates a 

value of r* that is 75 basis points higher than in the original rule.  Finally, with an 

inflation objective of 1½ percent, the first-difference rule—whose prescriptions do 

not depend on the level of the output gap or any particular value of the equilibrium 

real interest rate—calls for a distinct upward tilt to the path of policy, with the funds 

rate rising to 5¾ percent by the first quarter of next year; in contrast, with a 2 percent 

inflation goal, the first-difference rule is consistent with holding the funds rate at its 

current level.

Short-Run Policy Alternatives 

(16) This Bluebook presents three formal policy alternatives for the Committee’s 

consideration, associated with the draft statements in Table 1.  Under Alternatives A 

and B, the Committee would again leave the stance of monetary policy unchanged at 

this meeting; Alternative A would indicate that the Committee has no clear view as to 

the likely future direction of policy, whereas Alternative B would repeat the statement 

from September that further policy tightening may prove necessary.  Under 

Alternative C, the Committee would increase the target rate 25 basis points at this 

meeting and continue to stress upside risks to inflation.  In all three, the Committee 

would acknowledge that economic growth appears to have slowed further in the third 

quarter, but the characterization of growth going forward varies across the 

alternatives. 

(17) If the Committee judges that the news since its decision to hold the funds 

target unchanged in September has not significantly altered the outlook for inflation 

and activity, it might be attracted to Alternative B.  A combination of below-trend 

growth and an edging lower in core inflation, as in the staff forecast, may be viewed as 

the best attainable outcome.  With the real federal funds rate around the upper end of 

the range of model-based estimates of its equilibrium value as noted earlier, the 

Committee might judge the current stance of policy as broadly consistent with 

achieving this result.  Moreover, from a risk-management perspective, modest policy 

restraint may be viewed as appropriately weighing the competing risks to inflation and 

economic growth.  The possibility that inflation expectations could begin to drift 

higher and the tightness of the labor market, as evidenced by data on labor 

compensation and reports of difficulties in filing certain positions, may both be 

viewed as pointing to upside risks to costs and prices in the Greenbook projection.  

Despite those upside inflation risks, the Committee may want to refrain from 

tightening in light of the downside risks to economic growth, including the possibility

have the potential to sustain 
inflation pressures.  However, 
inflation pressures seem likely to

and the cumulative effects of 
monetary policy actions and other

resource utilization and of the prices 
of energy and other commodities 
have the potential to sustain 
inflation pressures.  Inflation 
pressures seem likely to moderate 
over time, but the extent and speed 
of that moderation is uncertain.  In 
these circumstances, the Committee 
believed that an additional firming 
of policy was appropriate to bolster 
progress towards achieving price 
stability. 

Assessment of 
Risk 

4.  Nonetheless, the Committee 
judges that some inflation risks 
remain.  The extent and timing of 
any additional firming that may be 
needed to address these risks will 
depend on the evolution of the 
outlook for both inflation and 
economic growth, as implied by

Although the Committee both seeks 
and expects a gradual reduction in 
inflation, it continues to view the 
risks to that outcome as remaining 
to the upside.  The extent and 
timing of any additional firming that 
may be needed to address these 
risks will depend on the evolution of 
the outlook for both inflation and 
economic growth, as implied by

that the housing market could continue to deteriorate.  Holding the federal funds rate 

unchanged would permit additional information bearing on the prospects for growth 

and inflation to accumulate before making a move in either direction.  

(18) With little news since the September FOMC meeting, the Committee could 

essentially repeat its previous statement, but acknowledge softness in the economy in 

the third quarter.  If the Committee wished to include an explicit assessment of the 

prospects for growth, it could also include an additional sentence in row 2 noting that 

“Going forward, the economy seems likely to expand at a moderate pace.”   

(19) Money market futures and options indicate that investors remain confident 

that the Committee will maintain the federal funds rate at 5¼ percent at this meeting.  

Moreover, the Desk’s survey of primary dealers indicates that the accompanying 

statement is expected to replicate broadly the September announcement.  The release 

of a statement along the lines of alternative B, therefore, would not prove a surprise, 

and the market reaction would likely be limited. 

(20) In recent statements, the risk assessment has pointed to upside risks to 

inflation and the possible need to firm policy further.  However, market participants 

appear to attach greater likelihood to policy easing than tightening.  To protest that 

view and to underscore its commitment to reduce inflation, the Committee might 

choose to modify its words to note that “Although the Committee both seeks and 

expects a gradual reduction in inflation, it continues to view the risks to that outcome 

as remaining to the upside.”  The variation in wording might also be seen as having 

the advantage of eliminating repetition, which in the past has led to market 

participants viewing certain phrases as heavily freighted with meaning.  If modifying 

the statement along these lines was successful in increasing investors’ perception of 

the upside risks to inflation, near-term policy expectations might back up somewhat 

and short-term Treasury yields rise.  In this case, the value of the dollar on foreign 

exchange markets would likely edge higher, and stock prices could fall. 

Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) Page 22 of 42



(21)  In contrast, the Committee might now be more concerned about the 

downside risks to growth, perhaps in part as a result of the sharp slowing estimated 

for the third quarter.  If so, Alternative A might find some support.  In this 

alternative, the stance of policy would be maintained at this meeting, and the 

statement would indicate that the outlook was such that the Committee did not have a 

clear view as to the likely future direction of policy.  The Committee might judge that 

there is a material probability that growth could prove weaker than in the staff 

forecast, perhaps reflecting a more pronounced housing market adjustment with more 

extensive effects on the rest of the economy, along the lines of the “Housing 

correction with spillovers” scenario described in the Greenbook.  Moreover, if the 

Committee, like the staff, saw only sluggish near-term growth in activity and 

employment, it might be concerned that any additional adverse shocks to demand 

could have a disproportionate impact on the economy.  Maintaining the federal funds 

rate at 5¼ percent for some time would be broadly consistent with the Committee’s 

past behavior as captured in the estimated policy rules presented earlier.  Further, as 

noted in the medium-term policy strategies, the optimal policy path associated with 

pursuit of a 2 percent inflation objective has the federal funds rate remaining near 

current levels for the next year or so, before moving gradually lower thereafter.   

(22) In order to point out the downside risks to growth, the statement 

accompanying Alternative A could note that “there is a risk that the slowdown in 

economic growth may become more pronounced.”  To simplify the statement, the 

Committee might want to remove from the discussion of inflation the reference to 

the high levels “of the prices of energy and other commodities.”  Indeed, the 

Committee might see some merit in this simplification for the other alternatives as 

well.  Given the competing risks to inflation and growth, the risk assessment might 

simply state that “In these circumstances, future policy adjustments will depend on 

Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) Page 23 of 42



the evolution of the outlook for inflation and economic growth, as implied by 

incoming information.”  

(23) Although market participants expect the current target for the federal funds 

rate to be maintained at this meeting, they do not expect a statement that explicitly 

identifies risks to growth as well as to inflation and suggests the Committee is no 

longer predisposed towards policy firming.  Market participants are likely to interpret 

such a statement as implying that the Committee might ease rates sooner than they 

had previously thought—and perhaps by even more than the half point reduction 

already built in for 2007.  As a result, near-term policy expectations would probably 

move lower and shorter-term Treasury yields decline.  The value of the dollar on 

foreign exchange markets would likely edge lower and stock prices rally.  The 

implications for long-term yields would depend on whether the statement caused 

investors to adjust their views about the Committee’s longer-term inflation intentions 

or the appropriate path for the real interest rate.  

(24) If the Committee expected higher inflation than the staff, or if it thought 

the Greenbook forecast was broadly plausible but viewed inflation as remaining 

unacceptably high, it might wish to raise the target federal funds rate to 5½ percent at 

this meeting, as in Alternative C.  This alternative might be favored if the factors 

underlying the increase in core inflation in the first half of this year were viewed as 

likely to be more persistent than envisaged in the staff’s projection, perhaps reflecting 

an increase in inflation expectations as illustrated in the “Higher expected inflation” 

simulation presented in the Greenbook.  In that regard, the Committee may be 

concerned that the current level of inflation expectations is already somewhat higher 

than the objectives cited by a number of policymakers.  (The box on the following 

page discusses various measures of inflation expectations.)  Even if the Committee 

shares the staff’s view that inflation is likely to decline gradually over the forecast, it 

may view the pace of that decline, in which core PCE inflation is projected to remain 

Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) Page 24 of 42



 fall Estimates of inflation expectations 
 
The level of inflation expectations is a key factor affecting monetary policy.  Estimates of 
such expectations can potentially be gleaned from surveys and financial asset prices.  But 
given various technical and measurement issues, these indicators do not typically provide a 
clean read of investors’ expectations of core inflation.  
 
The difference between yields on nominal Treasury securities and those on TIPS contains 
information about investors’ inflation expectations.  However, a number of adjustments are 
necessary to translate the raw spread between nominal and real yields into an estimate of 
core PCE inflation expectations: 
 

• First, the raw spread includes a liquidity premium.  Although the liquidity premium in 
TIPS is estimated to have declined notably over time, and by some recent 
calculations now stands very close to zero, this issue somewhat complicates any 
reading of inflation expectations.  

• Second, TIPS compensate investors for inflation with a two-and-a-half month lag, 
and hence raw prices partially reflect inflation that has already occurred.  Adjustments 
for these “carry effects” are straightforward but imprecise.  

• Third, TIPS payments are based on the non-seasonally-adjusted headline CPI, not 
the core PCE.  The staff’s forecasts of these two series can be used to translate 
between price indexes under the assumption that financial markets have a similar 
assessment. 

• Fourth, the raw spread includes an inflation risk premium.  To separate inflation risk 
premiums from expected inflation, Board staff employs a number of methods based 
on affine term structure models that are necessarily model dependent.   

 
After considering these adjustments and based on the most recently observed differences 
between yields on nominal Treasury securities and TIPS, the staff’s point estimates of 
expected core PCE inflation from the very near term to ten years ahead vary between about 
2.0 and 2.4 percent.  However, the caveats associated with these adjustments suggest 
substantial confidence intervals around these point estimates. 
 
The Desk’s recent survey includes primary dealers’ forecasts of quarterly core PCE price 
inflation from the current quarter through the first quarter of 2008, and the average 
projection across that horizon also ranged from about 2.0 percent to 2.4 percent.  The 
monthly Michigan Survey does not refer to a specific price index, but regressions can be 
used to infer anticipated core PCE inflation from the survey responses.  The most recent 
reading of 2.9 percent over the next twelve months implies expected core PCE inflation of 
approximately 2.6 percent over the same period.  Unfortunately, limited data preclude a 
similar mapping for longer-run expectations.  Finally, assuming the staff’s presumed 
discrepancy between headline CPI and core PCE, inflation expectations for 2007 and over 
the next ten years from the August Survey of Professional Forecasters are about 2.4 and 
2.1 percent, respectively.   

Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) Page 25 of 42



above 2 percent beyond 2008, as unacceptably slow.  In the medium-term strategies 

presented earlier, for example, bringing inflation below 2 percent in the next few years 

involves raising the federal funds rate to about 6 percent over the next several 

quarters.  

(25) In the statement accompanying Alternative C, the discussion of growth 

could be identical to that proposed for Alternative B.  However, in the second half of 

the inflation paragraph, rather than listing the various factors contributing to the 

expected moderation in inflation, the Committee could posit that “Inflation pressures 

seem likely to moderate over time, but the extent and speed of that moderation is 

uncertain.” The discussion of inflation could conclude by stating that “In these 

circumstances, the Committee believed that an additional firming of policy was 

appropriate to bolster progress towards achieving price stability.”  If, despite the 

firming in policy, the Committee continued to be predominantly concerned with 

inflation risks, it presumably would want to leave the risk assessment tilted as was 

proposed for Alternative B.  However, that sentiment could perhaps be conveyed 

more strongly to market participants by adopting the language in paragraph 20 earlier 

in this Bluebook noting that the Committee “both seeks and expects a gradual 

reduction in inflation.” 

(26) The tightening of policy envisaged under Alternative C would catch market 

participants unawares.  Investors would revise up sharply their expectations for the 

path of policy over the next year or so.  Short- and medium-term nominal and real 

rates would rise markedly.  Nominal long-term yields would probably decline if 

market participants concluded that the FOMC was seeking a steeper decline in 

inflation or had a lower objective for inflation than they previously thought.  With real 

rates higher, the foreign exchange value of the dollar would likely rise, and equity 

prices would probably decline, perhaps sharply.

Money and Debt Forecasts 

(27) Under the Greenbook forecast, M2 is projected to expand at around a 

4 percent annual rate in the second half of 2006, reflecting moderate growth in 

nominal income and the restraining effects of past policy tightening.  However, as 

opportunity costs gradually decline given the assumed path of the federal funds rate, 

M2 growth picks up to around a 5 percent annual rate in 2007 and 2008.   

(28) Growth of domestic nonfinancial sector debt is expected to slow to an 

annual rate of around 6¼ percent on average over the forecast horizon, down from 

growth of 9½ percent in 2005.  The growth of home mortgage debt is expected to 

step down considerably, reflecting both a deceleration in house prices and declining 

residential investment.  Business debt growth remains moderate over the forecast 

period, as profits flatten out and firms draw on their accumulated cash to finance 

growing investment spending.  With the budget deficit projected to widen some over 

the next two years, federal government debt is forecast to expand 6 percent in 2007 

and 2008, up from the 4½ percent increase expected in 2006.

information.

Appendix A: Measures of the Equilibrium Real Rate 
 

The equilibrium real rate is the real federal funds rate that, if maintained, would be projected to return 
output to its potential level over time.  The short-run equilibrium rate is defined as the rate that would 
close the output gap in twelve quarters given the corresponding model’s projection of the economy.   
The medium-run concept is the value of the real federal funds rate projected to keep output at potential 
in seven years, under the assumption that monetary policy acts to bring actual and potential output into 
line in the short run and then keeps them equal thereafter.  The TIPS-based factor model measure 
provides an estimate of market expectations for the real federal funds rate seven years ahead.  
 
The actual real federal funds rate is constructed as the difference between the nominal rate and realized 
inflation, where the nominal rate is measured as the quarterly average of the observed federal funds rate, 
and realized inflation is given by the log difference between the staff’s estimate of the core PCE price 
index and its lagged value four quarters earlier.  For the current quarter, the nominal rate is specified as 
the target federal funds rate on the Bluebook publication date.  
 
Confidence intervals reflect uncertainties about model specification, coefficients, and the level of 
potential output.  The final column of the table indicates the values for the current quarter based on  
the estimation for the previous Bluebook, except that the TIPS-based measure and the actual real funds 
rate are the values published in the previous Bluebook. 
  

Measure Description 

Single-equation 
Model  

The measure of the equilibrium real rate in the single-equation model is based on an 
estimated aggregate-demand relationship between the current value of the output gap and 
its lagged values as well as the lagged values of the real federal funds rate. 

Small Structural 
Model 

The small-scale model of the economy consists of equations for five variables: the output 
gap, the equity premium, the federal budget surplus, the trend growth rate of output, and 
the real bond yield. 

Large Model 
(FRB/US) 

Estimates of the equilibrium real rate using FRB/US—the staff’s large-scale econometric 
model of the U.S. economy—depend on a very broad array of economic factors, some of 
which take the form of projected values of the model’s exogenous variables. 

Greenbook-
consistent  

The FRB/US model is used in conjunction with an extended version of the Greenbook 
forecast to derive a Greenbook-consistent measure.  FRB/US is first add-factored so that 
its simulation matches the extended Greenbook forecast, and then a second simulation is 
run off this baseline to determine the value of the real federal funds rate that closes the 
output gap. 

TIPS-based 
Factor Model 

Yields on TIPS (Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities) reflect investors’ expectations of 
the future path of real interest rates, but also include term and liquidity premiums.  The 
TIPS-based measure of the equilibrium real rate is constructed using the seven-year-ahead 
instantaneous real forward rate derived from TIPS yields as of the Bluebook publication 
date.  This forward rate is adjusted to remove estimates of the term and liquidity 
premiums based on a three-factor arbitrage-free term-structure model applied to TIPS 
yields, nominal yields, and inflation.  Because TIPS indexation is based on the total CPI, 
this measure is also adjusted for the medium-term difference—projected at 40 basis 
points—between total CPI inflation and core PCE inflation.

Appendix B: Analysis of Policy Paths and Confidence Intervals 
 
Rule Specifications:  For the following rules, it denotes the federal funds rate for quarter t, while  
the explanatory variables include the staff’s projection of trailing four-quarter core PCE inflation (πt), 
inflation two and three quarters ahead (πt+2|t and πt+3|t), the output gap in the current period and one 
quarter ahead ( *t ty y−  and *1| 1|t t t ty y+ +− ), and the three-quarter-ahead forecast of annual average GDP 
growth relative to potential ( 4 4 *3| 3|t t t ty y+ +Δ − Δ ), and *π  denotes an assumed value of policymakers’ 
long-run inflation objective.  The outcome-based and forecast-based rules were estimated using real-
time data over the sample 1988:1-2005:4; each specification was chosen using the Bayesian information 
criterion.  Each rule incorporates a 75 basis point shift in the intercept, specified as a sequence of  
25 basis point increments during the first three quarters of 1998.  The first two simple rules were 
proposed by Taylor (1993, 1999), while the third is a variant of the Taylor (1999) rule—introduced  
in the August Bluebook—with a higher value of r*.  The prescriptions of the first-difference rule do  
not depend on assumptions regarding r* or the level of the output gap; see Orphanides (2003). 
 

Outcome-based rule it =  1.17it-1–0.37it-2+0.20[1.04  + 1.76 πt  + 3.32( *t ty y− )  – 2.37( *1 1t ty y− −− )]

Forecast-based rule it =  1.16it-1–0.36it-2+0.20[0.89+ 1.74 πt+2|t+2.32( *1| 1|t t t ty y+ +− )–1.40( *1 1t ty y− −− )]

Taylor (1993) rule it = 2 + πt + 0.5(πt – *π ) + 0.5( *t ty y− ) 

Taylor (1999) rule it = 2 + πt + 0.5(πt – *π ) + ( *t ty y− ) 

Taylor (1999) rule     
with higher r* 

it = 2.75 + πt + 0.5(πt – *π ) + ( *t ty y− )  

First-difference rule it = it-1 + 0.5(πt+3|t – *π ) + 0.5( 4 4 *3| 3|t t t ty y+ +Δ − Δ ) 
   
FRB/US Model Simulations:  Prescriptions from the two empirical rules are computed using dynamic 
simulations of the FRB/US model, implemented as though the rule is followed starting at this FOMC 
meeting.  This quarter’s prescription is a weighted average of the actual value of the federal funds rate 
thus far this quarter and the value obtained from the FRB/US model simulations using the timing of this 
meeting within the quarter to determine the weights.  Confidence intervals are based on stochastic 
simulations of the FRB/US model with shocks drawn from the estimated residuals over 1986-2004.  
  
Information from Financial Markets:  The expected funds rate path is based on federal funds  
and Eurodollar futures quotes.  The confidence intervals for this path are obtained from prices of  
at-the-money options contracts that are traded on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. 
 
Near-Term Prescriptions of Simple Policy Rules:  These prescriptions are calculated using Greenbook 
projections for inflation and the output gap.  The first-difference rule’s one-quarter-ahead prescription is 
computed using that rule’s prescription for the current quarter.

Inflation Indicator Based on M2

Note: P* is defined to equal M2 times V* divided by potential GDP. V*, or long-run velocity, is estimated
using average velocity over the 1959:Q1-to-1989:Q4 period and then, after a break, over the interval from
1993:Q1 to the present. For the forecast period, P* is based on the staff M2 forecast and P is simulated using a
short-run dynamic model relating P to P*. Blue areas indicate periods in which P* is notably less than P.
Gray areas denote the projection period.
