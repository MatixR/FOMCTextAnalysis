MONETARY POLICY ALTERNATIVES

Prepared for the Federal Open Market Committee

By the staff Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System



STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL (FR)
CLASS I - FOMC June 30, 1989

MONETARY POLICY ALTERNATIVES

Recent Developments

(1) Immediately after the May FOMC meeting, the borrowing objec-

tive was raised to $600 million as a technical adjustment to take account

of the effects of surging seasonal borrowing. Federal funds were expected

to continue to trade in a 9-3/4 to 9-7/8 percent range. With reserves

somewhat more plentiful than projected and markets coming to anticipate a

near-term easing of policy, the federal funds rate edged down to around

the lower end of the range, and borrowing averaged $500 million over the

first complete maintenance period following the meeting. In early June,

part way through the second maintenance period, the borrowing assumption

was reduced to $500 million, and funds were expected to move down to trade

mostly in a 9-1/2 to 9-5/8 percent range. This policy adjustment was made

in light of information suggesting a prospective slackening in inflation

pressures, as the monetary aggregates remained unusually sluggish, eco-

nomic activity moderated, and the dollar firmed. In that and the next

maintenance period, the federal funds rate averaged 9-1/2 percent. Bor-

rowing jumped from $465 million in the second period to $680 million in

the third and final maintenance period, with the latter including $470

million under the seasonal program. Seasonal borrowing this year has

increased even more rapidly than might be suggested by rate relationships

and past seasonal behavior; reports from Reserve Bank discount officers

suggest that heavier demands for crop-production loans along with weak

deposits have contributed to the strength in seasonal borrowing.



(2) Market interest rates declined further over the intermeeting

period, with long-term rates dropping around 3/4 percentage point and

short-term market rates 1/4 to 1/2 percentage point. The prime rate was

reduced 1/2 percentage point to 11 percent in early June. Rates responded

not only to the easing of policy, but also to indications of a continuing

softness in the economy. Prospects for slow growth were seen as suggest-

ing weaker demands for credit and greater scope for the Federal Reserve to

reduce short-term rates further over the near term without adverse im-

plications for inflation. The drop in bond rates brought them to their

lowest levels since early 1987, and produced a slightly greater downward

tilt to the yield curve, albeit through the unusual combination of a

larger drop in long- than in short-term rates. Stock prices rallied

through much of the intermeeting period to reach post-crash highs, fos-

tered by lower interest rates along with the perception that containing

inflation was more likely to be compatible with continued economic expan-

sion. More recently, as doubts about the sustainability of the expansion

emerged, stock prices retreated, generally reversing most of their pre-

vious gains.

(3) The dollar surged from mid-May to mid-June, even as U.S.

interest rates declined and differentials with foreign rates narrowed.

Factors supporting the dollar were better-than-expected U.S. trade data

for March and April, heightened political uncertainties abroad, and

demands for dollar assets given anticipated increases in bond and equity

prices. After reaching highs against the mark and the yen on the morning

of June 15 when April trade data were released, the dollar plummeted,



-3-

losing much of its earlier gains over the next two weeks. Reasons for the

sudden drop are not clear,

In addition, net demand for dollars associated with turmoil in China may

have abated following the initial reaction to developments in that

country. Even so, the dollar has been buoyant in recent days, despite

rising interest rates abroad

On balance, the dollar rose by 1-3/4 percent on a weighted average basis

over the period. Total intervention amounted to over

the intermeeting period, of which almost $10 billion was accounted for by

the Desk on behalf of the Federal Reserve and the Treasury.

(4) The broader monetary aggregates have rebounded following

declines in late April and early May when transaction and other liquid

deposit balances were drawn down by unexpectedly large federal tax pay-

ments for 1988. M2 is estimated to have expanded at a 6-1/2 percent rate

in June, bringing growth for March to June to 1-1/2 percent--the rate

specified by the Committee at its May meeting. Growth in June likely has

been augmented by some rebuilding of tax-depleted balances as well as by

the effect of declines in the opportunity costs of holding monetary

assets. After strong runoffs in the first quarter, total thrift deposits

have increased, and in May and June savings and small time deposits grew

more rapidly at thrifts than at banks for the first time since mid-1988.

The pattern for M2 carried through to M3, which expanded at a 6-1/4 per-

cent rate in June after declining at a 1 percent rate in May, when bank

sources of funds were boosted by a large increase in Treasury deposits.

Over the March-to-June period, M3 expanded at around a 2-1/2 percent rate,

compared with the Committee's expectation of 4 percent. The shortfall

seemed to reflect somewhat greater-than-expected reliance on non-M3

sources of funds given credit expansion about as anticipated.

(5) M1 is estimated to have contracted in June at a 6 percent

rate, a much slower rate of decline than in May. Currency resumed a more

normal rate of expansion in June and OCD runoffs slowed sharply, but

demand deposits continued to drop at a double-digit rate. According to

respondents to the Senior Financial Officer Survey conducted in June,

recent weakness in demand deposits largely has reflected the previous

runup in interest rates, working through both compensating balance and

opportunity cost channels, and, for household deposits, tax payments

effects as well. The fall in transaction deposits led to further declines

in both total and nonborrowed reserves in June. With the pickup in cur-

rency, however, the monetary base expanded at about a 4 percent rate after

decreasing on balance in the preceding two months.

(6) Through June, M2 and M3 had expanded from their fourth-quar-

ter 1988 bases at rates of 1-3/4 and 3-1/2 percent, respectively. This

left M2 in June a bit above the lower limit of the parallel band asso-

ciated with its annual range and M3 at the lower edge of its growth cone.

The relatively slow monetary growth over the first half of the year has

reflected in part the restraining impact of the rise in market interest



1
rates through the first quarter. The liquid deposit components of M2,

whose rates adjusted sluggishly, were particularly affected; only small

time deposits and MMMFs, which have yields that adjust fairly rapidly to

market rates, showed robust growth during the first half. In addition,

special circumstances contributed importantly to slow monetary growth this

year. Earlier in the year, the thrift crisis led to considerable outflows

from these institutions. Although staff estimates indicate that the bulk

of these funds was redeployed to other components of M2, some apparently

went outside the aggregates, particularly into Treasury securities, as

suggested by the unusual strength in noncompetitive tenders early in the

year. These outflows are estimated to have reduced first-quarter M2

growth by 1/2 percentage point at an annual rate. In the second quarter,

the unexpectedly large individual tax payments to the Treasury are

estimated to have taken a percentage point from the rate of M2 growth.

Finally, the extreme weakness in demand deposits likely fed through to M2.

(7) Domestic nonfinancial debt is estimated to have continued to

grow in May at a little below the first-quarter pace; fragmentary data for

June do not suggest a significant change in the overall pace of credit

expansion. Growth in federal government debt this quarter has been damped

by the unusually strong tax inflows. Expansion of the debt of nonfederal

sectors picked up a bit in May. Short-term borrowing by nonfinancial

this year is presented in a memorandum, "The Behavior of the Monetary
Aggregates During the First Half of 1989", which has been distributed
with this bluebook. An appendix to this memorandum summarizes the
results of the June Senior Financial Officer Survey.



businesses was much stronger in May even though identifiable merger-

related demands in these markets net of paydowns were muted. Boosted by

the RJR-Nabisco buyout financing in early May and by falling interest

rates throughout the month, longer-term business borrowing likewise posted

a sizable gain. Corporate bond issuance remained strong in June, but

short-term business credit growth was held down by a large paydown of a

merger-related bank loan as well as greater reliance on long-term funds.

Municipal issuance was weak in May, although it picked up in early June in

response to lower interest rates. Available evidence suggests that the

household sector has cut back its credit demands in the second quarter.

Nonfinancial debt is estimated to have expanded from the fourth quarter of

1988 through May at an 8 percent rate, below the 8-1/2 percent midpoint of

its monitoring range.

Long-Run Strategies

(8) As background for Committee consideration of the ranges for

money and credit for 1989 and 1990, the table below presents three alter-

native longer-run strategies for monetary policy through 1991 and their

consequences for output and prices. Strategy I is the baseline forecast,

encompassing the staff greenbook projections and associated policy assump-

tions for 1989 and 1990, with an extension into 1991. Strategies II and

III embody somewhat tighter and easier monetary policies, respectively, as

indexed by 1 percentage point slower and faster M2 growth beginning in the

third quarter and extending through the forecast horizon. The baseline

forecast is judgmental; however, the deviations from baseline associated

with the alternative strategies were derived through econometric model

simulations.

(9) The baseline forecast is built on a monetary policy designed

to bring about a gradual reduction in inflation. That outcome is judged

to require sufficient restraint on demand to reduce the expansion of

output to below its potential rate of growth for a period in order to

relieve pressure on resources. Once a margin of slack in resource markets

has been created, economic growth can pick up somewhat while inflation

rates recede slowly, and the extension into 1991 incorporates such a

pattern. Against a background of moderately restrictive fiscal policy

through 1991 on the one hand and a resumption of dollar decline on the

other, the monetary policy restraint of the past year is judged about

sufficient to produce this result in the baseline. As a consequence, real

interest rates need move very little from here, and nominal rates can edge

down as inflation and inflation expectations moderate. In this

environment, velocity will no longer rise and should begin to decline.

Thus, a pickup in money growth from recent years will be needed to support

the projected pattern of output and prices in 1990 and 1991.

(10) The effects of the alternative growth paths for money are

felt most immediately in output, and then with a lag in inflation rates.

Eventually, the 1 percentage point money growth differentials would be

reflected in 1 percentage point inflation differentials, but this does not

occur for some time. Even so, the slower M2 growth of alternative II

results in more noticeable progress toward price stability by 1991. But

this outcome entails the virtual cessation of economic growth next year



-10-

and a rise in the unemployment rate to 7 percent; this results from the

effects of higher real interest rates and a stronger dollar relative to

the baseline. The faster money growth of alternative III is sufficient to

maintain real growth at around its potential rate and to forestall an

appreciable rise in the unemployment rate. This policy would not result

in any progress against inflation; indeed, inflation would be poised to

accelerate slightly further in 1992.

(11) The table below gives predictions of inflation rates derived

from the P* model using the M2 growth rates of the three strategies.

Interestingly, the P* model prediction using the baseline money path is

indistinguishable from the staff's baseline forecast of inflation. More-

over, at the end of 1991 the predicted level of P would be above its long-

run equilibrium implied by the M2 path (P*), reinforcing the suggestion of

a further moderation of inflation with this strategy. While inflation

rates under the other two alternatives differ from those on the previous

table derived from the large macro model, the contours are very similar:

under strategy II, inflation decelerates by 1991 and would continue to

drop in 1992; under strategy III inflation does not change much through

1991, but because more rapid expansion of M2 would push P* above P during

1991, inflation would accelerate in 1992.

Long-Run Ranges

(12) The table below gives the current ranges for the money and

debt aggregates in 1989 along with the staff forecast for the growth of

these measures consistent with the income and interest rate outlook in the

greenbook. All three aggregates are projected to be comfortably within

their 1989 ranges, with M2 rising well into the lower half of its range by

the fourth quarter of the year, while M3 and debt come in somewhat below

the midpoints of their ranges.

Growth from QIV '88 Memo:
to QIV '89 Current Ranges Staff Forecast

M2 3 to 7 4
M3 3-1/2 to 7-1/2 5
Debt 6-1/2 to 10-1/2 7-3/4

Memo:
M1 -1-3/4
Nominal GNP 6-1/2

(13) An acceleration of M2 growth to 6 percent over the third and

fourth quarters of the year is anticipated. In the greenbook forecast,

nominal GNP growth of 5 percent over the second half of the year is

associated with short-term interest rates remaining essentially at current

levels. Under these circumstances, deposit offering rates on average are

unlikely to move appreciably further over the second half, implying fairly

stable opportunity costs. However, some impetus to M2 growth relative to

GNP will be provided during the second half by the narrowing in oppor-

tunity costs in the second quarter. Also, M2 growth is expected to be

boosted by the continued rebuilding of tax-depleted liquid balances.

Overall, M2 velocity would decline by about 1 percentage point at an



-12-

annual rate over the second half. (The historical and projected behavior

of M2 velocity is shown on the chart on the following page.) The fore-

casted M2 growth over the balance of the year would reverse most of its

first-half shortfall relative to the staff money demand model, so that for

a year as a whole, M2 growth of 4 percent is close to the model's predic-

tion. Along with other liquid components of M2, M1 should strengthen over

the second half, as demand deposit growth resumes and outflows from OCDs

abate. On a June-to-December basis, M1 is expected to grow at a 1-1/4

percent rate, though given its weakness in May and June, this aggregate

would be about flat from the second to the fourth quarter. The first-half

drop in M1 implies a decline of almost 2 percent for the year.

(14) M3 is anticipated to accelerate in the second half of the

year to about a 6-1/2 percent pace, producing growth of about 5 percent

for the year. Bank credit, buoyed by a strengthening in C&I lending, is

expected to expand a little faster than in the first half of the year. At

thrifts, net credit extensions are projected to remain sluggish, held down

by regulatory pressure and action to shrink insolvent institutions, as

well as by continued slow overall mortgage activity. However, with core

deposits picking up, depository institutions are projected to need to rely

less on non-M3 managed liabilities to finance asset growth.

(15) Overall debt growth is anticipated to be maintained in the

second half of the year at close to the 7-3/4 percent average pace of the

first two quarters of the year. Business credit demands may strengthen;

net equity retirements are projected to continue at the record pace of the

first half and the gap between capital spending and internal funds to rise



-13-

a little. The growth of household debt, however, is thought likely to

expand at the reduced pace of the first half, restrained by the upward

trend of interest rates since early 1988. In the mortgage market, while

mortgage lending by thrifts is expected to be subdued, mortgage demands

are expected to be met by other lenders--either directly or through the

process of securitization--without any further widening of spreads. The

Treasury likely will issue debt at a slower pace over the second half,

seasonally adjusted, as outsized April tax payments have reduced its

financing needs.2

(16) The current ranges for 1989 would appear adequate to encom-

pass not only the greenbook forecast, but also money and debt growth

accompanying economic outcomes or policy strategies somewhat at variance

with that forecast. For example, the further 1/2 percentage point easing

of the federal funds rate over the next several months that appears to be

built into the structure of short-term interest rates would not boost

money growth enough to threaten the upper ends of the current ranges,

given the low June starting points. Alternatively, should the first-half

slowdown in the economy prove to represent only a pause, and should an

associated intensification of inflationary pressures induce some policy

firming later in the year, the aggregates still would be likely to run

above their lower bounds. In this circumstance, the effect of higher

short-term interest rates on the aggregates might be partly offset by

higher nominal spending.

2. Treasury borrowing projections for this year and next assume off-
budget financing of the resolution of the thrift crisis.

(17) For 1990, the table below presents three alternative long-

run ranges for Committee consideration, along with the staff forecast

based on greenbook GNP and associated interest rates. Alternative I would

retain the current M3 and debt ranges, but raise the M2 range to encompass

more comfortably the pickup in this aggregate projected for next year.

Alternative II reduces the M3 and debt ranges from 1989, but retains the

M2 range. Under alternative III, ranges for both M2 and M3 would be

reduced by 1/2 percentage point from 1989, and that of debt by a full

percentage point. All the ranges retain the 4 percentage point width

that the Committee adopted for the 1988 and 1989 ranges.3 Such a width

seems appropriate in light of the implications of the relatively high

intermediate-run interest elasticity of M2 combined with considerable

uncertainty about the appropriate path for short-term market rates, along

with continuing questions about the evolution of deposit pricing strate-

gies. In addition, the resolution of the thrift crisis may have an unex-

pected impact on all the money and debt aggregates, if, for example, it

affects the trajectory of S&L asset growth, their funding patterns, or

their deposit pricing.

(18) M2 is expected to grow about in line with the increase in

nominal income next year. In the staff GNP projections, the slowing of

inflation over the course of 1990 could well be accompanied by slightly

lower short-term interest rates than at the end of 1989. As a consequence

velocity might decline a little (chart). This outlook presumes that the

relationship of offering rates at thrifts relative to those at banks is

unlikely to vary much as a result of changes in the regulatory environ-

ment. Demand deposits are expected to expand, albeit less rapidly than

the volume of transactions in keeping with the longer-run trend to econo-

mize on these deposits, as compensating balance requirements stop falling,

and perhaps edge higher. M1 as a whole is expected to record 3 percent

growth over the four quarters of next year, accompanying M2 growth of

6-1/2 percent.

(19) The pickup in M2 shows through to M3, but less than fully.

Credit expansion by depositories is projected to about maintain its 1989

4. The introduction in January of foreign currency deposits, which will
not be included in the aggregates, is not expected to affect the
aggregates materially. Holders of U.S. deposits are not projected to
shift significant amounts from dollar to foreign currency deposits. If
banks did receive an influx of foreign currency deposits that previously
were held abroad, it could affect funding decisions and M3, but such
inflows are not likely to be large given reserve requirements in the
United States.

pace, and with core deposits stronger, depositories could be expected

to cut back on their issuance of non-M3 managed liabilities, as well as

those in M3, resulting in a net boost to M3 growth. Regarding the effects

of the resolution of the thrift crisis on M3, the impact of new capital

requirements on the behavior of solvent S&Ls will depend on the particular

provisions of the bill. In addition, the procedures followed by the RTC

for dealing with insolvent institutions may influence thrift credit

growth, funding needs, and M3. In the staff forecast, asset expansion at

thrifts remains quite subdued, and these institutions provide a declining

share of mortgage credit.

(20) Growth of total domestic nonfinancial debt for 1990 is

likely to slow a little to about 7-1/2 percent. Growth in Treasury debt

is anticipated to ebb further next year as the federal deficit drops.

Despite some further widening of the gap between capital spending and

internally generated funds, corporate debt should grow a bit more slowly

next year if, as assumed, net equity retirements decline appreciably from

this year's elevated pace. For households, the rate of mortgage debt

formation should strengthen as housing activity next year is supported by

reduced mortgage rates. But consumer installment debt likely will slow

further reflecting restrained consumption spending. In the aggregate, the

growth of debt in 1990 will continue to outpace income by about the same

amount as in recent years (chart).

(21) Alternative I gives the most scope for even faster growth of

the aggregates than in the staff forecast. That room might be needed,

especially for M2, should the Committee wish to avert a slackening in

resource utilization as under the long-term strategy III discussed above.

In addition, the money and debt specifications of alternative I would seem

most compatible with a view that the risks for aggregate demand predom-

inantly are on the side of more weakness than in the greenbook. In these

circumstances, faster money growth would be needed to offset the potential

effects of a shortfall in aggregate demand on spending and output. The

increases in the bounds for M2 from the current year's range, though,

could be interpreted by the public as insufficiently guarding against the

possibility of faster inflation.

(22) If, in contrast, inflationary pressures turn out to be more

intense than in the greenbook forecast, perhaps because increases in labor

costs return to a more normal relationship to resource use or the dollar

falls more rapidly than expected by the staff, a substantial uptrend in

interest rates in 1990 might be appropriate. The lower bound of the M2

range in alternative III would allow the most scope for such an outcome,

although those of alternative I or II could accommodate some policy firm-

ing. But only alternative III involves a further reduction in all the

current money ranges and might seem most in accord with reinforcing the

Committee's longer-term commitment to price stability. Scope at the lower

end of the ranges also might be needed if regulatory pressure on thrifts

caused them to be substantially less aggressive in bidding for retail

deposits. However, this alternative allows no margin for faster M2 growth

than in the staff forecast, should that be warranted.

(23) Alternative II lowers two of the ranges, M3 and debt, under-

scoring the Committee's intention to restrain growth rates of money and



-18-

credit over time in moving towards price stability. Retaining the current

M2 range allows some scope for a small decline in velocity should interest

rates trend down in association with either a weaker economy or improving

inflation expectations. At the same time, the M2 range would appear suf-

ficiently low to trigger some policy restraint should inflation pressures

turn out to be stronger than expected and GNP begin to accelerate appre-

ciably.



-19-

Short-Run Policy Alternatives

(24) Three short-run policy alternatives are presented below.

Under alternative B, federal funds would continue to trade in the 9-1/2 to

9-5/8 percent area. Consistent with such unchanged reserve market condi-

tions, adjustment plus seasonal borrowing would be expected to average

$650 million over the coming intermeeting period, up from the present $500

million assumption. That adjustment is suggested in light of recent

experience; seasonal borrowing rose to $500 million near the end of the

last maintenance period and is likely to increase somewhat further over

the coming intermeeting period. Under alternative C, funds would trade

around 10 percent or a bit higher with borrowings of $850 million. The

easing of policy under alternative A might be associated with less than

the usual $200 million reduction in borrowing. Since adjustment borrowing

is close to frictional levels it is not likely to decline much in response

to decreases in the spread, and seasonal borrowing has a fairly low

interest sensitivity. As a consequence, the staff estimates that a funds

rate in the 9 to 9-1/8 percent area under alternative A would be consis-

tent with borrowing of perhaps around $550 million. In any event, the

rather high degree of uncertainty about the borrowing relationship sug-

gests that the Desk again should pursue the borrowing objective flexibly.

(25) Growth of the monetary aggregates over the June-to-September

period under the three alternatives is presented below, along with implied

growth through September from their fourth-quarter bases. (More detailed

data are shown on the table and charts on the following pages.) Under all

the alternatives, the monetary aggregates would strengthen from their



-20-

average pace of recent months as the full impact of recent declines in

rates takes hold. In addition the public is assumed to continue to

rebuild balances depleted by unexpectedly large final tax payments in

April.

(26) Money market rates currently have built in some further

near-term easing of policy and would likely firm if federal funds con-

tinued to trade around 9-1/2 to 9-5/8 percent. Short-term rates would

climb around a quarter of a percentage point. Bond rates could rise as

well, but probably to a limited degree, given the recent softness in the

economy, which is expected to continue in the staff forecast. The

approaching debt-ceiling constraint, which could well affect the mid-

quarter refunding in August, might lead to unusual movements in rate rela-

tionships involving Treasury securities in coming weeks. At the long end

of the market, rates might react temporarily to impending supplies of

Refcorp bonds, should the legislation pass with off-budget financing. The

higher level of U.S. interest rates could postpone the projected depreci-

ation of the dollar for a time.

(27) Under alternative B, M2 would grow at a 6-1/2 percent rate

over the June-to-September period, lifting this aggregate to the bottom of

its annual target cone in September. Despite the small rise in short-term

interest rates expected under this alternative, opportunity costs of hold-

ing M2 balances would remain below levels of the first quarter. Further

contributing to a pickup in M2 growth is the likelihood that outflows from

demand deposits--which have been much larger than expected--will diminish

appreciably and possibly cease over this period, as the recent decline in

market rates is reflected in compensating balance requirements. Retail

deposit growth at thrifts should remain near that of commercial banks, as

it has recently. On a quarterly average basis, M2 would grow at about a

5-1/4 percent annual rate in the third quarter, a bit above the rate of

expansion of nominal GNP in the staff forecast. Its M1 component would

edge higher over the June-to-September period, but owing to the declines

in May and June would decline at a 3 percent rate on a quarterly average

basis.

(28) M3 growth would strengthen to a 7 percent clip over the

June-to-September period under alternative B. Bank credit is projected to

be somewhat stronger in coming months, partly reflecting the possibility

of major corporate restructuring activity, which would be funded initially

by banks. On a quarterly average basis, M3 would grow at a 5-3/4 percent

rate, implying some decline in its velocity. Domestic nonfinancial debt

is expected to expand at a 7-1/2 percent rate from June to September,



-23-

leaving this aggregate 7-3/4 percent at an annual rate above its fourth-

quarter base.

(29) The extent of the easing of policy embodied in alternative A

would be larger than expected by market participants for the very near

term, although the current structure of market rates appears to reflect

expectations of a drop in rates of this magnitude in the next few months.

With federal funds moving immediately to around 9 percent or a bit above,

short-term rates would edge lower. The three-month Treasury bill rate

would settle below 8 percent. The dollar likely would come under downward

pressure, especially if, in light of the recent increases in monetary

restraint abroad, policy easing were viewed by the market as, in part, a

coordinated effort to stem strength in the dollar. Long-term rates would

tend to move lower, although with some easing already built into the yield

curve the decline could be minor.

(30) With money market rates and opportunity costs dropping under

alternative A, M2 growth would strengthen to an 8 percent rate over the

June-to-September period, bringing this aggregate into the lower end of

its annual target cone in August. The pickup in M2 would be most evident

in its liquid components, and M1 would strengthen to a 2 percent rate of

expansion over the three-month period ending in September. M3 growth

would firm under this alternative to a 7-1/2 percent rate, boosted in part

by larger inflows to institution-only money funds.

(31) The tightening of reserve conditions under alternative C

would come as a surprise to the financial markets. With federal funds

moving to 10 percent or a bit higher, money market rates would climb about



-24-

1/2 percentage point or more. The dollar could well take on a firmer tone

on foreign exchange markets. Bond rates would tend to rise under this

alternative, although the extent of any such rise would be limited to the

degree that market participants saw the move as unsustainable or focused

on its impact on inflation pressures over time.

(32) Under alternative C, M2 would expand over the June-to-Sep-

tember period at a 5 percent rate and would remain below the lower bound

of its annual growth cone in September (though on a trajectory to touch

that lower bound in the fourth quarter). Growth of liquid retail accounts

in M2 would be weak and M1 would decline further. M3 would be expected to

grow at a 6-1/2 percent pace over June to September under this alterna-

tive, moving up only gradually within the lower portion of its annual

target range.

Directive Language

(33) Presented below for Committee consideration is a draft

directive giving standard alternative language relating to the ranges for

1989, the tentative ranges for 1990, and the operating paragraph for the

intermeeting period.

The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary

and financial conditions that will foster price

stability, promote growth in output on a sustainable

basis, and contribute to an improved pattern of inter-

national transactions. In furtherance of these objec-

tives, the Committee REAFFIRMED at THIS [DEL: its] meeting THE

RANGES IT HAD [DEL: in February] established IN FEBRUARY [DEL: ranges]

for growth of M2 and M3 of 3 to 7 percent and 3-1/2 to

7-1/2 percent, respectively, measured from the fourth

quarter of 1988 to the fourth quarter of 1989. [IN

FURTHERANCE OF THESE OBJECTIVES, THE COMMITTEE AT THIS

MEETING RAISED/LOWERED THE RANGES IT HAD ESTABLISHED IN

FEBRUARY FOR GROWTH OF M2 AND M3 TO RANGES OF ____ TO ____

AND ____ TO ____ PERCENT RESPECTIVELY, MEASURED FROM THE

FOURTH QUARTER OF 1988 TO THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 1989.]

The monitoring range for growth of total domestic

nonfinancial debt was ALSO MAINTAINED set at 6-1/2 to

10-1/2 percent [WAS (ALSO) RAISED/LOWERED TO ____ TO ____

PERCENT] for the year. FOR 1990, THE COMMITTEE AGREED

ON TENTATIVE RANGES FOR MONETARY GROWTH, MEASURED FROM



-26-

THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 1989 TO THE FOURTH QUARTER OF

1990, OF ____ TO ____ PERCENT FOR M2 AND ____ TO ____ PERCENT

FOR M3. THE COMMITTEE PROVISIONALLY SET THE ASSOCIATED

MONITORING RANGE FOR GROWTH OF TOTAL DOMESTIC

NONFINANCIAL DEBT AT ____ TO ____ PERCENT. The behavior of

the monetary aggregates will continue to be evaluated in

the light of movements in their velocities, developments

in the economy and financial markets, and progress

toward price level stability.

OPERATIONAL PARAGRAPH

In the implementation of policy for the immediate

future, the Committee seeks to DECREASE SOMEWHAT/

maintain/INCREASE SOMEWHAT the existing degree of

pressure on reserve positions. Taking account of

indications of inflationary pressures, the strength of

the business expansion, the behavior of the monetary

aggregates, and developments in foreign exchange and

domestic financial markets, somewhat (SLIGHTLY) greater

reserve restraint (WOULD)(MIGHT) or somewhat (SLIGHTLY)

lesser reserve restraint would (MIGHT) be acceptable in

the intermeeting period. The contemplated reserve

conditions are expected to be consistent with growth of

M2 and M3 over the period from JUNE [DEL: March] through

SEPTEMBER [DEL: June] at annual rates of about ____ [DEL: 1-1/2] and ____

[DEL: 4] percent, respectively. The Chairman may call for



-27-

Committee consultation if it appears to the Manager for

Domestic Operations that reserve conditions during the

period before the next meeting are likely to be

associated with a federal funds rate persistently

outside a range of ____ [DEL: 8] to ____ [DEL: 12] percent.

and M3 are annualized growth rates from the fourth quarter
through June; the figure for domestic nonfinancial debt is growth from the fourth quarter
of 1988 through May.
1. Targets are for bank credit until 1983; from 1983 onward targets are for domestic
nonfinancial sector debt.
2. At the February 1979 meeting the FOMC adopted a QIV'78 to QIV'79 range for M1 of 1-1/2
to 4-1/2 percent. This range anticipated that shifting to ATS and NOW accounts in New
York State would slow M1 growth by 3 percentage points. At the October meeting it was
noted that ATS/NOW shifts would reduce M1 by no more than 1-1/2 percentage points. Thus,
the longer-run range for M1 was modified to 3-6 percent.
3. The figures shown reflect target and actual growth of Ml-B in 1980 and shift-adjusted
M1-B in 1981. Ml-B was relabeled M1 in Janauary 1982. The targeted growth for Ml-A was
3-1/2 to 6 percent in 1980 (actual growth was 5.0 percent); in 1981 targeted growth for
shift-adjusted MI-A was 3 to 5-1/2 percent (actual growth was 1.3 percent).
4. When these ranges were set, shifts into other checkable deposits in 1980 were expected
to have only a limited effect on growth of Mi-A and Ml-B. As the year progressed,
however, banks offered other checkable deposits more actively, and more funds than
expected were directed to these accounts. Such shifts are estimated to have decreased Ml-
A growth and increased Ml-B growth each by at least 1/2 percentage point more than had
been anticipated.

5. Adjusted for the effects of shifts out of demand deposits and savings deposits into
other checkable deposits. At the February FOMC meeting, the target ranges for
observed M1-A and M1-B in 1981 on an unadjusted basis, expected to be consistent with
the adjusted ranges, were -4-1/2 to -2 and 6 to 8-1/2 percent, respectively. Actual
M1-B growth (not shift adjusted) was 5.0 percent.
6. Adjusted for shifts of assets from domestic banking offices to International
Banking Facilities.
7. Range for bank credit is annualized growth from the December 1981-January 1982
average level through the fourth quarter of 1982.
8. Base period, adopted at the July 1983 FOMC meeting, is QII'83. At the February
1983 meeting, the FOMC had adopted a QIV'82 to QIV'83 target range for M1 of 4 to 8
percent.
9. Base period is the February-March 1983 average.
10. Base period, adopted at the July 1985 FOMC meeting, is QII'85. At the February
1985 meeting the FOMC had adopted a QIV'84 to QIV'85 target range for M1 of 4 to 7
percent.
11. No range for M1 was specified at the February FOMC meeting because of
uncertainties about its underlying relationship to the behavior of the economy and its
sensitivity to economic and financial circumstances.
