Prefatory Note 
 
 
The attached document represents the most complete and accurate version available 
based on original copies culled from the files of the FOMC Secretariat at the Board 
of Governors of the Federal Reserve System.  This electronic document was created 
through a comprehensive digitization process which included identifying the best-
preserved paper copies, scanning those copies,1 and then making the scanned 
versions text-searchable.2   Though a stringent quality assurance process was 
employed, some imperfections may remain. 
 
Please note that some material may have been redacted from this document if that 
material was received on a confidential basis.  Redacted material is indicated by

1  In some cases, original copies needed to be photocopied before being scanned into electronic 
format.  All scanned images were deskewed (to remove the effects of printer- and scanner-introduced 
tilting) and lightly cleaned (to remove dark spots caused by staple holes, hole punches, and other 
blemishes caused after initial printing). 
 
2 A two-step process was used.  An advanced optical character recognition computer program (OCR) 
first created electronic text from the document image.  Where the OCR results were inconclusive, 
staff checked and corrected the text as necessary.  Please note that the numbers and text in charts and

Recent developments

(1) M-1 growth picked up to a 7.7 per cent annual rate in

September, and for the September-October period is projected at an 8.8

per cent annual rate, almost 2 percentage points above the upper end of

the Committee's range. Growth in the time and savings deposit component

of M-2 has shown little net change in recent weeks, despite further advances

in short-term market interest rates. Thus, M-2 is projected to increase at

about an 8.6 per cent annual rate over September and October, somewhat over

the Committee's range. Funds continued to flow into deposit accounts at

nonbank thrift institutions in September at a rate only slightly below

August's very strong pace. Reflecting the recent strong expansion of

demand and time deposits, nonborrowed reserves are expected to rise at a

9.2 per cent annual rate in the September-October period.

(2) In light of the policy agreed upon by the FOMC at its

September meeting, the Desk began to aim for a Federal funds rate of 6-1/4

per cent on the day following that meeting. Thereafter, as incoming data

suggested that growth rates of the key aggregates would be near or above

the FOMC's ranges, the funds rate was raised to 6-3/8 per cent and then

to the 6-1/2 per cent upper end of its range. Short-term market inter-

est rates have generally increased about 30 to 65 basis points since

the September FOMC meeting, and long-term market yields have moved up 10

to 20 basis points. As short-term rates rose relative to the discount

rate, member bank borrowing at the discount window increased, reaching an

average of $1,051 million in the statement week just passed. The System's

$2.5 billion direct loan to the U.S. Treasury, extended on September 30

in anticipation of the lapse in the Treasury's temporary debt ceiling,

was repaid on October 4, 1977.

(3) Aggregate demands for credit have been fairly well maintained

in recent weeks. Although outstanding short-term business debt was about

unchanged in September following two months of moderate growth, corpora-

tions continued to issue fairly substantial amounts of long-term debt.

State and local governments and the U.S. Treasury have raised a substan-

tial volume of funds in securities markets in recent weeks, and households

have apparently continued to borrow heavily in the mortgage market. With

sales of autos and other durables slackening somewhat in September, how-

ever, expansion in consumer instalment credit probably slowed a bit from

August's strong pace.

Prospective Developments

(5) Displayed below for Committee consideration are four alter-

native sets of longer-run ranges for the monetary aggregates applicable

to the QIII '77-QIII '78 period. Also shown are the ranges currently

in place that pertain to the QII '77-QII '78 period.

Alt. A Alt. B Alt. C Alt. D Current

M-1 4-7 4-6½ 4-6 3-5½ 4-6½

M-2 6½-9 6-8½ 5½-8 5-7½ 7-9½

M-3 8-10½ 7½-10 7-9½ 6½-9 8½-11

Bank credit 7½-10½ 7-10 7-10 6-9 7-10

(6) Alternative B retains the growth range for M-1 adopted by

the Committee in July. However, the associated ranges for M-2 and M-3

are lower than those currently in place. The staff has assumed that

a higher average level of market interest rates would be required in

the QIII '77-QIII '78 period than had been earlier contemplated to keep

M-1 growth at the mid-point of a 4-6½ per cent range in the face of an

apparently strengthened demand for cash balances. Higher interest rates

would work to constrain growth in the time and savings deposit component

of M-2 and M-3 by more than would be implied by the mid-points of the

current ranges for those aggregates. Alternatives A and C encompass,

respectively, slightly higher and slightly lower longer-run growth ranges

for the aggregates. Alternative D reflects a larger downward adjustment

in growth ranges, including a reduction in the M-1 range sufficient to

compensate for the third-quarter overshoot in M-1 growth.



-6-

(7) The implications of mid-points in the proposed growth

ranges for M-1 and M-2 for growth rates in these aggregates over 15-month

and 18-month periods beginning in QII '77 and QI '77, respectively, and

ending in QIII '78 are shown in the table below.1/

Memo:

(8) It may be seen that under alternative D growth in M-1 at

around a 4¼ per cent rate over the QIII '77-QIII '78 period would lead to

expansion in the QII '77-QIII '78 period at a 5¼ per cent annual rate

--the mid-point of the current longer-run range. Growth would be somewhat

higher if measured from QI '77 since there was also an overshoot in the

second quarter for which alternative D does not compensate. Growth of

1/ Implications for growth over longer time periods are shown in appendix
IV for alternatives B and D. To permit the Committee to evaluate
proposed ranges in relation to growth in the aggregates over a variety
of past periods, appendix V contains growth triangles for M-1, M-2
and M-3. These tables show base periods for each quarter from QIV
'74 to QII '77 and terminal periods from QI '75 to QIII '77.



-7-

M-1 of around 5¼ per cent in the QIII '77-QIII '78 period, as called

for under alternative B, would be associated with expansion over the

15-month QII '77-QIII '78 period at an annual rate of close to 6 per cent,

in the upper part of the FOMC's current longer-run range. Under all of

the alternatives, however, growth rates in M-2 over the more extended

15- and 18-month periods would generally be near the mid-point, or in

the lower half, of its current 7-9½ per cent range.

(9) Proposed shorter-run specifications to guide Desk opera-

tions in the interval between FOMC meetings (and that are believed

consistent with longer-run proposals) are summarized below for Committee

consideration. (More detailed, and longer-term, data are shown in the

tables on pp. 8 and 9).

(10) Alternative B includes a Federal funds rate centered

on the recently prevailing level of about 6½ per cent. With such a funds

rate, M-1 growth during October-November may be in a 3-8 per cent, annual

rate, range. A relatively rapid growth appears to be in train for October,

given data thus far available for the month. The mid-point of the October-

November range assumes a substantially slower rate of growth in November

(which would represent a pattern similar to last year's), and is consistent

with growth in M-1 from the third to the fourth quarter at about a 6 per

cent annual rate. Such a moderation in M-1 growth from the advanced

rates of the past two quarters is likely as a result of the lagged effect

on money demand of the rise of about 1¼ percentage points in short-term

rates that has occurred since mid-year.

(11) The staff expects, however, that even further increases

in interest rates would be required as time goes on if growth in M-1

over the QIII '77-QIII '78 period is to be held to the mid-point of the

longer-run 4-6 per cent range associated with alternative B. This would

entail M-1 growth in the area of 4 -5 per cent, annual rate,during the

first three quarters of 1978. Given staff GNP projections and our assess-

ment of the likely strength of money demand, the Federal funds rate may

peak out at about 7 per cent in the second quarter of 1978, as shown in

appendix I.

(12) Our projection of the Federal funds rate still assumes

some downward shift in demand for M-1 relative to GNP in the year ahead.

However, given the rapid growth in M-1 of the past two quarters, we have

assumed a somewhat slower downward shift than in the year ending in

QIII '77. If the downward shift proceeds even more slowly, or stops

entirely, upward interest rate pressures would be larger than we have

projected. On the other hand, a rebound in economic confidence could

well be accompanied by an increased willingness to spend out of existing

cash balances by businesses and consumers, as appears to have occurred in

earlier stages of the current economic expansion; if this takes place, a

rebound in velocity need not entail significant interest rate pressures.



-11-

(13) Growth in M-2 over the October-November period is likely

to be in a 5 -9 per cent annual rate range under alternative B.

The time and savings deposit component of M-2 is expected to expand by

only slightly more than its reduced August-September pace. We continue

to anticipate little, if any, growth in outstanding large CD's at banks--

including the large-denomination time deposits that are included in M-2--

as short-term credit demands on banks remain moderate. In addition,

market rates are above bank ceiling rates on time deposits under $100,000

and maturing in less than four years, and this may be tending to con-

strain inflows of such deposits.

(14) If the Federal funds rate remains around 6 per cent

over the next few weeks, short-term market rates generally may show little

further change. There has been a substantial upward adjustment of Treasury

bill rates in the last few days, and this market appears to have fully

adjusted to a 6½ per cent funds rate. In long-term markets, an enlarged

volume of corporate and municipal bond offerings is expected in October and

November. In addition, longer-term markets will have to absorb a sizable

Treasury debt offering to be announced October 21. At that time the Trea-

sury is expected to offer $5½ to $6 billion of new issues to refund about

$2½ billion of publicly-held issues maturing in mid-November and to

raise about $3 to $3½ billion of new cash. Recent upward adjustments in

intermediate- and longer-term rates may have been sufficient to accomodate

this enlarged volume of bond offerings, but some further rise cannot be

ruled out.



-12-

(15) A tightening of the funds market to the mid-point of a

6¾-7¼ per cent range over the next few weeks is contemplated under

alternatives C or D--alternatives that over the longer-run involve lower

growth ranges for the monetary aggregates than alternative B. Such a

rise in the funds rate in the weeks immediately ahead would probably be

associated with a 2½-7½ per cent annual rate range for M-1 and a

5-9 per cent range for M-2.

(16) Under both alternatives C and D, interest rates would

probably have to rise further in late 1977 and in 1978 to achieve the

mid-points of their respective longer-run ranges for the monetary aggre-

gates. Rate increases would, of course, be larger under alternative D,

which involves M-1 growth over the QIII '77-QIII '78 period at a mid-

point rate of 4¼ per cent. The funds rate under this alternative

would be expected to reach around 8¼ per cent by the third quarter of

1978, as compared with a level of 7-5/8 per cent under alternative C.

Under alternative D, we have assumed an upward adjustment in Regulation

Q ceilings on time deposits of ¼ percentage point across the board in

the second quarter of next year.

(17) A rise in the funds rate to around 7 per cent over the

next few weeks would probably entail an increase in the 3-month bill rate

to around 6-3/4 per cent, with commensurate adjustments in other short-term

rates. Long-term rates may be somewhat more sensitive to increases in

short rates over the period ahead than has been the case in the past

several months. Deposit flows to thrift institutions would very likely



-13-

begin to slow and this could cause mortgage yields to begin rising; given

the current wide spread of mortgage over bond rates, bond yields could

also be expected to adjust upwards. Still, upward pressures on longer-

term market rates would be moderated by the sizable cash flow to insur-

ance companies and pension funds.

(18) The easing in money market conditions over the next few

weeks under alternative A would be consistent with a shift to somewhat

higher longer-run growth ranges than those of alternative B. A decline

in the funds rate would have to be soon reversed, though, given the

staff's GNP projections. We would expect the funds rate to rise to

around 7-1/4 per cent by the second quarter of 1978 under this alternative.

Directive language

(19) Given below are alternatives for the operational paragraphs

of the directive. The first formulation, like the directive adopted at

the last meeting, places main emphasis on near-term rates of growth in

monetary aggregates; it shows--in strike-through form--the specifications

adopted at the last meeting. The second formulation places main emphasis

on money market conditions. As suggested below, the particular language

needed in the opening lines of the money market formulation would depend

on the specific conditions sought; the three alternatives shown--calling,

respectively, for somewhat easier, prevailing, and somewhat firmer money

market conditions--are intended to be associated with the specifications

discussed in the preceding section under alternatives A, B, and C.

"Monetary Aggregates" Formulation

The Committee seeks to encourage near-term rates of growth

in M-1 and M-2 on a path believed to be reasonably consistent

with the longer-run ranges for monetary aggregates cited in the

preceding paragraph. Specifically, at present, it expects the

annual growth rates over the [DEL: September-October] OCTOBER-NOVEMBER

period to be within the ranges of [DEL: 2-to-7] ____ to ____ per cent

for M-1 and [DEL: 4-to-8] ____ to ____ per cent for M-2. In the judg-

ment of the Committee such growth rates are likely to be associated

with a weekly-average Federal funds rate of about [DEL: 6-1/4] ____

per cent. If, giving, approximately equal weight to M-1 and M-2,

it appears that growth rates over the 2-month period will deviate

significantly from the midpoints of the indicated ranges, the



-15-

operational objective for the Federal funds rate shall be modified

in an orderly fashion within a range of [DEL: 6 to 6-1/2] ____ to ____

per cent.

If it appears during the period before the next meeting that

the operating constraints specified above are proving to be sig-

nificantly inconsistent, the Manager is promptly to notify the

Chairman who will then decide whether the situation calls for

supplementary instructions from the Committee.

"Money Market" Formulation

At this time, the Committee seeks to maintain about the

prevailing money market conditions (or to achieve somewhat easier

or somewhat firmer money market conditions) during the period

immediately ahead, provided that monetary aggregates appear to be

growing at approximately the rates currently expected, which are

believed to be on a path reasonably consistent with the longer-run

ranges for monetary aggregates cited in the preceding paragraph.

Specifically, the Committee seeks to maintain the weekly-average

Federal funds rate at about ____ per cent, so long as M-1 and

1-2 appear to be growing over the October-November period at

annual rates within ranges of ____ to ____ per cent and ____

to ____ per cent, respectively. If,giving approximately equal

weight to M-1 and M-2, it appears that growth rates over the 2-

month period are approaching or moving beyond the limits of the

indicated ranges, the operational objective for the weekly-average



-16-

Federal funds rate shall be modified in an orderly fashion

within a range of ____ to ____ per cent.

If it appears during the period before the next meeting

that the operating constraints specified above are proving to

be significantly inconsistent, the Manager is promptly to notify

the Chairman who will then decide whether the situation calls

for supplementary instructions from the Committee.

NOTE: Government security dealer trading positions are on a commitment basis. Trading positions, which exclude Treasury securities financing by repurchase
agreements maturing in 16 days or more, are indicators of dealer holdings available for sale over the near-term. Underwriting syndicate positions consist
of issues still in syndicate, excluding trading positions. The basic reserve deficit is excess reserves less borrowing at Federal Reserve less net Federal
funds purchases. Weekly data are daily averages for statement weeks, except for corporate and municipal issues in syndicate which are Friday figures.

NOTE: Weekly data for columns 1 to 4 are statement week averages of daily data. Columns 5 and 6 are 1-day Wednesday quotes (prior to 1976, figures shown
are for 60-89 day and 90-119 day ranges, respectively). For columns 7 through 10, the weekly date is the mid-point of the calendar week over which data
are averaged. Columns 11 and 12 are 1-day quotes for Friday and Thursday, respectively, following the end of the statement week. Column 13 is an average
of contract interest rates on commitments for conventional first mortgages with 80 per cent loan-to-value ratios made by a sample of insured savings and loan
associations on the Friday following the end of the statement week. Column 14 gives FNMA auction data for Monday preceding the end of the statement week.
Column 15 is a 1-day quote for Monday preceding the end of the statement week. The FNMA auction yield is the average yield in bi-weekly auction for short-
term forward commitments for Government underwritten mortgages. GNMA yields are average net yields to investors on mortgage-backed securities for immediate
delivery, assuming prepayment in 12 years on pools of 30-year FHA/VA mortgages carrying the coupon rate 50 basis points below the current FHA/VA ceiling.
