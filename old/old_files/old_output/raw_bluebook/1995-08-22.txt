MONETARY POLICY ALTERNATIVES

Recent Developments

(1) With inflation pressures seen to be receding, the Federal

Open Market Committee eased monetary policy slightly on July 6, reduc-

ing the intended federal funds rate 25 basis points to 5-3/4 percent.

Federal funds have generally traded near the intended rate over the

intermeeting period.1 Market prices had apparently built in a

slight downward tilt to policy over coming months, including some odds

of a System easing on July 6 (chart). In the event, the actual move

was interpreted as indicating concern by the Federal Reserve regarding

the state of the economy, and, based on previous patterns of policy

action, as likely to be followed by additional easings. Consequently,

short- and intermediate-term market rates fell about 20 basis points

on the day: long-rates dropped 10 basis points, to their lowest levels

in 1995. The prime rate was cut 25 basis points, to 8-3/4 percent.

(2) Subsequently, however, stronger economic data--reinforced

by the Chairman's Humphrey-Hawkins testimony--disabused many market

participants of the notion that the economy would be weak enough to

prompt further substantial monetary policy ease. Judging from implied

volatility on Treasury bond futures (chart), investor uncertainty

1. In order to allow for anticipated increases in its seasonal
component, the borrowing allowance was raised $25 million both on the
morning of July 6 and on July 20, ending at $275 million. The borrow-
ing allowance was not reduced to effect the policy change because
adjustment borrowing already was expected to be at minimal levels. In
the three maintenance periods completed since the last FOMC meeting,
borrowing has averaged $74 million above its allowance, largely
reflecting heavy use of the window on the August 2 settlement day,
when demands for excess reserves were elevated.

ebbed early in the intermeeting period but has risen recently, per-

haps contributing a little to the backup in bond yields. On balance

since July 5, the Treasury yield curve has tilted up: While 3-month

rates are fractionally lower, intermediate- and long-term rates have

risen about 35 to 40 basis points. Nonetheless, bond yields currently

are 1-1/4 percentage points below their highs of last fall. Some

spreads of private over Treasury rates, which had widened a bit over

the second quarter as the expansion weakened, retraced most of those

increases during the intermeeting period. With earnings reports

stronger than expected, major equity indexes finished the period

higher.

(3) The brighter prospects for near-term economic growth in

the United States and the rise in long-term interest rates here rela-

tive to the average of long-term rates abroad contributed to a 5-1/2

percent rise in the dollar's weighted average exchange value since the

last Committee meeting. Renewed concerns about the pace of expansion

in Europe, especially in Germany, led to declines in interest rates in

these countries, and was an important factor in an increase in the

dollar against the DM and associated European currencies. The dollar

registered its largest gain--14 percent--relative to the Japanese yen.

Japanese authorities took two separate actions to depreciate the yen

and stimulate their economy. Early in the period, the Bank of Japan

lowered its call money rate. Subsequently, Japanese authorities an-

nounced a series of measures to promote capital outflows by domestic

financial institutions and on the same day undertook massive purchases

of dollars in Tokyo. After each policy action, the Desk purchased

dollars against yen in New York, in concerted operations with the Bank

of Japan. Late in the period, in a coordinated intervention with



Japan the Desk purchased $700 million against both yen

and DM, bringing its total purchases of dollars during the period to

$1.533 billion.2 These actions and interventions appeared to have a

substantial effect on yen-dollar exchange rates, perhaps because mar-

ket participants interpreted them as signalling a realization by the

Japanese authorities of the seriousness of their situation and a will-

ingness to take additional steps, and perhaps because they acted as a

catalyst for a correction to the unexplained strength in the yen this

spring. The depreciation of the yen contributed to a more than 20

percent increase in Japanese stock prices and to a sharp backup in

Japanese bond yields.

(4) Broad money growth decelerated in July, but remained

relatively strong, and data for early August suggest a persistence of

the recent rapid growth. M2 expanded at a 6 percent rate last month,

bringing its expansion from the fourth quarter of 1994 through July to

a 4-1/4 percent pace, in the upper half of its annual range. The

strength in M2 in recent months, despite sluggish growth of nominal

GDP, likely reflects the increased attractiveness of the returns on M2

assets owing to the net decline in market interest rates this year,

particularly at longer maturities. Retail money funds accounted for

most of M2's growth in July, apparently drawing strength from house-

hold deposits as well as from sources outside M2;new investments in

2. Each of the Desk's interventions during the period was split
evenly between the System and the Treasury.

3. Ml growth remained sluggish in July, at a 1-1/2 percent rate.
Continued low interest rates on NOW accounts and the introduction of
sweep programs at three additional banking organizations in early
August led to further runoffs of these deposits. However, demand
deposits showed continued growth, indicative of a pickup in mortgage
refinancing activity as well as the adjustment of compensating
balances to recent declines in short-term market rates. Total re-
serves rose at a 6-1/4 percent rate in July, tracking transactions
deposits. Nevertheless, the monetary base declined at a 1/2 percent
rate, owing to a drop in currency.



bond mutual funds remain anemic, and noncompetitive tenders at Trea-

sury bill and note auctions have dropped off substantially.

(5) M3's expansion remained surprisingly robust in July at an

8-3/4 percent rate. From the fourth quarter of 1994 through July, M3

grew at a 6-3/4 percent rate, exceeding even the 6 percent upper bound

of its new growth range for the year. Investments in M3-type money

funds again were quite strong through early July, as yields on such

funds lagged declines in short-term market rates. Furthermore, de-

positories continued to issue substantial volumes of large time de-

posits, partly to substitute for nondeposit funding sources.

(6) Business borrowing appears to have slowed somewhat, while

household borrowing has remained near the accelerated pace of earlier

this year. With the rise in bond yields, the composition of business

borrowing has shifted back toward banks and the commercial paper mar-

ket. Banks apparently continue to pursue business loans actively: in

the August Loan Officer Survey, they reported further easing of lend-

ing terms and standards. Unlike recent surveys, however, banks did

not report greater enthusiasm for making consumer and home mortgage

loans. Nonetheless, total consumer credit grew rapidly in June, and

bank consumer loans, inclusive of securitizations, remained robust in

July. Federal debt growth slowed in July, after an acceleration over

the second quarter. Total domestic nonfinancial debt is estimated to

have grown at a 5-3/4 percent pace from the fourth quarter through

June, leaving this aggregate somewhat above the midpoint of its 3-to-7

percent monitoring range for 1995.

Policy Alternatives

(7) Incoming information since the July FOMC meeting has

indicated somewhat stronger final demand over the late spring and

early summer and less inventory stocking than the staff had predicted.

As a consequence, the staff has revised up its forecast of the growth

of output to 2 percent this year. The forecast for 1996 envisions

output expanding close to the growth rate of potential. These fore-

casts are based on similar financial conditions and fiscal restraint

as assumed in the June Greenbook. For the two years combined, this

projection is consistent with the central tendency of the range of

projections of FOMC members in early July. Even though the staff's

output forecast has been raised for this year, favorable price and

compensation news has resulted in a small downward revision to pro-

jected CPI inflation in 1995, to just below 3 percent and beneath the

central tendency of FOMC expectations. Inflation for 1996 is seen as

edging higher--mostly owing to a rise in energy prices--but holding

within the central tendency of Committee projections. Against this

backdrop, the staff has presented the usual three alternative policy

options.

(8) Financial markets still see slight odds of a monetary

easing by year-end, but they do not expect any action at the August

FOMC meeting. Thus, the choice of the unchanged federal funds rate of

alternative B should have little immediate impact on market interest

rates. Over the intermeeting period, data in line with the staff's

forecast of a pickup in output growth to a moderate pace might remove

any lingering expectations of policy ease among market participants;

but with inflation also projected to be quite subdued, substantial



shifts in the anticipated course of policy are unlikely. At the cur-

rent ceiling for federal government debt, the staff does not expect

the Treasury to alter financing patterns much until late September or

to run out of cash until the first half of November. Nonetheless, as

the room under the debt ceiling shrinks, absent signs of some narrow-

ing of the differences between the President and congressional

leaders, financial markets may begin to focus more on the implications

for debt markets and the economy of a disruption in federal financing.

or possibly even a temporary default. To date, interest rates appear

to have been unaffected by the possibility of such a disruption, and

over the intermeeting period, which ends before the new fiscal year,

markets will probably remain of the view that in the end some com-

promise will be reached to avert the most dire consequences.

(9) Alternative B might be favored to the extent that the

staff forecast were seen to be credible and the outcome to balance

acceptably Committee concerns about expansion in output with those of

the containment of inflation. The stronger economic data available

over the recent intermeeting period could be read as suggesting that

policy in the latter part of 1994 and first part of 1995 might not

have been as restraining as suggested by the level of short-term real

rates relative to their long-run averages. Nominal values of the

foreign exchange value of the dollar and of bond yields are still

appreciably below their levels of last fall, even though the nominal

federal funds has been raised 1 percentage point on balance since that

time. With inflation relatively subdued, it seems highly likely that

real exchange rates and long-term interest rates have fallen notice-

ably as well over the last nine months. These declines, together with



generally supportive credit conditions, could be viewed as underpin-

ning the continued momentum in business and household spending. In

any event, an unchanged stance of policy would buy time for more in-

formation to accumulate to determine whether the economy is indeed on

track to a sustainable pace of expansion.

(10) A further easing of policy, as under alternative A,

could be supported if recent price and wage news were read as suggest-

ing that the underlying determinants of inflation were more favorable

than in the staff forecast. With inflation and inflation expectations

decreasing in these circumstances, nominal rates would have to be

reduced to keep real rates from rising. Indeed, the Committee might

want to lower real rates as well if it wished to realize a little

higher output as well as lower inflation. In addition, the Committee

might want to consider lowering the federal funds rate if it were

concerned that risks to the economic outlook were still seen to be

concentrated on the down side. Such risks might be viewed as height-

ened by the recent increases in longer-term interest rates and in the

foreign exchange value of the dollar, if the Committee thought that

markets had overreacted to stronger data, especially in light of on-

coming fiscal restraint.

(11) The drop in the federal funds rate of 1/2 percentage

point contemplated under alternative A would be much larger and sooner

than market participants currently expect. As a consequence, short-

term interest rates would fall nearly 50 basis points and banks prob-

ably would cut the prime rate 1/2 percentage point. The immediate

effect of an easing likely would be to reduce intermediate- and long-

term rates as well, especially if the Federal Reserve's perceived

optimism on inflation were to influence the market's assessment of the



outlook. Unless incoming data confirmed an improved inflation pic-

ture, however, market participants would come to question the sus-

tainability of the drop in short-term rates, and intermediate- and

long-term rates could back up. In any case, the dollar likely would

fall as System action reduced real interest rates.

(12) The choice of the higher rates of alternative C would

seem to rest on concerns about the longer-term inflation outlook. As

noted, in the staff forecast, inflation holds steady through 1996,

and, with no slack in the economy at the end of the forecast period,

would not be expected to decline appreciably in 1997. If the Commit-

tee were intent on making measurable progress toward price stability

in the next several years, a rise in the real federal funds rate from

its current level would seem to be needed based on the relationships

embodied in the staff forecast. To be sure, unexpected developments

could reduce inflation pressures, perhaps by putting slack in the

economy, but there can be no assurance of such a surprise on either

the supply or demand sides. The need for a tightening of policy -

reestablish a disinflationary trend might seem all the more pressing

if the firmer spending data of late and the brisk pace of broad money

growth, with the economy already producing around its potential, were

seen as suggesting risks on the side of more inflation than in the

staff forecast.

(13) Alternative C would come as a surprise to market par-

ticipants, and money market interest rates would rise at least 50

basis points and the dollar would strengthen further on foreign ex-

change markets. Intermediate- and long-term rates also would in-

crease, with the extent of the rise depending on whether market par-

ticipants saw the action as implying more underlying strength in



aggregate demand and greater inflationary pressure than currently

envisioned or whether this tightening were interpreted as suggesting

more resolve by the Committee to bring inflation down.

(14) Moderate growth in GDP in the staff forecast is expected

to be associated with some slowing in borrowing by nonfinancial sec-

tors in the remaining months of the year. Business requirements to

fund inventory accumulation are diminishing, and borrowing for share

retirements is likely to pause a bit before accelerating later this

year and early next year to finance the consummation of recently

announced mega-merger deals. In the household sector, debt should

continue to expand around its recent pace, further increasing debt-to-

income ratios. A pickup in mortgage financing in association with a

little stronger residential housing activity will tend to be offset by

a modest slowing in growth of consumer credit as repayments on loans

for big-ticket items catch up with the earlier surge in extensions.

Credit should be readily available to private borrowers, though we

expect an end to the trend of easing terms and conditions as lenders

reassess risk and returns in an environment of moderate real income

growth and rising debt of households and businesses. Very large

retirements of tax-exempt bonds and anemic gross issuance will further

drag down the stock of tax-exempt debt, and, in the federal sector,

debt growth in the near term is projected to slow even apart from

debt-ceiling disruptions. Consequently, as shown in the table below,

total debt of domestic nonfinancial sectors is projected to expand at

a 3-3/4 percent rate over the final five months of this year, placing

this aggregate in the fourth quarter 5 percent above its year-earlier

level.

Note. Growth rates based on alternative B.

(15) Growth rates of the broad monetary aggregates are ex-

pected to continue to slow from their recent very rapid pace, but to

remain relatively strong. Portfolio shifts into M2 assets should

abate with the stability of short-term rates and now-higher long-term

rates, which make bond funds more attractive. The velocity of M2 is

expected to decline in the third quarter, but primarily because of

the bulge in M2 growth already experienced. In the fourth quarter,

velocity is projected to be flat. For the year, M2 is expected to

remain below the 5 percent upper bound of its annual range, even under

alternative A.4  The projected softening in M3 owes primarily to

lower growth in institutional money funds as their yields become

better aligned with market rates. Bank credit is expected to expand

at a moderate pace, and issuance of managed liabilities in M3 should

remain strong, perhaps encouraged to a small degree by the recent

decline in deposit insurance premiums. M3 appears likely to break the

upper bound of its new range under any of the alternative policy

4. M1 is expected to continue to decline as more banks introduce
arrangements to sweep funds from NOW accounts to MMDAs to reduce re-
serve requirements. Assuming only a moderate amount of about $1 bil-
lion of additional sweeps over each of the last four months of the
year, this financial innovation will reduce M1 growth over the four
quarters of 1995 by 1-3/4 percentage points. Such programs, of
course, leave M2 unaffected.

paragraph that includes the usual options for Committee consideration.

In the implementation of policy for the immediate

future, the Committee seeks to decrease (SOMEWHAT)

slightly/ MAINTAIN/INCREASE (SOMEWHAT/SLIGHTLY) the

existing degree of pressure on reserve positions. In

the context of the Committee's long-run objectives for

price stability and sustainable economic growth, and

giving careful consideration to economic, financial, and

monetary developments, slightly (SOMEWHAT) greater

reserve restraint (WOULD) might or slightly (SOMEWHAT)

lesser reserve restraint would (MIGHT) be acceptable in

the intermeeting period. The contemplated reserve

conditions are expected to be consistent with MORE

moderate growth in M2 and M3 over coming months.
