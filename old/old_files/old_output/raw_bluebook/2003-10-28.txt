intermeeting period.  The Desk purchased $922 million of Treasury bills from foreign
official institutions and $742 million of Treasury coupon securities in the market.  The
outstanding amount of long-term RPs increased $2 billion, to a level of $20 billion.

MONETARY POLICY ALTERNATIVES

Recent Developments

(1) The FOMC’s decision at its September meeting to keep the target for the

federal funds rate unchanged at 1 percent and not to alter the assessment of risks to

the economic outlook was widely anticipated, and rates on near-dated federal funds

futures contracts held about steady after its announcement.  The Committee’s

characterization of labor market conditions as “weakening” and reaffirmation that an

accommodative policy can be maintained for a “considerable period” reportedly led

investors to mark down rates on futures contracts covering next year by a few basis

points.  In recent weeks, though, longer-dated futures rates have risen sharply against

the backdrop of better-than-expected economic data, positive corporate earnings

announcements, and a pronounced weakening of the dollar.  In addition, comments

by some Federal Reserve officials last week were read by many as signaling that policy

firming might commence sooner than had been previously expected, adding to the

upward pressure on market rates.  While short-term futures rates remained anchored

near 1 percent throughout the intermeeting period, those at longer horizons increased

about 25 to 30 basis points on net (Chart 1).  (Further discussion of the recent stability

of near-term policy expectations is provided in the box below.)  Market participants

seem certain that policy will remain on hold at this FOMC meeting, but they now

place considerable odds on a 25 basis point tightening by the middle of next year.1

The Recent Stability of Near-Term Policy Expectations 

The Committee’s recent announcements as well as comments by Federal
Reserve officials have hinted strongly–most explicitly in Chairman Greenspan’s
monetary policy testimony in July and in the concluding sentence of the August and
September FOMC statements–that the stance of policy would remain
accommodative for some time.  These statements seem to have left investors quite
confident that the target funds rate will remain near 1 percent for the next few
months.  For example, an estimate of uncertainty about the near-term policy path
derived from options data–shown in the left panel of the chart–has fallen sharply
over the summer and remains near historical lows.  The efficacy of the Committee’s
statements in anchoring near-term policy expectations has also been suggested by
movements of near- and longer-dated futures rates.  The right panel plots daily
changes in the eurodollar futures rate eight quarters ahead on the vertical axis

against the corresponding daily changes in the three-month-ahead federal funds
futures rate.  The solid black regression line shows the average relationship between
these variables over the entire period from 1990 to the present.  The red dashed
line shows the regression line fitted with data since the Chairman’s testimony in
July; the significantly steeper slope of this line is consistent with the view that near-
term policy expectations have been unusually stable over recent months.  This
conclusion holds even when a more recent period–the year ended June 2003 (the
blue dot-dashed line)–is used as the basis for comparison.



2

2  Fails to deliver Treasury securities, especially of the once-off-the-run ten-year
note, remained elevated–albeit well below their summertime peaks.

(2) These changes in policy expectations showed through to short- and

intermediate-term Treasury yields, which gained 10 to 20 basis points over the

intermeeting period.  Nominal yields on longer-term Treasury securities were about

unchanged, while those on indexed debt fell about 10 basis points.  As a result,

implied inflation compensation edged higher, consistent with the uptick in the

University of Michigan Survey’s measure of long-term inflation expectations. 

Treasury yields remained volatile, but bid-asked spreads held near normal levels, and

transaction volumes were in a typical range.2   Continued debate about the appropriate

regulatory structure for the GSEs, as well as reports of losses suffered by three

Federal Home Loan Banks, left only a small imprint on agency spreads. 

(3) Investors’ improved economic outlook and perhaps some increased

appetite for risk supported the prices of corporate debt and equity over the

intermeeting period (Chart 2).  While investment-grade yields moved about in line

with Treasuries, lower-tier spreads registered further significant and broad-based

declines.  Major equity indexes rose roughly 2 percent, even as earnings reports for the

third quarter came in about as strong as analysts had expected, and forward-looking

measures of the volatility of the S&P 500 fell to their lows for the year.  In addition,

gross equity issuance jumped in September and even included a rise in initial public

offerings. 

(4) The foreign exchange value of the dollar fell almost 5 percent over the

intermeeting period against major currencies, paced by a 6-1/2 percent drop against

the Japanese yen (Chart 3).  The dollar depreciated more than 4 percent against the

euro and the Canadian dollar.  The communique issued at the conclusion of the G-7

meeting in Dubai on September 20 was reportedly interpreted by market participants

     .   The Desk did not intervene for the accounts of the
System and the Treasury over the intermeeting period.

4 On October 10, the Bank of Japan announced an increase in the upper limit
of its target range for reserve balances to 32 trillion yen, from 30 trillion yen, and an
expansion of the scope of RP operations that amounted to an extension of the
permissible term of RPs.  A clarification of the conditions that would have to be met
before the Bank of Japan would end its policy of quantitative easing may have led
market participants to believe that low short-term interest rates would prevail for
longer than had been previously expected. 

as indicating official acceptance of further dollar depreciation.  Subsequent statements

by the Administration that the “strong dollar” policy had not changed and a

resumption of significant intervention by Japanese authorities within ten days of the

G-7 meeting did not halt the dollar’s decline.3  Long-term government bond yields in

advanced economies showed mixed changes; the exception was in the United

Kingdom, where yields jumped 32 basis points as market participants came to believe

that the Bank of England would be the first major central bank to tighten policy.  In

contrast, announcements by the Bank of Japan regarding its monetary policy

intentions supported equity prices and trimmed longer-term JGB yields.4  Stock prices

in other major foreign economies registered mixed changes on net over the

intermeeting period.

(5) Against the currencies of our other important trading partners, the trade-

weighted foreign exchange value of the dollar changed little on net, as a 2 percent rise

against the Mexican peso was offset by declines against the currencies of Brazil and

several Asian economies.  The Mexican government lowered its growth forecast for

the remainder of 2003, and Mexico’s stock market index posted only minor gains,

5 Data on business loans presented in this Bluebook have been adjusted to
remove the estimated effects of the adoption by some banks of Financial Accounting
Standards Board (FASB) Interpretation 46 (FIN 46).  This accounting change, which
was issued in January, originally required institutions to consolidate some variable
interest  entities onto their balance sheets in the third quarter.  During the
intermeeting period, however, FASB announced that institutions could delay
implementation of the new accounting treatment until the fourth quarter, reducing its
impact for now.  

while risk spreads widened somewhat.  In contrast, Brazilian financial market

indicators improved considerably on market speculation that Brazil’s sovereign debt

rating may be raised shortly.  Although the Chinese authorities maintained the

renminbi’s peg against the dollar, rates on forward contracts suggest that market

participants have marked up the odds on renminbi appreciation within the next year. 

(6) Nonfinancial businesses appear to have pared their borrowing further on

balance in September, as a pickup in net bond issuance was more than offset by

further paydowns of short-term debt (Chart 4).  For the third quarter as a whole, debt

of the nonfinancial business sector is estimated to have grown at a 2-3/4 percent pace. 

Available data for October suggest that business borrowing remains weak.  Bond

issuance has been slowed by the recent rise in interest rates, and runoffs of C&I loans

have continued unabated, despite the stabilization in banks’ lending standards and

terms reported in the most recent Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey.5  Commercial

paper issuance, though, appears to be strengthening somewhat.  In the household

sector, consumer credit growth picked up earlier in the third quarter, buoyed by

spending on motor vehicles.  Data from commercial banks suggest that growth of

households’ mortgage debt has slowed as the pace of mortgage refinancings has

stepped down.  Overall, debt of the household sector is estimated to have risen at a 9-

1/2 percent pace in the third quarter.  With debt in the federal sector expanding less

rapidly, total domestic nonfinancial debt is estimated to have grown at a 7 percent

6 Some pre-paid mortgage balances are required to be held temporarily in liquid
deposits before those funds are disbursed to holders of mortgage-backed securities.
The resulting effect on M2 growth for a given month depends on the dollar amount
of mortgage refinancings in that and the previous month as well as the length of time
those funds remain in M2 deposits.  Estimates of those factors are subject to
considerable uncertainty.  Nevertheless, it appears that refinancing effects accounted
for a large share of the deceleration of M2 in September.  

pace last quarter, down significantly from the second quarter. 

(7) M2 contracted at a 4-3/4 percent annual rate in September after surging

over the prior several months, and the weakness appears to be carrying into October.   

The steep falloff in mortgage refinancing seems to have played an important role in

this reversal.6  The temporary effects of the multi-day power blackout in August,

which had immobilized large amount of funds in demand deposits, elevated the level

of M2 in that month relative to September.  In addition, some portion of the child tax

credit refunds received by households in late July and early August may have been

initially placed in M2 accounts and then spent last month.  Lastly, net inflows to equity

and bond mutual funds picked up in September and early October relative to recent

months, perhaps damping M2 growth.

Policy Alternatives

(8) Stronger-than-expected incoming data on spending have led the staff to

mark up its estimate of third-quarter growth, and the resulting higher level of real

GDP is carried forward with the general contours of the forecast little changed. 

Monetary policy is still assumed to be on hold until mid-2005 and to firm only

gradually thereafter.  Longer-term interest rates are projected to be about flat for a few

quarters and then to drift a bit lower as investors conclude that monetary policy will

not need to tighten as quickly as they had thought.  The levels of equity prices and the

foreign exchange value of the dollar in the fourth quarter have been marked up and

down, respectively, to reflect their changes over the intermeeting period.  Over the

forecast interval, equity prices are again assumed to rise enough to yield risk-adjusted

returns in line with those on fixed-income instruments, while the dollar is still

assumed to edge lower at about the same rate as in the last Greenbook.  With these

accommodative financial conditions, expansionary fiscal policy, and inventory

dynamics supporting growth, real GDP is projected to expand at about a

5-1/4 percent rate over the second half of 2003 and at nearly that pace in 2004.  A

swing in fiscal policy toward restraint in 2005 contributes to a moderation of GDP

growth to about 4 percent–still somewhat above the estimated growth rate of

potential output.  With output growth exceeding that of its potential, the civilian

unemployment rate is projected to fall to nearly 5 percent–the staff’s estimate of the

natural rate–by the end of 2005.  Cumulative slack in product and labor markets puts

a bit of downward pressure on core PCE inflation, which ends the projection period

at 1 percent.  The recent rise in oil prices is assumed to unwind gradually, causing

headline inflation to run a bit below core inflation in 2004 and 2005. 

(9) If the Committee, like the staff, sees output growing briskly with

inflation staying near 1 percent for an extended period, it might choose an

7 In the September Bluebook, the staff estimated that the real federal funds rate in the
third quarter was about 20 basis points above the bottom of the range of estimates of its
equilibrium value.  In the current Bluebook, the staff now estimates that the real funds rate
in the third quarter was about 20 basis points below the bottom of the range.  This relative
shift largely reflects two factors.  First, the staff’s estimate of four-quarter core PCE inflation
for last quarter has increased about 10 basis points since the last Bluebook, reducing the
estimated level of the actual real federal funds rate.  Second, the level of third-quarter GDP
was revised higher, and some of this strength is projected to carry over to the fourth quarter. 
The resulting decline in the estimate of the output gap in these two quarters boosts the
estimate of the equilibrium funds rate produced by the one-sided statistical filter (the
measure at the bottom of the range) by 34 basis points. 

unchanged target for the federal funds rate at this meeting.  The recent strength in

spending may have led the Committee to trim its assessment of the possibility of a

significant decline in inflation and, perhaps, the risk of adverse feedback to aggregate

demand should such a decline eventuate.  Moreover, financial conditions would now

seem to be providing more support for spending than at the time of the September

meeting, and possibly enough to lead the Committee to see more robust growth in

aggregate demand going forward than the staff projects.  Indeed, current estimates

place the real federal funds rate below the range of equilibrium values derived from

various staff models (Chart 5).7  Even if the Committee is concerned that economic

slack could persist for a substantial time, it might think that any additional easing

undertaken at this meeting would not–given the lags with which policy affects

spending–have a noticeable impact until the economic expansion was far enough

along to make additional stimulus undesirable.  Alternatively, Committee

members–like many private forecasters–may expect inflation pressures to emerge

faster than in the staff projection.  For instance, relative to the Greenbook, the

Committee may see less resource slack currently or be more worried that very rapid

output growth could put pressure on prices even as some slack in resources remained. 

Given these possibilities, the Committee may feel that it is best to await additional

8 As discussed on September 15, the drafting of the announcement would be
facilitated if Committee members conveyed their views about the possible wording of the
second paragraph of the statement to the Secretary in advance of the meeting.  The

September 16 policy announcement is provided in the Appendix.  

information on aggregate demand and supply before adjusting policy further.    

(10) If, however, the Committee is concerned that growth may not remain

rapid enough to return output to its potential reasonably promptly and so limit any

further decline in inflation, then it might choose to cut the target for the federal

funds rate by 25 basis points at this meeting.  While the Committee may be

convinced that the economy has been growing robustly and will continue to do so

over the remainder of this year, it may fear that the expansion could sputter in 2004. 

In particular, firms may remain cautious in their spending, hiring, and inventory

control, implying continued restraint on aggregate demand growth as the impetus

from this summer’s tax cuts ebbs.  Even if the Committee thinks that the most likely

outcome is one in which output growth is sufficient to reduce resource slack at an

acceptable pace, it might want to err on the side of more accommodative policy given

that inflation is low, inflation expectations are apparently well anchored, and the costs

of a further decline in inflation likely outweigh those of a modest increase.  Indeed,

Committee members may see the current level of inflation as near the bottom of the

range that they would like to achieve in the longer term, given the asymmetries caused

by the zero lower bound on nominal interest rates and other possible nominal

rigidities.  

Policy Announcement, Directive, and Assessment of Risks8

(11) The wording of the second paragraph of the policy announcement–the

portion of the announcement that provides a rationale for the Committee’s decision–

should presumably reflect the judgments about the stance of monetary policy and

economic conditions that the Committee makes in arriving at its policy decision.  If

9 “Committee Discussion of the Wording of the Announcement,” memorandum to
the Committee from Vincent Reinhart, dated October 22, 2003.

the Committee decides to make no change in policy, then it may well want to employ

language similar to the statement issued following the September meeting.  Such a

statement would note that the accommodative stance of policy and vigorous growth

in productivity are providing ongoing support to economic activity and that incoming

data continue to show a firming of spending.  In light of the small rise in employment

in September and the somewhat lower levels of initial claims posted in recent weeks,

the Committee may want to note some evidence of stabilization in labor markets

rather than retaining the language that “the labor market has been weakening.”

(12) Even if the Committee is persuaded by the arguments for easier policy, it

may still want to start the “rationale” paragraph by noting that the accommodative

stance of policy and robust underlying growth in productivity are providing support to

economic activity and by acknowledging the recent strength in spending.  The

statement could then justify a rate cut by pointing to concerns about the sustainability

of brisk growth or the effects of faster structural productivity growth on estimates of

economic slack.  The statement might also note that the costs of a significant further

decline in inflation could be large whereas upside inflation risks seem small, helping to

tilt the balance in favor of easier policy.  

(13) This Bluebook assumes that the structure of the third paragraph of the

statement summarizing the risks to the outlook follows that selected at recent FOMC

meetings–with the possible exception of the final sentence, which will be discussed in

paragraph 16.9  The first two sentences summarize the risks to the outlook for

economic growth and for the rate of inflation over the next few quarters, which

correspond to the rows and columns, respectively, of Table 1.  If the Committee, like

the staff, sees output growth as likely to trim the slack in goods and factor markets

fairly slowly in coming quarters, then it may again judge that “... the risks to the

attainment of sustainable economic growth over the next several quarters are balanced.”  Such an

assessment might reflect a view that the phrase “sustainable economic growth” is

consistent with above-trend expansion over the next several quarters so long as it only

gradually closes the output gap.  Retention of this risk assessment might also follow

from an interpretation of the phrase that focused on whether or not the growth

process appeared to be self-sustaining, especially if the Committee harbored

reservations that the expansion could falter early in 2004.  However, if the Committee

views “sustainable economic growth” as denoting the growth rate of the economy’s

potential to produce, then it might be inclined to indicate that the risks are tilted

toward the upside at this meeting.  Since such a statement might be misread by the

markets, the Committee may want to make clear in the announcement that growth

above potential would not necessarily trigger tighter policy in the near term.   

(14) If the Committee remains concerned that substantial downward

pressures on prices could accumulate and that significantly lower inflation could prove

very costly, then it would likely indicate that, “...the probability, though minor, of an

unwelcome fall in inflation exceeds that of a rise in inflation from its already low level.”  However,

such concerns may have eased considerably given the tenor of the spending data since

summer, and, if the Committee believes that the more rapid growth is not likely to

prove transitory, then it might be ready to report that the risks to the outlook for

inflation over the next several quarters are about balanced. 

(15) The alternatives just discussed for the first two sentences admit four

possible configurations, as shown in Table 1.  As it did at the September meeting, the

Committee might see the risks to sustainable economic growth as balanced and the

risk of an unwelcome fall in inflation as outweighing that of a rise in inflation (the blue

diagonally hatched box in the table).  In that case it would presumably conclude that



11

“... the risk of inflation becoming undesirably low remains the predominant concern for the foreseeable

future.”  Alternatively, the Committee might assess the risks to sustainable growth as to

the upside but remain concerned about an unwelcome fall in inflation (the yellow

horizontally hatched box).  With the level of output currently below estimates of its

potential and inflation quite low, the Committee might believe that its dual goals are

more likely to be jeopardized by a further decline in inflation than by plausible

outcomes for growth in output.  In that case, it might continue to indicate that the risk

of undesirably low inflation was predominant.  However, if the Committee feels that

the prevailing degree of economic slack is relatively modest and thinks that output

growth could well pick up to a very rapid pace, then it might want to report a neutral

balance of risks.  Conversely, the Committee might still view the risks to sustainable

growth as balanced, but now believe that the risks to inflation are balanced as well (the

red vertically hatched box).  In that case, it seems likely that the overall assessment

also would be balanced.  Lastly, if the improvement in growth prospects is seen as

sufficiently large, the Committee might believe that the risks to sustainable output

growth are tilted to the upside, while the risks to inflation are balanced (the green

cross-hatched box).  If so, it would presumably indicate that the balance of risks is

weighted toward unsustainably rapid growth.     

(16) The final issue relating to the policy announcement is whether to modify

or delete the sentence “In these circumstances, the Committee believes that policy accommodation

can be maintained for a considerable period.”  This choice presumably depends upon the

same considerations that underlie the Committee’s selection of the balance of risks

statement.  If the Committee believes either that the growth of aggregate demand may

slow next year from its second-half pace or that the degree of slack in the economy is

currently considerable and will take time to work off, then it might choose to repeat

its earlier statement.  Such a decision might be especially favored if the Committee



12

viewed the firm anchoring of near-term policy expectations that appears to have been

the case of late as helpful in preventing market participants from anticipating

substantial policy tightening in short order.  However, with the recovery seemingly

gaining traction, the Committee might feel that tighter policy may well be needed

relatively soon to avoid a build-up in inflation pressures.  Since the Committee

presumably will want to remove the statement in its current form from the

announcement in advance of any policy tightening, it may judge that the time has

come to alter or drop it.  Relatively few market participants reportedly expect the

latter development at this meeting.  As a result, simply dropping the sentence might

well lead investors to move up the expected timing of policy tightening considerably,

prompting a sizable reaction in financial markets.

(17) Even if the Committee does not see current market expectations for

policy as unreasonable, it might be concerned that, as time goes by, repetition of the

sentence would lead investors to push back the date at which they expect tightening to

begin beyond the range that seems plausible to Committee members.  To avoid this

possibility, the statement could be made more clearly conditional on future economic

developments.  For example, the Committee could indicate that “. . . policy

accommodation can be maintained for the considerable period it currently assesses will be required to

foster the moderation of disinflationary pressures.”  Even with this modest change in wording,

interest rates would presumably rise some, since investors would see the change as

increasing the likelihood of a tightening move in the not-too-distant future.

(18) Should the Committee wish to follow the same procedure as at the last

two meetings, it could vote on the directive and on language providing guidance to

the drafters of the announcement regarding the risk assessment.  Draft language with

a range of options is provided below.  



13

(1) Directive Wording

The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and

financial conditions that will foster price stability and promote

sustainable growth in output.  To further its long-run objectives, the

Committee in the immediate future seeks conditions in reserve markets

consistent with maintaining/INCREASING/REDUCING the federal

funds rate at/TO an average of around ___ 1 percent.

(2) Risk Assessment

Against the background of its long-run goals of price stability and

sustainable economic growth and of the information currently available,

the Committee believes the risks to its outlook for sustainable economic

growth over the next several quarters [ARE WEIGHTED TOWARD

THE DOWNSIDE] [are balanced] [ARE WEIGHTED TOWARD

THE UPSIDE]; the risks to its outlook for inflation over the next

several quarters [are weighted to the downside] [ARE BALANCED]

[ARE WEIGHTED TOWARD THE UPSIDE]; and, taken together,

the balance of risks to its objectives [are weighted toward the downside]

[ARE BALANCED] [ARE WEIGHTED TOWARD THE UPSIDE] in

the foreseeable future. 

Market Reaction

(19) Market participants expect no change in the stance of monetary policy at

this meeting, and generally do not foresee an alteration in the three-sentence

assessment of risks.  Thus, an announcement that closely followed the content of the

September statement–that is, an announcement that the target federal funds rate was

being left at 1 percent, that the risks to sustainable growth were balanced, that the

probability of an unwelcome fall in inflation exceeds that of a rise, and that the risk of



14

undesirably low inflation remained the predominant concern–would presumably have

minimal effects in financial markets.  Given the focus of market participants on the

overall assessment of the balance of risks, market reactions would likely be quite

modest so long as the Committee continued to point to undesirably low inflation as

the predominant concern, even if the announcement indicated that the risks to

sustainable growth were now to the upside.  If, however, the Committee chose an

unchanged policy stance but suggested that the risks to its goals of sustainable

economic growth and price stability were about equal, investors would likely move up

their expected timing of policy tightening, pushing interest rates higher and trimming

stock prices.      

(20) A decision to ease policy at this meeting would surprise investors. 

Short-term interest rates would follow the federal funds rate lower, and

intermediate-term rates should also decline.  If investors interpreted the easier policy

as reflecting a higher desired level of long-run inflation on the part of the Committee

than they had previously believed, then they would likely foresee an easier policy

stance in the near term, but higher nominal interest rates in the longer run.  In that

case, long-term yields could increase, and the foreign exchange value of the dollar

would likely fall.  Alternatively, market participants might see the change in policy as

reflecting a deterioration in the outlook that they had not yet observed.  If so, longer-

term yields would presumably decline, as would stock prices and the dollar. 

Monetary and Credit Aggregates

(21) M2 is projected to accelerate gradually in coming months under the

assumptions of the Greenbook forecast.  The effects of the substantial drop-off in

mortgage refinancing activity on liquid deposits, which have trimmed M2 considerably

of late, are expected to diminish gradually.  Nonetheless, with the boost to M2 from

past monetary policy easings tailing off, and lower stock price volatility perhaps



15

encouraging some households to shift funds from M2 assets back into equities, the

expansion of M2 is expected to remain modest.  M2 is projected to be about flat from

September through December, bringing its increase for 2003 as a whole to around 

5-3/4 percent.  With a small further drag from the slowing of mortgage refinancing

flows and no change in opportunity costs, M2 growth in 2004 is forecast at 5-1/2

percent, a bit below the pace of expansion in nominal income.  The resulting increase

in M2 velocity would be the first in seven years.  M2 is projected to slow slightly

further in 2005, reflecting smaller gains in nominal income and the effects on

opportunity costs of the tightening of policy in the second half of the year.

(22) The growth rate of domestic nonfinancial sector debt is expected to

decline over the Greenbook period.  Household sector debt is projected to slow

noticeably in the current quarter, and then to decelerate a bit further in 2004 and 2005,

though it continues to expand at a slightly faster rate than disposable personal income. 

A reduction in the pace of mortgage refinancing, and a consequent fall in the volume

of cash raised from such transactions, is associated with a slowing in mortgage debt

that is only partly offset by an acceleration in consumer credit.  In the corporate 

sector, the pickup in investment spending in coming months is nearly matched by

rising profits, limiting business borrowing.  However, the rise in investment outlays

subsequently outstrips profits, and business debt growth picks up.  Federal borrowing

remains considerable through 2004, but it is projected to slow in 2005 as the budget

deficit narrows.  All told, debt of the domestic nonfinancial sectors is projected to

expand 8-1/4 percent in 2003 and then to slow to 7 percent and 6-1/4 percent in

2004 and 2005, respectively.

Appendix: The September FOMC Announcement

Paragraph Text

1. Policy decision The Federal Open Market Committee decided today to keep
its target for the federal funds rate at 1 percent. 

2. Rationale The Committee continues to believe that an accommodative
stance of monetary policy, coupled with robust underlying
growth in productivity, is providing important ongoing
support to economic activity. The evidence accumulated over
the intermeeting period confirms that spending is firming,
although the labor market has been weakening. Business
pricing power and increases in core consumer prices remain
muted. 

3. Assessment of
risks

The Committee perceives that the upside and downside risks
to the attainment of sustainable growth for the next few
quarters are roughly equal. In contrast, the probability, though
minor, of an unwelcome fall in inflation exceeds that of a rise
in inflation from its already low level. The Committee judges
that, on balance, the risk of inflation becoming undesirably
low remains the predominant concern for the foreseeable
future. In these circumstances, the Committee believes that
policy accommodation can be maintained for a considerable
period. 

4. Vote Voting for the FOMC monetary policy action were: Alan
Greenspan, Chairman; Ben S. Bernanke; Susan S. Bies; J.
Alfred Broaddus, Jr.; Roger W. Ferguson, Jr.; Edward M.
Gramlich; Jack Guynn; Donald L. Kohn; Michael H. Moskow;
