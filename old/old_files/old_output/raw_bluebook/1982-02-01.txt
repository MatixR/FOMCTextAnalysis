Prefatory Note 

 
 

The attached document represents the most complete and accurate version 
available based on original copies culled from the files of the FOMC Secretariat at the 
Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System.  This electronic document was 
created through a comprehensive digitization process which included identifying the best-
preserved paper copies, scanning those copies,1 and then making the scanned versions 
text-searchable.2  Though a stringent quality assurance process was employed, some 
imperfections may remain. 
 

Please note that this document may contain occasional gaps in the text.  These 
gaps are the result of a redaction process that removed information obtained on a

1 In some cases, original copies needed to be photocopied before being scanned into electronic format.  All 
scanned images were deskewed (to remove the effects of printer- and scanner-introduced tilting) and lightly 
cleaned (to remove dark spots caused by staple holes, hole punches, and other blemishes caused after initial 
printing). 
2 A two-step process was used.  An advanced optimal character recognition computer program (OCR) first 
created electronic text from the document image.  Where the OCR results were inconclusive, staff checked

MONETARY POLICY ALTERNATIVES

Recent developments

(1) Growth in M1, which was relatively rapid in November

and December, is estimated to have accelerated considerably further in

January to somewhat above a 21 percent annual rate, and is on a track

well above the FOMC's short-run target path of 4 to 5 percent growth

from November 1981 to March 1982 for this aggregate. Largely reflecting

strength in M1, the broader M2 measure--which expanded at about an 11¼

percent average rate over December and January--has grown somewhat above

the Committee's 9 to 10 percent target for the November-March interval.

The same pattern is evident in the newly revised money supply data

reflecting the annual benchmark and seasonal factor review. On the

revised basis, estimated January growth in M1 was at about a 22 percent

annual rate, and growth in M2 was 11¼ percent.1/ (Recent data on reserves

and monetary aggregates on a revised basis are shown in the table on the

next page. Subsequent references to the aggregates in this blue book

are on a revised basis).

(2) The surge in M1 growth in November and December reflected

expansion in the currency, demand, and OCD components of the aggregate.

1/ The impacts of the annual benchmark and seasonal factor revisions,
on a preliminary basis, as well as minor modifications in the defini-
tion of M2,are indicated in appendix I, where growth rates for the
old and revised series are compared. The definitional changes con-
sist mainly of excluding from M2 the "institution only" money market
mutual funds (which remain in M3) and including in M2 retail RP's
(which previously were included in M3 but excluded from M2). The
revised aggregates are confidential until officially released after
Chairman Volcker testifies on February 10. As discussed more fully in
Appendix I, the revision of the monetary aggregates does not result in a
substantially different overall pattern for 1981 or early 1982.
M1 growth for 1981 is still well below the low end of the longer-run
range and shows a substantial acceleration from October to January.
Revised M2 growth for 1981 is only slightly lower, and is still above
the upper end of its range.

The accelerated OCD growth contributed more than two-thirds of the November-

December growth in M1, and probably reflects the same precautionary motives

that contributed to growth in savings deposits beginning in November

following a year of continual monthly declines. In January, the surge of

demand deposits in the first statement week of the month (which included

the year-end statement date for banks and businesses) in large part reversed

as the month progressed.1/ Meanwhile, other checkable deposits continued

to exhibit substantial strength and apparently have expanded even more

rapidly than in November and December.

(3) A pick-up in M1 growth during a period of declining economic

2/activity is not without precedent.- Some part of the recent very rapid

expansion in money demand probably reflects a delayed response to earlier

declines in interest rates. In addition, uncertainties about the outlook

for income and interest rates likely have increased the precautionary

demands for highly liquid assets, including, as noted above, the OCD

component of narrow money and savings deposits included in M2. The

strengthening of savings and transactions deposits has been accompanied

in December and January by a decline of small time deposits and a slowing

in expansion of money market funds.

(4) Bank credit growth, adjusted for shifts to IBFs, picked up

to an 11 percent annual rate in December after two months of weakness. The

December acceleration was due mainly to a quickened pace in loans, led

was both decelerating and negative.



by a significantly higher growth of business loans (adjusted for shifts

to IBFs). Large bank data for early January suggest continued strength

for business loans, in large part reflecting a shift in corporate borrowing

from long-term markets. In December and January, commercial banks supple-

mented their other deposit flows by stepping up issuance of large time

deposits, while S&Ls continued to issue such deposits at an appreciable

pace.

(5) Total reserves expanded over December and January at about

13½ percent annual rate on average, reflecting the increase in required

reserves associated with the strength in the aggregates. Most of the

increased demand for reserves in December was, consistent with the reserve

path, accommodated by open market operations. By January, however, con-

straint on reserve provision by the Desk led to a sizable increase in

adjustment borrowing at the discount window as required reserves strengthened

markedly relative to path. The increase in borrowings was reinforced, given

continued strength in the aggregates, by a mid-January lowering of the

nonborrowed reserve path.1/ Nonborrowed reserves declined in January at

an estimated 13 percent annual rate. Over the last four statement weeks,

adjustment borrowing has averaged about $1.3 billion, in contrast to the

$300 million initially assumed in construction of the nonborrowed reserve

path.

(6) Given the tightening of bank reserve positions, short-

term market interest rates have risen about ¾ to 1½ percentage points,

on balance, since the December FOMC meeting. The federal funds rate has

moved up to the 14 percent area. Markets also have focused on the large

current and prospective borrowing requirements of the federal government.

1/ Reserve paths and adjustments made since the last Committee meeting
are shown in Appendix II.



Since the December meeting, the Treasury has increased the size of the

weekly bill auction twice, boosted the monthly bill auction, and .issued

126-day cash management bills. For its mid-February refunding, the

Treasury has announced an offering of $10 billion of new coupon issues

(which will raise $5 3/4 billion of new cash). Bond rates rose substantially

after the December FOMC meeting, but the recent rally has cut the increase

to about 1/4 to 1/2 percentage point. In January corporate bond issuance

declined to minimal levels, increasing the already sizable backlog of

issues overhanging the market. Since the last meeting, rates on fixed

rate mortgages in the primary market have risen almost 3/4 of a percentage

point.

(7) The dollar has risen by 2 percent on a weighted average

basis,

. The strength of the dollar was primarily in response

to the recent rise in short-term U.S. interest rates, coupled with a slight

decline in foreign interest rates, which increased the differential

between U.S. and a weighted average of short-term foreign interest rates

from to 2 percentage points over the period.



Alternative longer-run monetary strategies

(8) Broad economic and financial considerations affecting

the Committee's decision with respect to long-run targets for 1982

were discussed in the previous blue book. In this blue book, quantita-

tive impacts on key economic variables are estimated for alternative

money growth strategies looking out over the next three years. Of the

three strategies shown in the table on the next page, Strategy 1 would

have M1 grow from its QIV '81 level at the 4 percent midpoint of the

Committee's tentative 2½ to 5½ percent range for 1982 and then decelerate

gradually to 3½ percent in 1983 and 3 percent in 1984. M2 growth in 1982

would be about 8 percent, in the upper part of the FOMC's tentative 6 to

9 percent range. This strategy embodies the monetary policy assumption

underlying the staff's judgmental GNP forecast detailed in the Greenbook.

Strategy 2 specifies faster M1 growth--at the 5½ percent top of tentative

range for 1982 and then decelerating one-half percentage point per year

in 1983 and 1984. Strategy 3 represents a more stringent monetary policy,

with M1 growing at the 2½ percent low end of the tentative 1982 range and

continuing at that same rate in 1983 and 1984.

(9) As may be seen in the table, the extension of the Strategy 1

monetary path through 1984 produces a continuation of the moderate real GNP

growth in the Greenbook forecast for 1983 and a further slowing of inflation.

Unemployment remains in the 9 percent area. The higher M1 growth in Strategy 2

permits a considerably faster expansion of nominal GNP. (Projections

associated with Strategies 2 and 3 were derived as differences from the

judgmental base forecast as calculated by the Board's quarterly econometric

model.) Given the structure of the economy, as captured in the model,

within the three year forecast horizon the bulk of the increment to

nominal GNP under strategy 2 shows up in greater output. However, by the

third year inflation is no longer slowing, and upward price pressures are

likely to be strengthening,given the level of plant and manpower resource

utilization. Strategy 3, on the other hand, forces a more rapid decelera-

tion in nominal GNP; real GNP growth is very sluggish, causing the

unemployment rate to move above 10 percent, but the inflation rate drops

to around 3 percent by 1984.

(10) It should be noted that the staff's judgmental forecast,

represented by the Strategy 1 results, implies a substantial continuing

shortfall in the demand for M1 relative to the patterns obtaining before

the mid-1970s (according to the standard formulation in the Board model).

The failure of such weakness to materialize would result, at least in the

earlier part of the period, in higher interest rates, with negative con-

sequences for economic activity. On the other hand, the projection for

Strategy 3 does not allow for the possibility that a tendency for short-

term rates to rise toward record levels might prompt a still greater

degree of innovation in cash management; such a development would mean

that attainment of the specified M1 growth would be less restrictive than

indicated. Finally, it also should be noted that these figures do not

make allowance for the possibility that wages might adjust more quickly

than in the past to labor market slack or that inflation expectations,

as reflected in wage decisions or in bond rates, might improve markedly

owing to a greater public confidence in governmental policies. Such

developments could yield better outcomes for both real output and prices,

but would have to be major departures from past patterns in order to

materially alter the picture.



-9-

Near-term targets

(11) Attainment of the Committee's short-run target calling

for growth in M1 at a 4 to 5 percent annual rate from November to March

requires M1 to decline on average on the order of 8 percent, at an annual rate,

over February and March. Such an average rate of decline for a two-month

period would be very unusual, though not without precedent in the period

since 1959 for which we have monthly daily average data. So rapid a two-

month rate of decline developed in March-April of 1980, but at that time

money supply behavior was affected in large part by the ramifications of the

newly imposed credit control programs. However, there was a two-month

decline of similar magnitude in 1981 that seemed more related to monetary

policy actions. In May-June of last year M1-B (shift adjusted) declined at

almost a 7 percent annual rate, following a 19½ percent rise in April, while

the funds rate rose from a low of 13 percent in late March to over 19

percent in June.1/ Under current circumstances, it seems plausible that

there will be a sharp deceleration in money demand at around current interest

rates,and possibly even some decline, in part as the public begins to

invest or spend funds that had been temporarily placed in NOW accounts and

also demand deposits. But the very sharp decline over a 2-month period re-

quired to attain the FOMC's previous target seems unlikely to occur without a

further rise in the funds rate. A contraction in total reserves at about

a 7 percent annual rate from January to March would be needed. Non-

borrowed reserves would decline at about a 30 percent annual rate, if

borrowing were set at around $3 billion on the ground that a rise in the

funds rate of around 3 percentage points is likely to develop.

1/ Not-shift adjusted M1-B declined at a 6¾ percent annual rate in May-
June following a 25 percent rise in April.



-10-

(12) Continuation of the short-run policy toward M1 adopted

at the last meeting is shown as alternative A in the table below. This

option would bring M1 into the upper half of the 2½ to 5½ percent longer-

run range by March, assuming this long-run range is based, as has been

the case in the past, on the actual average level of M1 in the fourth

quarter of the previous year.1/ The risk of sharp interest rate fluctua-

tions that might be associated with alternative A, accompanied by

potentially adverse implications for economic activity and financial

markets, might be reduced by extending beyond the first quarter the

horizon over which the Committee targets the return of M1 to within the

tentative 2½ to 5½ percent longer-run range--as is contemplated by the

three other alternatives in the table. (More detailed and longer-run data

for the alternatives are contained in the table and charts on the

following pages).

1/ Even if the Committee wished to aim at the upper limit of that longer-
run range by March, M1 would have to contract at about a 5½ percent
annual rate over the remaining months of the quarter.

NOTE: Bank credit would be expected to grow approximately 8 percent between QIV '81 and QIV '82 under alternatives A, B, and
C, and somewhat faster under alternative D -- !after adjustment for the impact of shifts of assets from domestic offices
to IBFs. The need for such an IBF adjustment could be avoided by basing the annual range for bank credit on the
actual December-January average; such a base would yield virtually the same 1982 growth rates.

(13) Alternative B is designed to attain the upper limit of

the 2½ to 5½ percent range for M1 by June. That would be achieved, as

shown in Chart 1, by extending the January to March annual growth rate of

1 percent, suggested for this alternative, through June. This approach,

like alternative A, would be consistent with growth for 1982 at around the

midpoint of the longer-run range. Alternative C, which involves about a

2½ percent annual rate of growth over the last two months of the current

quarter, is designed to reach the upper end of the M1 range by September.

Such an approach would be more consistent with growth for the year in the

upper half of the longer-run range.

(14) Alternative D specifies a 4 percent annual rate of growth

for February and March. Continuation of that growth rate over the balance

of the year would result in growth of M1 from QIV '81 to QIV '82 at about

6¾ percent, above the 5½ percent upper limit of the 1982 range based on

the actual QIV '81 average level. Such a trajectory would be consistent

with a Committee decision to raise the upper limit of the tentative 1982

range or a decision to base the 2½ to 5½ percent range, not on the actual

QIV '81 level, but on, say, the lower limit of last year's longer-run

target range.1/ When the Committee established its tentative range for

1982 last July, it had anticipated that M1 would reach the lower limit

of the long-run range for 1981 by the fourth quarter; an upward shift in

1/ To derive a base consistent with the current M1, which is not shift-
adjusted, the level in QIV '81 implied by the 3½ percent lower limit

of the target range for M1-B shift-adjusted has to be raised by the
$11.3 billion of estimated shifts into NOW accounts from non-demand

deposit sources in 1981. This derived level would be $5.1 billion,
or 1.2 percent, higher than the actual (not shift-adjusted) level of
M1-B in the fourth quarter of 1981.



-13-

the base for the 1982 range would in that context indicate the Committee

was not willing to accept last year's undershoot and viewed the recent

increase in M1 as at least in part a desirable offset to the earlier short-

fall. With such a rebasing of the 2½ to 5½ percent longer-run range for

1982, the specifications of alternative D if extended for the year would

bring M1 into the upper half of the rebased range by the fourth quarter of

this year. If alternative C were adopted in conjunction with a rebasing

of the long-run range, growth by the fourth quarter would be around the

midpoint of the range.

(15) In all of the alternatives, except for A, M2 would probably

be above the top of its tentative longer-run range by March, essentially

reflecting the strength of M1 growth over the last three months. Given

the slowing in M1 growth that is targeted for the balance of the year,

the staff expects that M2 growth over the year as a whole will fall within

its longer-run range for alternatives A, B, and C, and will be at the top

of the range under the more expansive alternative D. Such behavior would

be consistent with the unchanged income-velocity of M2 over the past two

years.

(16) Alternative B calls for growth in Ml at about a 1 percent

annual rate over the two months January to March, a considerable decelera-

tion from the rapid pace of the previous three months. The staff believes

that such a slowing in narrow money growth is consistent with only rather

modest further upward pressure on interest rates, if any. Given the

staff's projection of nominal GNP growth during the current quarter at

only about a 2½ percent annual rate, the rapid increase in money that has

already occurred would appear quite sufficient to finance transactions

needs over the quarter, even assuming that a substantial part of the



-14-

increase represented precautionary balances. Indeed, even with virtually

no money growth over the balance of the quarter, the velocity of M1 would

decline in the quarter at a postwar record annual rate of about 9 percent.

(17) The alternative B specifications would entail little change

in total reserves over the period from January to March. Assuming adjustment

borrowing of around $1 billion, nonborrowed reserves would decline at a

3 percent rate and, at the present discount rate, the federal funds rate

in the intermeeting period would likely fluctuate in a 13½ to 14½ percent

range.1/ Demands for short-term credit are likely to remain quite strong

over the balance of the quarter, with businesses continuing to avoid the

bond market at the relatively high rate levels likely to prevail over the

near-term under this alternative.

(18) Treasury credit demands will remain sizable in all maturity

sectors. The 3-month bill rate may be in a 12½ to 13½ percent range over

the next few weeks. However, both short- and long-rates might show down-

ward tendencies as the quarter progresses, as the market responds to slow

money growth and also if economic indicators show unexpected economic

weakness. Residential mortgage rates are likely to remain near their

current advanced levels, and this may work to restrain demand for mortgage

commitments--the supply of which might also be constrained by cautious

behavior of thrifts in face of continued operating losses.

(19) Alternative C, which calls for growth of M1 at about a

2½ percent annual rate from January to March, would involve an increase

in total reserves over the balance of the quarter at about a 2 percent

1/ Such an interest rate is consistent with the near-term financial condi-
tions assumed in the Greenbook GNP projection. Appendix III shows
the quarterly pattern of interest rates over 1982 and 1983 associated
with the Greenbook projection.



-15-

annual rate. Assuming a decline in adjustment borrowing from recent levels

to about $1 billion, nonborrowed reserves would rise at 2 percent rate.

A federal funds rate of about 13 percent would be implied. The 3-month

bill rate would likely decline from present levels to around 12 percent

or a bit lower as expectations of further monetary ease tend to develop.

Bond yields may edge down from current levels, inducing a pick-up in bond

issuance from recent depressed levels.

(20) Alternative D, involving a 4 percent rate of growth of M1

on average in February and March, would require a growth in total reserves

at about a 4 percent annual rate. Given the staff's expectations for

weak money demand,such reserve growth would probably be associated with

a decline in borrowing to about $500 million, given the current discount

rate, and with growth in nonborrowed reserves at a 15 percent annual rate

over the balance of the quarter. The federal funds rate may drop to near

12 percent, and the 3-month bill rate decline into the 10½ to 11 percent

area. A sizable rally in bond markets would also tend to develop, but

marketing of the large overhang of corporate bonds would tend to moderate

the extent of rate decline. Cost pressure on thrift institutions would be

eased, which would probably be reflected in a downward adjustment in

mortgage rates and in a greater willingness on the part of instititions

to make mortgage commitments. M2 growth is likely to be strengthened

under this alternative, particularly in the near-term, as yields on MMMFs

lag the drop in open market rates.



-16-

Directive language

(21) Given below are two suggested operational paragraphs

for the directive. Alternative I, in which the specifications adopted

at the meeting on December 21-22 are shown in strike-through form, is

the more standard form. It could be adapted to growth rates either

continuing to be based on November, as at the last meeting, or updated

to January to take account of recent developments. Alternative II need

not have different substantive implications than alternative I. However,

its language relates the short-run objectives more explicitly to

achievement of the longer-run target over time, and indicates that a more

rapid return than the basic short-run path that might be selected by the

Committee would be acceptable in an environment of easier market conditions.

Alternative I

In the short run, the Committee seeks behavior of reserve

aggregates consistent with growth of M1 and M2 from [DEL: November

1981 to March] ____ TO ____ at annual rates of around [DEL: 4-to-5]

____ percent and [DEL: 9 to 10] ____ percent respectively. [DEL: The target

for M1 no longer reflects the "shift adjustment" for conversion

of outstanding interest-bearing assets into NOW accounts,

formerly estimated in the "shirft adjusted" M-1B series. In

setting the M1 target, the Committee took acocunt of the

relatively rapid growth that had already taken place through

the first part of December; it also recognized that inter-

pretation of actual money growth may nned to take account of

the significance of fluctuations in NOW accounts, which have

recently been growing relatively rapidly.] The Chairman may

call for Committee consultation if it appears to the Manager



-17-

for Domestic Operations that pursuit of the monetary objectives

and related reserve paths during the period before the next

meeting is likely to be associated with a federal funds rate

persistently outside a range of [DEL: 10 to 14] ____ TO ____ percent.

Alternative II

The Committee seeks behavior of reserve aggregates over the

balance of the quarter consistent with bringing M1 and M2 over time

into their longer-run target ranges for the year. For the January to

March period growth in M1 and M2 at annual rates of around ____

and ____ percent, respectively, is sought. A slower growth, or

in the case of M1 some decline, would be associated with more

rapid attainment of the longer-run range and would be acceptable

in the context of declining market interest rates. [Same federal

funds rate sentence as in alternative I].



APPENDIX I

MONEY STOCK REVISIONS

Measures of the money stock have been revised to incorporate

annual seasonal adjustment and benchmark changes, as well as minor defini-

tional changes. This appendix briefly describes these changes, to be

considered confidential until published after the Chairman's testimony,

and compares growth rates of the revised series, which are still preliminary,

with the old series.

Revisions to seasonal factors

Seasonal adjustment factors have been updated using data for 1981

and, in accordance with a recommendation of the Committee of Experts on

Seasonal Adjustment Techniques, an X-11-ARIMA method was used to compute

seasonal factors for 1982. For the deposit component of M1, seasonal

factors were calculated using data preadjusted to reduce distortions to

deposit flows accompanying the Special Credit Restraint Program of 1980

and shifts to NOW and ATS accounts; a similar procedure had been used in

1981. Seasonal factors for transactions deposits and demand deposits

were estimated separately, giving implicit factors for other checkable

deposits. Revisions due to seasonal factors were relatively small for

most months; however, in May, August and November of last year seasonal

revisions lowered M1 growth by 2¾, 2 and 4 percentage points at an

annual rate, respectively, while in June and September they raised M1

growth by 3½ to 2½ percentage points, respectively.

Benchmark revisions

Several benchmark revisions were made.

* Commercial bank deposits data were benchmarked to the March,

June and September 1981 call reports. The impact of these

adjustments was relatively small, both on levels and growth

rates.



I-2

* A consolidation adjustment has been made to remove at the M1

level the portion of thrift institutions' holdings of vault

cash that is estimated to be used for servicing their other

checkable deposit (OCD) liabilities; this lowers the currency

component of the money stock that previously included all

vault cash at thrift institutions. The remainder of thrift

institution vault cash has been removed at the M2 level.

This consolidation adjustment lowers M1 by less than

$.2 billion and M2 by $2.1 billion in December 1981; this

adjustment affects growth rates minimally.

* Cash items in the process of collection (CIPC) of thrift

institutions has been netted against transactions deposits

at the M1 level, lowering the level of the aggregates by

about $1.1 billion in December 1981 and affecting growth

rates negligibly. Owing to lack of data availability,

CIPC of thrift institutions previously had not been deducted

from measures of the money stock.

* Daily deposits data for savings and time deposits at thrift

institutions--reported since November 1980 as a consequence

of the Monetary Control Act of 1980--have been incorporated,

making these components for thrifts comparable to those of

commercial banks in terms of frequency of data and definition.

Incorporation of these new data has raised the level of small

time and savings deposits at thrifts by about $3 billion in

December 1981, although growth of M2 in 1981 was affected

only slightly.



I-3

* Revisions to deposits data of quarterly reporting institutions

and travelers check data have been incorporated. The principal

impact of revisions to quarterly reporters was to raise M1

growth in September and October of 1981 while revisions to

travelers checks reduced narrow money growth a bit in the

fourth quarter of last year.

Compositional changes

In the revised measures, retail RPs at all depository institutions--

issued in denominations of less than $100,000--appear in the small denomina-

tion time deposit component of M2; in the old measures, retail RPs entered

at the M3 level as a component of term RPs. Institution-only money market

mutual funds are removed from the money market mutual fund component of M2

and enter the money stock at the M3 level, along with large-denomination

time deposits and large denomination term RPs. The inclusion of retail

RPs raises the level of M2 by $12.5 billion in December 1981 while the

removal of institution-only money funds lowers M2 by $30.1 billion (after

a consolidation adjustment to the overnight RP component of M2 reflecting

RPs held by such money market funds) in that month. For the QIV '80 to

QIV '81 period, the retail RP adjustment raised the 12 growth rate by

0.7 percent, while the removal of institution-only money market funds

reduced this aggregate's growth rate by 0.9 percent.

Tables I-1, I-2 and I-3 compare growth rates of revised and old

M1, shift-adjusted M1, and M2. At this writing, revised M3 data are not

available.
