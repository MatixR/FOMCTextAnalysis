Recent developments

(1) Around the end of June incoming deposit data began to

indicate that RPD and the narrowly defined money supply were growing at

annual rates in excess of the upper limits of the Committee's June-July

ranges of tolerance. At the same time the rate of expansio in M 2 appeared

to be close to its upper limit. M2 moved ahead less rapidly than M1

because growth in other time and savings deposits fell somewhat short of

expectations.

(2) With monetary aggregates generally at or above the top of

the target ranges, the Account Manager moved to a more restrictive reserve

posture. This change was expected to raise the average Federal funds rate

from the 8-1/2 per cent level that had been prevailing to the 9-1/4 per cent

ceiling adopted by the Committee at its June meeting. At the same time,

however, seasonal movements in technical factors were absorbing a large

volume of reserves and commercial banks were seeking to adjust their reserve

positions in light of the Friday, June 29 statement date and the Wednesday,

July 4 holiday. Member bank borrowing at the Federal Reserve ballooned to

$4 billion and $2.9 billion on July 2 and 3, respectively, and the effective

rate on Federal funds rose to 10 and 13 per cent on these days. Money

market psychology was also being affected in this period by the June 29

actions of the Federal Reserve raising the discount rate and reserve

requirements on demand deposits. For the July 4 statement week as a

whole, member bank borrowing averaged $2.4 billion and the Federal funds

rate 10.21 per cent.

(3) Following the increased tightness of the July 4 holiday

week, borrowings dropped sharply and the Federal funds rate fell back.

On Friday, July 6, with growth in the monetary aggregates showing no

tendency to recede, Committee members agreed to raise the ceiling on the

Federal funds rate to 9-3/4 per cent. Under this additional leeway, the

Desk pursued a tighter reserve management policy in the expectation that

Federal funds would trade around 9-1/2 per cent. In the statement week



-3-

ending July 11, the funds rate actually averaged 9.52 per cent. When

evidence subsequently became available that the overshoot in M1 was

widening, the Desk adjusted reserve strategy again, expecting the funds

rate to average close to the new 9-3/4 per cent ceiling.

(4) Early in the inter-meeting period, before the System policy

actions of late June, short-term interest rates had begun to rise partly

in anticipation of some further policy tightening. Bank CD rates showed

the most pronounced advance, reflecting bank efforts to recoup the large

CD run-offs that had developed over the quarterly tax date. When the

System's policy actions proved to be more aggressive than generally

anticipated, short-term rates jumped sharply. Over the full inter-meeting

period interest rates on private short-term instruments--including the

bank prime rate--have risen generally 75--100 basis points. Treasury

bill rates reached a peak early in July, with the 3-month issue at about

8 per cent, or about 5/8 of a percentage point above levels prevailing at

the time of the last meeting. Most recently, however, the 3-month Treasury

bill rate was quoted 7.78 per cent.

(5) Long-term interest rates also had been moving up prior to the

late-June policy actions and rose considerably further in early July. Over

the inter-meeting period as a whole, the yield advance amounted to about

20--35 basis points. In the mortgage market, the rate in the latest

bi-weekly FNMA auction of commitments to buy FHA and VA mortgages jumped



29 basis points to 8.38 per cent, and field reports suggest that rates on

newly committed funds in primary mortgage markets have risen as much as

1/2 a percentage point in some key local markets. These changes apparently

reflect both cut-backs in new commitment activity by mortgage lenders con-

cerned about further reductions in savings inflows over the months ahead

and the pass-through of higher interest costs resulting from recent

increases in rates paid for savings.

(6) The table on the next page shows (in percentage annual rates

of change) selected monetary and financial flows over various time periods.

Prospective developments

(7) Three alternative policy strategies are summarized below

for Committee consideration. Alternative B incorporates a 3-3/4 per

cent annual rate of growth for M1 over the second half of 1973. This

is the growth rate that would be required to return to the 5-1/4 per

cent longer-run target path for M1, reaffirmed at the last meeting,

taking account of the overshoot in June and the second quarter (see

accompanying chart). Alternative A represents a somewhat easier policy,

and alternative C a somewhat tighter one. (More detailed figures are

shown in the table on the following page).

(8) In the weeks immediately ahead, the staff expects that

there would be little further change in the Federal funds rate if the

Committee adopts the aggregate targets specified in alternative B. The

funds rate range shown for this alternative centers on the recently

prevailing 9-3/4 per cent level. Under alternative A, we would expect

the funds rate to decline from current levels as more reserves are

provided to encourage monetary growth, and under alternative C we would

expect it to rise.

(9) Under all three alternatives growth in the monetary

aggregates would be slower in the second half of 1973 than in the first

half. Money demand is expected to moderate because of a slowing in the

rate of growth of nominal GNP and because of the cumulative impact of

recent sharp interest rate increases. While the timing of such demand

adjustments is always uncertain, our best judgment is that a significant

slowing will begin in August. For July-August combined, a 3-3/4--5-3/4

per cent annual rate of growth for M1 is indicated under alternative B.

(10) Under prevailing money market conditions, short-term

rates are likely to rise somewhat further between now and the next

meeting. The 3-month bill may rise into the 8--8-1/2 per cent area.

However, the 3-month bill is in short market supply currently, and

upward adjustment of the rate may be moderated particularly if the

Treasury emphasizes long-term offerings and/or pays off a considerable



portion of the maturing issues in its forthcoming mid-August refinancing.

About $4-1/2 billion of publicly held securities mature at that time.

The Treasury will announce terms for the refunding on July 25. It is

still too early to say much about the characteristics of the offering.

(11) Growth in time deposits other than large CD's is expected

to slow considerably in the second half of the year. Many banks raised

offering rates promptly following the increase in ceiling rates, but the

spread of market rates over deposit rates remains considerably wider than

in the first half of the year. With regard to the long-term certificate

without ceiling, there have been a number of instances of attractive and

innovative offerings. It is too soon, however, to evaluate the extent to

which such offerings will catch on at banks and with the public. For the

time being we have assumed that long-term certificates will make only a

modest net contribution to growth in consumer-type time deposits. Under

alternative B, a growth rate of around 6 per cent is expected for time

deposits other than large CD's in the second half of the year. And the

growth rate for M2 would be around 4-3/4 per cent.

(12) The slowing in growth of demand and consumer-type time

deposits will limit bank credit availability. Banks are expected to

attempt to compensate at least in part through sales of large CD's.

However, the high cost of these funds and expected abatement of loan

demand as the economic expansion slows and bank lending terms stiffen are



likely to retard growth in CD's below the second-quarter pace. Under

alternative B, the bank credit proxy in the second half is expected to

increase at a 7-1/2 per cent annual rate, considerably slower than in

the first half.

(13) Long-term rates are likely to be moving upward in

response to the recent upsurge in short rates, and would probably come

under additional pressure to the degree that short rates rise further.

The summer calendar of corporate bond issues remains seasonally light,

however, and the Treasury is likely to borrow a less than seasonal amount

over the balance of the year, offset only in part by further agency offerings.

In general, demand pressures on capital markets seem unlikely to be strong

unless there is a sizable shift in corporate borrowing from banks to the

bond market. However, the supply of investment funds is likely to be

falling off--for example, for municipals, as banks come under increasing

pressure and for mortgages, in reflection of smaller savings flows to

depositary institutions. Of course, it market participants should come

to believe in a strong Phase IV control program or the probability of

vigorous fiscal action, the outlook for interest rates would be modified

considerably.



Proposed directive

(14) Presented below are three alternative formulations for the

operational paragraph of the directive, which might be taken to correspond

to the similarly lettered policy alternatives discussed in the preceding

section. For all three alternatives it is proposed to add a reference to

Treasury financing because of the regular August refinancing to be announced

late this month.

Alternative A

To implement this policy, while taking account of international

and domestic financial market developments AND THE FORTHCOMING TREASURY

FINANCING, the Committee seeks to achieve bank reserve and money market

conditions consistent with somewhat slower growth in monetary aggregates

over the months immediately ahead than [DEL: appears indicated for] OCCURRED ON

AVERAGE IN the first half of the year.

Alternative B

To implement this policy, while taking account of international

and domestic financial market developments AND THE FORTHCOMING TREASURY

FINANCING, the Committee seeks to achieve bank reserve and money market

conditions consistent with [DEL: somewhat] slower growth in monetary aggregates

over the months immediately ahead than [DEL: appears indicated for] OCCURRED ON

AVERAGE IN the first half of the year.

Alternative C

To implement this policy, while taking account of international

FINANCING, the Committee seeks to achieve bank reserve and money market

conditions consistent with [DEL: somewhat] SIGNIFICANTLY slower growth in mone-

tary aggregates over the months immediately ahead than [DEL: appears indicated
