Prefatory Note 
 
 
The attached document represents the most complete and accurate version available 
based on original copies culled from the files of the FOMC Secretariat at the Board 
of Governors of the Federal Reserve System.  This electronic document was created 
through a comprehensive digitization process which included identifying the best-
preserved paper copies, scanning those copies,1 and then making the scanned 
versions text-searchable.2   Though a stringent quality assurance process was 
employed, some imperfections may remain. 
 
Please note that some material may have been redacted from this document if that 
material was received on a confidential basis.  Redacted material is indicated by 
occasional gaps in the text or by gray boxes around non-text content.  All redacted

1  In some cases, original copies needed to be photocopied before being scanned into electronic 
format.  All scanned images were deskewed (to remove the effects of printer- and scanner-introduced 
tilting) and lightly cleaned (to remove dark spots caused by staple holes, hole punches, and other 
blemishes caused after initial printing). 
 
2 A two-step process was used.  An advanced optical character recognition computer program (OCR) 
first created electronic text from the document image.  Where the OCR results were inconclusive, 
staff checked and corrected the text as necessary.  Please note that the numbers and text in charts and

MONETARY AGGREGATES AND
MONEY MARKET CONDITIONS

Recent developments

(1) M1 grew at about a 2 per cent annual rate in September, and

further weakness in recent data now suggest some net contraction for October.

As a result M1 is projected to decline slightly on average over the two-month

target period--falling substantially below the lower end of the Committee's

range of tolerance, as shown in the table. The weakness in M1 and a further

slowing of growth in consumer-type time deposits in September have reduced

the expected two-month growth rate for M2 to a 4.3 per cent annual rate, also

well below its range of tolerance.

1/ A majority of the Committee members concurred in the Chairman's
recommendation of October 2 to reduce the lower end of the funds
rate range from 6 to 5¾ per cent.



-2-

(2) Business loans at banks and commercial paper issued by

nonfinancial corporations both declined in September, as high corporate

liquidity reduced the need for external financing. Even so, the outstanding

volume of large negotiable bank CD's expanded appreciably for the first time

since January. This unexpected CD growth was concentrated among a few money

center banks and seems to have represented an effort to improve their liquidity

positions in preparation for possible adverse market reactions stemming from

the continuing financial problems of New York and recent publicity highlighting

loan losses at banks. As a result of the CD expansion, and of a larger than

projected rise in Government deposits, the bank credit proxy appears to be

expanding at about a 5 per cent annual rate in the September-October period.

(3) In the initial statement week after the September FOMC meeting,

the Desk sought reserve conditions consistent with a Federal funds rate

trading in a 6¼ -6½ per cent range. On October 2, incoming data suggested

that growth in the monetary aggregates was running below the Committee's

ranges of tolerance, and conditions in the municipal market were becoming

increasingly unsettled. Accordingly, the Chairman recommended and the

Committee concurred in a strategy calling for the Manager to lower the Federal

funds rate to 6-1/8 per cent immediately, and then to reduce it further over

the following few days to 6 per cent. The Committee also agreed to reduce

the lower limit of its funds rate constraint to 5¾ per cent, in order to

provide leeway for further reserve provision in the event that signs of

continuing weakness in the monetary aggregates were confirmed by additional

data. In the statement week ending October 8, the funds rate averaged



-3-

6.06 per cent. Since then--with additional data confirming weakness in the

aggregates--the rate has averaged around 5.80 per cent. On October 15,

the Board of Governors announced a cut in reserve requirements on longer-

maturity time deposits--which had the effect of releasing about $350 million

of reserves to banks in the week beginning October 30.

(4) Short-term interest rates have declined significantly since

early October in response to the evidence of weaker growth in the monetary

aggregates, the decline in the Federal funds rate, and the cut in bank

reserve requirements. As a result, most short-term rates are now 40 to 70

basis points below the levels that prevailed at the time of the September

FOMC meeting. The 3-month Treasury bill has traded most recently at around

5.90 per cent, its lowest level since late June.

(5) Recent declines in short rates have contributed to a general

strengthening of markets for longer-term securities as well. Yield reductions

have been largest on Treasury notes and bonds--ranging to as much as 50 basis

points. In the municipal market, developments surrounding the New York

financial crisis have continued to dominate. The atmosphere has improved

somewhat in response to the general easing in market conditions. On

October 17, New York City managed to roll over its debt maturities, but

there is still no demand for such issues from the general public.

(6) Combined deposit growth at savings and loan associations

and mutual savings banks slowed to an annual rate of 11½ per cent during

September. At S&L's the slower deposit flows, taken in conjunction with

the large volume of new mortgage commitments made during August, reportedly



-4-

led to more cautious lending policies in September. This is suggested by

recent data which show no further increase in commitments for September and an

increase of 10-15 basis points in the average interest rate on conventional

mortgages over the past five weeks.

(7) The table on the following page shows (in percentage annual

rates of change) selected monetary and financial flows over various time

periods.

Prospective developments

(8) Shown below for Committee consideration are alternative

longer-run growth ranges in the monetary aggregates. The one-year

span has been moved forward one quarter to cover the period from the

third quarter of 1975 to the third quarter of 1976. The FOMC's current

longer-run growth ranges for the period between the second quarters of

1/
1975 and 1976 are also shown for comparative purposes. 1/

Alt. A Alt. B Alt. C Current

M 6-84 5-7h 4-64 5-74

M2  6-10 6-8 4t-64 8%-10k

M3  8-10 6k-84 5-7 10-12

Bank credit proxy 5-8 4-7 2t-51 64-94

(9) Of the longer-run alternatives, B encompasses the same

growth range as adopted in June for Ml. Growth rates for M2 and M3 are

lower, however, because slower growth in time and savings deposits is

now anticipated, given recent experience and the expectation that

market interest rates will again be under upward pressure late this year

and early next year.

1/ Since M 1 grew at a 6.9 per cent annual rate from the second to third
quarters of 1975, the new proposed long-run rates of growth are
calculated from a base level that incorporates a rate of expansion
slightly above the mid-point of the Committee's current longer-run
range. While achievement of a 6¼ per cent growth rate over the next
four quarters would not include any adjustment for the higher rate of
expansion in the third quarter, the problem in this instance would not
appear to be of any real quantitative significance. For example,
under alternative B the implied growth rate from QII '75 to QII '76
for M (the Committee's previous target period) would be no more than
about 6.4 per cent--well within the Committee's range.



-7-

(10) Shorter-run alternatives for monetary aggregates and the

Federal funds rate are summarized below

Alt. A Alt. B Alt. C

Ranges of tolerance
for October-November

M1  3h to 5h 3 to 5 2 to 4

M2  6 to 8 5 to 7 45 to 6

RPD 1h to 3 0 to 2 -1 to

Federal funds rate
(intermeeting range) 5 to 6 5% to 6k 5% to 63

These alternatives can be viewed as first stages that are loosely related to

attainment of the corresponding longer-run growth paths. Appendix Table IV

shows quarterly average Federal funds rates that the staff currently believes

likely to evolve over the next four quarters in attaining longer-run monetary

objectives. In general, all the alternatives involve rising Federal funds

rates as the period progresses, given the continued expansion projected for GNP.

(11) The staff still believes that growth in M 1 will soon resume.

We are now projecting growth over the latter part of October and continuing

through winter, in view of the strong further expansion in nominal GNP, and

hence in transactions needs for money, forecast by the staff. Since the early

October level of M1 is so low, however, this growth would not be reflected in

the monthly averages until November. Given current money market conditions,

as under alternative B, the staff expects M1 to expand at more than a 10 per

cent annual rate in November. But since the level of M1 is expected to decline,

-8-

on average, in October, the two month October-November growth rate would be

relatively low--in a 3-5 per cent annual rate range under alternative B.

(12) Alternative B involves a Federal funds rate range centered

around the recently prevailing 5¾ per cent rate. Yields in short- and

long-term markets (other than the mortgage market) have declined recently in

response to the easing of the money market, and little further decline is

likely in the period immediately ahead, assuming the funds rate remains around

5¾ per cent. The 3-month bill is likely to trade around 6 per cent and 3-month

commercial paper may be around 6-3/8 per cent. Bond yields could decline

somewhat further if there should be a breakthrough in resolving New York's

financing problem or if the volume of corporate bond offerings drops further.

However, the Treasury will announce its mid-November refunding on October 22.

While the refunding is a small one--involving only about $2.4 billion of

maturing publicly-held issues--the Treasury may offer mainly longer-term

issues in the financing and is expected to raise a modest amount of new cash

at the same time.

(13) Given at least maintenance of the recent lower level of market

rates, time deposit experience at banks and thrift institutions should improve

somewhat as compared with the recent past. However, over the longer-run, with

upward interest rate pressures still anticipated, the staff believes that

institutional savings flows will come under renewed pressure, and we have

assumed an increase in Regulation Q ceilings in the first quarter of next

year.



-9-

(14) A slight easing of the money market, as is contemplated by

the mid-point of the 5-6 per cent Federal funds rate range shown for

alternative A, might be accompanied by some further declines in market

interest rates. These declines probably would not be particularly large

since many market participants may still expect rates to turn around later.

Such an expectation would be reinforced to the extent that incoming business

news continues to be good. A larger decline in the funds rate to around

the 5 per cent bottom of the alternative A range would of course trigger

more substantial interest rate declines as the market's assessment of future

monetary policy and possibly also the business outlook changes.

(15) The staff expects that interest rate declines under

alternative A would facilitate attainment of higher longer-run growth rates

for the monetary aggregates--typified by M1 growth over the next year in a

6-8 per cent range. The effect on money demands of these initial declines

in interest rates are likely to be quite substantial, however, especially

when considered in conjunction with expansion over the longer-run of

transactions demands. Thus, the Federal funds rate under this alternative

probably would have to begin rising again late in the year to keep money

growth around the mid-point of the higher range.

(16) Alternative C involves a Federal funds rate range over the

next four weeks centered on 6 per cent. This would return the rate to where

it was at about the time of the previous Committee meeting. Such an immediate

rise in the funds rate appears most consistent with adoption by the Committee



-10-

of lower longer-run rates of growth in the monetary aggregates,

indexed by M1 expansion over the year ahead in a 4-6½

per cent range. Also such a rise in the funds rate would not be inconsistent

with the longer-run growth rates of alternative B. An immediate increase in

the funds rate would retard money growth over the near term, but would imply

somewhat less of a rise in the Federal funds rate over the next year than

shown for alternative B in appendix Table IV.

(17) A rebound in the funds rate to around 6 per cent would

exert significant general upward pressure on interest rates, since it would

be contrary to current market expectations. Yields on Treasury securities

would probably be particularly affected given the imminent quarterly Treasury

refunding and the continuing sizable volume of Federal deficit financing. In

these circumstances, savings inflows to depositary institutions could, of

course, be expected to deteriorate.



-11-
Proposed directive

(18) Presented below are three alternative formulations for

the operational paragraph of the directive, which are intended to corre-

spond to the similarly lettered policy alternatives discussed in the

preceding section. No reference to the forthcoming Treasury financing

is proposed because the quarterly financing to be announced on October 22

is relatively small and because Treasury financings have been and for some

time will continue to be frequent.

Alternative A

To implement this policy, while taking account of developments

in domestic and international financial markets, the Committee seeks

to achieve bank reserve and money market conditions consistent with

[DEL: moderate] SUBSTANTIAL growth in monetary aggregates over the months

ahead.

Alternative B

To implement this policy, while taking account of developments

in domestic and international financial markets, the Committee seeks

to achieve bank reserve and money market conditions consistent

with moderate growth in monetary aggregates over the months ahead.

Alternative C

To implement this policy, while taking account of developments

in domestic and international financial markets, the Committee seeks

to achieve bank reserve and money market conditions consistent

with [DEL: moderate] MODEST growth in monetary aggregates over the months

ahead.
