The attached document represents the most complete and accurate version available 
based on original copies culled from the files of the FOMC Secretariat at the Board 
of Governors of the Federal Reserve System.  This electronic document was created 
through a comprehensive digitization process which included identifying the best-
preserved paper copies, scanning those copies,1 and then making the scanned 
versions text-searchable.2   Though a stringent quality assurance process was 
employed, some imperfections may remain. 
 
Please note that some material may have been redacted from this document if that

MONETARY AGGREGATES AND
MONEY MARKET CONDITIONS

Recent developments

(1) Both M1 and M 2 appear to be growing at rates below the low

ends of the two-month ranges of tolerance adopted by the Committee at the

last meeting. M1 contracted at about a 2¾ per cent annual rate in December,

and data thus far available in early 1976 suggest that January will show

little net change. After adjustment for the preliminary new seasonal factors

presented at the time of the last meeting, M1 appears likely to expand at

less than a one per cent annual rate over the two-month period. Expansion

in time deposits other than money market CD's has, on balance, also been

somewhat slower than anticipated, and M2 is now projected to grow at about a

6 per cent annual rate during the December-January period.

recommendation to instruct the Account Manager to hold the weekly average

Federal funds rate at approximately 4¾ per cent until the next FOMC meeting.

(2) Recent growth rates for both M1 and M2 continue to be

affected by increases in business savings accounts. Although expansion

in these accounts at weekly reporting banks has slowed recently, shifts

to such accounts may have reduced the annual rate of growth in M1 over the

December-January period by about 2½ percentage points, or about 1-1½ per-

centage points more than assumed in the previous blue book. Thus part of

the shortfall in M1 reflects greater-than-anticipated shifts out of demand

deposits to savings accounts.

(3) Data received a few days after the last FOMC meeting suggested

that the monetary aggregates--particularly M1--were growing at a substantially

slower pace than anticipated at the time of the meeting. However, since data

on the aggregates are typically volatile around year-end and because the

Committee had voted to give greater emphasis than usual to money market

conditions, the Desk continued to seek reserve conditions consistent with a

Federal funds rate centering around 5¼ per cent. When subsequent data

suggested further weakening in the aggregates, the Desk adopted a more

accommodative reserve posture, and the funds rate moved down in stages to

4¾ per cent. On January 12, a majority of the Committee concurred in the

Chairman's recommendation to instruct the Account Manager to hold the weekly

average Federal funds rate at approximately this level until the January

meeting. In the statement week just ended the funds rate averaged 4¾ per

cent.

(4) Inter-meeting changes in prices and yields in securities

markets have been substantial. Interest rates on short-term market



-3-

instruments have declined 60-100 basis points, with the 3-month bill trading

most recently around 4.85 per cent. Yields on bonds declined 20-65 basis

points, while stock prices--as measured by the comprehensive New York Stock

Exchange index--have advanced 9¼ per cent. Short-term rates are currently

at their lowest levels since mid-1972, and corporate bond yields have

reached their lowest levels since the spring of 1974. The ceiling rate on

FHA/VA single-family mortgages was also cut, from 9 to 8¾ per cent, on

January 5, as yields on mortgages traded in the secondary market continued

to decline. However, rates on primary mortgages have, as usual, lagged

behind other long-term rates, dropping only about 5 basis points during the

inter-meeting period.

(5) The Board's December 24 action reducing reserve requirements

on certain time deposits, and the subsequent decline in the funds rate,

contributed importantly to the general decline of interest rates. At the

same time, year-end private economic forecasts tended to crystalize market

judgments on the longer-term economic outlook, encouraging the view that

moderate future economic growth and further progress on inflation were

likely to permit significant further reductions of the inflation premium

in long-term rates.

(6) The table on the following page shows (in percentage annual

rates of change) selected monetary and financial flows over various time

periods.

reserve requirements are changed.



Prospective developments

(7) Shown below are alternative longer-run growth ranges for

the monetary aggregates, together with the ranges adopted by the Committee

in October. In keeping with past practice, the time period for the proposed

ranges has been shifted forward by one quarter; the alternatives apply to

the period from QIV 1975 to QIV 1976, whereas the current ranges relate to

the QIII '75-QIII '76 period.1 /

Alt. A Alt. B Alt. C Current

M1  6-8½ 5-7½ 4-6½ 5-7½

M2 7½-10½ 6½-9½ 5-8 7½-10½

M3  8½-11½ 7½-10½ 6-9 9-12

Credit proxy 4-7 3½-6½ 3-6 6-9

(8) Of the three alternatives, B calls for retaining the current

range for M, but reducing somewhat the growth ranges for the broader M's.

This is because growth in time and savings deposits (other than large CD's)

in the course of 1976 is likely to remain around the more moderate pace that

developed in the second half of last year. The current longer-run ranges

for M2 and M3 assume a more rapid pace.

1/ Figures for selected subperiods of the QIV '75-QIV '76 period are shown
in the detailed tables on pages 5a and 5b . In addition, the table
includes the one-year growth rates measured from both of the quarterly
bases the Committee has employed in the past--i.e., the second and
third quarters of 1975--for each of the aggregates under each of the
alternatives.

(9) Alternative A encompasses higher growth rates for the monetary

aggregates over the next year than alternative B, while alternative C

presents lower rates. The alternative A rates may be viewed as compensating,

in an arithmetic sense, for the shortfall in M1 growth relative to expecta-

tions in the fourth quarter. That is to say, under alternative A the

level of M1 in the third quarter 1976(using mid-points of the ranges) would

be the same as that implied by a 6¼ per cent growth rate measured from the

third quarter of 1975. To reach that level, M 1 would have to expand at

almost a 7½ per cent annual rate over the first three quarters of 1976.

(10) The M1 level for QIII '76 that is implied by the Committee's

current longer-run growth range probably should be adjusted downward,

however, on economic grounds to allow for recent shifts of business funds

from demand deposits into savings accounts and for expected future growth

of such accounts at the expense of demand deposits. The regulatory change

permitting businesses to hold savings accounts up to $150,000 in size

became effective in mid-November. By early January such accounts aggregated

about $2 billion, of which the staff estimates that about $1½ billion would

otherwise have gone into demand deposits. Growth in business savings

accounts has been slowing in recent weeks, and the staff expects it to slow

further as time goes on; by the third quarter of 1976, additional growth in

such accounts substituting for demand deposits might total $1 billion. In

sum then, a $2½ billion downward adjustment in the target level of M1 for

the third quarter might be a reasonable allowance for corporate savings

accounts. This would imply M1 growth over the next three quarters at close



to a 6¼ per cent annual rate, which is approximately the growth rate for

that period under alternative B. For the one year QIII '75-QIII '76 period,

the path contained in alternative B involves M1 growth of 5.3 per cent.

(11) Shorter-run alternative operating ranges corresponding

generally to the longer-run alternatives are summarized below (with more

detail presented in the tables on pp. 5a and 5b).

RPD -2½ to -6½ -3 to -7 -3½ to -7½

Federal funds rate 3½-4½ 4¼-5¼ 5-6
(intermeeting range)

1/ The growth rates for M1 and M2 are based on the new seasonal factors
that will soon be published. These differ somewhat from the pre-
liminary revised factors employed in the previous blue book. Appendix
table V compares the new factors for M1 with the preliminary revised
and old factors. The new factors raise the Jan.-Feb. annual growth
rate for M1 by about 1¾ percentage points relative to the old factors.
Other elements of money supply revision, including benchmark and certain
other adjustments, are not yet completed. The new series is expected
to be published shortly after the Committee meeting.

(12) Alternative A involves a decline in the Federal funds rate

from the 4¾ per cent level recently prevailing to the mid-point of a 3½-4½

per cent range. Under such circumstances, M1 would be expected to expand

in a 4½-8½ per cent annual rate range in the two-month Jan.-Feb. period,

and M2 in a 7½-11½ per cent range. The pick-up in M1 growth relative to

recent behavior reflects mainly staff expectations that the projected

continuing rise in nominal GNP will be accompanied by resumed expansion

in money demand--given the unusual, and probably unsustainable, rise in the

velocity of money that has already occurred in the current cyclical expansion.



-8-

(13) We would expect a further drop in the Federal funds rate

of that magnitude to be accompanied by a decline in the 3-month Treasury

bill rate to around the 4-4¼ per cent area. Such an easing in the money

market would,of course, lead to additional downward adjustments in inter-

mediate- and longer-term interest rates. These rate declines might be

limited, however, to the extent that borrowers--particularly corporate

borrowers--took advantage of the more favorable market atmosphere to

accelerate security offerings. The Treasury will announce terms of its

mid-February refunding on January 27. It will refund $4.3 billion of

publicly-held maturing securities and will probably also raise $1-1½ billion

of new cash, with the exact amount depending in part on the market

environment.

(14) The lower funds rate assumed under alternative A would be

expected to persist until late spring or early summer. The funds rate

would then be expected to begin rising, given continued expansion in GNP.

The funds rate would be likely to be around 6 per cent by late 1976, assuming

money growth over the year is held to around 7¼ per cent under this

alternative.

(15) A Federal funds rate centered around 4¾ per cent is con-

templated under alternative B, with M1 growth in a 4-8 per cent annual

rate range in the January-February period. Given such a funds rate,

interest rates generally may show little net change over the next few

weeks. If anything, short-term interest rates could drift up a little, as

expectations by some market participants of a further decline in the funds

rate, following the discount rate action announced today, are disappointed.



-9-

Longer-term market interest rates may remain around the recent reduced

levels, given the more moderate corporate bond calendar and the availability

of sizable funds for investment in longer-term markets from insurance

companies, savings banks, and pension funds. With business loan demand

slack, banks may show increased interest in intermediate-term Treasury

offerings to increase earnings, particularly in view of the steep slope

of the yield curve. Mortgage rates can be expected to decline somewhat

further since savings inflows to thrift institutions are expected to be

well maintained and since a more favorable yield spread of primary mortgage

rates over corporate bond rates has recently developed.

(16) If the Committee seeks to attain a 6¼ per cent growth rate

from QIV '75 to QIV '76 for M1, the staff would expect interest rates to

begin rising by late winter. A more gradual rise is now anticipated than

had been predicted earlier, with the funds rate reaching a level of around

6 per cent by summer. As a result, inflows of time and savings deposits

(other than large CD's) are expected to slow as the year progresses, but

not so much as to require an upward adjustment in Regulation Q ceiling rates.

(17) Alternative C assumes that the Federal funds rate is adjusted

upward over the next few weeks to the middle of a 5-6 per cent range. This

approach is most consistent with a reduction in the longer-run growth

ranges. If the FOMC were to seek one-year growth in the aggregates as

indexed by M1 expansion of about 5¼ per cent from QIV '75 to QIV '76, the

staff believes that the funds rate would have to rise further to around 7¼

per cent by summer.



-10-

(18) Any significant near-term rise in the funds rate would

certainly be unexpected by the market. Thus, a sharp upward re-adjustment

of interest rates could be anticipated with the 3-month bill rate possibly

rising as high as 6 per cent between now and the next meeting. This would

again make thrift institutions uncertain about the strength of future

savings flows and might, therefore, bring the recent decline in mortgage

rates to a halt. In bond markets, yields would back up, and the rise

might be especially large in the Treasury market in view of the size of

dealer positions and the imminent refunding.



-11-

Proposed directive

(19) Presented below are four alternative formulations for the

operational paragraph of the directive. The first three are couched in

terms of desired growth in monetary aggregates over the months ahead and

are intended to correspond to the similarly lettered policy alternatives

discussed in the preceding section. The fourth alternative is proposed in

the event that the Committee wishes to continue to formulate its instructions

in terms of money market conditions and wishes to maintain the conditions

now prevailing. No special reference to the Treasury's quarterly financing

to be announced on January 27 is proposed because Treasury financings have

been, and for some time will continue to be, frequent.
