CLASS I FOMC - RESTRICTED CONTROLLED (FR)

MONETARY POLICY ALTERNATIVES

PREPARED FOR THE FEDERAL OPEN MARKET COMMITTEE 
BY THE STAFF OF THE BOARD OF GOVERNORS OF THE FEDERAL RESERVE SYSTEM 

DECEMBER 10, 2009 



 

 

                                           
1 The effective federal funds rate averaged 0.12 percent over the intermeeting period, and the 
intraday standard deviation averaged 3.3 basis points.  

RECENT DEVELOPMENTS 

SUMMARY 

Financial market conditions became somewhat more supportive of economic 

growth over the intermeeting period, but banks apparently continued to tighten the 

terms of credit.  The expected path of monetary policy moved lower, on net, as did 

yields on most fixed-income securities.  Broad equity indexes rose amid generally 

positive economic data, and the dollar was mixed against the major currencies.  

Consistent with a continued return toward normal functioning in funding markets, 

borrowing from Federal Reserve facilities edged down further.   

Corporate bond and equity issuance was solid in November, but the level of 

commercial bank credit continued to decline, albeit at a slower pace than in recent 

months.  Asset-backed security (ABS) issuance picked up in November, and, with the 

support of the Term Asset-Backed Securities Loan Facility (TALF), the first 

commercial mortgage-backed security (CMBS) issuance in nearly 18 months came to 

market.  Domestic nonfinancial sector debt is projected to expand in the fourth 

quarter at an annual rate of about 1½ percent, weighed down by a continued 

contraction in the debt of both households and businesses. 

MONETARY POLICY EXPECTATIONS AND TREASURY YIELDS 

Implied rates on federal funds and Eurodollar futures have moved lower since the 

November FOMC meeting.1  Although the decision to keep the target range for the 

federal funds rate unchanged at that meeting and to retain the “extended period” 

language in the accompanying statement was largely anticipated, market participants

took note of the Committee’s explicit enumeration of the factors that are expected to 

continue to warrant this policy, and Eurodollar futures rates fell a bit on the release.  

Market participants’ perception that the federal funds rate will likely remain near its 

current level for an extended period appeared to be reinforced by subsequent Federal 

Reserve communications, most notably Chairman Bernanke’s speech on November 

16.  Incoming economic data were, on balance, somewhat better than expected, but 

their net impact on interest rate expectations appeared to be small.  Consistent with a 

net reduction in realized and implied volatility in short-term rates, staff models 

suggest that a decrease in term premiums may also have contributed to the decline in 

futures rates since early November.   

Under the staff’s usual term-premium assumption of 1 basis point per month, the 

path of the federal funds rate implied by futures quotes now lifts off from the current 

target range in the third quarter of 2010 and reaches about 2 percent by the end of 

2011.  That expectation apparently prices in some low-probability scenarios that 

would entail substantial rate increases.  Quotes from the market for interest rate caps 

suggest that the most likely path of the federal funds rate—that is, the mode of the 

distribution, rather than the mean—does not move above 25 basis points until around 

the beginning of 2011 and rises by about 70 basis points over the subsequent year 

(Chart 1). 

The readings from financial-market quotes are roughly consistent with results 

from the December survey of primary dealers, according to which about two-thirds of 

respondents expect the first rate increase to occur by the end of 2010, a slightly larger 

fraction than in the October survey.  Dealers generally do not anticipate major 

changes to the FOMC statement at the upcoming meeting, although several do expect 

some revision to reflect an improvement in the economic outlook.  In a new question, 

dealers were asked how many meetings in advance of the first increase in the target

rate they expected the phrase “extended period” to be removed from the statement.  

Although responses varied considerably, most clustered around three.  

Consistent with the decline in short-term interest rates, yields on two-year 

nominal off-the-run Treasury securities fell 18 basis points over the intermeeting 

period; ten-year yields were down only slightly.  Trading volumes in nominal issues 

remained within their recent range, and measures of liquidity in the coupon market 

were roughly stable.  TIPS yields fell slightly more than their nominal counterparts, on 

net, leaving inflation compensation up a few basis points across the term structure.  

Five-year inflation compensation five years ahead remained near the upper end of its 

historical range.  Some of the decline in TIPS yields may owe to the Treasury 

Borrowing Advisory Committee’s recommendation that total TIPS issuance for 2010 

be increased to between $70 and $80 billion—a significantly smaller amount than 

traders had expected.  Survey measures of short-term inflation expectations declined a 

little, while changes in survey measures of longer-term expectations were mixed.  

The Treasury auctioned approximately $270 billion in nominal coupon debt of 

various maturities over the intermeeting period.  The auctions were generally well 

received, with bid-to-cover ratios mostly at the upper end of their recent ranges.  

Trends in indirect participation in these auctions, as well as anecdotal reports, 

continued to suggest resilient foreign demand for Treasury securities.  In its quarterly 

refunding statement on November 4, the Treasury announced the discontinuation of 

20-year TIPS and the re-introduction of 30-year TIPS, actions that were broadly in 

line with market expectations.  As of December 9, debt subject to limit was only 

about $80 billion below the statutory debt ceiling of $12.1 trillion.  Although the debt 

limit is looming and may become binding in the near term, as in the past, the Treasury 

will likely be able to employ accounting tools, if necessary, to continue to make 

payments as scheduled for some time after the turn of the year.

CAPITAL MARKETS 

Broad equity price indexes rose about 5 percent over the intermeeting period, 

partly in response to a somewhat improved economic outlook (Chart 2).  Also 

contributing to the increase were third-quarter earnings for S&P 500 firms, which 

logged another solid gain, and upward revisions to analysts’ expectations of year-

ahead earnings for S&P 500 firms.  In addition, the implied volatility of equity prices, 

as gauged by the VIX index, declined.  Meanwhile, the equity premium—as measured 

by the staff’s estimate of the expected real return on equity over the next ten years 

relative to the real 10-year yield on Treasury securities—remained about unchanged at 

a relatively high level. 

 Financial-sector shares, on the whole, underperformed the broader market 

since the November FOMC meeting as investors continued to express concerns 

about the future profitability of the banking industry.  Indeed, third-quarter Call 

Reports show continued broad deterioration in measures of loan quality at 

commercial banks, suggesting that loss provisioning will remain a drag on earnings for 

some time.  Nonetheless, equity prices of both large and smaller banks moved higher 

over the period, and spreads on credit default swaps (CDS) for large bank holding 

companies fell a bit.  Although U.S. bank stock prices retreated somewhat on the 

news of the standstill on Dubai World debt, these moves were partially reversed as it 

became clear that domestic banks’ direct exposures were low. 

In the corporate bond market, yields on investment-grade and speculative-grade 

issues fell a little more than those on nominal Treasuries, leaving their spreads a touch 

narrower.  In the secondary market for leveraged loans, bid prices changed little after 

a run-up over the previous several months.  On balance, the credit quality of 

nonfinancial firms appears to have remained steady over the period.  Based on data 

through November, the pace of nonfinancial corporate ratings downgrades by

2 On December 10, CIT confirmed that it had emerged from bankruptcy, having satisfied 
the conditions of its prepackaged reorganization plan.  The distribution of CIT’s new debt 
and equity took place in accordance with the plan, and the new common stock commenced 
trading on the New York Stock Exchange. 

Moody’s is estimated to have been moderate in the fourth quarter.  The pace of 

upgrades picked up notably in November, although bonds of a single domestic 

automaker accounted for most of this change.  The year-ahead expected default 

frequency for nonfinancial firms from Moody’s KMV was little changed in 

November; this measure of default risk has declined sharply from the peak reached 

early this year but is still elevated by historical standards.   

Gross issuance of investment-grade bonds by nonfinancial corporations 

rebounded in November following a lull in October, and speculative-grade bond 

issuance maintained its solid third-quarter pace (Chart 3).  In the primary market for 

syndicated leveraged loans, signs of a recovery emerged, with issuers trickling back to 

the market and in some cases completing successful syndications.  By contrast, both 

commercial paper outstanding and commercial and industrial (C&I) loans on banks’ 

books contracted again in November.  Gross public equity issuance by nonfinancial 

firms remained solid in November, supported by the continued strength of initial 

offerings.  The recent weakness in announcements of new share repurchase programs 

persisted, while announcements of mergers and acquisitions continued to rebound.  

For financial firms, gross bond issuance slowed somewhat further following the 

October 31 expiration of the FDIC’s Temporary Liquidity Guarantee Program.  

Financial firms’ equity issuance was again sluggish in November, but Bank of America 

issued nearly $20 billion of common-equivalent shares in early December in 

conjunction with its repayment of $45 billion in funds received through the Troubled 

Asset Relief Program.2

3 Market participants have reportedly also expressed considerable concern about a provision 
in the regulatory reform bill as recently reported out of the House Financial Services 
Committee that would allow the FDIC to impose haircuts of 20 percent on the assets of 
secured creditors, including parties in repurchase agreements, during the resolution of 
systemically important non-bank financial institutions.  Amendments have been proposed 
that would limit this provision.  It is unclear at this time how this issue will ultimately be 
resolved by the House of Representatives. 

Municipal bond issuance remained robust in November, and the ratio of yields on 

such instruments to comparable-maturity Treasury securities was about unchanged.  

Newly acquired ratings data from Moody’s show that credit quality in the municipal 

sector deteriorated over the first three quarters of 2009, a trend that, until recently, 

had been obscured in the ratings data from Standard and Poor’s as a result of a 

gradual shift in its rating methodology for this sector.  

The average interest rate on 30-year conforming fixed-rate mortgages fell to 4¾ 

percent over the intermeeting period, and the spread between the mortgage rate and 

the 10-year Treasury yield narrowed.  Yields on agency mortgage-backed securities 

(MBS) decreased, on balance, and net issuance of MBS by Fannie Mae and Freddie 

Mac remained sluggish in October amid relatively strong demand for FHA loans.  Led 

by auto-loan securitizations, consumer ABS issuance increased in November.  While 

credit card ABS issuance was very low in October and November, it is set to pick up 

substantially in December as a result of interim FDIC guidance that clarifies how the 

FDIC would handle these securitizations for a bank in receivership.3  (See box entitled 

“Effect of FAS 166 and FAS 197 on Commercial Banks.”) 

The announcement in the FOMC statement that the Federal Reserve would 

purchase only about $175 billion of agency debt securities had not been generally 

anticipated, and spreads on those securities widened a few basis points following the 

release.  Market participants noted further tapering of the MBS purchase program and 

the apparent onset of tapering in the agency debt purchase program.  Investors have

The Effects of FAS 166 and FAS 167 on Commercial Banks 

Last June, the Financial Accounting Standards Board published two new 
accounting standards—commonly referred to as FAS 166 and FAS 167—that will 
change the basis for determining whether firms are required to consolidate 
securitized assets (as well as the associated liabilities and equity) onto their balance 
sheets.1  The new standards focus on the degree of control that the firm exercises 
over the assets, whereas the previous standards were more focused on the firm’s 
credit exposure to the assets.    

Board staff believes that most credit card securitizations and asset-backed 
commercial paper conduits will need to be consolidated, as will the portion of 
private label mortgage-backed securitizations and other term securitizations for 
which the originator retains both servicing rights and an economic interest in the 
securitization.2  Most banks will apply the new standards as of the March 31, 2010 
Call Report.  Industry analysts estimate that the amount of assets that will be 
brought onto banks’ balance sheets at that time is likely to exceed $1 trillion, with 
the amount highly concentrated at a handful of large banking institutions.   

The consolidation of these assets is likely to significantly reduce the regulatory 
capital ratios of several large banks that are heavily involved in securitization, 
particularly monoline credit card banks.3  Rating agencies reportedly have already 
been evaluating capital adequacy on the basis of the firms’ combined on- and off-
balance sheet assets, so the accounting change is not expected to have adverse 
implications for banking institutions’ credit ratings.  Moreover, the Supervisory 
Capital Assessment Program incorporated estimates of the effect of the 
consolidation for most securitizations, and staff estimate that the regulatory capital 
ratios of each highly affected bank will remain above key regulatory thresholds even 
after implementing FAS 166 and 167.  Even so, it is possible that some banks may 
respond to the decline in their reported capital ratios by restricting lending in order 
to offset at least some of the effect of the consolidation.  Partly in response to 

                                                            
1 Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 166 (FAS 166), Accounting for Transfers of Financial Assets (an 
amendment to FASB Statement No. 140); and FAS 167, Amendments to FIN 46R, Consolidation of Variable Interest 
Entities.  FAS 166 and 167 must be implemented with firms’ first financial reporting period that begins after 
November 15, 2009.   
2 A small fraction of ABCP conduits failed to meet the requirements for off-balance-sheet treatment under 
the old accounting rules.  In those situations, the banking agencies’ regulations allowed the sponsoring firm 
not to consolidate the conduits for the calculation of risk-based capital ratios.  The agencies are in the process 
of eliminating this exemption.  
3 Some banks’ leverage ratios will be affected more than their risk-based capital ratios because they provided 
support to their credit card securitization structures over the past year and thus were required to report higher 
risk-weighted assets in their 2009 regulatory filings.   

December 10, 2009 Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) 10 of 72



these concerns, the Division of Banking Supervision and Regulation is working 
with the other bank regulatory agencies on a final rule that would phase in the 
effect of the accounting changes on risk-based capital ratios over as much as one 
year.4   

The changes in accounting treatment have also led the FDIC to reconsider its 
handling of securitized assets in receiverships; the specific details of the new rules 
the FDIC is developing in this area could have significant consequences for the 
recovery of securitization markets.  Prior to the accounting changes, the FDIC 
granted securitized assets that qualified for off-balance-sheet treatment a safe 
harbor under which the assets would not be subject to stays or seizure in 
receivership, thereby providing investors with assurance of timely payment of 
principal and interest on the debt.  The FDIC recently announced that 
securitizations completed before March 31, 2010 that comply with the old 
accounting rules for off-balance-sheet treatment will continue to be granted this 
safe harbor treatment.   FDIC staff is consulting with staff members at the Board 
and the other supervisory agencies in their effort to develop new safe harbor 
provisions for securitizations completed after March 2010. 

  

                                                            
4 The regulatory leverage ratio is designed to be a GAAP-based assessment of the balance sheet as a 
supplement to the risk-based capital rules.  Because the affected banks’ leverage ratios are expected to remain 
above regulatory minimums, the agencies decided to retain the strict GAAP focus and require banks to 
recognize the effect of the consolidations on the leverage ratio immediately.

reportedly continued to express some uncertainty about several matters related to the 

GSEs over the coming weeks, including the expiration of the Treasury’s GSE liquidity 

facility at year-end, the extent of the Treasury’s authority to provide additional capital 

going forward, the termination of the Federal Reserve’s and Treasury’s large-scale 

asset purchase programs, and the portfolio reductions required of the agencies under 

the terms of their conservatorship.  To date, these concerns do not appear to have put 

substantial pressure on agency debt or MBS prices.   

MARKET FUNCTIONING AND FEDERAL RESERVE PROGRAMS 

Conditions in short-term funding markets were little changed over the 

intermeeting period.  One- and three-month Libor-OIS spreads were flat, while six-

month spreads edged down somewhat further.  Spreads on A2/P2-rated commercial 

paper and AA-rated ABCP were little changed, remaining at the low end of their 

ranges over the past two years.  There were few signs of significant year-end pressures 

in the commercial paper market or in bank funding markets.  In the Treasury bill 

market, however, year-end pressures were more evident, with high demand for bills 

maturing just past December 31 pushing yields on several such bills to zero.  The 

relative scarcity of Treasury bills has been exacerbated by the recent reduction in 

supplementary financing bills.  The combination of scarce collateral and abundant 

liquidity is also reportedly putting downward pressure on term general collateral repo 

rates.  Separately, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York announced that it would 

conduct a series of small-scale triparty repurchase agreements to ensure the 

operational readiness of this tool, and it carried out four such operations in early 

December.  Neither the announcements nor the operations themselves elicited 

material price action. 

Indicators of how well other markets are functioning also showed no recent 

deterioration.  Bid-asked spreads on corporate bonds, Treasury securities, and

leveraged loans moved sideways, and the average range of CDS dealer quotes was 

about unchanged.  In Treasury coupon markets, on-the-run premiums and yield-curve 

fitting errors stayed within their recent ranges. 

Supported by the TALF, ABS issuance picked up in November and $400 million 

of CMBS came to market—the first CMBS issuance since June 2008.  (See box 

entitled “Balance Sheet Developments.”)  Two other single-borrower CMBS deals 

came to market without TALF support, reflecting improved investor appetite for the 

asset class.   

FOREIGN MARKET DEVELOPMENTS 

On net, the dollar depreciated about ½ percent on a trade-weighted basis 

against both the major currencies and the currencies of our other important trading 

partners over the intermeeting period (Chart 4).  The dollar declined early in the 

period, apparently due in part to a continued normalization of risk attitudes.  

Additionally, the dollar fell broadly after the meeting of the G-20 ministers over the 

weekend of November 7-8, with market participants noting that the meeting’s 

communiqué failed to mention concern over the dollar’s recent depreciation.  Late in 

the period, however, the dollar reversed course and appreciated sharply following the 

release of the stronger-than-expected November employment report.  The U.S. dollar 

depreciated another 3 percent against the yen over the intermeeting period, and 

Japanese officials have voiced unease over the yen’s strength.  Several emerging 

economies, including Brazil and Korea, intervened to stem the appreciation of their 

currencies, while others are reportedly contemplating tightening capital controls.  

Foreign stock markets generally rose on net, with notable gains in Brazil and Mexico, 

amid increasing commodity prices and a better-than-expected Mexican GDP report.  

China’s stock market climbed 4 percent, in part due to strong trade data, while 

European equity indexes rose by 2 percent.  Japanese equities were unchanged on

Balance Sheet Developments during the Intermeeting Period 

Since the November FOMC meeting, the Federal Reserve’s total assets have 
edged up to about $2.2 trillion.1  As a result of ongoing asset purchases, securities 
held outright increased by $89 billion, which more than offset a $71 billion decline 
in lending through liquidity and credit facilities. 

The Open Market Desk purchased $9 billion in agency debt securities and $80 
billion in agency mortgage-backed securities (MBS) during the intermeeting period.2  
In contrast, most of the System’s liquidity and credit programs contracted further, 
consistent with continued improvements in global bank funding markets.  Term 
auction credit declined $53 billion, foreign central bank liquidity swaps declined $15 
billion, and primary credit declined $3 billion.3  Net portfolio holdings of 
Commercial Paper Funding Facility LLC (CPFF) declined slightly to $14 billion.  
Lending under the Primary Dealer Credit Facility (PDCF), loans extended under 
the Asset-Backed Commercial Paper Money Market Mutual Fund Liquidity Facility 
(AMLF), and securities lent through the Term Securities Lending Facility (TSLF) all 
remained at zero.4 

The Term Asset-Backed Securities Loan Facility (TALF) expanded slightly in 
size to $44 billion.  Three subscriptions were conducted during the intermeeting 
period, two of which have settled.  The first loan subscription, totaling $1.1 billion, 
financed the issuance of asset-backed securities (ABS) collateralized by credit card, 
equipment, floorplan, small business, and student loans.  The second subscription 
included $1.4 billion in loan requests to finance purchases of legacy commercial 
mortgage-backed securities (CMBS) and $72 million in loan requests to finance 
purchases of the first newly issued CMBS since June 2008.  About three-fourths of 
the newly issued TALF-eligible CMBS were purchased by non-TALF investors.  
The third subscription, which settles December 10, garnered loan requests totaling 
$3.1 billion and will finance the issuance of ABS collateralized by credit card, 
equipment, floorplan, servicing advances, small business, and student loans.5  More 

                                                            
1 These data are through December 9, 2009. 
2 The figures for securities holdings reflect only trades that have settled.  Over the intermeeting period, the 
Open Market Desk committed to purchase, but has not yet settled, an additional $113 billion of MBS, on net. 
3 On November 17, 2009 the Federal Reserve Board announced a reduction in the maximum maturity of 
primary credit loans at the discount window to 28 days, effective January 14, 2010.  There was no market 
reaction to the announcement. 
4 Securities lent through the TSLF do not affect the level of Federal Reserve assets because the Federal 
Reserve retains ownership of the securities lent. 
5 On November 19, 2009, the assets and liabilities of TALF LLC were consolidated with the assets and 
liabilities of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, consistent with generally accepted accounting principles.  

December 10, 2009 Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) 14 of 72



than half of the ABS brought to market with this subscription were financed 
through TALF, a substantial pickup from recent months.  The subscription 
included student loan and credit card ABS, which tend to be more heavily financed 
through TALF.  Approximately $1 billion of TALF loans were prepaid over the 
intermeeting period. 

In conjunction with the restructuring of the government’s support for 
American International Group (AIG) announced on March 2, 2009, the Federal 
Reserve Bank of New York received $25 billion of preferred interests in two special 
purpose vehicles, AIA Aurora LLC and ALICO Holdings LLC on December 1 and 
reduced the balance and amount available of revolving credit provided to AIG by a 
commensurate amount.  These two limited liability companies were created to hold 
all of the outstanding common stock of American International Assurance 
Company (AIA) and American Life Insurance Company (ALICO), two life 
insurance subsidiaries of AIG. 

On the liability side of the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet, the U.S. Treasury’s 
general account decreased $25 billion, and the Treasury’s supplementary financing 
account remained unchanged at $15 billion.  Reserve balances of depository 
institutions increased $41 billion over the intermeeting period.  

                                                                                                                                                                                                

Currently, the LLC has only about $270 million in assets, funded by a commitment fee paid by the Federal 
Reserve Bank of New York and initial funding from the TARP.

balance.  Foreign sovereign yields generally declined since the November FOMC 

meeting. 

Although the central banks of the major foreign industrial economies kept policy 

rates on hold, there were some noteworthy changes to other policy measures.  The 

Bank of England increased its Asset Purchase Facility by a somewhat smaller-than-

expected £25 billion to £200 billion.  The European Central Bank took some initial 

steps toward scaling back emergency lending by announcing that the upcoming one-

year refinancing operation on December 16 will be its last of that tenor and that funds 

will be offered at a rate equal to the average of the benchmark rates set in the weekly 

main refinancing operations over the life of the operation.  Amid concerns about 

deflation and the strength of the yen, the Bank of Japan announced an additional ¥10 

trillion three-month secured lending facility at an unscheduled meeting on December 

1, but this move is not expected to have substantial effects.   

News that the Dubai government had requested a standstill on debts owed by 

Dubai World, a government-owned corporation, temporarily roiled financial markets.  

Global equity markets and sovereign bond yields fell immediately following the 

announcement, while the dollar rose roughly 1 percent, as investors pulled back from 

riskier investments on concerns that problems in Dubai could have knock-on effects 

elsewhere.  However, these movements subsequently eased somewhat as investors 

concluded that Dubai World’s difficulties were likely to be isolated and not spill over 

to other markets.  Concerns about the potential for default by some sovereign nations 

also rose over the period, most notably for Greece, whose sovereign debt rating was 

lowered because of long-standing concerns over its public finances.

DEBT, BANK CREDIT, AND MONEY 

The level of private-sector debt is projected to have fallen slightly in the fourth 

quarter on a further decline in household debt and a tick down in nonfinancial 

business debt (Chart 5).  The growth of federal government debt slowed somewhat 

from its recent rapid pace, while state and local government debt continued to expand 

at a moderate rate.  All told, the growth rate of domestic nonfinancial-sector debt is 

projected to have declined from an annual rate of 2½ percent in the third quarter to 

about 1½ percent in the fourth quarter. 

Commercial bank credit is estimated to have decreased further in November, 

although the pace of decline slowed relative to October.  Total loans contracted in 

November at an annual rate of about 4 percent while securities decreased at a pace of 

about 2½ percent.  (See box entitled “Commercial Bank Loan Growth and Bank 

Health.”)  C&I loans fell at a 16 percent rate, likely reflecting weak demand and a 

continued tightening of terms.  The Survey of Terms of Business Lending (STBL) 

conducted in November indicated that the average C&I loan rate spread over 

comparable-maturity market instruments rose for the fifth consecutive survey; the 

increase was broadly apparent across most loan categories.4  The decline in 

commercial real estate loans continued, consistent with the further weakening of 

fundamentals in that sector.  On the household side, a slowdown in loan sales to the 

GSEs resulted in a 5½ percent increase in on-balance-sheet holdings of closed-end 

residential mortgages in November.  However, home equity loans fell again.  

Consumer loans originated by banks also declined sharply as credit card loan 

originations dropped.

Commercial Bank Loan Growth and Bank Health 

Decomposing the change in total loans and leases on the books of domestic 
banks into two components – the change at “strong” banks and the change at “weak” 
banks – reveals that in 2009, unlike in 1990-1993, loan portfolios have contracted at 
strong as well as weak banks.   

Strong banks are defined here as banks 
with CAMELS ratings of 1 or 2 and weak 
banks as those with ratings of 3, 4, or 5.1  
Over the past two years, CAMELS 
downgrades have been widespread, and as 
the top figure shows, at the beginning of the 
third quarter, weak banks held more than 40 
percent of all loans outstanding, nearly as 
large a share as in the early 1990s.2 

As shown in the second panel, the 
growth rates of loans at strong and weak 
banks generally move in parallel, with the 
growth rate at weak banks consistently 
running well below that at strong banks.  
This difference presumably is a result of 
greater concerns about asset quality and the 
high cost of funding at weak banks, which 
may cause such banks to constrain lending.  
It may also reflect the relatively poor 
condition of the customers of weak banks, 
and their resulting lower demand for loans. 

The panel at the top of the next page puts these pieces together, showing the 
four-quarter percent change in total loans held by all domestic banks (the black line) 
as well as colored vertical bars representing the contributions to the aggregate growth 
rate from strong (blue) and weak (red) banks (that is, the percent change of loans at 
banks in each category multiplied by the share of loans held by banks in that 
category).  As can be seen, during the early 1990s, the sharp contraction in loans at 
weak banks accounted for the bulk of the runoff in aggregate loans, while lending at 
strong banks contracted only slightly. 

                                                            
1 This classification of weak banks may differ from other classifications, including the FDIC’s “problem bank” 
classification, which includes banks with ratings of 4 or 5. 
2 However, in the recent period a number of strong banks received government assistance, such as TARP funds, 
which likely contributed to regulators’ favorable assessment of their health. 

December 10, 2009 Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) 21 of 72



Similarly, in the current period, the significant increase in the fraction of industry 
loans held by weak banks and the substantial contraction in loans held at those banks 
have accounted for much of the decline in U.S. bank loans.  In addition, in the current 
period strong banks have contributed importantly to this contraction.  The declines at 
both strong and weak banks in the current episode suggest that a confluence of 
factors is affecting lending across the industry.  These factors include widespread 
weakness in loan demand from creditworthy borrowers as a result of the sharp 
economic slowdown, and reduced loan supply, perhaps reflecting concerns about the 
economic outlook and balance sheet constraints. 

The significance of supply factors is evident in recent Senior Loan Officer 
Opinion Surveys.  Similar fractions of strong and weak banks tightened lending 
standards during the first three quarters of 2009.3  This was also the case during the 
early 1990s.4  This similarity across weak and strong banks indicates that deterioration 
in the condition of banks is only one factor inducing banks to tighten their lending 
standards.  In contrast, demand reportedly fell more at weak banks in the first quarter 
of 2009, which may explain part of the larger decline in loans observed at those 
institutions. 

 

 

                                                            
3 We average responses to questions on lending standards for different loan categories at the bank level, and then 
across strong and weak banks. 
4 The SLOOS panel contained 6 or fewer weak banks between 1993Q4 and 2008Q4, making it difficult to make 
comparisons during that period. 

December 10, 2009 Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) 22 of 72



 

 

  

According to Call Report data, the aggregate profitability of the banking sector 

edged into positive territory in the third quarter, but most of the increase was due to a 

few large institutions that reported significant decreases in loan-loss provisioning, 

even as industry-wide measures of credit quality appeared to worsen.  Regulatory 

capital ratios increased further in the third quarter as banks received equity infusions 

from their parent holding companies and shrank their balance sheets.  Unused loan 

commitments contracted for the seventh consecutive quarter, though the rate of 

decline slowed, especially for commitments to lend to businesses.   

 M2 expanded at a 4½ percent annual rate in November, in line with its modest 

growth in September and October.  As has been the case in recent months, liquid 

deposits grew rapidly, while small time deposits and retail money market mutual funds 

continued to contract, albeit at slightly slower paces.  Currency ran off at a 5 percent 

annual rate in November, likely reflecting weak demand for U.S. banknotes from 

abroad, consistent with the continued stabilization in most global financial markets.  

The monetary base expanded at an annualized pace of about 50 percent last month, 

reflecting the continued strong growth in reserve balances due to ongoing large-scale 

asset purchases, which more than offset the decreased usage of liquidity and credit 

facilities.

5 Purchases of $300 billion in Treasury securities were completed at the end of October.  
Purchases of $1.25 trillion in agency MBS and $175 billion in agency debt are projected to 
be finished by the end of the first quarter of 2010. 

ECONOMIC OUTLOOK 

Information received over the intermeeting period has been largely consistent 

with the staff projection provided in the October Greenbook.  As a result, the staff 

has made only modest changes to its forecast, with the trajectories for output and 

inflation revised up a bit.  The staff continues to expect that the expansion of real 

GDP will outpace the rise in potential output, causing the output gap to narrow over 

the next couple of years.  As was the case in the last forecast, the expected level of the 

unemployment rate declines over time as the output gap narrows, but it ends the 

projection period slightly higher than in the previous projection because the staff has 

raised its estimates of the boost to labor force participation from extended and 

emergency unemployment benefits.  The rates of core and total PCE inflation are 

expected to slow appreciably further over the next two years, with both running a 

little above 1 percent in 2011.   

The staff assumes that the federal funds rate will remain in its current range for 

the next seven quarters and then begin to rise in the last quarter of 2011, a slightly 

earlier start to policy tightening than in the October forecast.  No significant changes 

have been made to the assumptions regarding the sizes or timing of the Federal 

Reserve’s LSAP programs.5  Fiscal policy is expected to add about 1 percentage point 

to real GDP growth in 2010, the same as in the current year, but to impose a slight 

drag on growth in 2011.  House prices are projected to decline over the next year as 

foreclosure activity continues, but then to rise a bit in 2011.   

December 10, 2009 Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) 24 of 72



 

 

The rates on 30-year fixed-rate mortgages and longer-term Treasuries are 

projected to rise through 2011, with the spread between them widening a bit as the 

Federal Reserve completes its purchases of agency MBS.  By contrast, yields on 

investment-grade corporate bonds are expected to edge down as risk spreads narrow 

considerably further against a backdrop of continued improvements in financial 

markets and the economic outlook.  With the equity risk premium also expected to 

narrow, stock prices are projected to rise briskly at an annual rate of around 15 

percent over the next two years.  Bank lending conditions for firms and households 

are anticipated to ease over time but to remain tight by historical standards.  The real 

foreign exchange value of the dollar is assumed to fall at about a 2¼ percent pace, on 

average, over 2010 and 2011.  Based on readings from futures markets, the staff 

expects oil prices to rise over the forecast period to about $86 a barrel at the end of 

2011, little changed from the October Greenbook. 

Against this backdrop, the staff expects real GDP to grow at an annual rate of just 

over 3 percent in the second half of 2009, about 3½ percent in 2010, and about 4½ 

percent in 2011, very close to the October projection.  The unemployment rate is 

projected to be at its peak of around 10 percent this quarter and early next year before 

declining slowly to about 9½ percent at the end of 2010 and 8¼ percent at the end of 

2011, similar to the trajectory in the last Greenbook, and well above the staff’s 5¼ 

percent estimate of the NAIRU.  In light of the current and prospective level of 

economic slack, the staff projects core PCE inflation to slow to around 1½ percent in 

the fourth quarter of this year and to just over 1 percent in 2010 and 2011.  Total 

PCE inflation remains slightly higher than core inflation. 

Looking further ahead, the staff assumes that the federal funds rate will rise 

steadily starting in the fourth quarter of 2011, climbing to about 3¾ percent in late 

2014.  The staff forecasts that real GDP will expand at nearly a 4¾ percent pace in 

December 10, 2009 Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) 25 of 72



 

 

  

2012 and 2013 before decelerating in 2014.  Potential output is forecast to rise at an 

average pace of almost 3 percent per year from 2012 through 2014, and so with real 

GDP growth outstripping that of potential, the unemployment rate falls rapidly for a 

time, but then levels out in 2014 at just under 4¾ percent, a bit below the staff’s 

estimate of the NAIRU in that year.  Longer-term inflation expectations remain 

stable, and, as the output gap nearly closes, total PCE inflation slowly rises to just

6 Conditioning the four model-based estimates on information through the fourth quarter by 
starting the simulations in 2010Q1 would have the additional effect of moving the twelve-
quarter window further into the economic recovery, thereby boosting measured short-run 

MONETARY POLICY STRATEGIES 

Chart 6 shows various estimates of short-run r*, defined as the real federal funds 

rate that, if maintained over time, would bring output to its potential level at a horizon 

of twelve quarters.  Greenbook-consistent short-run r*, estimated using the FRB/US 

model, edged up 10 basis points from its October Bluebook value.  The estimate is 

now -1.9 percent, about 50 basis points below the actual real federal funds rate.  The 

Greenbook-consistent measure from the EDO model rose about 40 basis points, but 

at -3.3 percent remains well below the actual funds rate.  The increases in these 

measures largely reflect the modest upward revisions that the staff has made to its 

projection for GDP over the next two years.  

The other four measures of r* shown in the chart are based on models that 

condition on information only through last quarter.  Primarily as a result of the nearly 

1 percentage point downward revision to third-quarter real GDP growth since the 

October Bluebook, these models now generally indicate somewhat lower short-run 

values for r*.  In particular, the estimates of r* from the single-equation model and the 

small structural model are about 20 basis points lower than in October, and the 

FRB/US model-based measure is 10 basis points lower.  All three of these estimates 

are at or below the actual current level of the real rate of -1.4 percent.  In contrast, the 

EDO model-based estimate of r* edged up since the last Bluebook because this 

model’s estimate of slack narrowed a touch in response to the incoming data.  At ½ 

percent, the EDO estimate of r* is well above the actual real rate, reflecting the 

model’s projection of a robust recovery in real activity.6

7  Even though the policy path is unconstrained in 2010Q1, it is conditioned on a federal 
funds rate in 2009Q4 that is at the effective lower bound rather than the lower value that 
was prescribed by the policy path in the October Bluebook.  With the interest rate 
smoothing embedded in the objective function, this initial condition influences the 
unconstrained optimal policy path for a time, leading to a somewhat higher level of the 
optimal funds rate through the middle of 2011 relative to the October path. 

Chart 7 shows the results of optimal control simulations of the FRB/US model.  

These simulations use the extended staff baseline projection—embodying liquidity 

and credit actions by the Federal Reserve—as a starting point.  Policymakers are 

assumed to place equal weight on keeping core PCE inflation close to a 2 percent 

inflation goal, on keeping unemployment close to the NAIRU, and on minimizing 

changes in the federal funds rate.  As in recent Bluebooks, optimal monetary policy 

under these simulations is constrained by the effective lower bound, and the nominal 

funds rate does not depart from this bound until the second half of 2012 (black solid 

lines).  Under this policy, the unemployment rate would be projected to remain well 

above the NAIRU, and core PCE inflation to stay appreciably below the 2 percent 

goal, until 2013.  

 Chart 7 also displays the optimal control results that are obtained if we assume 

that the nominal funds rate is not constrained by the effective lower bound (blue 

dashed lines).  With the resulting more-accommodative stance of monetary policy, real 

activity exhibits a faster recovery, while the trajectory for inflation is markedly closer 

to the assumed goal of 2 percent.  The unconstrained policy path has shifted up 

significantly since October.  This shift partly reflects the staff’s assessment that the 

outlook for real activity has improved modestly in recent weeks —an improvement 

mirrored in the upward revision to the Greenbook-consistent estimates of r*— as 

well as the earlier jumping-off point for adjusting the federal funds rate.7

8 While the staff projection roughly corresponds to the mode of the distribution, the 
financial-market forecast is probably closer to a mean.  Stochastic simulations of the 
FRB/US model suggest that the mean of the distribution of the staff’s federal funds rate 
projection first rises above ¼ percent in the second half of 2010, in contrast to late 2011 in 
the staff’s modal baseline projection. 

As depicted in Chart 8, the outcome-based estimated policy rule prescribes a 

trajectory for the federal funds rate (upper-left panel) similar to the one in the 

previous Bluebook.  The funds rate starts rising above the effective lower bound in 

2011Q4, slightly earlier than in October.  According to stochastic simulations of the 

FRB/US model, the 90 percent confidence band for the funds rate in 2011Q4 spans 

an interval from the effective lower bound to about 2½ percent.8  Market participants’ 

expectations regarding the path of the funds rate have shifted noticeably lower over 

the intermeeting period (upper-right panel).  Staff models indicate, however, that term 

premiums may also have declined over the period, suggesting that the drop in the 

expected trajectory of the federal funds rate could be smaller than that shown here.  

Financial market quotes imply that the 90 percent confidence interval for the federal 

funds rate in 2011Q4 spans a range from about ½ percent to about 4½ percent; the 

width of this interval is slightly smaller than in the previous Bluebook. 

The lower panel of Chart 8 provides near-term prescriptions from simple policy 

rules.  The two variants of the Taylor rule, as well as the two estimated policy rules, 

leave the federal funds rate at its effective lower bound over the next two quarters.  

When this bound is not imposed, all rules prescribe funds rates that are higher (less 

negative) than in the previous Bluebook, reflecting the upward revision to the staff’s 

projection of the output gap.  The first-difference rule—because it responds to 

economic growth rather than to the estimated level of resource utilization—prescribes 

a slight upward trajectory for the policy rate, with the funds rate increasing to about 

65 basis points in 2010Q2.

POLICY ALTERNATIVES 

This Bluebook presents three policy alternatives—labeled A, B, and C—for the 

Committee’s consideration.  Table 1 provides an overview of the key elements of 

these alternatives.  Draft statements are provided in subsequent pages, followed by 

summaries of the cases for each alternative. 

The characterization of the economic outlook differs somewhat across the three 

alternatives.  Alternatives A and B note that economic activity has continued to pick 

up, while Alternative C states that a recovery is under way.  All three acknowledge that 

the deterioration in labor markets is abating and that activity in the housing sector has 

increased.  Alternatives A and B, however, note that household spending continues to 

be constrained by a variety of factors.  Alternatives B and C point to financial market 

conditions that have become more supportive of economic growth.  In contrast, 

Alternative A indicates that the recovery will be sluggish and slack in resource 

utilization will decline quite slowly absent further policy action.  As in the November 

statement, Alternatives A and B note that the Committee expects that inflation will 

remain subdued for some time because resource slack is likely to dampen cost 

pressures and because longer-term inflation expectations remain stable.  Alternative A 

mentions that inflation has fallen considerably over the past year.  Alternative C 

indicates that the Committee expects inflation to remain stable, but in response to 

appropriate monetary policy adjustments rather than because of resource slack. 

Each of the three alternatives maintains the target range for the federal funds rate 

at 0 to ¼ percent, but the alternatives differ in the specification of the size and 

completion dates of the Federal Reserve’s purchase programs for agency MBS and 

agency debt, and also in their forward guidance regarding the path of the target federal

funds rate.  Under Alternative A, the Committee would increase its purchases of 

agency MBS to a total of $1.5 trillion (from the currently planned amount of $1.25 

trillion) and extend the timeframe for these purchases to the end of the second 

quarter of 2010.  The Committee also would complete its purchases of about $175 

billion of agency debt by the end of the first quarter of 2010.  The increase in 

purchases of MBS would provide additional macroeconomic stimulus, while the 

extension would permit the pace of transactions to be tapered to promote a smooth 

transition in markets as the purchases come to an end.  Under Alternative B, the 

statement would be very similar to that for the November meeting.  The Committee 

would reiterate its intention to purchase $1.25 trillion of agency MBS and about $175 

billion of agency debt and the plan to complete these purchases by the end of the first 

quarter of 2010.  Alternatives A and B maintain the forward guidance from 

November that the Committee anticipates maintaining exceptionally low levels of the 

federal funds rate for an extended period, with this expectation explicitly conditioned 

on low rates of resource utilization, subdued inflation trends, and stable inflation 

expectations.  Alternative A specifies that the exceptionally low level of the federal 

funds rate anticipated is the current 0 to ¼ percent target range. 

Under Alternative C, the amount of agency MBS purchases would be reduced to 

$1.1 trillion while agency debt purchases would be reduced to $160 billion.  The 

statement would also indicate that the Committee anticipates that these purchases 

would be completed by the end of January 2010.  Alternative C changes the forward 

guidance by indicating that the Committee anticipates “low” levels of the federal 

funds rate “for some time.” 

The alternatives also differ in their treatment of the discussion of policy tools.  

Alternative A indicates that the Committee will continue to employ a wide range of 

policy tools to promote economic recovery and price stability.  Alternatives B and C

remove the reference to the use of a wide range of policy tools and note that the 

Committee and the Board of Governors anticipate that a number of liquidity 

programs will expire on February 1 and that amounts auctioned through the Term 

Auction Facility will be scaled back further over the first quarter of 2010.

November FOMC Statement 

Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in September suggests 
that economic activity has continued to pick up.  Conditions in financial markets were 
roughly unchanged, on balance, over the intermeeting period.  Activity in the housing sector 
has increased over recent months.  Household spending appears to be expanding but 
remains constrained by ongoing job losses, sluggish income growth, lower housing wealth, 
and tight credit.  Businesses are still cutting back on fixed investment and staffing, though at 
a slower pace; they continue to make progress in bringing inventory stocks into better 
alignment with sales.  Although economic activity is likely to remain weak for a time, the 
Committee anticipates that policy actions to stabilize financial markets and institutions, fiscal 
and monetary stimulus, and market forces will support a strengthening of economic growth 
and a gradual return to higher levels of resource utilization in a context of price stability.  

With substantial resource slack likely to continue to dampen cost pressures and with longer-
term inflation expectations stable, the Committee expects that inflation will remain subdued 
for some time. 

In these circumstances, the Federal Reserve will continue to employ a wide range of tools to 
promote economic recovery and to preserve price stability.  The Committee will maintain 
the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to ¼ percent and continues to anticipate that 
economic conditions, including low rates of resource utilization, subdued inflation trends, 
and stable inflation expectations, are likely to warrant exceptionally low levels of the federal 
funds rate for an extended period.  To provide support to mortgage lending and housing 
markets and to improve overall conditions in private credit markets, the Federal Reserve will 
purchase a total of $1.25 trillion of agency mortgage-backed securities and about $175 billion 
of agency debt.  The amount of agency debt purchases, while somewhat less than the 
previously announced maximum of $200 billion, is consistent with the recent path of 
purchases and reflects the limited availability of agency debt.  In order to promote a smooth 
transition in markets, the Committee will gradually slow the pace of its purchases of both 
agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities and anticipates that these transactions 
will be executed by the end of the first quarter of 2010.  The Committee will continue to 
evaluate the timing and overall amounts of its purchases of securities in light of the evolving 
economic outlook and conditions in financial markets.  The Federal Reserve is monitoring 
the size and composition of its balance sheet and will make adjustments to its credit and 
liquidity programs as warranted.

December FOMC Statement—Alternative A 

1. Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in November suggests 
that economic activity has continued to pick up and that the deterioration in the labor 
market is abating.  The housing sector has shown some signs of improvement over 
recent months, boosted in part by government incentives for first-time homebuyers.  
Household spending appears to be expanding but remains constrained by the weak labor 
market, modest income growth, lower housing wealth, and tight credit.  Business 
spending is being dampened by firms’ efforts to reduce inventories to bring them 
into better alignment with sales and by cutbacks in fixed investment.  Partly reflecting 
these factors, the Committee anticipates that the economic recovery will be sluggish 
and that slack in resource utilization will diminish quite slowly absent further policy 
action. 

2.  Inflation has fallen considerably over the past year.  With substantial resource slack 
likely to continue to dampen cost pressures and with longer-term inflation expectations 
stable, the Committee expects that inflation will remain subdued for some time. 

3.  To promote a stronger economic recovery and higher resource utilization, the 
Committee will provide additional monetary stimulus by increasing its purchases of 
agency mortgage-backed securities to a total of $1.5 trillion, up from the previously 
announced amount of $1.25 trillion; the Committee anticipates that these purchases 
will be executed by the end of the second quarter of 2010.  The Committee is also in 
the process of purchasing $175 billion of agency debt; it anticipates that these purchases 
will be completed by the end of the first quarter of 2010.  The Committee will continue to 
evaluate the timing and overall amounts of its purchases of securities in light of the evolving 
economic outlook and conditions in financial markets.  The Committee will maintain the 
target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to ¼ percent and continues to anticipate that low 
rates of resource utilization, subdued inflation trends, and stable inflation expectations are 
likely to warrant this exceptionally low range for the federal funds rate for an extended 
period.  The Federal Reserve will continue to employ a wide range of tools to promote 
economic recovery and to preserve price stability.  The Federal Reserve is monitoring the 
size and composition of its balance sheet and will make adjustments to its credit and liquidity 
programs as warranted.

4. In light of ongoing improvements in the functioning of financial markets, the 
Committee and the Board of Governors anticipate that most of the Federal Reserve’s 
special liquidity facilities will expire on February 1, 2010, consistent with the Federal 
Reserve’s announcement of June 25, 2009.  These facilities include the Asset-Backed 
Commercial Paper Money Market Mutual Fund Liquidity Facility, the Commercial 
Paper Funding Facility, the Primary Dealer Credit Facility, and the Term Securities 
Lending Facility.  The Federal Reserve will also be working with its central bank 
counterparties to close its temporary liquidity swap arrangements by February 1.  
The Federal Reserve expects that amounts provided under the Term Auction Facility 
will continue to be scaled back in early 2010.   The anticipated expiration dates for 
the Term Asset-Backed Securities Loan Facility remain set at June 30, 2010, for loans 
backed by new-issue commercial mortgage-backed securities and March 31, 2010, for 
loans backed by all other types of collateral.  The Federal Reserve is prepared to 
modify these plans if necessary to support financial stability and economic growth.

that policy actions to stabilize financial markets and institutions, fiscal and monetary 
stimulus, and market forces will contribute to a strengthening of economic growth and a 
gradual return to higher levels of resource utilization in a context of price stability. 

2. Longer term inflation expectations have been stable, and the Committee expects that, with 
appropriate monetary policy adjustments, inflation will remain at levels consistent with 
price stability. 

3. At this meeting, the Committee maintained the target range for the federal funds rate at 
its exceptionally low level of 0 to ¼ percent, and it anticipates that economic conditions, 
including low rates of resource utilization, subdued inflation trends, and stable inflation 
expectations, are likely to warrant low levels of the federal funds rate for some time.  In 
view of continued improvements in financial market conditions and the economic 
outlook, the Committee decided to cap its purchases of agency mortgage-backed 
securities at $1.1 trillion and its purchases of agency debt at $160 billion, and it 
anticipates that these transactions will be executed by the end of January 2010.  The 
Committee will continue to evaluate the timing and overall amounts of its purchases of 
securities in light of the evolving economic outlook and conditions in financial markets. 

4. In light of ongoing improvements in the functioning of financial markets, the 
Committee and the Board of Governors anticipate that most of the Federal Reserve’s 
special liquidity facilities will expire on February 1, 2010, consistent with the Federal 
Reserve’s announcement of June 25, 2009.  These facilities include the Asset-Backed 
Commercial Paper Money Market Mutual Fund Liquidity Facility, the Commercial 
Paper Funding Facility, the Primary Dealer Credit Facility, and the Term Securities 
Lending Facility.  The Federal Reserve will also be working with its central bank 
counterparties to close its temporary liquidity swap arrangements by February 1.  
The Federal Reserve expects that amounts provided under the Term Auction Facility 
will continue to be scaled back in early 2010.   The anticipated expiration dates for 
the Term Asset-Backed Securities Loan Facility remain set at June 30, 2010, for loans 
backed by new-issue commercial mortgage-backed securities and March 31, 2010, for 
loans backed by all other types of collateral.  The Federal Reserve is prepared to 
modify these plans if necessary to support financial stability and economic growth.

THE CASE FOR ALTERNATIVE B 

If policymakers believe that completion of the Committee’s large-scale asset 

purchase programs as previously announced as well as the maintenance of 

exceptionally low levels of the funds rate for an extended period is a reasonable 

course of action given current economic circumstances, the Committee might adopt 

the policy actions and language of Alternative B.  Such a choice might be appealing if 

the Committee shares the staff’s assessment that incoming economic data and recent 

financial market developments are consistent with sustained but moderate growth in 

output and subdued inflation over coming quarters.  In the staff forecast, output 

expands at a pace above trend over the forecast period, and the unemployment rate 

gradually declines.  Nevertheless, even by the end of 2011, the unemployment rate 

remains above 8 percent, significantly higher than the staff’s estimate of the NAIRU, 

suggesting that a very accommodative stance of policy will remain appropriate for a 

considerable amount of time.  While the Greenbook-consistent measures of short-run 

r* have been revised up a bit since the November meeting, these measures are still 

negative and below the actual level of the real federal funds rate.  Moreover, the funds 

rate path implied by the estimated outcome-based rule (Chart 8) seems consistent 

with the statement that economic conditions are likely to warrant exceptionally low 

levels of the funds rate for an extended period. 

Even if participants believed that the economy might recover more quickly than 

in the staff forecast, they may nevertheless believe that they have considerable time 

before policy firming becomes appropriate.  For example, in the “Stronger Recovery” 

scenario in the Greenbook, inflation still remains low over the forecast period even 

though policy firming does not commence until the end of 2010.  Accordingly, 

policymakers may prefer to accumulate more conclusive evidence that the economic 

recovery is firmly established before tightening policy.  This preference may be 

December 10, 2009 Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) 41 of 72



 

 

reinforced by a view that some of the observed pickup in aggregate spending may 

reflect government policy actions whose influence is expected to wane in 2011.  More 

generally, participants may simply view the strength and sustainability of the recovery 

as still highly uncertain.   

While policymakers may view the current and projected slack in resource 

utilization, particularly the persistently high unemployment rate, as unsatisfactory, an 

expansion of the LSAPs or other policy actions to provide more stimulus might be 

judged as likely to be relatively ineffective and as entailing significant potential costs.  

Additional actions to stimulate the economy could boost inflation expectations, which 

may call for a reversal in the stance of policy before the recovery is sufficiently well 

established.  Moreover, a larger Federal Reserve balance sheet could also present 

challenges for the Committee’s exit strategy, either because the greater size could 

result in larger unrealized mark-to-market losses on the portfolio in the event of an 

abrupt upward movement in interest rates or because of the potentially greater 

difficulty in controlling short-term interest rates that could result from even higher 

reserve balances. 

The Federal Reserve announced in June that many of the liquidity facilities that 

have been supporting financial markets would be extended until February 1, 2010.  

Because that date is approaching and financial market functioning has improved to a 

great extent, policymakers may wish to confirm expectations that those liquidity 

facilities will in fact be wound down early next year and that the Federal Reserve is in 

the process of normalizing its support for markets.  The proposed statement in 

Alternative B provides language to describe that development. 

Market participants generally appear to expect a statement along the lines of 

Alternative B, so the announcement of this action would likely elicit only modest 

December 10, 2009 Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) 42 of 72



 

 

reaction in financial markets.  To the extent that some market participants may place 

some odds on a further extension of liquidity programs, the confirmation that these 

programs will likely be discontinued early in the new year could result in some 

pressures in money markets.  Moreover, the announcement could be seen as another 

milestone in the normalization of monetary policy implementation and—even with 

the language to the contrary in the statement—may be viewed as suggesting that the 

date at which policy firming would commence was drawing near.  On the other hand, 

market participants might view the statement as reassuring because it would reiterate 

the Committee’s and the Board’s assessment that financial conditions have improved 

enough to allow the withdrawal of Federal Reserve support.   

THE CASE FOR ALTERNATIVE C 

If policymakers viewed the incoming data as indicating that the recovery is gaining 

strength and that inflation pressures could begin to mount before long, they might 

wish to trim the size of the LSAPs and suggest in the policy statement that the 

Committee may need to raise the federal funds rate target in the not-too-distant 

future, as in Alternative C.  Under this alternative, the Committee would reduce its 

total purchases of agency MBS and agency debt compared with the previously 

announced amounts and bring the LSAPs to a more rapid close.  The statement 

would also suggest a somewhat earlier start to policy firming by stating that the federal 

funds rate would remain at “low levels” for “some time” as opposed to the current 

characterization of “exceptionally low levels” for “an extended period.”  The 

statement for Alternative C would use the same language as proposed for Alternative 

B regarding the likely expiration of most of the liquidity facilities. 

Participants might be particularly attracted to Alternative C if they saw greater 

upside risks to inflation and inflation expectations than does the staff.  With a 

somewhat brighter labor market outlook, a falling foreign exchange value of the 

December 10, 2009 Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) 43 of 72



 

 

dollar, and readings on some measures of longer-term inflation expectations that are 

at the high end of their ranges over recent years, a significant further expansion of the 

Federal Reserve’s balance sheet could be seen as risking a significant increase in 

inflation expectations that might prove costly to reverse later.  The “Higher Inflation 

Expectations” scenario in the Greenbook presents such an outcome.  A change in the 

stance of monetary policy at this point in time could be viewed as appropriate in order 

to keep inflation expectations stable. 

Members’ inflation concerns could be amplified if the recent spending, 

production, and labor market indicators were seen as suggesting that aggregate 

demand going forward could be stronger than had been expected and that the 

softness in labor costs that had prevailed might be coming to an end, along the lines 

of the “Stronger Recovery” scenario presented in the Greenbook.  Although bank 

lending continues to contract, large firms have ready access to capital markets, and 

broader financial market conditions became more supportive of growth, on balance, 

over the intermeeting period, with a lower foreign exchange value of the dollar, lower 

interest rates, and rising equity prices.  While business executives no doubt remain 

quite cautious, recent data on employment may indicate that firms will become willing 

to hire and expand production sooner than anecdotal information might suggest, 

pointing to a more rapid rise in employment and investment than in the staff forecast.   

Members may also believe that measures of resource slack are subject to 

considerable error and, as a result, are not reliable guides for the conduct of monetary 

policy.  Consequently, they may put less weight on the estimated level of output and 

unemployment gaps in forecasting inflation trends and more weight on inflation 

expectations and the change in output than does the staff.  Misinterpreting the 

readings from the output gap could lead to undesirable outcomes for inflation.  For 

this reason, participants may wish to signal that they are prepared to raise the federal 

December 10, 2009 Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) 44 of 72



 

 

funds rate sooner than had been anticipated, in addition to reducing the size of 

LSAPs. 

Finally, the Committee may be concerned that even the present size of the Federal 

Reserve’s balance sheet could pose challenges when it comes time to begin removing 

policy accommodation.  Some participants may believe that the current extremely 

high level of reserves could give significant impetus to bank lending as banks become 

more confident about the outlook and their own capital positions.  A very sharp 

pickup in lending could be unwelcome if it comes at a time when the Committee 

wishes to remove policy accommodation.  The level of reserves might also be of 

concern if participants are not confident that the tools at the Committee’s disposal 

will prove sufficient to allow it to raise short-term rates when doing so becomes 

appropriate.  In either case, the Committee might choose to cap its purchases in order 

to limit the resulting risks.  As in Alternative B, the Committee may also view it as 

appropriate to affirm that the various liquidity facilities will be winding down.  

The adoption of Alternative C would greatly surprise market participants and lead 

them to reevaluate, perhaps significantly, their beliefs regarding the Committee’s 

intentions.  The expected near-term path of the federal funds rate could rise notably 

as investors inferred that a tightening in policy might be drawing near.  Longer-term 

rates presumably would also rise as the path for policy was shifted up, and equity 

prices might fall.  Importantly, MBS and primary mortgage rates could well move 

sharply higher; Federal Reserve MBS purchases currently exceed the pace of new 

issues significantly, and the adoption of Alternative C would imply a dramatic scaling 

back of those purchases.  As a result, functioning in the MBS market might become 

impaired for a time.  Forward measures of inflation compensation would probably 

decline if the Committee’s decision led investors to mark down their longer-term 

inflation expectations, and the exchange value of the dollar would likely rise. 

December 10, 2009 Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) 45 of 72



 

 

Given the strong reaction that curtailing the purchases of securities might 

provoke, the Committee might prefer to consider combining the forward guidance on 

the federal funds rate path in Alternative C with the LSAP purchases proposed in 

Alternative B.  By indicating that the Committee anticipated low interest rates for 

some time (instead of an extended period), such a combination would be less likely to 

generate disruptions in the functioning of MBS and mortgage markets.  Nevertheless, 

the change in the forward guidance about the path of the federal funds rate would still 

prompt a strong revision to investors’ expectations, pushing up interest rates and 

likely causing equity prices to fall somewhat.  Another possible combination is to 

reduce the LSAPs as in Alternative C and maintain the forward guidance language 

from Alternative B.  Such a combination would have the possible advantage of exiting 

from unconventional policy earlier.  However, this combination would also come as a 

considerable surprise to market participants and could well also disrupt MBS and 

mortgage markets to some degree and push up longer-term interest rates, although 

the rise in longer-term rates might be attenuated by the Committee’s continued 

expectation that economic conditions would warrant maintaining an exceptionally low 

rate for the federal funds rate for an extended period. 

THE CASE FOR ALTERNATIVE A 

If the members’ views of the economic outlook were similar to the staff forecast, 

with the unemployment rate remaining at very high levels for many quarters to come 

and inflation expected to fall further below a range consistent with price stability, then 

they might be inclined to put in place additional policy stimulus.  To do so, the 

Committee could increase the quantity of agency MBS purchases and extend the 

timeframe for those purchases while continuing to signal that the federal funds rate 

will remain at the effective zero lower bound for an extended period, as in Alternative 

A.  Even if they anticipate an outcome similar to the staff forecast as most likely, 

December 10, 2009 Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) 46 of 72



 

 

participants may see a significant risk that the economy could fall back into recession 

next year, perhaps after some of the support from government policies and liquidity 

facilities is removed.  Also, even without a relapse in the real economy, additional 

policy accommodation may be seen as appropriate in view of the staff’s projection 

that, for many years, unemployment will remain very high and inflation below the 

majority of Committee participants’ long-run projections.   

The Committee may view some of the recent stronger readings on economic 

activity as reflecting temporary forces, such as fiscal policy, that may be overstating 

the underlying momentum of the economy.  Moreover, the staff may be 

underestimating the restraint that weakness in the balance sheets of households and 

some firms will put on the expansion.  Indeed, the continued sharp contraction in 

bank credit and the sluggishness in M2 growth may point to slower economic 

expansion than is captured by the staff’s forecast.  The “Weaker Aggregate Demand” 

scenario provided in the Greenbook illustrates these downside risks to the economy. 

The Committee’s previous decisions to maintain the size of LSAPs, rather than 

increase them, may have been based partly on concerns about potential complications 

associated with the exit strategy.  Staff work on the various tools to drain reserves may 

have provided greater confidence to policymakers that additional purchases of 

securities can be undertaken without significantly complicating the exit strategy.  In 

order to promote a smooth transition in financial markets, given the greater quantity 

of purchases, the Committee may view it as desirable to extend the time period over 

which the purchases are to be completed to the end of the second quarter. 

An announcement such as that in Alternative A would come as a surprise to 

market participants.  Most likely, short-term interest rates would fall as investors 

priced in a later liftoff of the federal funds rate, and the resulting decline in mortgage 

December 10, 2009 Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) 47 of 72



 

 

 

  

and other longer-term rates would most likely be amplified by the increase in MBS 

purchases.  Equity prices might rise, while the foreign exchange value of the dollar 

would likely decline.  Inflation compensation could increase to some degree if 

investors revised up their inflation expectations based on a larger size of the Federal 

Reserve’s balance sheet and greater policy accommodation.  Alternative A does not 

explicitly mention the expiration of the various liquidity facilities as do the other 

alternatives.  While this omission would in no way preclude policymakers from letting 

the facilities expire in February, participants may prefer to explicitly signal that the 

Federal Reserve’s support for financial markets is winding down by including in 

Alternative A the paragraph proposed on the facilities’ expiration proposed for 

Alternatives B and C.

9 The Greenbook projection assumes that the federal funds rate begins to rise in the fourth quarter 
of 2011.  The balance sheet projections assume that the interest rate paid on excess balances 
becomes an effective floor for the federal funds rate and that no draining of reserve balances is 
required to achieve the higher target federal funds rate. 

 

LONG‐RUN PROJECTIONS OF THE BALANCE SHEET AND MONETARY BASE 

In this section, three scenarios for the balance sheet are presented that correspond 

to the different paths for large-scale asset purchases (LSAP) of agency debt securities 

and agency MBS proposed in the three policy alternatives discussed in the “Policy 

Alternatives” section of the Bluebook.  The baseline scenario corresponds to 

Alternative B in which agency MBS purchases of $1.25 trillion and agency debt 

securities purchases of $175 billion are executed by the end of the first quarter of 

2010.  Under Alternative A, the agency MBS purchases are increased by $250 billion 

to a total $1.5 trillion and are completed by the end of the second quarter of 2010; 

purchases of agency debt securities under this alternative remain at $175 billion and 

are executed by the end of the first quarter of 2010.  Under Alternative C, the 

quantities of agency MBS purchases and agency debt purchases are reduced to $1.1 

trillion and $160 billion, respectively; all purchases under this alternative are 

completed by January 2010. 

Projections for these scenarios are developed based on assumptions about each 

component of the balance sheet.9  Details of these assumptions are contained in 

Appendix C.  Substantive revisions to these assumptions, relative to the October 

Bluebook, are outlined below.  

In all three scenarios, total assets are lower over the majority of the projection 

period than in the October Bluebook, largely due to a projected decrease in credit 

extended through the liquidity facilities that more than offsets an increase in the

10 The change in the path for prepayments largely reflects the incorporation of a more up-to-
date forecast from one of the MBS purchase program investment managers. 

11 The decrease in other deposits held at the Federal Reserve primarily reflects a decrease in 
deposits held at the Federal Reserve by Government Sponsored Enterprises (GSEs). 

forecasted level of agency MBS holdings.  The projected levels of credit extended 

through the primary credit program, Term Auction Facility (TAF), and the Term 

Asset-Backed Securities Loan Facility (TALF) were revised down in response to lower 

use of these facilities over the intermeeting period.  Projections of these and other 

Federal Reserve liquidity programs and credit facilities implicitly incorporate a 

judgment about the potential interactions between their level and the level of reserve 

balances.  The upward revision to the level of agency MBS holdings reflects a lower 

assumed pace of prepayments.10   

On the liability side of the balance sheet, the projected levels of reverse 

repurchase agreements with foreign official and international accounts and of deposits 

held at the Federal Reserve other than by depository institutions or the U.S. Treasury 

were revised down reflecting decreases over the intermeeting period.11  On net, the 

revisions in the asset and liability components of the balance sheet imply an upward 

revision in the level of reserve balances over the projection period.

12 The composition of Federal Reserve assets in all three of these projections differs notably 
from historical patterns.  Prior to August 2007, U.S. Treasury securities were about 90 
percent of assets and the Federal Reserve did not hold any agency mortgage-backed 
securities.  By contrast, under the baseline scenario, Treasury securities are projected to 
account for only around 34 percent of total assets at the end of 2009 and rise to just 46 
percent of total assets at the end of the projection period.  

The size and timing of the peak level of the balance sheet varies in each scenario, 

primarily because of the different paths for the LSAPs.  For the baseline and 

Alternative A scenarios, the balance sheet reaches a peak of $2.4 trillion and $2.5 

trillion, respectively, with the peak occurring a quarter after the agency MBS LSAPs 

are assumed to be completed.  In Alternative C, the size of the balance sheet peaks at 

$2.2 trillion in December 2009.  By the end of 2016, the size of the balance sheet 

under each scenario declines to roughly $1.5 trillion.12 

December 10, 2009 Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) 51 of 72



 

 

 
 
 

  

With respect to the level of reserve balances, the peak occurs at the end of 2009 

under the baseline and Alternative C scenarios at $1.2 trillion and $1.1 trillion, 

respectively.  Although LSAPs continue into 2010 in each of these scenarios, reserve 

balances begin to decline at the beginning of the year because of the decline in lending 

through liquidity and credit facilities and a return of the U.S. Treasury’s 

supplementary financing account to $200 billion following an assumed increase in the 

debt ceiling.  In contrast, under Alternative A, reserve balances do not peak until the 

third quarter of 2010 at $1.3 trillion, reflecting the extension of asset purchases 

through the middle of next year.  Since the monetary base is derived from the balance 

sheet projections of Federal Reserve notes in circulation and reserve balances, the 

path of the monetary base in each scenario largely mirrors the path of reserve 

balances.  Specifically, in each scenario, the monetary base peaks at essentially the 

same time as reserve balances, and as reserve balances decline, the monetary base 

contracts.  Towards the end of the projection period, when reserve balances are 

assumed to stabilize at $25 billion, the growth rate of the monetary base roughly 

matches the growth rate of Federal Reserve notes in circulation.

rate of about 1¾ percent in the fourth quarter of 2009 and then at about a 5½ 

percent pace, on average, over 2010 and 2011.  The forecast reflects rapid growth in 

federal government debt and a moderate increase in state and local government debt.  

By contrast, increases in household and nonfinancial business debt are projected to be 

sluggish.  Staff anticipates that household debt will not begin to expand noticeably 

until the second half of next year, and the pace of borrowing is expected to be 

subdued through 2011 because of roughly flat home prices, a higher household saving 

rate, relatively tight lending standards, and loan charge-offs that remain elevated for 

some time.  The growth of nonfinancial business debt is anticipated to be modest, as 

demand for external funds remains soft, banks’ terms and standards for business 

loans ease only gradually, and the commercial real estate market remains very weak. 

Commercial bank credit is expected to contract at an annual rate of 8½ percent in 

the fourth quarter, reflecting continued steep drops in loans—especially to 

businesses—and only a small increase in banks’ holdings of securities.  Bank credit is 

expected to increase about 1½ percent in 2010 as moderate growth in securities 

offsets a further decline in loans for much of the year.  Loan growth resumes late in 

2010 as the economic recovery gains steam and leads to a pickup in loan demand and 

a gradual easing of standards and terms, and in 2011 bank credit growth accelerates to 

about 5 percent.  C&I loans are projected to continue to contract until late in 2010 

and to expand only sluggishly in 2011.  Weak fundamentals for commercial real estate 

and soft home prices hold down real estate loans through most of 2010, and that loan 

component is expected to expand only modestly in 2011.  Consumer loans on banks’ 

books are expected to be about flat in 2010 before rising at a moderate rate in 2011.

M2 is projected to expand at an annual rate of only 2½ percent in the fourth 

quarter, as a reallocation of household wealth toward higher-yielding assets continues 

to weigh on money demand to some degree.  Over the next two years, outflows from 

money market mutual funds and small time deposits are expected to diminish, while 

growth in liquid deposits is expected to remain strong.  As a result, the staff 

anticipates that M2 will accelerate gradually over 2010 and will expand at a pace closer 

to that of nominal GDP by 2011.

DIRECTIVE   

 The November directive and draft language for the December directive are 

provided below. 

NOVEMBER FOMC MEETING 

The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and financial conditions 

that will foster price stability and promote sustainable growth in output. To further its 

long-run objectives, the Committee seeks conditions in reserve markets consistent 

with federal funds trading in a range from 0 to 1/4 percent. The Committee directs 

the Desk to purchase agency debt and agency MBS during the intermeeting period 

with the aim of providing support to private credit markets and economic activity. 

The timing and pace of these purchases should depend on conditions in the markets 

for such securities and on a broader assessment of private credit market conditions. 

The Desk is expected to execute purchases of about $175 billion in housing-related 

agency debt and about $1.25 trillion of agency MBS by the end of the first quarter of 

2010. The Desk is expected to gradually slow the pace of these purchases as they near 

completion. The Committee anticipates that outright purchases of securities will cause 

the size of the Federal Reserve's balance sheet to expand significantly in coming 

months. The System Open Market Account Manager and the Secretary will keep the 

Committee informed of ongoing developments regarding the System's balance sheet 

that could affect the attainment over time of the Committee's objectives of maximum 

employment and price stability.

DECEMBER FOMC MEETING — ALTERNATIVE A 

The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and financial conditions 

that will foster price stability and promote sustainable growth in output.  To further 

its long-run objectives, the Committee seeks conditions in reserve markets consistent 

with federal funds trading in a range from 0 to ¼ percent.  The Committee directs the 

Desk to purchase agency debt and agency MBS during the intermeeting period with 

the aim of providing support to private credit markets and economic activity.  The 

timing and pace of these purchases should depend on conditions in the markets for 

such securities and on a broader assessment of private credit market conditions.  The 

Desk is expected to execute purchases of about $175 billion in housing-related agency 

debt by the end of the first quarter of 2010 and about $1.5 trillion of agency MBS by 

the end of the second quarter of 2010.  The Desk is expected to gradually slow the 

pace of these purchases as they near completion.  The Committee anticipates that 

outright purchases of securities will cause the size of the Federal Reserve’s balance 

sheet to expand significantly in coming months.  The System Open Market Account 

Manager and the Secretary will keep the Committee informed of ongoing

Measure  Description 

Single-
equation 

Model 

The measure of the equilibrium real rate in the single-equation model is based on an 
estimated aggregate-demand relationship between the current value of the output gap and its 
lagged values as well as the lagged values of the real federal funds rate. 

Small 
Structural 

Model 

The small-scale model of the economy consists of equations for six variables: the output 
gap, the equity premium, the federal budget surplus, the trend growth rate of output, the real 
bond yield, and the real federal funds rate. 

EDO 
Model 

Estimates of the equilibrium real rate using EDO—an estimated dynamic-stochastic-
general-equilibrium (DSGE) model of the U.S. economy—depend on data for major 
spending categories, price and wages, and the federal funds rate as well as the model’s 
structure and estimate of the output gap. 

FRB/US 
Model 

Estimates of the equilibrium real rate using FRB/US—the staff’s large-scale econometric 
model of the U.S. economy—depend on a very broad array of economic factors, some of 
which take the form of projected values of the model’s exogenous variables. 

Greenbook-
consistent 

Two measures are presented—based on the FRB/US and the EDO models.  Both models 
are matched to the extended Greenbook forecast.  Model simulations determine the value of 
the real federal funds rate that closes the output gap conditional on the extended baseline. 

TIPS-based 
Factor 
Model 

Yields on TIPS (Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities) reflect investors’ expectations of 
the future path of real interest rates.  The TIPS-based measure of the equilibrium real rate is 
constructed using the seven-year-ahead instantaneous real forward rate derived from TIPS 
yields as of the Bluebook publication date.  This forward rate is adjusted to remove 
estimates of the term and liquidity premiums based on a three-factor arbitrage-free term-
structure model applied to TIPS yields, nominal yields, and inflation. 

APPENDIX A:  MEASURES OF THE EQUILIBRIUM REAL RATE 

The equilibrium real rate is the real federal funds rate that, if maintained, would be projected to 
return output to its potential level over time.  The short-run equilibrium rate is defined as the rate 
that would close the output gap in twelve quarters given the corresponding model’s projection of 
the economy.  The medium-run concept is the value of the real federal funds rate projected to keep 
output at potential in seven years, under the assumption that monetary policy acts to bring actual 
and potential output into line in the short run and then keeps them equal thereafter.  The TIPS-
based factor model measure provides an estimate of market expectations for the real federal funds 
rate seven years ahead.  

The actual real federal funds rate is constructed as the difference between the nominal rate and 
realized inflation, where the nominal rate is measured as the quarterly average of the observed 
federal funds rate, and realized inflation is given by the log difference between the core PCE price 
index and its lagged value four quarters earlier.  If the upcoming FOMC meeting falls early in the 
quarter, the lagged inflation measure ends in the last quarter.  For the current quarter, the nominal 
rate is specified as the target federal funds rate on the Bluebook publication date.   

December 10, 2009 Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) 63 of 72



 

 

Estimates of the real federal funds rate depend on the proxies for expected inflation used.  The table 
below shows estimated real federal funds rates based on lagged core PCE inflation, the definition 
used in the Equilibrium Real Federal Funds Rate chart; lagged four-quarter headline PCE inflation; 
and projected four-quarter headline PCE inflation beginning with the next quarter.  For each 
estimate of the real rate, the table also provides the Greenbook-consistent measure of the short-run 
equilibrium real rate and the average actual real federal funds rate over the next twelve quarters.

APPENDIX B:  ANALYSIS OF POLICY PATHS AND CONFIDENCE INTERVALS 

RULE SPECIFICATIONS   
For the following rules, it denotes the federal funds rate for quarter t, while the explanatory variables 
include the staff’s projection of trailing four-quarter core PCE inflation (πt), inflation two and three 
quarters ahead (πt+2|t and πt+3|t), the output gap in the current period and one quarter ahead ( *t ty y  
and *1| 1|t t t ty y  ), and the three-quarter-ahead forecast of annual average GDP growth relative to 
potential ( 4 4 *3| 3|t t t ty y    ), and *  denotes an assumed value of policymakers’ long-run inflation 
objective.  The outcome-based and forecast-based rules were estimated using real-time data over the 
sample 1988:1-2006:4; each specification was chosen using the Bayesian information criterion. Each 
rule incorporates a 75 basis point shift in the intercept, specified as a sequence of 25 basis point 
increments during the first three quarters of 1998.  The first two simple rules were proposed by 
Taylor (1993, 1999).  The prescriptions of the first-difference rule do not depend on assumptions 
regarding r* or the level of the output gap; see Orphanides (2003). 

Outcome-based rule it =  1.20it-1–0.39it-2+0.19[1.17  + 1.73 πt  + 3.66( *t ty y )  – 2.72( *1 1t ty y  )] 

Forecast-based rule it =  1.18it-1–0.38it-2+0.20[0.98 +1.72 πt+2|t+2.29( *1| 1|t t t ty y  )–1.37( *1 1t ty y  )] 

Taylor (1993) rule it = 2 + πt + 0.5(πt – * ) + 0.5( *t ty y ) 

Taylor (1999) rule it = 2 + πt + 0.5(πt – * ) + ( *t ty y ) 

First-difference rule it = it-1 + 0.5(πt+3|t – * ) + 0.5( 4 4 *3| 3|t t t ty y    ) 

FRB/US MODEL SIMULATIONS   
Prescriptions from the two empirical rules are computed using dynamic simulations of the FRB/US 
model, implemented as though the rule were followed starting at this FOMC meeting.  The dotted 
line labeled “Previous Bluebook” is based on the current specification of the policy rule, applied to 
the previous Greenbook projection.  Confidence intervals are based on stochastic simulations of the 
FRB/US model with shocks drawn from the estimated residuals over 1969-2008.  

INFORMATION FROM FINANCIAL MARKETS   
The expected funds rate path is based on Eurodollar quotes and implied three-month forward rates 
from swaps, and the confidence intervals for this path are constructed using prices of interest rate 
caps.  

NEAR‐TERM PRESCRIPTIONS OF SIMPLE POLICY RULES   
These prescriptions are calculated using Greenbook projections for inflation and the output gap. 
Because the first-difference rule involves the lagged funds rate, the value labeled “Previous 
Bluebook” for the current quarter is computed using the actual value of the lagged funds rate, and 
the one-quarter-ahead prescriptions are based on this rule’s prescription for the current quarter.

APPENDIX C:  LONG‐RUN PROJECTIONS OF THE  
BALANCE SHEET AND MONETARY BASE  

This appendix presents the assumptions underlying the projections provided in the section entitled 
“Long-Run Projections of the Balance Sheet and Monetary Base.” 

GENERAL ASSUMPTIONS 
The balance sheet projections are constructed on a monthly frequency from December 2009 to 
December 2016.  The few balance sheet items that are not discussed below are assumed to be 
constant over the projection period at the level observed on November 30, 2009.  The projections 
for all major asset and liability categories are summarized in the charts and table that follow the 
bullet points.   

The Greenbook projection assumes that the federal funds rate begins to rise in the fourth quarter of 
2011.  The balance sheet projections assume that the interest rate paid on excess balances becomes 
an effective floor for the federal funds rate and that no draining of reserve balances is required to 
achieve the higher target federal funds rate. 

ASSETS 

Asset Purchases 
 The baseline scenario incorporates large-scale asset purchases (LSAP) roughly in line with 

those that have been announced. 
o The Committee purchases $175 billion in agency debt securities and $1.25 trillion in 

agency MBS; both types of purchases are to be executed by the end of the first 
quarter of 2010. 
 Agency debt securities and agency MBS are held to maturity and are not 

replaced.  Prepayments of MBS are not reinvested. 
 Holdings of agency debt securities peak at $172 billion in March 2010, and 

decline slowly over the remainder of the forecast horizon as they mature.  
The peak is slightly below the announced purchase amount, reflecting the 
maturity of agency debt securities already in the SOMA portfolio.    

 Due to expected settlement lags and prepayments, agency MBS holdings 
peak at $1.1 trillion in June 2010, a somewhat lower level than the amount 
purchased.13  For agency MBS, the rate of prepayment is based on estimates 
from one of the program’s investment managers.  The historically low 
coupon on these securities implies a relatively slow prepayment rate.  As a 
result, at the end of 2016, $657 billion of the $1.25 trillion of MBS purchased 
remain on the balance sheet. 

December 10, 2009 Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) 67 of 72



 

 

o The Committee’s purchases of $300 billion in U.S. Treasury securities related to the 
LSAP program were completed by the end of October 2009. 
 The maturity distribution of the Treasury securities purchased as a part of the 

LSAP program is based on data from the Federal Reserve Bank of New 
York’s Markets Group.  The maturities of most purchases are between two 
and ten years, with the weighted average maturity being a little over six years. 

 There are no sales of Treasury securities purchased as a part of the LSAP 
program, and maturing securities are not rolled over.  As a result, total 
holdings of Treasury securities decline as issues mature.  Treasury securities 
held in the SOMA portfolio prior to the initiation of the LSAP program are 
assumed to be reinvested as they mature.   

 In the scenario corresponding to Alternative A, the Committee increases its purchases of 
agency MBS by $250 billion to a total of $1.5 trillion and extends the timeframe for these 
purchases to the end of the second quarter of 2010.  The Committee completes its purchase 
of $175 billion in agency debt securities by the end of the first quarter of 2010. 

 In the scenario corresponding to Alternative C, the Committee decreases its purchases of 
agency MBS by $150 billion to a total of $1.1 trillion and reduces its purchases of agency 
debt securities by $15 billion to a total of $160 billion.  The Committee completes these 
purchases by the end of January 2010. 

 A minimum level of $25 billion is set for reserve balances.  By the end of the projection 
period in the baseline and Alternative C scenarios, the expansion of Federal Reserve notes in 
circulation and capital, combined with a runoff of assets, necessitates not only the reduction 
of the U.S. Treasury’s supplementary financing account to zero, but also the resumption of 
Treasury securities purchases to maintain reserve balances at a level of $25 billion.   

Liquidity Programs and Credit Facilities 
 Projections of the liquidity programs and credit facilities implicitly incorporate a judgment 

about the potential interactions between their level and the level of reserve balances. 
 Primary credit declines gradually from its current level to $1 billion by the end of 2011 and 

remains at that level thereafter.  Secondary credit is assumed to be zero over the forecast 
period. 

 The Term Auction Facility (TAF) falls to zero by July 2010 and remains at zero thereafter.   
 The Term Asset-Backed Securities Loan Facility (TALF) peaks at $62 billion in March 2010.  

As these loans mature or are prepaid, credit extended through this facility reaches zero by 
the second quarter of 2015. 

o TALF loans are extended with either a three-year or a five-year term. 
 Until loans with a three-year term begin to mature in 2012, the decline in 

TALF is attributable to prepayments.   
 In 2012, TALF loans begin to decline more rapidly, reflecting the maturity of 

three-year loans.   
 After all three-year loans have matured in 2013, TALF declines at a less rapid 

pace as five-year loans mature, because the dollar amount of five-year loans is 
smaller than the dollar amount of three-year loans.

14 On March 2, 2009, the Federal Reserve and Treasury jointly announced a restructuring of the government’s assistance 

to AIG.  As part of this restructuring, on December 1, 2009, the revolving credit facility was reduced in exchange for 
preferred interests in two special purpose vehicles created to hold common stock of two AIG subsidiaries.  The total 
size of the assistance to AIG is not directly affected by this restructuring.    

o TALF loans backed by asset-backed securities other than newly issued commercial 
mortgage-backed securities (CMBS) reach $50 billion by March 2010.  A portion of 
these loans are expected to prepay, and the quantity outstanding reaches zero by the 
end of the first quarter of 2015. 

o TALF loans backed by newly issued CMBS reach $12 billion by March 2010.  These 
loans are assumed to be held to maturity, and the quantity outstanding reaches zero 
by the second quarter of 2015. 

 The Commercial Paper Funding Facility (CPFF) and central bank liquidity swap lines are 
assumed to expire on February 1, 2010; funds extended through these facilities decline to 
zero in the second quarter of 2010 as their credit extensions mature. 

 No credit is extended through either the Asset-Backed Commercial Paper Money Market 
Mutual Fund Liquidity Facility (AMLF) or the Primary Dealer Credit Facility (PDCF) before 
the facilities expire February 1, 2010. 

 Support to AIG, the sum of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York’s extension of revolving 
credit and its preferred interests in AIA Aurora LLC and ALICO LLC, remains around $40 
billion through midyear 2011 and then declines to zero by the end of 2013.14   

 The assets held by Maiden Lane LLC, Maiden Lane II LLC, and Maiden Lane III LLC are 
sold over time and reach either zero or a nominal level by the end of 2016.   

 The assets held by TALF LLC increase to $2 billion by June 2012 and remain at that level 
through 2014.  Assets held by TALF LLC comprise investments purchased with 
commitment fees collected by the LLC and from the U.S. Treasury’s initial funding.  The 
LLC does not purchase any ABS received by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York in 
connection with a decision of a borrower not to repay a TALF loan.  

Other Assets 
 The Special Drawing Rights (SDR) certificate account increases by $2 billion, to $7 billion, 

by the third quarter of 2011, as a result of an assumed monetization of the recent allocation 
of SDRs. 

LIABILITIES AND CAPITAL 
 All liabilities and capital assumptions are the same across scenarios except where noted 

below. 
 Federal Reserve notes in circulation grow in line with the staff forecast for money stock 

currency through the end of 2011.  From 2011 to the end of the projection period, Federal 
Reserve notes in circulation grow at the same rate as nominal GDP, as projected in the 
extended Greenbook forecast. 

 Reverse repurchase agreements remain roughly at the current level of reverse repurchase 
agreements with foreign official and international accounts.  Some minor fluctuations in the

15 The staff forecast for end-of-month U.S. Treasury’s operating cash balances includes forecasts of both the TGA and 

balances associated with the U.S. Treasury’s Tax and Loan program.  Because balances associated with the Tax and 
Loan program are $2 billion, for the time being, this forecast is a good proxy for the level of TGA balances. 

near-term level of reverse repurchase agreements reflect the tests by the Open Market Desk 
of triparty reverse repurchase agreements with primary dealers.  

 The U.S. Treasury’s general account (TGA) follows the staff forecast for end-of-month U.S. 
Treasury’s operating cash balances through June 2010.15  Thereafter, the TGA drops back to 
its historical target level of $5 billion by the end of next year as it is assumed that the 
Treasury will have implemented a new cash management system that allows it to easily invest 
funds in excess of $5 billion.  The TGA remains constant at $5 billion over the remainder of 
the forecast period. 

 In the near term, movements in the U.S. Treasury’s supplementary financing account (SFA) 
reflect constraints the U.S. Treasury faces with regards to its debt limit.  In line with the 
Treasury’s announcement regarding the Supplementary Financing Program, the SFA has run 
down to $15 billion.  Subsequently, under the assumption that the Congress raises the debt 
limit, the balances in the SFA gradually increase to $200 billion over the first quarter of 2010 
and remain at this level in each of the scenarios until the SFA is reduced to ensure reserve 
balance levels do not fall below $25 billion.  The timing of when the SFA is reduced to 
maintain reserve balance levels of $25 billion varies across the three scenarios. 

 Federal Reserve capital grows 15 percent per year, in line with the average rate of the past 
ten years. 

 In general, the level of assets of the Federal Reserve drives the level of reserve balances.  
Increases in the levels of other liability items, such as Federal Reserve notes in circulation 
and the TGA, along with increases in the level of Reserve Bank capital drain reserve 
balances.  Reserve balances in the three scenarios peak at different levels and at different 
times.  However, in all scenarios, reserve balances fall back to $25 billion by the end of the 
forecast horizon.
