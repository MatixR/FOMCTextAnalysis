Prefatory Note 

 
 

The attached document represents the most complete and accurate version 
available based on original copies culled from the files of the FOMC Secretariat at the 
Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System.  This electronic document was 
created through a comprehensive digitization process which included identifying the best-
preserved paper copies, scanning those copies,1 and then making the scanned versions 
text-searchable.2  Though a stringent quality assurance process was employed, some 
imperfections may remain. 
 

Please note that this document may contain occasional gaps in the text.  These 
gaps are the result of a redaction process that removed information obtained on a

scanned images were deskewed (to remove the effects of printer- and scanner-introduced tilting) and lightly 
cleaned (to remove dark spots caused by staple holes, hole punches, and other blemishes caused after initial 
printing). 
2 A two-step process was used.  An advanced optimal character recognition computer program (OCR) first 
created electronic text from the document image.  Where the OCR results were inconclusive, staff checked

MONETARY POLICY ALTERNATIVES

Recent Developments

(1) In accordance with the Committee's decision at its March 29

meeting to increase slightly the degree of reserve pressure, the allowance

for adjustment plus seasonal borrowing was raised by $100 million, to $300

million, during the maintenance period ending April 6. Actual borrowing

averaged $332 million over the first two maintenance periods since the

meeting, but jumped to $438 million in the period ending on May 4. Reserve

management in the latter period was complicated by considerable uncertainty

about the timing and magnitude of federal tax payments. Market expectations

that the funds rate would firm as Treasury balances soared, together with

apparently heightened demands for excess reserves, may have contributed to

upward pressure on the funds rate and particularly heavy borrowing in the

second week of that period. Much of the increase in borrowing in the May

4 maintenance period occurred at small and medium-sized banks, and included

a rise of nearly $70 million in seasonal borrowing to $191 million. Early

in the current maintenance period, in light of data since the last FOMC

meeting showing considerable economic strength with possible accompanying

price pressures, and given growth of M2 and M3 in the upper portions of

their ranges, the borrowing assumption was raised further to $400 million.

Over the first eight days of this period, adjustment plus seasonal borrowing

has averaged around $350 million.

1. Reflecting the long-term trend toward greater demand for excess
reserves, on April 29 the standard allowance for excess reserves was
increased from $850 million to $950 million.

NOTES: Monthly reserve measures, including excess reserves and
borrowing, are calculated by prorating averages for two-week reserve
maintenance periods that overlap months. Reserve data incorporate
adjustments for discontinuities associated with changes in reserve
requirements.



(2) Responding to the increases in reserve pressures, the federal

funds rate has moved up from around 6-1/2 percent at the time of the last

FOMC meeting to around 7 percent most recently. Other short-term interest

rates increased by similar amounts--including a 1/2 percentage point rise in

the prime rate to 9 percent; bond yields rose 30 to 45 basis points. Much

of the upward movement in rates, especially in long-term markets, occurred

following release of economic and price data (along with a disappointing

trade balance) that pointed to strength in demands on the economy and pos-

sible labor cost and price pressures, engendering expectations that the

Federal Reserve would need to tighten; at the time of their occurrence,

actual increases in reserve pressures and the federal funds rate had little

further effect on bond markets. On balance, movements in broad stock price

indexes were mixed over the intermeeting period; daily volatility in stock

prices picked up somewhat, though remaining well below that in late 1987 and

early 1988.

(3) Indications of a tightening of U.S. monetary policy in early

April and again in early May lent some firmness to the dollar, interrupted

by a mid-April weakening in response to the release of U.S. trade figures

for February. On balance, the dollar's weighted average exchange value has

appreciated about 3/8 percent since the last Committee meeting.

. The Desk purchased $500 million against yen and

marks . Short-term interest rates

abroad generally rose only slightly, except in Canada, where concern about



-4-

inflation prompted increases about in line with those in the United States,

and in the United Kingdom, where rates declined in response to the Bank of

England's efforts to offset some of sterling's strength. Long-term rates

abroad, especially in Germany, rose somewhat, partly on expectations that

monetary authorities might tighten following the rise in U.S. interest

rates.

(4) Monetary growth in April was distorted by a build-up of

transactions balances associated with outsized individual nonwithheld tax

payments. Transactions deposits surged after mid-month to meet final tax

liabilities for 1987, which had been buoyed by underwithholding and possibly

by realized capital gains associated with increased stock market trading

volume last year. A large portion of the checks written against these

deposits did not clear until late April and early May, and preliminary data

for early May indicate substantial declines in transactions deposits. For

the month of April, M1 accelerated to an 11-1/4 percent rate of growth, with

perhaps as much as 5 percentage points accounted for by tax-related

increases in cash balances. Total and nonborrowed reserves in April

paralleled the pickup in required reserves against transactions deposits,

and with currency growth unchanged last month, expansion of the monetary

base also accelerated.

(5) Within the broader aggregates, a good part of the tax distor-

tion likely was offset as individuals funded part of the increases in M1

deposits by drawing down savings-type balances included in M2 and as deposi-

tory institutions used a portion of the net additions to core deposits to

reduce their issuance of managed liabilities in M3. M2 and M3 expanded in



April at rates of 10 and 6-3/4 percent, respectively, compared with the

FOMC's 6 to 7 percent path for March to June. Relatively rapid M2 growth in

April may have reflected not only some tax-related effects, but also lagged

adjustments to earlier declines in opportunity costs. Moreover, heightened

preferences by households for liquid assets in response to uncertainties

about future movements in long-term securities prices, as evidenced by

weakness in bond and stock mutual funds this year, may have contributed to

continuing strength in M2. A resumption in bank borrowing from foreign

branches reduced the need to issue managed liabilities in M3, despite a

surge in bank credit. Growth in this aggregate also was held down by a

faster runoff from institution-only money market funds, as the opportunity

costs of holding such funds widened further with the rise in market rates.

(6) Growth of the debt of domestic nonfinancial sectors in April

slowed to an estimated 8 percent rate. Private borrowing appears to have

been well maintained last month, while Treasury borrowing declined markedly.

Given its ample cash position, the Treasury continued to pay down bills in

regular weekly auctions during April. Among private sectors, overall busi-

ness borrowing was strong as the financing gap likely remained wide and

heavy equity retirements continued to create large funding needs. With the

backup in market rates, business borrowing shifted somewhat from bond mar-

kets to short-term sources; the sum of bank loans and commercial paper

surged last month. Bank data for April suggest that growth of consumer and

real estate loans remained substantial.



Policy Alternatives

(7) The three policy alternatives presented below are geared to

unchanged, increased, and decreased pressures on reserve positions relative

to the Desk's current operating objective. The assumption for adjustment

plus seasonal borrowing would be kept at $400 million under alternative B

and would be raised or lowered by $200 million under alternatives C and A,

respectively. The federal funds rate would be expected to average around

7 percent under alternative B, and around 7-1/2 and 6-1/2 percent under
2

alternatives C and A. These relations embody some continued reluctance of

banks to be seen at the discount window compared with patterns before the

stock market crash; to the extent this reluctance abates or is offset by

further unusually strong increases in seasonal credit, however, federal

funds rates consistent with these borrowing assumptions could average a

little lower.

(8) The table below gives growth rates for the monetary aggre-

gates from March to June expected to be associated with the reserve market

conditions for each alternative. Under all the alternatives, M2 growth

should be appreciably slower on average over May and June compared with its

advanced April pace, reflecting the effects of higher interest rates and the

unwinding of the tax-related build-up. Under alternative B, the effects on

money demand for the March-to-June period of somewhat higher interest rates

than anticipated at the last FOMC meeting are offset by upward revisions to

income, and the growth rates of M2 and M3, respectively, are projected to be

2. The intermeeting consultation range for the federal funds rate
suggested for alternative B in the table below is 5 to 9 percent, up
from 4 to 8 percent at present, in order to be better centered on
expected federal funds rates.



at the upper end and in the middle of the Committee's current 6 to 7 percent

short-run specifications. The detailed table and charts on the following

pages indicate that the broad aggregates would be expected under all the

alternatives to remain within the upper halves of their annual target cones

through midyear.

(9) Market interest rates now appear to incorporate the policy

stance of alternative B. Thus, with federal funds continuing to trade

around 7 percent, the three-month Treasury bill rate could remain in the

6-1/4 percent area in the near term. But if economic data in coming weeks

confirm the second-quarter strength of economic activity envisioned in the

greenbook forecast, heightened market concern about inflation and anticipa-

tion of further policy restraint could well induce a further firming in

short- and long-term rates as midyear approaches. Pressures on the dollar

will depend not only on incoming information about the trade deficit and on

movements in relative interest rates, but also on market views of how macro-

economic developments and policies are affecting the sustainability of

improvements in external imbalances. A substantial firming of monetary

policies abroad in the wake of recent Federal Reserve action, or emerging

market perceptions over coming weeks of a need for more U.S. policy

restraint in the face of the maintenance of the reserve conditions of alter-

native B, could result in a decline in the dollar.

(10) Under alternative B, opportunity costs of holding liquid

retail accounts would remain higher through midyear than in recent months,

given the likely very gradual response of offering rates on such accounts to

the recent rise in market rates. The unwinding of tax-related balances also

will be depressing money growth rates in May. Both of these influences will

have considerably smaller impacts on M2 than on M1. The latter was boosted

more substantially in April by the temporary build-up of transactions depos-

its and will be more affected by the rise in interest rates as depositors

shift funds from OCDs into small time deposits, whose yields adjust more

promptly to market rates. Growth in M1 is projected to drop below 3 percent

on average over May and June from 11-1/4 percent in April. In light of

weakness early in May, probably related to clearing of tax checks, M2 is

projected to increase at only a 4-1/2 percent rate this month. In June, M2

expansion is expected to rebound to around 6-1/2 percent--a little below the

projected growth of nominal income over the current quarter, owing to higher

opportunity costs. Implied M2 growth from March to June would be held to 7

percent, but, with the rapid M2 expansion through April, quarterly average

growth would amount to around 8 percent. Assuming the staff projection of

second-quarter growth in nominal GNP of around 7 percent, M2 velocity would

fall by about 1 percent, approximately half of the decline in the first

quarter.



-10-

(11) M3 growth should moderate to around a 6-1/4 percent rate over

May and June under alternative B. Money market mutual funds in M3 probably

will decline further for a while as returns lag behind recently elevated

short-term market rates. The drop in core deposit inflows in May and June

is likely to be only partly offset by increased issuance of managed liabili-

ties by banks and thrifts because depository institution credit is antici-

pated to slow. At banks, business loan growth, though likely to remain

strong given the rise in bond rates, should drop back from the April pace,

which was boosted by an extraordinary volume of merger-related and other

special borrowing, and households may tap consumer credit and home equity

lines to a lesser extent in coming months with the scaling back of auto

incentives and the passing of the April tax date. At thrifts, however, the

restraining effects on asset expansion of the recent upturn in mortgage

rates will be cushioned some by a growing share of ARMs. Total household

borrowing over the remainder of the quarter is expected to edge down, while

overall business credit demands should remain robust into the summer given

the elevated financing gap and continuing merger activity. But with federal

government borrowing light over the rest of the second quarter, the growth

in the debt of all domestic nonfinancial sectors by June is expected to be

moving closer to, though still staying a little above, the 9 percent mid-

point of the Committee's annual range.

(12) The increase in discount borrowing to $600 million under

alternative C would raise the federal funds rate by 1/2 percentage point and

carry Treasury bill rates up by similar amounts. Banks very likely would

raise the prime rate by another 1/2 point, and business financing costs on



-11-

open market paper also could rise by a like amount. Downward pressure on

the exchange value of the dollar would be forestalled, at least for a time.

As is typical, bond yields would go up by less than short-term rates, though

the initial declines in bond and possibly stock prices in response to an

unanticipated firming of the size contemplated under this alternative could

be substantial. Over time, however, movements in securities prices will

depend on perceptions both of underlying strength in credit demands and of

the likely success of the Federal Reserve in checking any emerging accelera-

tion of inflation. While the course of economic activity and prices would

not be much affected by small variations in the time path of interest rates,

alternative C is closer to what was contemplated in the staff GNP forecast,

which anticipates a fairly substantial rise in money market yields through

early 1989.

(13) The higher market interest rates associated with alternative

C would further damp money growth. M1 would show little expansion in May

and June; reduced compensating balance requirements would constrain demand

deposits, and still wider opportunity costs would make NOW accounts, along

with other liquid retail accounts, even less attractive. Slower M2 growth

through June would be expected to bring its March-to-June pace to 6-1/4

percent, and its expansion from the fourth quarter to 7 percent. M3 could

be supported somewhat by a further shifting of business credit demands to

banks as higher bond yields curtail firms' offerings of longer-term debt,

necessitating greater reliance on managed liabilities by banks than under

alternative B.



-12-

(14) Alternative A would be implemented through restoring the

assumption for adjustment plus seasonal borrowing to the level of $200 mil-

lion that was in force from late January through late March, with federal

funds probably returning to the 6-1/2 percent trading area; even lower rates

could prevail if seasonal credit, which is now above $200 million, responded

relatively little to the decline in reserve pressures. Such a measure on

the heels of the two recent tightening steps clearly would be unexpected by

market participants and, in the absence of considerably weaker economic and

price data, might raise doubts about the Federal Reserve's anti-inflationary

resolve. The exchange value of the dollar would come under strong downward

pressure, and there is some risk that heightened inflationary expectations

would have adverse implications for bond prices. The prospect that such a

policy easing could not long be sustained also would limit associated

declines in short-term interest rates, with the three-month Treasury bill

rate perhaps not falling much below 6 percent. This decline in money market

rates would encourage somewhat faster growth in the broader monetary

aggregates, although the March-to-June growth of M2 and M3 still would

remain well below their December-to-March pace, and in June these aggre-

gates still would be below the upper limit of their 4 to 8 percent long-run

ranges.

Directive Language

(15) Draft language for the operational paragraph, with the usual

options for alternative specifications of reserve pressures and possible

intermeeting adjustments, is presented below for Committee consideration.

The second sentence calling for continued flexibility in the conduct of

operations is shown in brackets.

Operational Paragraph

In the implementation of policy for the immediate

future, the Committee seeks to DECREASE SLIGHTLY (SOMEWHAT)

(Alt. A)/MAINTAIN (Alt. B)/increase slightly (SOMEWHAT)

(Alt. C) the degree of pressure on reserve positions. [The

Committee agrees that the current more normal approach to

open market operations remains appropriate; still sensitive

conditions in financial markets and uncertainties in the

economic outlook may continue to call for some flexibility

in operations.] Taking account of conditions in financial

markets, somewhat (SLIGHTLY) greater reserve restraint

WOULD (MIGHT) or somewhat (SLIGHTLY) lesser reserve

restraint would (MIGHT) be acceptable depending on the

strength of the business expansion, indications of

inflationary pressures, developments in foreign exchange

markets, as well as the behavior of the monetary aggre-

gates. The contemplated reserve conditions are expected to



-14-

be consistent with growth in M2 and M3 over the period from

March through June at annual rates of about [DEL:6-to-7] ___

PERCENT AND ____ percent-, RESPECTIVELY. The Chairman may

call for Committee consultation if it appears to the

Manager for Domestic Operations that reserve conditions

during the period before the next meeting are likely to be

associated with a federal funds rate persistently outside a

range of [DEL: 4-to-8] ____ TO ____ percent.
