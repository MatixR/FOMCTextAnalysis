Prefatory Note 

 
 

The attached document represents the most complete and accurate version 
available based on original copies culled from the files of the FOMC Secretariat at the 
Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System.  This electronic document was 
created through a comprehensive digitization process which included identifying the best-
preserved paper copies, scanning those copies,1 and then making the scanned versions 
text-searchable.2  Though a stringent quality assurance process was employed, some 
imperfections may remain. 
 

Please note that this document may contain occasional gaps in the text.  These 
gaps are the result of a redaction process that removed information obtained on a

1 In some cases, original copies needed to be photocopied before being scanned into electronic format.  All 
scanned images were deskewed (to remove the effects of printer- and scanner-introduced tilting) and lightly 
cleaned (to remove dark spots caused by staple holes, hole punches, and other blemishes caused after initial 
printing). 
2 A two-step process was used.  An advanced optimal character recognition computer program (OCR) first 
created electronic text from the document image.  Where the OCR results were inconclusive, staff checked 
and corrected the text as necessary.   Please note that the numbers and text in charts and tables were not

MONETARY POLICY ALTERNATIVES

Recent developments

(1) M2 grew at about an 8 percent annual rate in October (and

M3 at a 9 percent rate), while M1 expanded at about a 20 percent annual

rate. Growth in M2, probably held down to a minor degree by shifts of

ASC funds to market instruments, ran increasingly above the path set con-

sistent with the Committee's 8½ to 9½ percent quarterly growth target as

the intermeeting period progressed. This path had called for relatively

slow growth in October and more rapid growth in subsequent months.

(2) The strength in M2 reflects greater growth in both its M1

and nontransactions components,relative to initial expectations, abstracting

from estimated ASC effects. It now appears that the effect on the monthly

average of M1 in October from the disposition of maturing ASC balances

was much larger than we had anticipated; more seems to have been initially

shifted and the funds have remained in transaction accounts longer. Never-

theless, growth in M1 in October abstracting from shifts was still probably

around 10 percent.1/

(3) Total reserves grew at a 9½ percent annual rate in October,

with most of the increase reflecting the rise in required reserves associated

with the strength in transactions accounts. Given a $475 million drop in

the average level of adjustment borrowing in October, nonborrowed reserves

expanded at about a 25 percent annual rate last month. The nonborrowed

path constructed following the October FOMC meeting implied borrowing of

around $300 million. The implied level of borrowing rose during the inter-

meeting period, but not commensurately with the strengthening of M2, since

account was taken of the Committee's willingness to accommodate exceptional

liquidity demands and the fact that M2 growth in October, though substantially

faster than initial expectations for the intermeeting period, was not neces-

1/
sarily out of keeping with the quarterly target range.

(4) Reflecting limited pressure to borrow at the discount window

and a ½ percentage point cut in the discount rate soon after the October

FOMC meeting, the federal funds rate declined from somewhat above 10 percent

in September to the neighborhood of the 9½ percent discount rate throughout

the intermeeting period. Most other rates dropped by much more, in part

because of expectations that the Federal Reserve would promote a further

easing of money market conditions. Despite some rate increases in recent

days as a further discount rate cut has not been forthcoming, private short-

term rates have dropped about 1½ percentage points on balance since the

early October meeting, while yields on Treasury bills have fallen con-

siderably less as concerns about private credit risks apparently have

lessened. Corporate and Treasury bond rates have dropped about 1 to 1½

percentage points since early October. The average commitment rate on

conventional mortgages at S&Ls has dropped 1¼ percentage points and the

continuing easing in mortgage markets reportedly has led to a noticeable

pickup in institutional lending activity.

(5) Bank credit continued to grow moderately in October,

registering a 7 percent annual rate of increase. Loan growth remained

in general relatively weak, but banks stepped up their acquisitions of

Treasury securities. Business loan growth slowed to around a 7 percent

annual rate last month, even though it was still being boosted by the

effects of merger-related financings arranged in September. Total short-term

borrowing by nonfinancial business weakened further, as commercial paper out-

standing contracted sharply again in October. This dropoff in short-term

borrowing reflected an increased issuance of long-term debt in response

to the continuing downtrend in bond yields.

(6) After dropping rather sharply immediately following the last

FOMC meeting, the dollar has appreciated further in recent weeks. On

balance, the dollar has advanced about 1 1/2 percent since the Committee

meeting,

. The strength

in the dollar occurred in the face of news of a sharply larger third-quarter

trade deficit, and of greater declines in U.S. interest rates, on balance,

than in foreign interest rates over the period.



Alternative near-term targets

(7) The table below presents three alternative targets for M2

for the current quarter, along with associated federal funds rate ranges.

Alternatives B and C encompass growth rates of M2 (and also M3) for the

quarter consistent with the Committee's decision with respect to these

aggregates at the previous meeting, while alternative A looks to somewhat

higher growth rates. Rates of growth for M1 implied by these M2 paths

are shown in the second panel. More detailed data for the alternatives

are shown in the table and charts on the next few pages. The quarterly

interest rate path underlying the staff's GNP projection is contained in

Appendix II.

(8) As appears to have been the case thus far this year, the

public's liquidity demands are assumed to remain high over the balance

of the year, reflecting the impact of continuing economic uncertainties.

Both Ml and M2 this quarter are expected to expand considerably more

rapidly than nominal GNP under all three alternatives; and, as shown on

the charts and tables on the succeeding pages, the growth rates of the

monetary aggregates are expected for the year to be above the upper ends

of their respective longer-run ranges. The income velocities of both

Ml and M2 thus will decline by unusually large amounts over the QIV '81

to QIV '82 period--about 3¼ and 5 percent, respectively.

(9) Under all three alternatives, M1 growth is expected to

decelerate--though still remaining strong--in the last two months of the

year, reflecting in part an unwinding of the demand and NOW balances

built up from some of the proceeds of the very large ASC deposits maturing

in October. On the other hand, the nontransactions component of M2 should

accelerate from its October pace, when it was held down by transfers of

ASC funds to transactions accounts and market instruments. It is expected

that the new DIDC money market account will reduce M1 balances and have

only a relatively small effect on M2 when it becomes available in mid-

December. However, there might be some effects, perhaps raising M1 or M2,

in the interim if and as the public lodges funds in deposits in anticipa-

1/
tion of the new account.-

(10) Alternative B, which calls for M2 growth this quarter at

the upper end of the 8½ to 9½ percent range adopted by the Committee at its

last meeting, would be associated with an increase in total reserves at

about a 6¾ percent annual rate over the last two months of the year. Given

continued strong liquidity demands, such an M2 target might involve a

federal funds rate over the intermeeting period fluctuating around the

present 9½ percent discount rate and borrowing at the discount window

ranging around $350 million. Nonborrowed reserves would expand in parallel

with total reserves over the last two months of the year.

(11) With many in the market currently expecting some decline

in the funds rate (and the discount rate) over the near-term, maintenance

will be presented in the blue book for the December meeting. Our
initial estimates are for a quite small effect on the aggregates for
December, given the late effective date of the instrument.



of these rates around recent levels would probably lead to some further

back-up in short- and longer-term market rates. A 3-month bill rate moving

up to around the 8½ percent area is not unlikely, and private short-term rates

might rise 25 to 50 basis points or so. Longer-term interest rates also

would tend to rise, but probably by less, given the favorable outlook for

curbing inflation and the evidence of weak economic activity. Mortgage

rates would probably not fall much further, as bond yields firm and short-

term financing costs of depository institutions tend to edge up.

(12) The growth of credit to all nonfinancial sectors appears

to be slowing a bit in the fourth quarter, though remaining above the first

half pace and also in excess of the expected growth of nominal GNP. Treasury

indebtedness is increasing rapidly--at an estimated 18 percent seasonally

adjusted annual rate in the fourth quarter--and is projected to continue

rising at this pace in early 1983. Growth in credit raised by private non-

financial sectors this quarter remains below its first half pace. However,

the recent decline of interest rates appears to be stimulating credit usage

by households, whose mortgage and other borrowing is projected to pick up

this quarter and to continue rising moderately into 1983. Lower rates

apparently also are inducing greater borrowing by state and local govern-

ments, but bond issuance in anticipation of new regulation at year-end is

also a factor behind recent record tax-exempt bond volumes, and the credit

demands of this sector are expected to moderate in early 1983. Business

borrowing appears to be moderating somewhat in the current quarter as

financing needs are held down by a further reduction in inventories, and

as greater reliance is placed on equity issuance in the wake of the advance

of stock prices. Businesses also are projected to continue the recent

pattern of heavier issuance of bonds and reduced borrowing from banks.



Largely as a result, bank credit growth in coming months is expected to

remain close to the more moderate pace established in the second half of

this year.

(13) An increase in the Committee's fourth-quarter M2 target to

a 10 percent annual rate, as in alternative A, might be required for some

further easing of money market conditions in an environment of continued

strong liquidity demands on the part of the public. The percentage point

of more rapid growth in M2 under this alternative, as compared with

alternative B, would entail a relatively more rapid expansion in M1--by

about 1¼ percentage points over the 3-month period. What information we

have suggests that--in view of the availability of market-related rates

on instruments encompassed by M2--M1 may have at least twice the elasticity

with respect to market interest rates as M2. Thus, a given change in

market interest rates will have a more substantial impact on M1 growth

rates than on M2 rates.

(14) Under alternative A, we would expect the federal funds

rate to decline from its present level to the area of 8½ percent, with

total reserves rising at about an 8 percent annual rate in November and

December. Assuming such a decline in the funds rate, adjustment borrowing

would be at minimal levels ($150 million or less), given the present or

a somewhat lower discount rate. Nonborrowed reserves would rise at about

an 11½ percent annual rate over the balance of the year.

(15) The further easing in bank reserve positions contemplated

by alternative A might involve a drop in the 3-month bill rate to around

7½ percent, or perhaps somewhat lower depending on expectations of further

policy adjustments. As markets ease, and confidence in markets and the

economy improves, some little further narrowing in quality spreads might



-10-

develop. The bank prime rate would probably decline to around 11 percent.

Bond rates would also likely share in these downward adjustments, as

investors hastened to lock up still relatively high longer-term yields.

And the lower cost of thrift institution deposits would bring additional

downward pressure on mortgage rates. The further decline in U.S. interest

rates would tend at least to blunt the strength of the dollar on foreign

exchange markets, and may well bring some depreciation.

(16) Alternative C involves M2 growth over the fourth quarter at

a 9 percent annual rate and constraint on reserve provision that would

probably lead to a federal funds rate of 10 percent or somewhat higher.

Total reserves would be expected to expand at a 5 percent annual rate over

the last two months of the year. With the discount rate unchanged at 9

percent, borrowings would likely be in the area of $600 million, and non-

borrowed reserves would rise at only a 1 percent annual rate.

(17) A substantial reaction to a tightening of basic reserve

positions would be expected in short-term and longer-term markets. The

3-month bill rate and other short-term rates could rise by as much as 1

percentage point. Longer-term rates would also adjust upwards, though

much higher rates would probably not be long sustained. A significant

rise in short rates would probably be seen by market participants as

retarding economic recovery and reducing the odds on a strengthening of

private credit demands, thus making the present or higher levels of long-

term rates attractive to investors despite a near-term rise in short rates.



-11-

Directive language

(18) Given below are suggested operational paragraphs for the

directive, with specifications adopted at the meeting on Ocotber 5 shown

in strike-through form.

Specification of the behavior of M1 over the balance of

the year [DEL: is] REMAINS subject to unusually great uncertainties

because [DEL: it will be substantially affected by] OF special

circumstances [DEL: in-the-very-near-term-by] THE reinvestment of funds

from maturing all savers certificates and [DEL: later by] the public's

response to the new account directly competitive with money market

funds mandated by recent legislation. The [DEL: probable] difficulties in

interpretation of M1 [DEL: during the period] suggest THAT much less than

usual weight be placed on movements in that aggregate during the

current quarter. These developments are expected to affect M2 and

other broader aggregates to a much smaller extent.

In all the circumstances, the Committee seeks to maintain

expansion in bank reserves needed for an orderly and sustained flow of

money and credit, consistent with growth of M2 (and M3) in a range of

around [DEL: 8½ to 9½] ____ TO ____ percent at an annual rate from September to

December, and taking account of the desirability of somewhat reduced

pressures in private credit markets in the light of current economic

conditions. Somewhat slower growth, bringing those aggregates around

the upper part of the ranges set for the year, would be acceptable and

desirable in a context of declining interest rates. Should economic

and financial uncertainties lead to exceptional liquidity demands,

somewhat more rapid growth in the broader aggregates would be tolerated.



-12-

The Chairman may call for Committee consultation if it appears to the

Manager for Domestic Operations that pursuit of the monetary objectives

and related reserve paths during the period before the next meeting

is likely to be associated with a federal funds rate persistently

outside a range of [DEL: 7 to 10½] ____ TO ____ percent.
