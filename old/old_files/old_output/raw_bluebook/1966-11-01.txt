employed, some imperfections may remain.

1  In some cases, original copies needed to be photocopied before being scanned into electronic 
format.  All scanned images were deskewed (to remove the effects of printer- and scanner-introduced 
tilting) and lightly cleaned (to remove dark spots caused by staple holes, hole punches, and other 
blemishes caused after initial printing). 
 
2 A two-step process was used.  An advanced optical character recognition computer program (OCR) 
first created electronic text from the document image.  Where the OCR results were inconclusive, 
staff checked and corrected the text as necessary.  Please note that the numbers and text in charts and

MONEY MARKET AND RESERVE RELATIONSHIPS

Recent developments

Money market conditions have eased somewhat in recent weeks,

and aggregate bank reserves, bank credit, and the money supply have

shown considerably less strength than earlier anticipated; in fact,

all these variables have declined on average in October. The outflow

of time deposits at banks is not very different from anticipations

with time and savings deposits at all commercial banks declining at

about a 2.5 per cent annual rate in October. This reflects a net run-

off in CD's estimated at between $1.2 to $1.5 billion of the $5.2 billion

of CD's maturing during the month.

Total member bank deposits (the bank credit proxy) declined

at an annual rate of almost 3 per cent on average in October; this

represented a substantial shortfall from earlier projections, with
1/

the shortfall reflecting weaker than expected private demand deposits.

The weakness in bank credit is also attested to by very preliminary

estimates for the change in total commercial bank credit on a last-

Wednesday-of-the-month basis. This series shows only a very minor

$200 million rise (an annual rate of not quite 1 per cent) for October.

1/ During October, domestic banks made somewhat less use of funds

obtained through their foreign branches than in recent months.

Allowance for such funds would make the October decline in the

bank credit proxy 2.2 per cent.

CONFIDENTIAL (FR) - 2 - October 28, 1966

Business loan growth in October, when there was again a

sizable speed-up in certain corporate tax payments, was somewhat larger

than in September, but less than the very high rate of expansion of

the first eight months of the year. With the present degree of monetary

restraint and with CD run-offs sizable, banks had to liquidate a sub-

stantial amount of U.S. Government securities, especially in the first

half of October. Despite bank sales and the Treasury's October 11

auction of tax bills, bill rates remained within a relatively narrow

range of fluctuation during the first half of October, when the 3-month

bill averaged 5.40 per cent; bill rates subsequently declined, with

the 3-month bill currently quoted around 5.25 per cent.

While the decline in bill rates was partly the result of dis-

intermediation (with reinvestment of funds from CD run-offs converging

on the short-term bill market), it also appears to have reflected the

development of less intense credit demands in the economy--inasmuch as

the decline in bill rates was also accompanied by some declines in

other short-term rates, a reduction in money supply, and a further

decline in long-term rates. Over the four months since midyear, the

money supply and total reserves have declined at annual rates of more

than 2 per cent and nonborrowed reserves at about 3.5 per cent. During

the first half of this year by contrast all these variables increased at

annual rates of between 3 and 5 per cent.

CONFIDENTIAL (FR)



COF DENTIAL (FR) - 3 - October 28, 1966

With aggregate monetary variables showing less strength than

expected in recent weeks, open market operations did not attempt to

offset fully the comparative ease that was developing in money market

conditions. Net borrowed reserves during the past two statement weeks

averaged $338 million, with member bank borrowings averaging $654 million;

in the previous two statement weeks these indicators had averaged $494

million and $878 million respectively. The volume of Federal funds

trading picked up slightly during the past two statement weeks, while

the average rate at which trading took place declined to around 5½ per

cent. Dealer loan rates in New York eased back a little, although by

relatively less than did such rates outside New York.

Prospective developments

Assuming that money market rates and net borrowed reserves

remain within the range of fluctuation of the past four weeks, staff

projections suggest a further decline in total member bank deposits

(the bank credit proxy) on average in November. The decline is likely

to be in the order of a 2 per cent annual rate. With the deposit mix

continuing to shift in favor of demand deposits, required reserves

are projected to decline by only about 1 per cent. These projections

assume some additional Treasury cash financing toward the end of the

month, and a business loan expansion somewhat less than in October --

mainly because corporate payments of withheld taxes were shifted forward

to October from November.

CONFIDENTIAL (FR)



CONFIDENTIA (FR)

The reduction in total member bank deposits assumes a CD run-

off during November of about $ billion, less than half the pace of the

past two months. The recent decline in short-term bill rates (with the

one-month bill currently quoted at around 4.50 per cent on the offered

side) has led to some reported sales of short bills and reinvestment of

the proceeds in short CD's. Total time and savings deposits for all

member banks may still decline slightly on average in the month of

November, but such deposits at all commercial banks are likely

to rise slightly because of continued deposit gains by nonmember banks.

Money supply and private demand deposits are expected to rise

at roughly a 2-3 per cent annual rate on average from October to November.

Because private demand deposits fell steadily on a weekly basis after

the first week in October, a resumed rise in November would start from a

low point. As a result, the increase projected in such deposits from

the last week of October to the last week in November is more rapid

than the average rise for the month--partly influenced by the expected

declines in the Treasury cash balance during most of the month ahead.

The Government security market in November will be importantly

influenced by the market's accommodation of the Treasury's November

refunding. The initial reaction to the Treasury's offering--a 15-month,

5-5/8 per cent note and a 5-year, 5-3/8 per cent note--was highly

favorable, and prices were marked up especially in the intermediate-

and long-term area. In the capital markets as a whole, the current

CONFIDENTIAL (FR)

- 4 - October 28, 1966



CONFIDENTIAL (FR) - 5 - October 28, 1966

moderation in the corporate and municipal calendars is contributing to

a firm atmosphere, which is likely to persist unless a sizable build-up

in the calendar is induced.

Short-term markets are moving into the season when upward

yield pressures generally intensify, and bill rates are likely to be

influenced by a Treasury cash financing in the bill area that may be

announced later in November. It appears likely that the 3-month bill

rate will rise as November progresses, while generally remaining within

a 5.20-5.50 per cent range. The propensity of investors to arbitrage

between short bills and CD's would also tend to maintain a floor under

bill rates. The Federal funds rate may also come under upward seasonal

pressure in the weeks ahead and edge up from the recent average of 5-1/4

per cent.

Given the demand assumptions underlying the above projections,

a movement toward a consistently shallower net borrowed reserve figure

than obtained during the past four weeks--say, in the order of $200

million--to encourage aggregate reserve and bank credit expansion would

likely be accompanied by lower bill rates (with the 3-month bill possibly

in a 4.90-5.30 per cent range) and increased market expectations for

declining longer term rates.
