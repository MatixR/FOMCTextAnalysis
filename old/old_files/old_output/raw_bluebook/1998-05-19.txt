Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System.  This electronic document was 
created through a comprehensive digitization process which included identifying the best-
preserved paper copies, scanning those copies,1 and then making the scanned versions 
text-searchable.2  Though a stringent quality assurance process was employed, some 
imperfections may remain. 
 

Please note that this document may contain occasional gaps in the text.  These

MONETARY POLICY ALTERNATIVES

Recent Developments

(1) Keeping the federal funds rate close to its intended level of 5-1/2 percent, which

was reaffirmed at the FOMC meeting on March 31, proved challenging at times over the

intermeeting period. The Desk added reserves on a permanent basis early in the period and

arranged some large temporary injections to offset April tax inflows. More recently, after the

Treasury balance retreated to a more normal level, the Desk has been draining reserves. In

the event, depositories seemed inclined to hold fewer excess reserves than had been expected,

and the federal funds rate traded shy of its intended level through the latter part of April and

into May before returning to the 5-1/2 percent area of late.1

(2) Most other market interest rates have registered small net declines since the

March meeting (chart). News stories in late April reporting that the Committee had switched

to an asymmetric directive toward tightening were a focus of market attention for a time, in

part because they appeared consistent with the more hawkish tone taken by several Federal

Reserve officials in speeches and interviews. These reports triggered a spike in market yields,

engendered skittishness about the prospects for rates going forward, and set back stock prices

some. The effects proved fleeting once investors learned that wage and price inflation in the

first quarter remained well contained. In that context, they seemed to play down other data

suggesting that the economy retained considerable momentum and that the margin of unused

resources was slim. Most recently, heightened turmoil in Asian economies augmented the

1. At the start of the current maintenance period, the assumption for excess reserves was lowered
$200 million, to $1.2 billion, in response to this apparent downshift.

demand for dollar assets, raising the foreign exchange value of the dollar and trimming

interest rates. Judging from futures rates, market participants are currently putting little

weight on the possibility of policy tightening over coming months. With reported inflation a

touch lower and survey measures of inflation expectations continuing to decline, real short

rates appear to have extended their gradual upcreep. Real rates at longer maturities seem to

have firmed, too: While the illiquidity of the indexed debt market makes inference about

underlying real rates problematic, the yields on inflation-indexed debt rose somewhat further,

on net, over the intermeeting period. The advance in the real federal funds rate may be one

factor behind increases of 1/4 percentage point or more in rates on inflation-indexed debt

since last fall. Indeed, the downward tilt to the term structure of indexed yields--which has

become more pronounced in recent months--could be read as indicating that market

participants believe that real short rates will eventually reverse some of that increase. Higher

real rates and soft earnings reports, however, did not prove to be much of a check on equity

prices on balance, as major indexes gained from 1-1/2 to 3-3/4 percent.

(3) Since the March FOMC meeting, the trade-weighted exchange value of the

dollar relative to major currencies is little changed on balance. The dollar has depreciated

about 3-1/2 percent relative to the mark and other continental European currencies, while

appreciating from 1-1/2 to 3 percent against the yen, the Canadian dollar, and sterling. Over the

intermeeting period, signs of strong German economic growth and significant progress in

settling outstanding issues necessary for next year's launch of the euro contributed to the

mark's rise. German interest rates are up a little over the intermeeting period. The

depreciation of the yen against the dollar has occurred against the backdrop of continued



-3-

indications of weak economic activity in Japan, very accommodative monetary conditions,

and considerable declines in short- and long-term yields. Following the release of the details

of Japan's latest fiscal stimulus package on April 9, Japanese authorities sold dollars for yen

on a massive scale. The effects of the intervention, amounting to more than $20 billion over

two days, were short-lived; the dollar immediately depreciated 3 percent but recouped these

losses within ten days.

The

Desk did not intervene in the foreign exchange market for U.S. accounts.

(4) Other Asian financial markets have come under renewed pressure after two

months of relative calm. Although Indonesian and IMF officials reached an agreement that

accelerated reform measures and allowed for a resumption of IMF payments in early April,

subsequent social unrest has triggered a 20 percent fall in the rupiah against the dollar over

the intermeeting period. Labor unrest in Korea has also emerged as unemployment continues

to rise and a number of chaebols have announced restructuring plans that are expected to

generate significant layoffs. With the exception of the rupiah, currencies in the region have

been relatively stable since the last FOMC meeting, though achieving that stability has taken

substantial increases in market interest rates in some cases. Equity prices in emerging Asian

economies have fallen as much as 25 percent over the intermeeting period. Renewed

difficulties in Asia have not prompted substantial declines in the prices on financial markets

of emerging economies elsewhere, although spreads on Latin American and Eastern European

debt have moved a bit higher and their equity markets are generally lower.



-4-

(5) Growth of the monetary aggregates has been whipsawed by special factors of

late. M2 expanded at a 9-1/2 percent clip in April, but is falling early this month. Households

evidently built up their deposits in late March and early April to meet unusually heavy

nonwithheld tax liabilities. As those tax payments have cleared in recent weeks, M2 has run

off. Heavy mortgage prepayments, as households took advantage of lower longer-term yields

to refinance, provided an additional spur to M2 in April, as they had in March, but, with

mortgage refinancings leveling out, their effect on money growth is estimated to be waning in

May. Averaging the performance of M2 in April with the projection for May, which should

leave virtually no net imprint of tax effects, suggests that its growth has downshifted

substantially this quarter relative to its rapid first-quarter pace, about in line with staff

expectations. M3 also appears to be moderating in April and May as a whole relative to

earlier in the year; not only has M2 growth slowed, but spectacular growth in institution-only

money funds has been offset somewhat by a runoff in large time deposits. Commercial banks

evidently have needed to raise a smaller volume of funds in the market of late, given the

heavy influx of nonwithheld tax receipts into Treasury deposits, as well as the apparent

slowing in bank credit expansion, on average, over the past two months.

(6) While businesses have continued to tap the bond market in volume of late,

some of the proceeds have been used to pay down bank loans and commercial paper, so that

their total borrowing appears to have receded from its rapid first-quarter pace. In contrast,

household borrowing likely has remained fairly robust, as mortgage debt expansion appears to

have maintained the strong pace of the past half year, no doubt reflecting the considerable

vigor of the housing market. In recent weeks, quality spreads on marketable business debt



-5-

instruments have widened slightly, albeit from very low levels, as issuance has been brisk.

Commercial banks, however, have reported in the most recent senior loan officer survey that

business lending spreads, particularly for larger firms, have been narrowed further. With state

and local governments continuing to issue debt aggressively, in part to fund new capital

projects, the debt of nonfederal sectors has grown at about an 8 percent rate in recent months.

However, robust tax inflows have allowed the Treasury to pay down federal debt, even on a

seasonally adjusted basis, holding total debt growth to around 6 percent over March and

April.

Policy Alternatives

(7) In light of incoming data indicating robust domestic demand, the Greenbook

projection for real GDP growth over the first half of this year has been strengthened

appreciably. Output growth, as before, is projected to slow after the middle of this year, to a

little less than the pace of its potential, assuming an unchanged nominal funds rate. With the

drag from net exports expected to have peaked in the first quarter, the slowdown in GDP

growth reflects the restraint associated with a drop in inventory investment and, partly as a

result of associated multiplier effects, a cooling of domestic final demand. The latter reflects

the scaling back of purchases of consumer durables and business capital owing partly to the

earlier buildup in their stocks relative to income and production, the waning effects of prior

interest rate declines, and the projected softening in equity prices. However, the path of the

unemployment rate, while rising, has been revised down a tad over the forecast period. Even

so, the outlook for inflation is little changed; we continue to predict that the measured

increase in the core CPI will stay reasonably stable, averaging near a 2-1/4 percent rate through

the end of next year. Further technical corrections will help to hold down published inflation,

but a number of economic forces are also at work: Non-oil import prices are projected to

continue to decline, though at a diminishing rate, capacity utilization is seen as easing

noticeably, the rate of increase in unit labor costs is projected to slip back next year to below

a 2 percent pace, and inflation expectations should continue to edge lower.

(8) If the Committee views the Greenbook forecast as both likely and acceptable, it

might be inclined to maintain its current 5-1/2 percent intended federal funds rate, as under

alternative B. Although that forecast has an underlying upward tilt to inflation in 1999 as



-8-

labor markets remain quite tight, that tilt is gradual and starts from a lower inflation rate in

1998 than the Committee had anticipated only a few months ago, judging from the central

tendencies of members' CPI projections in February.2 Even if the Committee were troubled

by the underlying uptrend of inflation in the staff forecast, it might still be willing to adopt

the unchanged federal funds rate of alternative B. The vulnerable state of many financial

markets in Asia, which could react adversely to an increase in U.S. interest rates, might weigh

against action at this time. When the Committee's directive tilt was disclosed prematurely in

late April, interest rates in those markets rose along with dollar interest rates, indeed by

somewhat more than those here. In addition, the Committee may feel that a small uptick in

underlying inflation, should it unfold as in the staff forecast, would generate only minimal

costs in potential resource distortions and could be readily countered in the future. If so, the

Committee may be willing to accept the significant probability of such an uptick through

1999 because recent experience has led it to place greater weight on the possibility that the

economy will prove able to sustain the high operating rate built into the staff forecast without

a rise in underlying inflation.

(9) In that regard, maintaining the current stance of policy might simply be based

on the high degree of uncertainty about the inflation outlook. The persistent underpredictions

of real output growth and employment and overpredictions of inflation that have confronted

policymakers and forecasters alike have been symptomatic of several factors on the supply

side of the economy. Some of these factors are likely to be temporary but others may reflect

2. The staff CPI projection for 1998 of 1.6 percent is below the Committee members' 1-3/4 to 2-
1/4 percent central tendency range in February.



-9-

ongoing structural shifts in the economy that permanently raise the path of potential output.

Forecasters have not been very successful in either anticipating these forces or sorting out the

extent to which their effects will be transitory, suggesting, perhaps, that less weight should be

placed on such forecasts at present in the making of policy. Even though unemployment has

fallen to a historically low rate, the point at which inflation will actually start to rise remains

sufficiently uncertain that the appropriate policy posture may be to keep standing pat and

allowing the economy's momentum to continue until clearer evidence of mounting

inflationary pressures begins to surface. At that point, policy might need to respond quickly

and vigorously, but the process of accelerating prices is likely to unfold gradually enough that

such a reaction has a good chance of being successful in keeping inflation subdued. Until

that point, however, the economy can continue to reap the benefits of greater employment and

production than previously thought sustainable without inflationary side effects.

(10) Market participants seem to have incorporated virtually no odds of policy

action at the May FOMC meeting, so a decision to keep the intended federal funds rate

unchanged should elicit little immediate reaction in financial markets. Moreover, market

participants appear to be anticipating economic events over the intermeeting period along the

lines of the Greenbook forecast, so market interest rates should vary around current quotes.

The exchange value of the dollar against major currencies also is not expected to break out of

its recent trading range.

(11) The Committee instead may prefer to raise its intended federal funds rate by 25

basis points at the May meeting, as under alternative C. The Committee was concerned

about the inflation outlook at its last meeting, and in some respects that outlook may have



- 10-

worsened. In particular, the unemployment rate may be seen as having now fallen so low

that, even if it were to edge up a little, as it does with the slowing of real growth in the staff

forecast, the risks of burgeoning inflationary pressures have become unacceptably high.

Although the first-quarter ECI increase was less than expected, total compensation, its wage

component, and average hourly earnings have all been on an accelerating trend for some time.

With the unemployment rate likely to remain far below any plausible estimate of its

sustainable level, nominal compensation gains may well continue to mount, in contrast to the

staff forecast. If so, expansion of labor compensation would increasingly exceed even

optimistic views of a step-up in productivity growth. Moreover, the slowdown in output

growth in the staff forecast is by no means a foregone conclusion, absent a tighter monetary

policy stance. The effects of Asian woes on net exports may not of themselves be a

sufficient offset to buoyant domestic final demand at current levels of short-term interest

rates. Although real interest rates are high relative to historical norms, medium- and long-

term real rates still may not be elevated enough at present to exert adequate restraint on

spending for consumer durables, housing, and business fixed investment in light of optimistic

"animal spirits" and rising equity prices. Even if the Committee were not dissatisfied with

the likely intermediate-term economic outlook, it might see the possibility that an equity price

bubble was building as representing a sufficient threat in the more distant future to the health

of the economy and the financial system to warrant consideration of tightening policy. The

appendix provides additional perspective on the potential role of equity prices in monetary

policy decisions.



- 11 -

(12) In any event, part of the transmission of policy restraint to spending may work

through a correction in equity markets. Whether an increase in the funds rate of only 1/4 point

would be enough to leave a lasting imprint on stock prices is not clear. To the extent that the

unexpected monetary tightening were interpreted by market participants as suggesting

heightened inflation concerns of the Committee, and, hence, as only the first of a number of

upward steps, it could induce a significant backup in bond yields. In that case, stock prices

might register substantial declines, reflecting both a less favorable outlook for corporate

earnings and a higher discount rate applied to those earnings. Alternatively, were the

tightening seen as an isolated "mid-course correction" in response to a modest shift in

inflation risks, the reaction in bond and equity markets would be muted. Absent a substantial

downdraft in the prices of U.S. financial assets, the value of the dollar would tend to firm on

exchange markets. Although a tightening of U.S. monetary policy at this time might have

negative impacts on financial conditions in Asian, and perhaps other, emerging market

economies, the Committee would need to weigh those effects against the possibility that delay

would necessitate more substantial actions later.

(13) Under the stable money market conditions of alternative B, the staffs projected

2-1/2 percentage point moderation in the pace of nominal GDP from the first to the third quarter

of this year should be associated with a noticeable slowdown in the expansion of the debt and

monetary aggregates. Household borrowing should slow along with spending on consumer

durables and houses, and business demand for credit should subside as inventory investment

downshifts substantially. Still, the debt of both sectors is expected to exceed the expansion of

income, with the upturn in debt-servicing burdens held down by recent and continuing



-12-

refinancing of outstanding higher-cost obligations. While slower economic growth and

narrower profit margins may make lenders a little more cautious, a significant restriction in

credit availability does not appear likely, given the healthy financial condition of both

borrowers and lenders. In the federal sector, outstanding debt should run off, even on a

seasonally adjusted basis, reflecting the government's widening budget surplus. From April to

September, the growth of domestic nonfinancial debt is foreseen as slowing to a 4-1/2 percent

annual rate, bringing its average advance from the fourth quarter to 5-1/2 percent, somewhat

above the midpoint of its annual range.

(14) Under alternative B, M2 growth is expected to slow significantly to a 3 percent

average rate over the April-to-September period, with a little more than 1 percentage point of

the slowdown from the first four months of 1998 representing the projected unwinding of the

previous artificial boost related to special tax and mortgage-refinancing factors. Even so, over

the second and third quarters, M2 growth averaging 5 percent on a quarterly average basis is

projected to exceed the 4 percent average rate of nominal GDP expansion, implying a further

1 percent rate of decline in M2's velocity. From the fourth quarter through September,

implied M2 growth would be at a 5-3/4 percent rate. Looking a little further out, the staff now

envisions growth of this aggregate for the year at a 5-1/2 percent rate, putting it above the 1 to

5 percent annual range judged by the FOMC to be consistent with conditions of price stability

and stable velocity behavior; this projection embodies a 1 percent decline in velocity in 1998.

(15) Projected M3 growth under alternative B would dip to a 5-1/2 percent rate from

April through September, reflecting some expected reduction in the growth of depository

funding needs associated with the anticipated marked slowing in depository credit expansion



- 13 -

over that interval. The rapid rate of securities acquisitions of late 1997 and earlier this year,

which appeared to be related to some large banks' efforts to increase leverage, is expected to

slow. The pace of lending, too, is likely to remain below that of the first four months of the

year as credit demands moderate. From the fourth quarter through September, M3 is seen as

advancing at an 8-1/2 percent annual rate, and for the year as a whole at 8-1/4 percent, well above

the upper bound of its 2 to 6 percent annual range.

Appendix: Equity Prices and Monetary Policy

(17) The capital appreciation on major equity markets of late has pushed prices

further beyond the predictions of conventional models of equity-price fundamentals. Rising

share values, even as the outlook for earnings has become less ebullient, have increased the

odds that an asset-price bubble is inflating. This possibility has drawn considerable attention

to the question of how the Committee should factor equity market developments into its

policy deliberations. In the standard formulation of monetary policy, equity prices are

important for what they imply about future spending and inflation, not for their own sake.

Indeed, they have the same status as any of the other critical determinants of spending,

production, and inflation--such as the foreign exchange value of the dollar, the federal budget

position, and foreign economic activity. In that regard, high and rising equity prices--

particularly if they were accompanied by a general increase in the value of other long-lived

assets--might signal excessive liquidity, accommodative financial conditions, and a penchant

for speculation on price increases, presaging the buildup of strains on resources. Presumably,

though, such effects are embodied in the Committee's outlook for output and inflation and

would warrant a policy response only to the extent that they threatened the achievement of its

macroeconomic goals.

(18) The case for altering the course of policy in response to equity price

movements beyond what would be called for on the basis of their contribution to current and

future pressures on resources would seem to rest on one or both of two considerations. For

one, the Committee might be concerned that the inflating of an asset bubble implied a

significant misallocation of resources that would prevent the economy from producing most



- 17 -

efficiently. In an environment of ready capital gains, households might be consuming and

building up debt on the basis of ephemeral additions to wealth, and firms might be adding to

capacity because the inflated market values of their existing capital were high relative to

replacement costs. These purchases of durable goods, to the extent that they were viewed

with regret once equity prices fell back into their proper alignment, would also have the

potential to amplify cyclical swings in economic activity.

(19) As another possibility, although the Committee might be satisfied that the most

likely path for equity prices was consistent with its macroeconomic objectives, it might also

feel that there was a significant risk of substantially faster asset inflation that would sow the

seeds of problems when it corrected. In particular, absent effective efforts to prick the

bubble, once begun, an asset inflation might continue on its own momentum, and the relative

price misalignment become increasingly severe. The resulting threat of a large price decline

when the bubble bursts may be troubling because of concerns about systemic risk to the

financial system, knock-on effects on spending and confidence, and the risk of subsequent

undershooting of equity prices.

(20) By tightening monetary policy beyond that expected to be required to achieve

desired macroeconomic outcomes, the Committee would be tolerating some straying in the

intermediate term from the fundamental goals of maximum employment and stability of the

prices of goods and services in order to lessen the risks of systemic problems or severe

macroeconomic dislocations. Such action requires both that the Committee believes that it

has a more accurate view of fundamentals than the market and that it doubts that market

forces will discover and correct the imbalance in a timely fashion. Given the complex



- 18 -

interaction of equity price determination and short-term interest rates, the Committee would

need to be mindful of the high degree of uncertainty surrounding the extent of monetary

policy action ultimately required to burst the bubble without causing significant undershooting

of equity prices. Moreover, the Committee would need to make the judgement that standard

regulatory and supervisory practices, discount window lending, and post-crash provision of

liquidity and easing of monetary policy might be insufficient to prevent systemic problems or

severe macroeconomic disturbances should the bubble be allowed to inflate for now only to

burst at a later date.
