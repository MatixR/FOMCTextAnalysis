Prefatory Note 

 
 

The attached document represents the most complete and accurate version 
available based on original copies culled from the files of the FOMC Secretariat at the 
Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System.  This electronic document was 
created through a comprehensive digitization process which included identifying the best-
preserved paper copies, scanning those copies,1 and then making the scanned versions 
text-searchable.2  Though a stringent quality assurance process was employed, some 
imperfections may remain. 
 

Please note that this document may contain occasional gaps in the text.  These 
gaps are the result of a redaction process that removed information obtained on a 
confidential basis.  All redacted passages are exempt from disclosure under applicable 
provisions of the Freedom of Information Act.    

 

                                                 
1 In some cases, original copies needed to be photocopied before being scanned into electronic format.  All 
scanned images were deskewed (to remove the effects of printer- and scanner-introduced tilting) and lightly 
cleaned (to remove dark spots caused by staple holes, hole punches, and other blemishes caused after initial 
printing). 
2 A two-step process was used.  An advanced optimal character recognition computer program (OCR) first 
created electronic text from the document image.  Where the OCR results were inconclusive, staff checked 
and corrected the text as necessary.   Please note that the numbers and text in charts and tables were not 
reliably recognized by the OCR process and were not checked or corrected by staff.

MONETARY POLICY ALTERNATIVES

Recent developments

(1) M1-B, adjusted for shifts into NOW accounts, expanded in

October at a 3¾ percent annual rate--about half the pace of the Committee's

September to December target. With expansion in the narrow money aggre-

gate remaining weak, year-to-date growth in adjusted M1-B has been only

at a 1 percent annual rate, continuing well below the lower limit of the

Committee's 3 to 6 percent longer-run range. M2 growth picked up to a 9¼

percent annual rate in October,1/ putting this aggregate just at the upper

end of the Committee's 6 to 9 percent longer-run range. (Recent monetary

and reserves data are shown in the table on the next page).

(2) Bank credit expansion slowed in October to an 8 percent

annual rate, reflecting in part moderation in business loan growth. With

bank credit growth weaker, large time deposits contracted in October,

slowing M3 growth to a 6½ percent annual rate. Nevertheless, year-to-date

expansion in M3 remains 1 percentage points above the upper end of the

Committee's longer-run range for this aggregate.

(3) Growth in nonborrowed reserves slowed markedly in October,

largely reflecting reductions in required reserves behind deposits not

included in M1 and M2, such as large time and interbank deposits. With

borrowing declining markedly further, total reserves contracted at a 9

1/ The staff estimates that shifts from non-M2 assets into ASCs increased
the measured rate of growth of M2 in October by about 2 percentage
points, of which a little over 1 percentage point represented shifts
from retail RPs and a little under 1 percentage point shifts from

other non-M2 assets. On a monthly average basis, ASCs in October are
estimated to have increased by nearly $22 billion. The staff esti-
mates that about $3 billion came from non-M2 assets, such as retail
RPs and market securities.

percent annual rate. The monetary base was essentially unchanged as currency

expansion about offset the decline in total reserves. Given the weakness

in money growth and associated required reserves, adjustment borrowing

generally remained below the $850 million assumed in the initial reserves

path. In the current statement week borrowing is expected to average around

$400 million, partly reflecting an upward adjustment in the nonborrowed

reserves path to help counter the evolving weakness in M1-B and total

1/
reserves.- The lower level of borrowing--and reductions of 1 percentage

point in both the discount and surcharge rates--was associated with a

further easing in the federal funds rate to the 13 to 14 percent area,

from around 15½ percent at the time of the October meeting.

(4) In response to the easing in bank reserve positions and a

further slackening in economic activity, other short-term market interest

rates have declined about 2½ to 3 percentage points since the last meeting,

bringing them under the earlier lows for the year (reached in late winter).

The bank prime rate was lowered by 2 percentage points to 17 percent, with

a few banks currently at 16½ percent. Bond yields approached record levels

in October, as market participants focused on the current and prospective

amount of Treasury borrowing and on disappointing consumer price data.

More recently, bond yields have fallen as much as 2 percentage points in

reaction to further evidence of weakness in economic activity and the

reduced pressures in the money market. However, bond yields still remain

about 1½ percentage points above earlier lows for the year. Primary mort-

gage rates have eased a bit from their historic highs. The Treasury

raised about $4 billion of new money in its recently completed three-part

meeting period.



mid-quarter refunding, bringing to nearly $18 billion the amount raised

thus far in the quarter. Over the next seven weeks, the Treasury will

have to raise another $18 billion. Sponsored agency financing has

slowed recently from the advanced pace in the third quarter, due mainly

to reduced borrowing by the FHLBs. Corporate bond offerings continued

moderate in October, but the decline in bond yields has induced a sub-

stantial pick-up in offerings this month.

(5) Since the October meeting, the dollar has fluctuated rather

widely in exchange markets. On balance, the dollar has declined only

slightly on a weighted average basis, despite the considerable drop in

short-term rates here relative to those abroad.



Prospective Developments

(6) The upper panel of the table below presents three alternative

specifications for the monetary aggregates for the current quarter, while

implied growth rates for the last two months of the year are shown in the

second panel. Possible ranges for the intermeeting federal funds rate are

indicated in the last line of the table. (More detailed data on these

and other aggregates, including implied growth rates for the year 1981, may

be found on the following two pages, and charts indicating the relationship

of the alternative targets to the Committee's existing longer-run ranges

for 1981 may be found on the next three pages.)

(7) Alternative A maintains the September to December target

for M1-B adopted by the Committee at its last meeting, while alternatives

B and C reduce that target by one and two percentage points, respectively.

All of the alternatives would imply faster M1-B growth over the two month

October to December period than has occurred in any two-month period since

last spring. Still, all would imply growth in M1-B over the year 1981

below the lower-end of the Committee's longer-run range. Growth in M2 for

the year may be a little over the upper limit of its 6 to 9 percent annual

range under any of the alternatives, but at this point growth seems unlikely

to be much more than at a 9¼ percent rate.1/

(8) While the sharp decline in short-term interest rates since

mid-summer should tend to stimulate growth of M1-B, the stimulative effect

may in practice be offset, at least in part, by any continued downward

shift in money demand relative to GNP and interest rates. Such a downward

shift was quite marked over the first three quarters of the year, at least

as judged from the money demand equation in the Board's quarterly model.

Moreover, transactions demand for money in the latter part of the year

may be relatively weak in any event if the significant contraction in

economic activity now projected by the staff for the fourth quarter develops--

with real GNP projected to decline at a 4¾ percent annual rate and nominal

GNP to rise at no more than a 5 percent annual rate. Thus, unless the

downward shift in money demand halts, or is reversed, the odds are that

the proposed alternatives, particularly alternatives A and B, may involve

further downward pressures on short-term interest rates.

(9) Alternative A--which calls for maintaining the Committee's

7 percent growth rate target for M1-B for the last three months of the

1/ The introduction of International Banking Facilities in early December
might have a temporary downward impact on M1-B to the extent that

foreign IPC demand deposits are shifted to 2-day notice accounts in

IBFs. Such shifts are expected to be small, however; they may have
some impact on annual growth rates for the month of December, but
would probably have no significant effect on growth for the year.

The great bulk of the money shifted into IBFs will be from large time

deposits or other interest-bearing liabilities, so that the principal

impact potentially would be on M3.

year--would entail growth in total reserves at a 7½ percent annual rate

1/
over the last two months of the year- and may involve a drop in the funds

rate over the next few weeks to the 9 to 10 percent area. Under such

conditions other short-term interest rates would of course also decline

substantially, with the 3-month bill rate perhaps falling to around the 9

percent area. Such declines would occur against a back-drop of continued

sizable Treasury cash borrowings over the balance of the year ($13 billion

in the bill market and $6 billion in the coupon market) but reduced short-

term credit demands by businesses, as their financing gap narrows, largely

in reflection of reduced inventory accumulation, and as credit demands

are shifted to longer-term markets.

(10) A further sharp decline in short-term interest rates, should

it develop, would be transmitted to bond markets, leading to continuation

of the recent rally. If such a decline in short rates were interpreted as

reflecting a weakening in the System's resolve to combat inflation, the

drop in bond yields would tend to be limited. Given the current weak

economic outlook, however, high-grade corporate bond yields could drop

into the 14 to 15 percent area which may well induce substantial corporate

bond offerings to refund sizable short-term debts at banks and in the

commercial paper market. Tax-exempt offerings, which have been better

sustained than corporate offerings, are also likely to rise as previously

postponed issues re-enter the market. Mortgage rates, while stickier than

bond yields, could also be expected to decline as thrift deposit costs

moderate and deposit flows pick up. Improvement in mortgage market

conditions, and in thrift mortgage commitments, may lag somewhat more than

usual, however, because of uncertainties about the permanence of any

substantial decline in short-term market rates. M2 would tend to strengthen

from shifts out of market securities into deposits and also from shifting by

institutional investors to MMMFs in order to take advantage of the usual lag

in money fund yields.

(11) A further considerable decline in short-term interest rates

might lead to a marked weakening of the dollar on exchange markets. How-

ever, any tendency for the dollar to fall substantially on exchange markets

could be limited in the degree that declining interest rates here and/or

the tendency for foreign currencies to appreciate leads foreign authorities

to ease their monetary policies, given continued weak economic performance

abroad.

(12) The more rapidly short-term interest rates decline over

the weeks ahead, the greater the odds that rates will rebound in early

1982, given the monetary targets for next year that the Committee has

tentatively set, with the degree of rebound, if any, depending in part

on the underlying resilience of the economy. Alternatives B and C, which

involve reducing the Committee's fourth quarter target for M1-B set at

the last meeting, would tend to limit downward pressures on interest rates

between now and year-end and possibly work toward a smoother transition

to targets for 1982. Because it is so late in 1981, the impact on annual

growth of the aggregates this year from adoption of either of these

alternatives rather than continuing with alternative A would be relatively

small, as may be noted from the detailed tables on pp. 6 and 7.



-11-

(13) Alternative B would require expansion in total reserves

at a 6 percent annual rate over the last two months of the year, while

growth in reserves under alternative C would be at a 4½ percent annual

rate. The staff believes short-term rate declines under alternative B

could carry the funds rate into the 10 to 12 percent range. The aggre-

gates specifications of alternative C are likely to be associated with a

funds rate in a 12 to 14 percent range, implying the that the funds rate

could drop below the current discount rate.

(14) Declines in market interest rates, both short- and long-term,

generally would be more modest under alternatives B and C than under alter-

native A, and potential downward pressure on the dollar in exchange markets

would be reduced. Under B, Treasury bill rates would still likely reach

levels which, if sustained, would make thrift institutions generally pro-

fitable. Under alternative C, that might also develop, but it would be

less certain as the weight of Treasury financings and possible market

disappointment about the likely course of the funds rate (and hence of

dealer financing costs) would work to hold bill and other short-term

rates up. Thus, under C an easing in mortgage market conditions would be

relatively more delayed, both because of institutional uncertainty about

positive earnings and because long-term market rates may remain higher

than otherwise.

(15) The possibility of the funds rate dropping significantly

below the current 13 percent discount rate introduces complications in the

design of reserve paths, particularly for alternatives A and B. The

complications arise if reserve paths do not involve sufficient levels

of borrowing at the discount window to permit weakness in demands for

money (and for required reserves) to be cushioned by commensurate declines

in borrowings. The funds rate could then be subject to sharp downward



-12-

pressures as the reserves provided led to sizable excess reserves. An

initial borrowing level around the $400 million expected in the current

statement week would provide some borrowing cushion. Frictional levels

of borrowing that would provide virtually no cushion appear to be in the

$50 to $150 million range. The nonborrowed reserve path for alternative C,

the alternative involving the least expansion in reserves, might be initially

constructed on the basis of $400 million in borrowing. The more

reserve expansion of alternatives A and B logically should be based

on lower levels of borrowing, but whether set at frictional levels or

higher, we would expect the demand for reserves soon to fall well short

of supply. In such cases, to avoid an undue build-up in excess reserves,

adjustments in the nonborrowed reserve path might need to be considered

in conjunction with discount rate strategy.

Directive language

(16) Given below is a suggested operational paragraph for the

directive. The specifications adopted at the meeting on October 5-6 are

shown in strike-through form.

In the short run the Committee seeks behavior of reserve

aggregates consistent with growth of M1-B from September to December

at an annual rate of [DEL: 7] ____ percent after allowance for the impact

of flows into NOW accounts and with growth in M2 at an annual rate

around [DEL: 10] ____ percent [DEL: or slightly higher, recognizing that the

behavior of M2 will be affected-by-recent-regulatory-and-legislative

changes, particularly the public's response to the availability of

the all savers certificate]. The Chairman may call for Committee

consultation if it appears to the Manager for Domestic Operations

that pursuit of the monetary objectives and related reserve paths

during the period before the next meeting is likely to be associated

with a federal funds rate persistently outside a range of [DEL: 12 to 17]

____ TO ____ percent.

NOTE: Government securities dealer cash positions consist of securities already delivered, commit-
ments to buy (sell) securities on an outright basis for immediate delivery (5 business days or less), and
certain "when-issued" securities for delayed delivery (more than 5 business days). Futures and forward
positions include all other commitments involving delayed delivery; futures contracts are arranged on
organized exchanges. Underwriting syndicate positions consists of issues in syndicate, excluding
trading positions.

Weekly data are daily averages for statement weeks, except for corporate and municipal issues in
syndicate, which are Friday figures. Monthly averages for excess reserves and borrowing are weighted
averages of statement week figures. Monthly data for dealer futures and forwards are end-of-month
figures for 1980.
