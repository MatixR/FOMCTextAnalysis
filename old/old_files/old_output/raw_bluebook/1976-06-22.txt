Recent Developments

(1) Growth in M1 slowed to a 6 per cent annual rate in May--

following April's exceptionally rapid advance--and appears to be

moderating somewhat further in June. Thus, for the May-June period,

M1 expansion is now projected at around a 5½ per cent annual rate, just

below the mid-point of the Committee's range. M2 is projected to expand

at around an 8¾ per cent rate during May and June, also well below its

pace in April, but near the upper bound of the Committee's range. Growth

in the time deposit component of M2 has been somewhat greater than expected

in recent weeks, despite a marked diminution of inflows to savings

deposits, as market rates moved above the ceiling rate on passbook savings.

Inflows of funds to nonbank thrift institutions were well maintained in

May.

(2) Following the May 18 FOMC meeting, the Desk promptly became

somewhat less accommodative in the provision of reserves and sought a

Federal funds rate around 5-3/8 per cent, a shade above the then prevail-

ing 5-1/4 per cent and equal to the mid-point of the 5 to 5-3/4 per cent

range newly adopted by the Committee. When incoming data during the latter

part of May suggested that May-June growth in both M1 and M2 would be near

the upper ends of the Committee's ranges, the Desk raised its funds rate

objective to 5-1/2 per cent. Subsequent data tended to confirm this projec-

tion of M2 growth, but indicated that M1 growth might be weaker than earlier

believed. Under the circumstances, the Desk has continued to seek a Federal

funds rate averaging about 5-1/2 per cent.

(3) Nonborrowed reserves in the May-June period appear to be

increasing at about a 3-1/2 per cent annual rate, on average, rather than

decreasing slightly as the staff had thought would be consistent with the

short-run ranges for the monetary aggregates adopted by the FOMC at its

last meeting.1/ Since the banking system held more free reserves (excess

reserves minus borrowings) than anticipated, this growth rate did not support

more monetary expansion than expected. With Federal funds generally trading

around the 5-1/2 per cent discount rate, member bank borrowing did nonethe-

less increase and averaged about $125 million in the interval between Com-

mittee meetings, as compared with about $50 million in the preceding two months.

1/ A discussion of the actual behavior of nonborrowed reserves in the weeks
between meetings relative to the behavior that was expected to be con-
sistent with the Committee's short-run targets for monetary growth may
be found in Appendix A.



(4) Since the May FOMC meeting, private short-term interest

rates have generally increased 1/4 to 1/2 of a percentage point, on balance,

while Treasury bill rates have changed little. Most of the increase in

private rates occurred in late May and early June, as the Federal funds

rate rose. When the funds rate subsequently stabilized around the 5-1/2

per cent level, and published data indicated a substantial slowdown of

growth in M1 the upward movement of rates stopped. The spread between

private short-term rates and Treasury bill rates widened, in part reflect-

ing some firming in business demands for short-term credit while the Trea-

sury continued to redeem maturing bills in its weekly auction. The volume

of commercial paper increased modestly further in May. Business loans at

banks also rose a little over this period, and banks-perhaps expecting a

further increase in business loans and rising interest rates--have increased

their outstanding CD's.

(5) Bond yields continued to move higher in late May, but

declined in June as short-term markets stabilized, and on balance were

down a little over the intermeeting period. The bond markets have absorbed

a substantial volume of new corporate and municipal issues in recent weeks.

Treasury borrowing activity over the period was less heavy than had pre-

viously been projected by the Treasury--reflecting an unexpected shortfall

in outlays--but was still on the large side for the period of the year.

Although yields in the secondary mortgage market have moved in sympathy

with bond market rates, rates in the primary market for home loans have

continued to edge upward in the past few weeks. Net acquisitions of



-4-

mortgages by savings and loan associations remained at a relatively high

level in April, and loan commitments increased to their highest level in

3 years.

(6) The table on the following page shows (in percentage annual

rates of change) related monetary and financial flows over various time

periods.

Prospective developments

(7) Three alternative sets of short-run specifications for

the monetary aggregates and the Federal funds rate are summarized below

for Committee consideration. (More detailed data, as well as longer-run

growth rates, are shown in the tables on pp. 6a and 6b, while reserve

aggregates believed to be consistent with these specifications are presented

in appendix Table I.)

M2  7-11 6½-10½ 5½-9½

Federal funds rate 4½-5½ 5-6 5½-6½
(intermeeting range)

(8) If the Federal funds rate between now and the next meeting

of the Committee remains around the recently prevailing 5½ per cent--the

mid-point of the alternative B range--the staff would expect that the annual

rate of M1 growth may be in a 4-8 per cent range over the June-July period.

In light of the data already reported for the early part of the month,

growth in June is expected to be around a 5 per cent annual rate. Such a

growth rate may reflect, in part, continued adjustment by cash-holders to

the April bulge in M1 growth. Recently available deposit ownership survey

figures suggest that much of the April increase was in balances of consumers,

who may take a longer time than busineses and other holders to restore their

balances to desired levels. The staff expects M1 growth in July to be at

a somewhat higher rate, in view of the projected rise in nominal GNP.

-7-

(9) Given the prevailing Federal funds rate, time deposits

other than large money market CD's are expected to grow over the next two

months at an annual rate around 10 per cent. With short-term market rates

generally above the 5 per cent passbook rate, interest-sensitive holders,

including businesses and state and local governments, may continue to

reduce holdings of savings deposits. However, this may be offset by further

expansion of ceiling-free time certificates of deposit, including large-

denomination certificates issued by non-money market banks. Thus, for

the June-July period, M2 growth may be in a 6½-10½ per cent annual rate

range under alternative B.

(10) In the near-term, if the money market remains stable,

short- and long-term interest rates are likely to change little. Longer-

term market interest rates could edge down further once the market has

absorbed the very large volume of new corporate and municipal bond offerings

scheduled for June. The Treasury has a very large third-quarter deficit

to finance, but it is expected to end the current fiscal year with a large

cash balance and will probably raise the bulk of the new cash it needs later

this summer.

(11) Over the longer run, the outlook is still for upward

pressures on interest rates, particularly short-term rates. Credit demands

on banks and in short-term markets are expected to strengthen as the year

progresses--with consequent upward pressure on CD and commercial paper

rates. And by early winter the Treasury may have to finance itself



-8-

increasingly outside the banking system, even if some upward adjustment in

Regulation Q ceiling rates has been made by then, as we assume. As may be

seen from appendix Table II, under alternative B the staff would expect a

Federal funds rate of around 8 per cent by early next year, given a growth

rate in M1 from QI '76 to QI '77 of 5¾ per cent.

(12) The specifications of alternative C include a tightening

of the funds rate over the next few weeks to the mid-point of a 5½-6½

per cent range. This would clearly entail further upward adjustments in

market rates, with the 3-month bill rate moving to the 6 per cent area and

the 3-month commercial paper rate rising to perhaps around 6¼-6½ per cent.

However, such a near-term tightening of the money market would tend to

moderate the need for restraint as the year progresses, as compared with

alternative B. The funds rate under alternative C would be expected to

peak at around 7¼ per cent by late this year, again assuming a 5¾ per cent

growth rate in M1 over the QI '76-QI '77 period,

(13) Growth in M1 in the June-July period may be in a 3½-7½

per cent, annual rate, range under alternative C, only a little less than

under alternative B. In the short run, member banks could be expected

to offset the greater constraint on nonborrowed reserves that is specified

under alternative C by increasing their borrowing through the discount

window, as suggested in appendix Table I. Expansion of M2 over the forth-

coming 2-month period might be in a 5½-9½ per cent annual rate range, in

part reflecting reduced inflows to time and savings deposits (other than

money market CD's) as funds are increasingly diverted from such accounts to

higher-yielding market instruments.



-9-

(14) Alternative A assumes an easing in the Federal funds rate

to the mid-point of a 4½-5½ per cent range between now and the next

Committee meeting. Such an easing would encourage more rapid money growth

in the third and fourth quarter than under alternatives B and C. However,

if the FOMC also wished to constrain longer-run M1 growth to 5¼ per cent,

alternative A would entail a more pronounced slowing in the rate of expansion

of M1 in early 1977 and a sharper rise in interest rates in late 1976 and

early 1977 than would the other two alternatives.



-10-

Proposed directive

(15) Given below is a proposed operational paragraph for the

directive if the Committee wishes to continue formulating its instructions

in terms of desired growth in monetary aggregates over the months ahead.

No alternatives are presented for this formulation, in the expectation that

the reference to desired growth will be taken to apply to the longer-term

targets and that at this meeting the Committee will not reconsider those

targets.

"Monetary Aggregates" Proposal

To implement this policy, while taking account of develop-

ments in domestic and international financial markets, the Committee

seeks to achieve bank reserve and money market conditions consistent

with moderate growth in monetary aggregates over the period ahead.

(16) Should the Committee desire to place main emphasis on bank

reserve and money market conditions, the language needed would depend on

the specific conditions sought. Three alternative "money market" direc-

tives intended to correspond to the similarly lettered policy alternatives

are given below.

Alternative "Money Market" Proposals

Alternative A

To implement this policy, while taking account of develop-

ments in domestic and international financial markets, the Committee

seeks to achieve SOMEWHAT EASIER bank reserve and money market condi-

tions [DEL: consistent with moderate growth in monetary aggregates] over the



-11-

period IMMEDIATELY ahead, PROVIDED THAT MONETARY AGGREGATES APPEAR

TO BE GROWING AT ABOUT THE RATES CURRENTLY EXPECTED.

Alternative B

To implement this policy, while taking account of develop-

ments in domestic and international financial markets, the Committee

seeks to [DEL: achieve] MAINTAIN PREVAILING bank reserve and money market

conditions [DEL: consistent with moderate growth in monetary aggregates]

over the period IMMEDIATELY ahead, PROVIDED THAT MONETARY AGGREGATES

APPEAR TO BE GROWING AT ABOUT THE RATES CURRENTLY EXPECTED.

Alternative C

To implement this policy, while taking account of develop-

ments in domestic and international financial markets, the Committee

seeks to achieve SOMEWHAT FIRMER bank reserve and money market condi-

tions [DEL: consistent with moderate growth in monetary aggregates] over the

period IMMEDIATELY ahead, PROVIDED THAT MONETARY AGGREGATES APPEAR TO

BE GROWING AT ABOUT THE RATES CURRENTLY EXPECTED.



Appendix A

Comparison of Actual and "Targeted" Reserves

The table below compares the actual average level of reserves

for the 5 week period ending June 23 with the "targeted" level that had

been thought consistent with the mid-points of the short-run ranges for

the monetary aggregates adopted at the last FOMC meeting.

Actual 1/ "Targeted" Difference

1 (2+3) Nonborrowed reserves 34,023 33,948 75

2 Required reserves 33,952 34,061 -109

3 (4-5) Free reserves 71 -113 184

4 Excess reserves 194 162 32
5 Member bank

borrowing 123 275 -152

6 (1+5) Total reserves 34,146 34,223 -77

7 Currency 80,298 80,460 -162

8 (6+7) Monetary base 114,444 114,683 -239

1/ Includes week of June 23, which is partly estimated.

As can be seen from the table, nonborrowed reserves during the

intermeeting period were $75 million higher than "targeted." Relative

to expectations, these reserves were employed to support more free reserves

in the banking system (line 3) rather than more required reserves (line 2).

Member banks held somewhat more excess reserves than anticipated and did

not borrow as much as had been thought consistent with the "targeted"

reserves and monetary aggregates. At the same time, required reserves were



A-2

about $110 million weaker than expected in the five week period, owing

to weaker than anticipated demand deposits at member banks as well as a

slightly higher multiplier relationship between lagged deposits at member

banks and current required reserves (given changes in the mix of deposits).

With borrowing falling considerably short of "target," total

reserves were smaller than anticipated during the intermeeting period. The

monetary base was even further below "target," as currency in circulation

turned out to be substantially smaller than expected.

Achievement of the nonborrowed "target" during the period by the

Desk would have resulted in a higher Federal funds rate, perhaps around the

upper end of the 5-5¾ per cent range adopted by the FOMC. On the other

hand, if the Desk had attempted to reach "targeted" levels of total reserves

or the monetary base, the funds rate would have been lower than actually

prevailed--and much lower in the case of the monetary base.

**Monthly averages for excess reserves and borrowings are weighted averages of statement week figures.

Government security dealer trading positions are on a commitment basis. Trading positions, which exclude Treasury securities financed by repurchase
agreements maturing in 16 days or more, are indicators of dealer holdings available for sale over the near-term. Underwriting syndicate positions
consist of issues still in syndicate, excluding trading positions. The basic reserve deficit is excess reserves less borrowing at Federal
Reserve less net Federal funds purchases. Weekly data are daily averages for statement weeks, except for corporate and municipal issues in
syndicate which are Friday figures.
