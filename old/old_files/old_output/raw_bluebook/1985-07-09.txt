MONETARY POLICY ALTERNATIVES

Recent Developments

(1) With growth very rapid in May and June, M1 expanded at about

a 13-1/4 percent annual rate over the March-to-June interval, well above the

path for that period of a little over 6 percent adopted at the last FOMC

meeting and bringing the aggregate far above the upper edge of the parallel

band associated with its 1985 growth range. The overall strength in demand

for M1, even as income growth remained moderate, probably has reflected in

some degree the effects of recent interest rate declines. The velocity of

M1 has declined by about 5 percent at an annual rate in both the first and

second quarters, in association with growth in M1 averaging 10-1/2 percent

over the two quarters.

(2) The extent of M1 growth over the past two months has been

much greater than monthly models predict. Strength has been evident

during that period in all major components of M1 and is widespread across

Reserve Districts. However, demand deposits have been particularly strong

for several weeks now. Examination of the data and contacts with banks

do not suggest any clear special factor at work-such as a change in cash

management techniques in response to the E.F. Hutton development or a

much larger rise in compensating balances than would be expected in

response to recent interest rate declines. It may be noted, though, that

the total Teasury balance dropped very sharply from mid-May to mid-June,

perhaps providing some temporary stimulus to demand deposits at the time.

(3) Growth in M2 and M3 picked up further in June to 13-3/4 and

10-3/4 percent annual rates, respectively. The nontransactions component

of M2 strengthened considerably in June as flows into MMDAs and money funds

NOTE: Monthly reserve measures, including excess reserves and borrowing, are
calculated by prorating averages for 2-week reserve maintenance periods
that overlap months.

1. Growth rates of reserve measures are adjusted to remove the effects of discon-
tinuities resulting from phased changes in reserve ratios under the Monetary
Control Act.

2. Includes "other extended credit" from the Federal Reserve, but not special
situation borrowing by thrifts that was part of adjustment plus seasonal
borrowing until reclassified as extended credit.



were sizable in response to relatively favorable yields on these instruments,

whose offering rates, as usual, lagged behind the recent decline in market

rates. Over the three-month period ending in June, M2 and M3 expanded at

annual rates of 7-1/4 and 6 percent-somewhat stronger than anticipated at

the time of the last meeting, and in the case of M2 in line with earlier

expectations at the time of the March meeting. By June, M2 was slightly

above the upper end of its long-run target growth cone and M3 was still well

within its range.

(4) Growth in total domestic nonfinancial debt has slowed from

its first-quarter pace, though second-quarter expansion remains relatively

high at around an 11-3/4 percent annual rate. Both federal and private

sectors contributed to the recent deceleration in debt. Business borrowing

has continued to be boosted by unusually large debt-financed retirements of

corporate equity, which are estimated to account for around one percentage

point of total credit growth thus far this year. Issuance of debt by

state and local governments has been quite heavy as refunding issues have

surged.

(5) Total reserves grew at about a 22 percent annual rate over

May and June, on average, reflecting strength in required reserves against

transaction accounts. The nonborrowed reserve path over the entire inter-

meeting period was constructed assuming $350 million of adjustment plus

seasonal borrowing, abstracting from any borrowing still in the adjustment

category by thrifts in special situations. Excluding special situations,

adjustment plus seasonal borrowing averaged around $510 million over the

past six weeks--fluctuating on a weekly basis between $240 million and $850

million. Throughout the period, excess reserves ran higher than expected,

particularly during the last maintenance period containing the mid-year



statement date, and averaged around $940 million. By mid-June virtually

all special situation borrowing had been reclassified as extended credit,

and total borrowing by privately-insured thrift institutions has dropped

to $330 million most recently from $463 million at the time of the May

FOMC meeting.

(6) Federal funds since the last FOMC meeting have traded

mainly in the 7-1/2 to 7-3/4 percent range reached following the discount

rate cut, although around mid-June the funds rate fell to around 7 percent

and below. Very recently, the funds rate moved above 8 percent for a time

with the approach of the July 4 holiday and an unusually sharp reserve

drain as Treasury balances at Federal Reserve Banks soared on the settlement

date of two new Treasury issues. Other market rates generally varied within

a wide range over the intermeeting period, in response to the ebb and flow

of expectations about the proximity of further cuts in the discount rate,

incoming economic information, and at times unanticipated money supply

developments. On balance, Treasury bill rates are currently around 60

basis points below their levels at the time of the last FOMC meeting, while

commercial paper and CD rates have declined less, as risk premiums widened

somewhat in response to concerns about the health of some financial institu-

tions. The prime rate was reduced from 10 to 9-1/2 percent. In the capital

markets, Treasury and corporate bond yields are down a little more than

1/2 percentage point, and some broad stock price indices reached record

levels; mortgage rates have fallen by about 80 basis points in lagged

response to earlier market gains.

(7) Foreign exchange market conditions have generally been less

volatile since the last FOMC meeting than in earlier periods of the year.

The dollar has declined by about 2-1/2 percent on a weighted average basis,

with trading in a relatively narrow range. Interest differentials among



-5-

major currencies have shown little change since the last Committee meeting.



Long-run targets

(8) Two alternative long-run targets for the monetary and debt

aggregates for 1985, plus the currently established targets, are shown

below. Alternative I differs only with respect to M1. Alternative II

suggests a larger revision for M1, together with small increases in the

upper limits of the M2 and debt ranges. At mid-year, M2 was around its

upper bound and debt was running strong, so that some adjustments of the

ranges for those aggregates might be considered.

Growth Ranges for 1985

Current Alt. I Alt. II

Ml 4 to 7 4 to 8 5 to 9

M2 6 to 9 6 to 9 6 to 9-1/2

M3 6 to 9-1/2 6 to 9-1/2 6 to 9-1/2

Debt 9 to 12 9 to 12 9 to 12-1/2

(9) The table below focuses on the arithmetic of achieving

the upper bounds of the current and proposed M1 long-run growth ranges

for the year 1985, given growth of 10-1/2 percent annual rate over the

first half of 1985 (QIV '84 to QII '85). A particular problem arises

because M1 was so strong in the latter part of the second quarter. This

high jumping off point means that attainment of, say, the 7 percent upper

limit of the current long-run range would entail virtually no month-by-

month growth on average over the balance of the year-as can be seen from

the table, one-half of one percent at an annual rate. However, implied

growth over the second half measured from QII '85 to QIV '85 would be

higher-about 3-1/4 percent annual rate-owing to the carry-over effect

of the acceleration of M1 late in the second quarter. The upper limit

of the alternative II range could be achieved with 5 percent, annual rate,



month-by-month growth, which would yield substantial quarterly average

growth.

Ml Growth rate from Implied M1 Growth
QIV '84 to QIV '85 QII '85-QIV '85 June-December

7 3.3 .5

8 5.3 2.8

9 7.1 5.0

(10) The staff GNP projection for 1985 assumes, given recent

developments, M1 growth above the upper limit of the current range--

increasing 8 to 9 percent for the year--with interest rates showing

little net change over the balance of the year. Growth of M2 and M3

for the year is expected to be within their current long-run ranges,

though well into the upper part for M2, while debt growth may be just

above the upper limit of the range.

(11) The alternatives presented in paragraph (8) above assume

the Committee retains the QIV '84 base for M1. However, as in mid-1983,

the FOMC may wish to contemplate shifting the base to the second quarter

of 1985; relevant economic considerations are discussed in the next

paragraph. Because of the very rapid growth of M1 toward the end of the

spring quarter, the aggregate would still be starting off high relative

to a rebased long-run path. If the Committee chose to retain the existing

4 to 7 percent range, but to shift the base to the second quarter (so

that the range applied to the QII '85-QIV '85 period), the upper limit

could be attained with growth from June-to-December at a 4-3/4 percent,

annual rate, while growth around the mid-point of the range would be

consistent with month-by-month growth averaging 3 percent at an annual

rate. If an 8 percent upper limit were employed in a rebased range,



-8-

June-to-December growth of 6 percent, annual rate, would be consistent

with the upper limit.

(12) The economic argument for shifting the base is similar

to the consideration that prompted the base shift in mid-1983-the

likelihood that the rapid growth of M1 above target was needed to

accommodate to a "permanent" downward shift in the level of velocity and

thus did not entail the need to offset rapid growth by commensurately

lower growth subsequently.1/ Assuming the recent decline in velocity

represents a "permanent" adjustment, it could be appropriate to rebase,

with the new M1 target range designed to be more consistent with the

longer-run trend of velocity (abstracting from interest rate movements)

allowing for a reasonable range of actual velocity variation in light

of emerging economic and financial conditions. The target would also

need to take account of the speed with which the FOMC wishes to move to

decelerate price inflation further and assessment of the prospective

strength of the economy. It would not seem appropriate to rebase, however,

if the Committee felt that the recent burst of M1 growth would contribute

in the period ahead to undesirably strong demand pressures and to acceler-

ating inflation or felt that rebasing would be perceived as signaling

less determination to resist inflation. In those circumstances, it would

be desirable to aim at a greater slowdown of M1 growth than is implied by

rebasing, although one might still wish to consider raising the current

Ml range so as to avoid a deceleration that is unduly abrupt, given the

and implications for monetary targeting are discussed in some detail

1985.



remaining lagged effects on M1 demand that can be expected from the

recent declines in interest rates.

(13) Regarding tentative money and credit targets to be set

for 1986, three alternatives are presented below. Alternative I encom-

passes a 4 to 7 percent range for M1, the same as that currently in place,

and also an unchanged range for M2. The growth range for M3 has an upper

limit that is one-half percent lower than the current one and the credit

range is lower by a full percentage point. Nominal GNP is projected by

the staff to grow about 1/2 percentage point more than this year, but

with no further worsening in the current account deficit expected,

spending and the credit needed to finance it would tend to grow less than

this year. In addition, debt growth should be damped by an abatement of

mergers and other activities associated with greater leveraging by busi-

nesses. Alternative II widens the M1 and M2 ranges to provide added

flexibility in the face of uncertainties such as those described in

paragraphs (14) to (17) below. Alternative III represents a stronger

move in the direction of attaining reasonable price stability.

Growth ranges for 1986

Alt. I Alt. II Alt. III

M1 4 to 7 4 to 8 3-1/2 to 6-1/2

M2 6 to 9 6 to 9-1/2 5-1/2 to 8-1/2

M3 6 to 9 6 to 9 5-1/2 to 8-1/2

Debt 8 to 11 8-1/2 to 11-1/2 7-1/2 to 10-1/2

(14) The staff's GNP projection for next year assumes M1 growth

on the order of 5-1/2 percent and little change in the level of market

interest rates from recent levels. That assumption is encompassed by



-10-

all of the alternatives, with alternative II representing a looser and

alternative III a tighter fit. The Committee's choice of monetary targets

would depend on, among other things, the extent to which it finds the

projected growth of GNP acceptable, the pace at which it wishes to move

toward price stability, and the extent to which it wishes to allow for

uncertainties such as the sustainability of real growth under current

credit and exchange market conditions, the course of fiscal policy, the

behavior of the dollar, and effects of institutional change.

(15) In general, money growth on the high side would likely be

needed if nominal interest rates were, contrary to our expectation, to

notch down further next year. Indeed, even the upper limit of alternative

II may not encompass developments in the event of a substantial downward

adjustment of interest rates, as the experience of 1982-1983 and from late

last year through the first half of this year tends to suggest. Nominal

interest rates could drop if the present level of real interest rates

turns out to be too high, as the expansion matures further, to sustain

real growth at a satisfactory pace (assuming the level of real rates is

not reduced by acceleration of inflation). Nominal rates could also drop

in the event of a further decline of inflation expectations. The evolution

of fiscal policy could also affect interest rates, though perhaps not

substantially given the range of probable fiscal outcomes. In principle,

a move toward greater fiscal restraint than the $50 billion federal deficit

cut in the fiscal year 1986 assumed by the staff should exert greater

downward presure on interest rates, with potential one-time feedback

effects on money demand. On the other hand, a failure to act on the

deficit would exert some upward impact on interest rates and possibly

also inflation expectations.



-11-

(16) The behavior of the dollar on exchange markets is another

area of uncertainty. The GNP outlook assumes a moderate decline, but

a very sharp decline would entail certain fundamental changes in the

underlying economic situation. Upward price pressures would be stronger,

there would be a greater stimulus to domestic output from the declining

dollar, and there would be a risk of worsening inflationary expectations.

Desirable behavior of money under these conditions would depend in part

on other surrounding circumstances. But, in general, keeping money growth

at rates earlier contemplated would involve upward pressure on interest

rates, with real GNP growth sustained over time by the positive impact

on domestic production of the dollar depreciation. The continued restraint

on money growth would work to check tendencies for inflationary expecta-

tions to rise. An increase in money growth might relieve potential

strains in financial markets, and help ensure that economic growth was

not unduly depressed by behavior of interest-sensitive domestic sectors,

but probably at the cost of worsening the long-run inflationary consequences

of a sharp dollar decline. A lessening of money growth would do most to

restrain any inflationary impact of a sharp dollar decline, but would

tend to exacerbate financial strains as added upward pressures were

placed on interest rates and would most risk a weakening, at least in the

short run, of real growth.

(17) The institutional changes known to be in prospect for next

year are the lifting of ceiling rates on regular NOW accounts and savings

deposits on March 31, 1986, and the removal of the present $1,000 minimum

balance restriction on super NOWs and MMDAs on January 1 of that year.

There will undoubtedly be some resulting deposit shifts. However, we do

not at this point expect any significant impact on growth of M1 or M2,



-12-

taking into account experience with reductions in the minimum balance

earlier this year, the availability of ceiling-free checking and savings

accounts in any event for sane time now, and the observation that most

banks currently impose minimum balance requirements above $1,000 on

regular NOW accounts (if fees are to be avoided) and on super NOWs.



-13-

Near-term policy alternatives

(18) The table below gives three alternative specifications

for the monetary aggregates over the June-to-September period along with

associated federal funds rate ranges. (More detailed data, including

growth implied under each alternative for the fourth quarter to September,

can be found on the table and charts on the following pages.)

Alt. A Alt. B Alt. C

Growth from
June to Sept.

M1 7 5-1/2 4
M2 8-1/2 7-1/2 6-1/2
M3 8 7-1/4 6-1/2

Associated federal
funds rate range 5 to 9 6 to 10 7 to 11

(19) Alternative B contemplates a slowing of M1 growth to a

5-1/2 percent annual rate over the June-to-September period, consistent

with seasonal and adjustment borrowing at the discount window at around

the $350 million level used in constructing reserve paths since the last

FOMC meeting. Federal funds would generally trade in a 7-1/2 to 7-3/4

percent area. Growth in total and nonborrowed reserves would slow to 3-1/2

and 5-1/2 percent annual rates respectively over the June-to-September

period as the expansion of transaction deposits moderates.

(20) In part, the slowing of M1 growth under alternative B is

expected to result from a substantial weakening in the demand deposit

component, working off a portion of its recent unusually large bulge.

The rapid growth of M1 late last quarter has brought money balances to a

point where they might be considered to be sufficiently high to finance

at least some significant GNP growth in the third quarter without further

expansion of M1. Indeed, if M1 remained at its June level during the

third quarter, average growth for the quarter would be more than 5-3/4

percent at an annual rate. While this suggests that transactions needs

of the third quarter may have been in some measure already satisfied, M1

growth over the months ahead is likely to be sustained by the continuing

effect on money demand of the recent declines of interest rates, if for no

other reason. On a quarterly average basis, M1 would be expected to

increase at around a 10 percent annual rate, implying another appreciable

decline in velocity of more than 3-3/4 percent at an annual rate given

the Greenbook GNP forecast.

(21) Under alternative B, M1 by September would be about 10

percent at an annual rate above the fourth-quarter 1984 long-run target

base. It would of course be less high relative to a long-run target

rebased to QII '85, with growth from that base to September at an 8-1/2

percent annual rate. M1 expansion would be expected to slow further on a

month-by-month basis in the fourth quarter, to a 3 to 4 percent annual

rate, if reserve market conditions remain essentially unchanged, as the

effects on money demand of recent interest rate declines wear off and

velocity returns to around its expected trend rate of growth (absent

interest rate changes). As a result, M1 by the fourth quarter on average

might be about 8-3/4 percent above its QIV '84 level and 7 percent,

annual rate, above a QII '85 level.

(22) Growth of M2 and M3 under alternative B would also be

expected to slow relative to their average pace of May and June. In

addition to the moderation of M1 growth, the nontransaction components of

M2 and M3 should expand less rapidly over coming months, with inflows to

money market funds and MMDAs tapering off as their yields fall into more



-16-

normal alignment with market interest rates. Moreover, issuance of

managed liabilities in the broader aggregates is unlikely to strengthen

greatly, given expectations of some weakening in bank credit growth and

continuing constraints on thrift asset expansion from capital requirements

and market concerns about the thrifts' financial condition. Under

alternative B, M2 in September would be just below the upper end of its

current long-run range, while M3 would be expected to be a little above

the midpoint of its range.

(23) Growth in the debt of nonfinancial sectors is expected

to slow slightly further in the third quarter, but expansion through

September might be around the upper end of the Committee's 9 to 12 percent

long-run range. Some of the moderation in overall debt growth is attri-

butable to less rapid expansion of federal government debt on a seasonally

adjusted basis. In addition, state and local governments' advance re-

funding of existing debt is expected to taper off. Consumer credit growth

also should slow along with the growth of consumption expenditures--

including those for durable goods. Mortgage credit expansion is expected

to edge higher, however, as housing activity responds to the previous

declines in interest rates. Underlying needs for funds by businesses may

increase, with capital spending expanding in the face of relatively flat

profits, but borrowing to finance mergers, buyouts and stock retirements

is projected to moderate a little. In the fourth quarter, growth of debt

of private nonfinancial sectors is expected to remain close to the third-

quarter pace, assuming interest rates stay around current levels. However,

federal government borrowing is likely to pick up, seasonally adjusted,

and credit growth for the year probably would be just above the upper end

of the Committee's long-run range.



-17-

(24) Unchanged reserve and money market conditions, as under

alternative B, are likely to be associated with a modest back-up in short-

term interest rates as the summer progresses, given fairly widespread

expectations of some easing of Federal Reserve policy over coming months.

The 3-month Treasury bill rate might rise to around 7-1/4 percent. Bond

yields, although increasing a bit initially in sympathy with short-term

rates, might change relatively little on balance, since long-term rates

are high in real terms and relative to short-term rates. Some upward

movement in long-term rates may develop, however, should there be sub-

stantial disappointment with Congressional action on federal deficits.

In foreign exchange markets, the dollar is expected to remain within

the trading range prevailing in the last few months.

(25) Alternative A contemplates an easing in money market

conditions consistent with somewhat more rapid money growth over the June-

to-September period. Borrowing at the discount window would drop to

minimal levels of around $150-200 million, or a more modest reduction in

borrowing might be accompanied by a cut in the discount rate to 7 percent.

The federal funds rate under this alternative would be expected to decline

toward 7 percent. Total and nonborrowed reserves would increase at 5-1/2

and 9-1/4 percent annual rates, respectively, over the summer. Other market

interest rates would fall relatively little under this alternative from

most recent levels-levels that appear to reflect anticipations of some

easing by the Federal Reserve over the near-term. The three-month bill

would probably trade in a 6-1/2 to 6-3/4 percent area. Private short-term

rates might decline more than bill rates as the lower overall level of

rates was seen as helping those financial institutions currently under

some stress. The dollar would decline in foreign exchange markets.



-18-

(26) Alternative A incorporates M1 growth at a 7 percent

annual rate over the third quarter, and at a 10-1/2 percent annual rate

from its fourth-quarter 1984 base. Growth of M2, and to a lesser extent

M3, would be bolstered under this alternative, as lower interest rates

boosted flows into MMDAs and MMFs. The lower interest rates likely to

develop, if maintained over the balance of the year, would also tend,

along with stronger growth in income, to raise money demand into the

fourth quarter. Under those conditions, growth of M1, M2 and debt for

the QIV 1984 to QIV 1985 period could be around the upper ends of the

specifications of alternative II.

(27) Alternative C contemplates a more marked slowing of money

growth over the months ahead than alternative B, with M1 specified to

grow at a 4 percent annual rate. Adjustment plus seasonal credit at the

discount window would be expected to increase to around $600 million, with

growth in nonborrowed reserves slowing to a one percent annual rate over

the coming three months. The federal funds rate would be expected to

rise to around the 8-1/4 to 8-1/2 percent area, and other interest rates,

as well as the foreign exchange value of the dollar, would increase

substantially in response to the unexpected tightening in money markets.

This greater slowing of money growth and tightening of credit conditions

would increase the odds that M1 might approach its current long-run upper

limit by late this year, although growth at the upper bound of or within

the current range would probably require a further tightening of reserve

conditions.

Directive language

(28) Given below is draft directive language, with variants,

relating to the Committee's decisions on the longer-run ranges. (Draft

language for the operating paragraph is shown in paragraph (29) beginning

on p. 22.) To improve readability, the language adopted at the previous

meeting is intially shown below in crossed-out form and proposed language

is shown thereafter without the usual format of strike-throughs and

capital letters. For simplicity, the proposed language does not repeat

the first sentence containing the general statement of the Committee's

policy objectives nor the ensuing standard paragraph on policy implementa-

tion. The first proposal is structured to allow for consideration of

raising the base of the M1 range for 1985, or, as shown in brackets,

for shifting the base; the possibility of adjusting the upper limits of

certain other ranges is also provided for. The second proposal assumes all

current ranges for 1985 are retained but allows for accepting growth in M1

above the range. After the two proposals, a proposed paragraph for 1986

ranges is shown.

Current language

The Federal Open Market Committee seeks to foster monetary and

financial conditions that will help to reduce inflation further,

promote growth in output on a sustainable basis, and contribute

to an improved pattern of international transactions. [DEL: In furtherance

of these objectives the Committee agreed-at-its-meeting in February

to- establish ranges for monetary growth of 4 to 7 percent for M1,

6 to 9 percent for M2, and 6 to 9-1/2 percent for M3 for the period

from the fourth quarter of 1984 to the fourth quarter of 1985.

The associated range- for- total- domestic nonfinancial debt was set

at-9-to 12 percent for the year 1985. The Committee agreed that



-20-

growth in the monetary aggregates in the upper part of their

ranges for 1985 may be appropriate, depending on developments

withe respect to velocity and provided that inflationary pressures

remain subdued.]

The Committee understood that policy implementation would

require continuing appraisal of the relationships not only among

the various measures of money and credit but also between those

aggregates and nominal GNP, including evaluation of conditions

in domestic credit and foreign exchange markets.

Proposal 1

... In furtherance of these objectives the Committee at this

meeting established a range of ____ to ____ percent for M1 for

the period from the fourth quarter of 1984 to the fourth quarter

of 1985 [for the period from the second quarter of 1985 to the

fourth quarter of 1985] and reaffirmed [established] ranges

for the year of ____ to ____ percent for M2 and ____ to ____

percent for M3. The associated range for total domestic

nonfinancial debt was reaffirmed [established] at ____ to

percent. Although growth in M1 was expected to slow in the

second half of 1985, the range for the year was raised from

that established in February to allow for the possibility that

the velocity of M1 may decline for the year as a whole, given

the substantial drop in the first half of the year. [The base

for the M1 range was moved forward to the second quarter of 1985

to be consistent with a gradual return of velocity growth toward

more usual patterns, following the sharp decline in velocity

during the first half of the year.] [The upper limit(s) of the



-21-

range(s) for (M2 and/or debt) was (were) also raised in light of

the decline(s) in its (their) velocity on average over the first

half of the year.] The Committee agreed that growth in the

aggregates generally may be in the upper parts of their ranges,

depending on continuing developments with respect to velocity

and provided that inflationary pressures remain subdued.

Proposal 2

... In furtherance of these objectives the Committee at this

meeting reaffirmed the ranges of money growth established in

February of 4 to 7 percent for M1, 6 to 9 percent for M2, and

6 to 9-1/2 percent for M3 for the period from the fourth quarter

of 1984 to the fourth quarter of 1985. The associated range for

total domestic nonfinancial debt was retained at 9 to 12 percent.

In reaffiming these ranges, the Committee recognized, with

respect to M1, that the velocity of M1 for the year may decline,

given the substantial drop in the first half. In that context,

although growth in M1 was expected to slow from the first-half

pace in the second half of the year, growth for the year as a

whole above the range would be acceptable provided that inflation-

ary pressures remain subdued. Growth of other aggregates in

the upper part of their ranges would also be acceptable depending

in part on velocity developments.

Proposal for 1986 ranges

For 1986 the Committee agree on tentative ranges of monetary

quarter of 1986, of ____ to ____ percent for M1, ____ to ____ percent

for M2, and ____ to ____ percent for M3. The associated range for

growth in total domestic nonfinancial debt was provisionally set at



-22-

____ to ____ percent for 1986. However, in establishing ranges for

next year, the Comittee recognized that account would need to be

taken of experience with institutional and depositor behavior in

response to the completion of deposit rate deregulation early in

the year.

(29) An operating paragraph structured along the lines of the

Committee's usual approach of recent months is proposed below.

Proposed operating paragraph

In the implementation of policy for the immediate future, [DEL: and

against the background of the recent reduction in the discount

rate] the Committee seeks to DECREASE SLIGHTLY (ALT. A)/maintain

(ALT. B)/INCREASE SLIGHTLY (ALT. C) [DEL: about] the [DEL: same] EXISTING degree

of pressure on [DEL: bank] reserve positions. This action is expected

to be consistent with growth in M1, M2, AND M3 at [DEL: an] annual rate

RATES of around 6 ____, ____, AND ____ percent [DEL: or a little higher]

during the period from [DEL: March to] June TO SEPTEMBER, [DEL: while M2

and M3, in the light of their weakness in April, are expected

to grow more slowly over the quarter than the 7 and 8 percent

annual rates, respectively, anticipated earlier.] Somewhat lesser

reserve restraint would (MIGHT) be acceptable in the event of

substantially slower growth of the monetary aggregates while

somewhat greater restraint might (WOULD) be acceptable in the

event of substantially higher growth. In either case such a

change would be considered in the context of appraisals of the

strength of the business expansion, progress against inflation,

and conditions in domestic credit and foreign exchange markets.

The Chairman may call for Committee consultation if it appears



-23-

to the Manager for Domestic Operations that pursuit of the

monetary objectives and related reserve paths during the period

before the next meeting is likely to be associated with a

federal funds rate persistently outside a range of [DEL:6 to 10] ____

TO ____ percent.
