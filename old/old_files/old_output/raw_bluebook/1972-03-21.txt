of Governors of the Federal Reserve System.  This electronic document was created 
through a comprehensive digitization process which included identifying the best-
preserved paper copies, scanning those copies,1 and then making the scanned 
versions text-searchable.2   Though a stringent quality assurance process was 
employed, some imperfections may remain.

format.  All scanned images were deskewed (to remove the effects of printer- and scanner-introduced 
tilting) and lightly cleaned (to remove dark spots caused by staple holes, hole punches, and other 
blemishes caused after initial printing). 
 
2 A two-step process was used.  An advanced optical character recognition computer program (OCR) 
first created electronic text from the document image.  Where the OCR results were inconclusive,

MONEY MARKET CONDITIONS

Recent developments

(1) Growth in seasonally adjusted total reserves available to

support private nonbank deposits appears to be expanding at about an 11 per

cent annual rate for February and March combined. (See attached Table 1).

This would be slightly above the upper end of the 6--10 per cent range targeted

by the Committee, and at the upper end if adjustment is made for the small

downward revision in the January level. For February alone, the growth rate

was only 3.7 per cent. In March, however, the growth pace of such reserves

has accelerated; actual reserve data through mid-month, and required reserve

figures for the last half of the month (given the lagged reserve accounting),

now suggest March growth at around an 18 per cent annual rate.

(2) It appears that the money and credit aggregates are growing

at rates slightly in excess of the first quarter pace desired by the Committee.

In February, M1, M2, and the adjusted credit proxy grew at annual rates of

13-1/2, 15 and 6 per cent respectively, as shown in attached Table 3. Data

thus far available for March suggest continued high growth rates for M 1 and

M2, though not so high as in February, and an upsurge in the credit proxy.

For the first quarter as a whole, our current estimate (with half of March

projected) is for growth in M1 at a 9-1/2 per cent annual rate, which compares

with a 7--8 per cent rate desired by the Committee.



-2-

(3) When it became apparent that growth of reserves was close to

the upper end of the desired February-March range and growth of the aggregates

seemed to be running a bit above the desired first-quarter ranges, the Desk

began to hold back on reserve provision and allowed money market conditions

to firm. As a result, the Federal funds rate rose to an average of 3-7/8 per

cent in the latest statement week and most recently has continued to trade

around that level. This compares with a weekly low of 3.18 per cent, reached

about mid-way in the intermeeting period.

(4) Even before the firming of money market conditions, Treasury bill

rates had begun to rise from their mid-February lows, as a marked earlier dearth

in the market supply of immediately available bills began to be remedied.

Increased bill supplies came chiefly from the Treasury's $3 billion offering

of strip bills early in March and the continuing $300 million weekly increments

to its regular bill auctions. Other bills came into the market during the

latter part of February when a Treasury decision to drop its balance at the

Federal Reserve by $2.3 billion elicited sizable System bill sales to help

absorb the resulting release of reserves. In part, however, the marked rise

in bill rates has reflected the sharp recent advance in Federal funds and

dealer loan rates. Very recently, 3-month Treasury bills have traded at about

3.90 per cent, nearly 85 basis points above the yield prevailing at the time

of the last Committee meeting.

(5) Rates on other short-term market instruments have also moved

up recently, by 25--75 basis points. A bank with a flexibile prime rate policy



-3-

that had been quoting a rate of 4-3/8 per cent has raised its rate in two

stages to 4-3/4 per cent. Yields in markets for longer-term securities have

changed little on balance since the last Committee meeting, but most recently

there has been some small rise in response to increases in money market rates.

(6) The following table compares seasonally adjusted annual rates

of change in major financial aggregates for recent periods:

As indicated in paragraph (7), under patterns II and III member bank

borrowings would be expected to rise from current levels as the Federal

funds rate rises relative to the discount rate. Expansion in nonborrow-

ed reserves supporting nonbank private deposits would be slower than for

the total of such reserves in patterns II and III. The average annual

rate of expansion for such nonborrowed reserves in March-April would be

expected to be around 12 per cent for pattern I, 8 per cent for II, and

4 per cent for III.

(9) With transactions demands for cash expanding in reflec-

tion of the 10 per cent annual rate of rise projected for nominal GNP

in the second quarter, M1 growth would be expected to decline only

slightly from the substantial first quarter rate of growth of about 9-1/2

per cent if prevailing money market conditions are maintained. If the

Committee should seek to reduce growth in M1 significantly below the

estimated first quarter rate, money market conditions would be expected

to tighten. For example, if the Desk were to provide reserves at a rate

consistent with M growth rates in the pattern II area (around 6-1/2 per

cent for April and 7-1/2 per cent for the second quarter), the staff

would expect the Federal funds rate to rise to near the upper end of the

3-1/2--4-3/4 per cent range. Also, member bank borrowings would likely

increase to around the upper end of their $50-$200 million range. Likewise,

in attaining pattern III aggregates, the staff would expect money market

conditions to move to the tight end of the ranges shown for that alterna-

tive.



(10) With the 3-month Treasury bill rate around 3-7/8 per

cent, the market has probably largely adjusted to a Federal funds rate

in a 3-3/4--4 per cent range and may have discounted some of the pros-

pective Treasury cash borrowing. It is not yet certain whether the

Treasury will borrow additional cash in early April, or how much might

be borrowed if they come to market, or in what maturity area. For

projection purposes, we have assumed only $2 billion of borrowing in

the short- or short-intermediate-term area. If the Treasury does not

undertake some such market borrowing, it probably would have to borrow

directly from the System for a few days around mid-April. With such a

moderate amount of borrowing the 3-month bill rate might remain around

4 per cent, or below, between now and the next Committee meeting. A

rise in the Federal funds rate, however, toward 4-1/2 per cent would

involve a further, perhaps commensurate, rise in the bill rate. And

as the funds rate penetrated the 4-1/2 per cent discount rate, the bill

rate might begin to rise more rapidly in anticipation of a discount

rate hike.

(11) The still wide spread of long- over short- rates

will tend to minimize effects on long markets of rising short-term

rates. We would expect, though, that a further rise in the bill rate of

25-50 basis points over the near-term would be accompanied by some up-

ward rate pressures in bond markets. Corporate and municipal bond

volume is still fairly sizable, though well below last year, and only a

modest further decline in volume is anticipated into the summer. Upward



rate pressures may be largest in the municipal market as bank demand

weakens in the face of rising costs of CD funds and banker attitudes

toward liquidity become more cautious.

(12) Growth in time deposits other than large CD's is

likely to slow in the months ahead from the very rapid January-February

pace, and particularly if short-term market rates rise. As a result,

growth in M2 in the second quarter is likely to be noticeably slower

than in the first under all three patterns.

(13) The adjusted bank credit proxy, too, is expected to

grow less rapidly in the second quarter than the first, mainly in

reflection of the considerably slower growth in consumer-type time

deposits. Expansion in outstanding large CD's is expected to be

little changed from recent months under pattern I, but some pick-up

is anticipated under tighter money market conditions as banks attempt

to compensate in some degree for slower growth in other deposits.



- 10

Proposed directive

(14) On the assumption that the Committee will want to continue

to use the general procedure agreed upon at the February 15 meeting, the

following language for the second paragraph of the directive, which is

similar to that adopted then, is suggested:

"To implement this policy, while taking account of

international developments, the Committee seeks to achieve

bank reserve and money market conditions that will support
(I - AMPLE )
(II - moderate ) growth in monetary aggregates over the
(III - MORE moderate)
months ahead."

If the Committee so wishes, each of three alternative adjectives qualifying

"growth in monetary aggregates over the months ahead" can be taken to

correspond with the similarly numbered pattern of aggregate growth rates

described in the preceding section. For expository purposes these patterns

have been expressed as single point values, but as at the February meeting,

the Committee may, of course, wish to specify its objectives in terms of

ranges.
