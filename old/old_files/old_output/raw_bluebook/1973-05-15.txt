of Governors of the Federal Reserve System.  This electronic document was created 
through a comprehensive digitization process which included identifying the best-
preserved paper copies, scanning those copies,1 and then making the scanned 
versions text-searchable.2   Though a stringent quality assurance process was 
employed, some imperfections may remain.

Recent developments

(1) Both M1 and M2 appear to be expanding at annual rates somewhat

above the upper ends of the Committee's April-May ranges of tolerance. Growth

in RPD for the same period, however, seems to be falling short of its range,

as shown in the table. The divergent tendencies evident in money supply

and RPD expansion are attributable to a lower than anticipated average

level of excess reserves in May; to greater than anticipated growth in

currency, which swells M but does not absorb required reserves; and to a

difference (still partly projected) in the weekly pattern of deposits from

that projected earlier (which affects the required reserve component of RPD

with a lag).

(2) The tendency for money supply growth to exceed the Committee's

target ranges became evident soon after the last meeting, and the Desk, while

May 11, 1973



-2-

taking account of even-keel, adopted a somewhat more reluctant reserve

supplying strategy. This was expected to raise the Federal funds rate from

the 6-7/8 to 7 per cent range prevailing at the time of the last meeting

into a 7-1/4--7-1/2 per cent range. In the week ending May 2 the average

funds rate rose to 7.43 per cent, and then in the most recent week to

7.60 per cent. During these two statement weeks, member bank borrowings

averaged $1.7 billion, little different from the preceding four weeks.

(3) The recent rise in the funds rate to more than 7-1/2 per

cent reflected unexpected shortages in the supply of reserves arising

partly from a large shortfall in float over the week-end of May 5, which

was partly related to delays in transfers of funds to banks because of a

computer failure. In response to developing money market tightness in the

most recent period, the Desk supplied reserves mainly through repurchase

agreements. The impact of the higher funds rate on market attitudes was

blunted by the reserve supplying efforts of the Desk, by the relatively

low volume of total dealer positions, and by the ready availability of

dealer financing at favorable rates from non-bank institutions.

(4) During most of the inter-meeting period, interest rates on

market securities showed little net response to the rise in the Federal

funds rate. While average issuing rates in the auction of the Treasury's

new 6-7/8 per cent note and 7 per cent bond were apparently nudged upward,

these securities dropped somewhat in yield in the immediate post-auction

period, and yields on short-term bills declined about a quarter of a

percentage point, with the 3-month issue moving to just under 6 per cent.

This drop reflected both current and prospective shortages in the market



-3-

supply of Treasury bills. In addition to the usual April and June redemptions

of tax bills, the Treasury recently initiated a cut-back of its regular

bill auction by $100 million a week; $1.7 billion of the maturing May

securities will be redeemed--creating potential demands for bills; the

rest of the May maturities were refunded into longer-maturity notes and

bonds; and it was announced that the initial Treasury cash borrowing in

the new fiscal year might not come until early August.

(5) Following the 1/4 point rise in the discount rate to 5-3/4

per cent on April 23, a further increase to 6 per cent was announced

Thursday. Yesterday's announcement was received relatively quietly by

the market. Bill rates initially adjusted upward about 10 basis points,

but rose further on Friday as the day progressed, perhaps in part due to

persisting money market tightness on that day. The 3-month bill most

recently was quoted 6.23 per cent bid. There were minor price declines

in Treasury and other bond markets. On balance, since the last Committee

meeting, corporate and municipal bond yields have changed little, while

mortgage rates have edged up and longer-term Government securities have

advanced about 1/8 of a percentage point in response to the Treasury's debt

lengthening operation.

might well involve some further tightening of the money market, with

the funds rate between now and the next Committee meeting probably moving

up toward the top of the 7-1/4--8 per cent range shown. This represents

somewhat tighter money market conditions than were specified at the time

of the last meeting as consistent with the given longer-run objectives for

the aggregates. This specification of tighter money market conditions re-

flects the greater strength of money supply in recent weeks and the sizable

upward revision in the projection of nominal GNP for the second quarter.

(9) In May-June, M 1 growth is indicated to be less rapid than

in April. Income tax refunds will be tapering off in the forthcoming

period, and growth will also be held down by the cumulative impact of past

interest rate increases together with the restraint on reserve growth

targeted. By the third quarter, a further modest slowing in M 1 growth

would be needed to attain the longer-run target. This might be accomplished

without any additional tightening in money market conditions beyond the 7-1/4--8

per cent funds rate range, particularly if, as projected, the rate of growth

in GNP moderates.

(10) Between now and the next Committee meeting the 3-month

Treasury bill rate is likely to move back up into a 6-1/4--6-5/8 per cent

range under alternative B. The recent rise in the discount rate and the

somewhat tauter money market conditions anticipated will put pressure on

dealer financing costs and will also give banks a further incentive to sell

or liquidate bills as compared with other forms of adjustment. In addition,

a $1--$2 billion drop in the Treasury balance at the Fed is anticipated prior

to mid-June tax receipts and this will cause the System to sell more bills

than otherwise into the market. The bill rate is still expected to remain

unusually low relative to the funds rate, however. The Treasury's favorable

cash position has enabled it to pay down maturing coupon issues and bills, and



the Treasury has also stressed debt lengthening in its refunding operations.

In this assessment of the bill market, we have not assumed any substantial

reflow of funds from abroad.

(11) Pressure on bank liquidity positions is expected to persist

in the weeks ahead as bank lending continues to grow at a rapid pace. There

has been some moderation of business loan demands as the shift of commercial

paper borrowers to banks has abated. Nevertheless, the projected rapid

rate of business inventory accumulation and large plant and equipment outlays

indicate basic strength in credit demands.

(12) These demands are likely to be financed in large part by

issuance of CD's in sizable volume, though diminished from the record first

quarter pace. If the cost of issuing CD's is increased (by raising reserve

requirements), the amount of CD's issued will probably be cut back some-

what because of the higher effective rate, banks will shift to other

forms of raising funds (such as selling securities), and lending terms to

business may righten somewhat further.

(13) The availability of bank credit to finance demands will

also be dampened by an expected further slowing of net inflows of consumer-

type time and savings deposits as short-term interest rates edge higher.

The staff has not assumed a rise in Regulation Q ceilings that pertain to

such deposits. Given this assumption, a more marked slowing of consumer-

type time deposit flows is anticipated around the mid-year interest crediting

period and continuing into the third quarter, when Treasury bill rates are

expected to rise further.



(14) Long-term interest rates seem likely to rise somewhat under

the conditions of alternative B partly as restraint on bank credit availa-

bility leads banks to participate relatively little as suppliers of funds

in securities markets. Reduced flows of funds to nonbank savings institu-

tions will also work toward upward pressure on mortgage rates and on debt

markets more generally as Federal agencies offer sizable amounts of

securities to help support the mortgage market. Demands on long-term bond

markets, however, still appear quite moderate, and this may permit a rise

in short rates to develop without significant impacts on long rates. But

expectations are very important in the determination of long rates, and

should monetary actions be interpreted as implying that credit will

tighten substantially further, or remain tight for a more extended period

than expected, long rates could well come under more upward pressure.

(15) Alternative A indicates specifications that appear consis-

tent with a policy move toward a higher growth rate for the aggregates

than encompassed in alternative B. This alternative implies some easing

of money market conditions in the weeks ahead.

(16) Under alternative C, which moves toward a lower long-run

growth rate for the aggregates, it would appear that the Federal funds

rate would probably have to rise above 8 per cent over the period imme-

diately ahead. Because of lags the main impact on M1 growth would not

occur until the third quarter, when--to achieve the 4--4-1/2 per cent

long-run objective--M1 growth would have to fall to a 3 per cent annual

rate. M2 growth also would slow sharply, given the significantly higher

short-term rates and assuming no increase in Regulation Q ceilings for



-9-

consumer-type time deposits. Given the low growth rates for the aggre-

gates expected for the third quarter under this alternative, the Committee may

find it necessary to ease money market conditions in the course of summer

if it desires to stay on the longer-run growth paths of alternative C

thereafter.



-10-

Proposed directive

(17) Presented below are three alternative formulations for

the operational paragraph of the directive, which might be taken to

correspond to the similarly lettered policy alternatives discussed in the

preceding section. In light of the comments by a number of members at the

previous Committee meeting about the disadvantages of using such qualita-

tive terms as "moderate" or "modest" to characterize the desired growth

rates in the monetary aggregates, such objectives have been expressed

relative to the actual growth over the past 6 months. These 6-month growth

rates are shown in the table on page 4. The diverse behavior of the various

monetary aggregates, however, creates difficulties in characterizing future

targets in the same way relative to past performance for all aggregates.

(18) The 6 month comparison works quite well for M1, since

the long-term target range specified under alternative B (5--5-1/2 per

cent) and the short-run range of tolerance encompass the 5-1/4 per cent

growth rate experience in the past 6 months; the ranges specified under

A and C are, respectively, somewhat above and somewhat below the 6-month

pace. For the bank credit proxy, actual growth over the past 6 months

exceeds both the long-run target and near-term expectations under all

three alternatives. For RPD and M2 , the situation is a little more compli-

cated, but for the most part the previous 6-month rates of expansion are

above specifications in the three alternatives (with some exceptions in

alternative A).



-11-

(19) The directive language below attempts to take account of

the differences in specified future movement of the aggregates relative to

the past. As will be noted, an instruction to take account of credit market

developments is included in alternative C since the relatively sharp tightening

of money market conditions contemplated could lead to undesirably rapid

adjustments in credit markets generally.
