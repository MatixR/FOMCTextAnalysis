Prefatory Note 

 
 

The attached document represents the most complete and accurate version 
available based on original copies culled from the files of the FOMC Secretariat at the 
Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System.  This electronic document was 
created through a comprehensive digitization process which included identifying the best-
preserved paper copies, scanning those copies,1 and then making the scanned versions 
text-searchable.2  Though a stringent quality assurance process was employed, some 
imperfections may remain. 
 

Please note that this document may contain occasional gaps in the text.  These 
gaps are the result of a redaction process that removed information obtained on a 
confidential basis.  All redacted passages are exempt from disclosure under applicable 
provisions of the Freedom of Information Act.    

 

                                                 
1 In some cases, original copies needed to be photocopied before being scanned into electronic format.  All 
scanned images were deskewed (to remove the effects of printer- and scanner-introduced tilting) and lightly 
cleaned (to remove dark spots caused by staple holes, hole punches, and other blemishes caused after initial 
printing). 
2 A two-step process was used.  An advanced optimal character recognition computer program (OCR) first 
created electronic text from the document image.  Where the OCR results were inconclusive, staff checked 
and corrected the text as necessary.   Please note that the numbers and text in charts and tables were not 
reliably recognized by the OCR process and were not checked or corrected by staff.

Recent developments

(1) M-1 increased at a 5.1 per cent annual rate in July and

appears to be expanding over the July-August period at an annual rate of

about 6 per cent, the mid-point of the Committee's range. M-2

expansion during July and August is projected to average almost 9 per

cent at an annual rate, in the upper half of the Committee's range.

Large-denomination time deposits included in M-2 have increased sharply

in recent weeks, while growth in small-denomination time deposits

slowed and savings deposits declined somewhat. At nonbank thrift

institutions, deposit inflows strengthened further in July. Although

sales of the new money market certificates picked up in July at both

banks and thrifts, only the latter appear to be gaining substantial net

new money through the instrument.

(2) Since the July FOMC meeting Federal funds have traded

within a 7 to 8 per cent range, while projected growth in the mone-

tary aggregates over the July-August period has also remained well

within the Committee's ranges. Although the funds rate was slightly

higher during the inter-meeting period than in preceding weeks, short-

and long-term market interest rates declined by as much as 20 and

30 basis points since the July FOMC meeting. The fall in rates

developed in response to a shift in expectations, apparently induced

by recent moderate growth in the monetary aggregates, failure of the

Federal funds rate to move even higher, and signs of slowing in

economic expansion. The rally was encouraged by efforts of Treasury

security dealers and other active trading accounts to cover short

positions in coupon issues and to build up larger long positions in

bills. In addition, demand for Treasury bills increased as a result

of substantial foreign central bank investment of dollars obtained in

currency exchange support operations. Most recently, a portion of

the general rate decline has been reversed.

(3) Corporate bond offerings to the public have been

relatively light in recent weeks, but issuance of municipal bonds

has been exceptionally heavy, partly reflecting a spurt in advance

refunding issues in advance of a September 1 change in Treasury

regulations. The Treasury also raised about $5 billion of new money

during the inter-meeting period. In its quarterly refunding operation,

the Treasury sold $7.7 billion of new debt instruments--including

$700 million issued to foreign official accounts on a non-competitive



basis--to roll over $4.4 billion of maturing debt. Aggressive bidding

by investors and a sizable volume of private non-competitive tenders

left the dealer community with only about 35 per cent of the total awards

to the domestic public. Dealers have thus far distributed about two-

thirds of their awards.

(4) The improved deposit flows to thrift institutions and

reduction in market interest rates have reduced the pressure on mortgage

rates. While mortgage indebtedness apparently has continued to expand

at about the stronger second-quarter pace, average rates on new home

loan commitments at S&L's have edged up only slightly in recent weeks.

Moreover, fewer institutions have been reporting that lendable funds

are in substantially short supply.

(5) Growth in commercial bank credit rebounded in July,

reflecting a very strong advance in total loans and a substantial rise

in total investments. Real estate and consumer loans continued to

rise at relatively strong rates. Growth in business loans also picked

up from June's reduced pace, but remained below that recorded on

average over the first half of the year. To help finance bank credit

expansion, banks issued sizable amounts of negotiable CD's and other

large time deposits.

(6) The table on the next page shows percentage annual

rates of changes in related monetary and financial flows over various

time periods.

Prospective developments

(7) Tabulated below for Committee consideration are two

alternative short-run specifications for the Federal funds rate and

the monetary aggregates. (More detailed and longer-term data are con-

tained in the tables on pp. 6 and 7.)

M-1 5½ to 9½ 5 to 9

M-2 7 to 11 6½ to 10½

Federal funds rate 7¾ to 8 7¾ to 8½
(inter-meeting period)

(8) Alternative A contemplates continuation of a Federal

funds rate around the mid-point of the existing 7¾ to 8 per cent range.

Under the circumstances, M-1 growth over the August-September period

is expected to accelerate into a 5½ to 9½ per cent, annual rate,

range--bringing the level of M-1 by September a shade above that

implied by the upper bound of the Committee's newly adopted longer-

run range, as may be seen from chart 1 on the following page.

M-1 growth in June and July may have been held down by an unusually

rapid run-up in U.S. Government deposits, and such deposits are

projected to decline in September. Moreover, transactions demands

for cash are likely to be fairly strong in the third quarter as a

whole, when nominal GNP is projected to rise at about an 11 per cent

annual rate. The projected M-1 increase for August and September would

lead to an expansion in the third quarter at about a 6¼ per cent

annual rate, and would imply a rise in velocity of 4¼ per cent at an

annual rate (see Appendix II).

(9) M-2 in the August-September period under alternative A

is expected to grow in a 7 to 11 per cent annual rate range. The

interest-bearing component of M-2 may expand at about a 10 per cent

annual rate over the period. This represents a slight slowing from

the July rate of growth, but is more rapid than in the first half of

the year. With inflows of deposits subject to ceiling rates remaining

sluggish, banks are expected to sell substantial amounts of large

time deposits--both non-negotiable and negotiable--to finance continued

relatively strong credit demands.

(10) Inflows of interest-bearing deposits to thrift institu-

tions are projected to slow over the weeks ahead from the rapid July

pace. The impact of the initial shifting of funds from outstanding

financial assets to the 6-month money market certificate, which has

been aggressively marketed by thrift institutions, may soon run its

course. Even so, as with the interest-bearing component of M-2,

thrift deposits are expected to grow somewhat more rapidly than in the

first half of the year.

(11) Under alternative A, the recent upward readjustment

of market rates, following the unexpectedly sharp decline of recent

weeks, may continue, with rates returning closer to their mid-July

levels. Basically, however, demands on credit markets are not expected

to strengthen significantly over the period. Corporate bond offerings

are likely to remain near their recent reduced pace, municipal volume

should drop off, and Treasury credit demands are not expected to pick

up until later in the fall. In short-term markets, the 3-month



Treasury bill rate is still quite low relative to the Federal funds

rate--a spread of about one percentage point--and the bill rate should

rise more than other short rates unless there is a substantial volume

of foreign central bank purchases.

(12) If the funds rate were to move up to the mid-point of

the 7¾ to 8½ per cent alternative B range, the upward adjustment

in market rates would likely be prompt and marked. The 3-month bill

rate should move toward 7¼ per cent, and pressures on the CD and

commercial paper rates should generate a further rise in the prime

loan rate. The rise of interest rates on Treasury coupon issues

would probably reverse all of the recent decline in such yields,

and perhaps go somewhat further. And corporate bond yields may

also rise fairly substantially given the prevailing narrow rate spread

between Treasury and corporate issues.

(13) Growth in M-1 and M-2 under alternative B may be

in ranges of 5 to 9 and 6½ to 10½ per cent, respectively. It is

expected that continued issuance of the 6-month money market certificate

by banks and thrift institutions will tend to moderate adverse impacts

of rising interest rates on inflows of small-denomination time and

savings deposits; the beneficial effect is likely to be most marked

at thrift institutions, if recent experience is any guide. Neverthe-

less, the rising marginal cost of time and savings deposits, if not

an actual slowing of deposit inflows, is likely to exert additional

upward pressure on primary mortgage interest rates.



-10-

(14) The staff still expects that interest rates between

now and mid-1979 will have to rise beyond those contemplated

under the short-run specifications for alternative B--given projec-

tions for GNP growth--if M-1 growth over the one-year QII '78 to

QII '79 period is to be around the upper limit1/ of the 4 to 6 per

cent range adopted for that aggregate. Federal funds rate projections

through the second quarter of next year are shown in appendix I.

Directive language

(15) Given below are suggested operational paragraphs for

the directive. The language of alternative A is consistent with the

specifications of alternative A discussed in the preceding section. Like

the directive adopted at the last meeting, it places main emphasis on

money market conditions and calls for operations directed at maintain-

ing the weekly-average Federal funds rate within the range of 7-3/4 to

8 per cent.

(16) The language of alternative B is consistent with the

specifications of the tightening alternative discussed in the preced-

ing section; it calls for operations directed initially at attaining

a weekly-average Federal funds rate slightly or somewhat above the

current level. This formulation also provides variants that enable

the Committee to place main emphasis either on money market conditions

or on monetary aggregates.

In the short run, the Committee seeks to achieve bank reserve

and money market conditions that are broadly consistent with the

longer-run ranges for monetary aggregates cited above, while

giving due regard to developing conditions in financial markets

more generally. During the period until the next regular meet-

ing, System open market operations shall be directed



-12-

Alternative A

at maintaining the weekly-average Federal funds rate within the

range of 7-3/4 to 8 per cent. In deciding on the specific objec-

tive for the Federal funds rate the Manager shall be guided mainly

by the relationship between the latest estimates of annual rates

of growth in the [DEL: July-August] AUGUST-SEPTEMBER period of M-1 and

M-2 and the following ranges of tolerance: [DEL: 4 to 8] ____ TO

____ per cent for M-1 and [DEL:6 to 10] ____ TO ____ per cent for

M-2. If, giving approximately equal weight to M-1 and M-2, their

rates of growth appear to be close to or beyond the upper or lower

limits of the indicated ranges, the objective for the funds rate

shall be raised or lowered in an orderly fashion within its range.

If the rates of growth in the aggregates appear to be above

the upper limit or below the lower limit of the indicated ranges

at a time when the objective for the funds rate has already been

moved to the corresponding limit of its range, the Manager is

promptly to notify the Chairman who will then decide whether the

situation calls for supplementary instructions from the Committee.

NOTE: Government security dealer trading positions are on a commitment basis. Trading positions, which exclude Treasury securities financed
by repurchase agreements maturing in 16 days or more, are indicators of dealer holdings available for sale over the near-term. Underwriting
syndicate positions consist of issues still in syndicate, excluding trading positions. The basic reserve deficit is excess reserves less
borrowing at Federal Reserve less net Federal funds purchases. Weekly data are daily averages for statement weeks, except for corporate
and municipal issues in syndicate which are Friday figures.

* Strictly confidential.
** Monthly averages for excess reserves and borrowings are weighted averages of statement week figures.
