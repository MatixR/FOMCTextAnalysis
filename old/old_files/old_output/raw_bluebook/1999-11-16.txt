Prefatory Note 

 
 

The attached document represents the most complete and accurate version 
available based on original copies culled from the files of the FOMC Secretariat at the 
Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System.  This electronic document was 
created through a comprehensive digitization process which included identifying the best-
preserved paper copies, scanning those copies,1 and then making the scanned versions 
text-searchable.2  Though a stringent quality assurance process was employed, some 
imperfections may remain. 
 

Please note that this document may contain occasional gaps in the text.  These 
gaps are the result of a redaction process that removed information obtained on a

scanned images were deskewed (to remove the effects of printer- and scanner-introduced tilting) and lightly 
cleaned (to remove dark spots caused by staple holes, hole punches, and other blemishes caused after initial 
printing). 
2 A two-step process was used.  An advanced optimal character recognition computer program (OCR) first 
created electronic text from the document image.  Where the OCR results were inconclusive, staff checked

STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL (FR) CLASS II FOMC

MONETARY POLICY ALTERNATIVES

PREPARED FOR THE FEDERAL OPEN MARKET COMMITTEE

BY THE STAFF OF THE BOARD OF GOVERNORS OF THE FEDERAL RESERVE SYSTEM



Strictly Confidential (F.R.) November 12,1999
Class I -- FOMC

MONETARY POLICY ALTERNATIVES

Recent Developments

(1) Financial market conditions have become a little more accommodative on

balance since the October FOMC meeting, with stock prices rising appreciably and interest

and dollar exchange rates showing small mixed changes. While the Committee's decision at

that meeting to leave the federal funds rate unchanged was widely anticipated by market

participants, the adoption of a bias toward tightening came as something of a surprise, and

market interest rates rose in response to the announcement. Yields continued to climb over

the first half of the intermeeting period as data releases, especially the September PPI and

retail sales reports, elevated concerns about unsustainable growth and inflation and

heightened expectations of further monetary policy tightening (chart 1). Yields have since

retreated, however, largely in response to data pointing to low wage and price inflation. On

net, yields on Treasury coupon securities are from 7 basis points lower to 8 basis points

higher.1

(2) Conditions in private credit markets appear to have eased slightly over the

intermeeting period. Yields on long-term private securities have edged lower, swap spreads

have narrowed, and rates on most short-term private securities have fallen. More favorable

1. In contrast, Treasury bill rates have risen about 20 to 40 basis points. Investors
anticipate a large increase in bill supplies in November and December as the Treasury builds
its cash balance to larger-than-usual levels ahead of the century date change. In addition,
demand for bills likely has decreased somewhat as Y2K-related market concerns have
lessened.

economic performance at home and abroad appears to have fostered investor confidence

and perhaps a greater willingness to bear risk. An important part of this more relaxed

attitude probably reflects reduced concerns about funding and liquidity pressures over the

century date change. The Desk's implementation of a number of measures to enhance its

ability to supply reserves and to act as a backstop source of funding to major participants in

the financing markets over the century date change no doubt played an important role. The

Desk put into place arrangements to execute repurchase agreements on a triparty basis, and,

using those arrangements, it began accepting agency mortgage-backed securities as collateral;

it also started to conduct repurchase agreements with maturities of up to 90 days that

extended into the new year; and it auctioned options on repurchase agreements for the weeks

around year-end.2 In addition, the relatively high volume of commercial paper issued with

2. The options permit the buyer to engage in overnight repurchase agreements with the
Desk on any or all days during a specified week; options have been offered for the weeks
beginning on December 23, December 30, and January 6. The demand for the options has
been considerable, with the Desk increasing the total volume of options offered in each of
the first four auctions and extending the number of auctions from five to seven. The volume
of options outstanding is $74 billion for the week of December 23, $143 billion for the week
of December 30, and $89 billion for the week of January 6. In the most recent auction,
though, propositions fell off considerably, and the Desk responded by substantially reducing
the volume of options to be auctioned next week.

The Federal Reserve's other initiative for providing liquidity, the Special Liquidity
Facility (SLF), has seen limited usage to date--probably because the federal funds rate was
close to its target over most of the intermeeting period. SLF borrowing averaged $9 million
over the intermeeting period, although one depository institution borrowed $210 million on
November 3, when the funds rate reached a high of 10 percent, reportedly to sell the
proceeds in the funds market. Most other drawdowns were for testing purposes, although
two credit unions borrowed to meet funding needs. The Federal Reserve also expanded the
range of collateral eligible to be pledged for discount window loans to include bank
obligations, collateralized loan obligations, collateralized bond obligations, commercial
mortgage-backed securities, mutual fund shares, and, shortly, sovereign debt denominated in
foreign currencies. In recent months, banks have greatly increased the volume of collateral



-3-

maturities after the middle of January indicates that borrowers have gotten a good start on

meeting their funding needs (chart 2). Direct measures of Y2K effects in financing markets,

such as butterfly interest-rate spreads on one-month bank deposits spanning the year-end,

have narrowed in recent weeks. Nonetheless, those spreads remain unusually elevated.

Moreover, spreads in bond and swap markets have not rolled back all their runup since last

spring, and financial markets in general are still somewhat less liquid than the norm prior to

the Russian default in August 1998.

(3) Equity prices have been lifted by stronger-than-expected earnings reports and

perceptions of improved prospects for continued strong output growth with subdued

inflation. Nonetheless, most broad equity indexes are still a bit below the peaks that were

posted in spring and midsummer. An exception, however, is the Nasdaq, which reached a

record high over the intermeeting period. Prices of financial stocks have received a further

boost from the passage of financial reform legislation. On balance, major equity price

indexes have risen 3 to 15 percent since the October FOMC meeting.

(4) In foreign exchange markets, the exchange value of the dollar against a broad

index of foreign currencies was little changed on net over the intermeeting period, as a

1 percent appreciation relative to major currencies just offset a like-sized depreciation

against the currencies of other important trading partners. For industrial countries, the net

change in bilateral exchange rates mirrored variations in long-term interest rate differentials,

pre-positioned with Reserve Banks to support discount window borrowing, and the ready
availability of this credit is likely also helping to calm year-end concerns.

but movements on some days were sharp and difficult to relate to fundamentals. Both the

European Central Bank and the Bank of England firmed policy late in the intermeeting

period, raising official rates 50 and 25 basis points, respectively. Market participants

apparently interpreted these actions-which had been largely anticipated--and, in the case of

the ECB, the accompanying statement, as lowering the cumulative tightening that might be

necessary and as reducing uncertainty by rendering it less likely that additional policy action

would be forthcoming for a while. Against this backdrop, ten-year nominal yields fell 30

basis points in Germany and 70 basis points in the United Kingdom over the intermeeting

period. These interest rate declines supported equity values but tended to weaken the euro

and pound relative to the dollar. In Japan, evidence of sustained economic growth and

expectations of substantial fiscal stimulus pushed up bond yields about 15 basis points,

share prices 5 percent, and the exchange value of the yen against the dollar over 1 percent.

Although rumors surfaced of impending action from time to time, Japanese authorities did

not intervene in the foreign exchange market.

. The Desk did not

intervene.

(5) The depreciation of the dollar against the currencies of other important

trading partners over the intermeeting period owed in part to greater assurance of economic

expansion in many of those emerging economies and, perhaps, to an increased willingness

of global investors to bear risk. In addition, relatively orderly elections in Indonesia and

Argentina and a primary in Mexico underscored a sense of renewed stability in many of



-5-

these countries. Interest rate spreads on emerging market bonds narrowed considerably,

and numerous reports indicate that credit markets have been receptive to new issues and

debt exchanges by emerging market economies. Investor receptivity was evident in equity

markets too: Excluding earthquake-stricken Taiwan, share prices rose 5 to 20 percent.

(6) In October, M2 growth advanced at a 5 percent pace, the same rate as in the

third quarter but a bit slower than anticipated in the last bluebook. The public's holdings of

currency continued to expand about in line with the rapid rates of earlier this year, but the

data do not suggest any pronounced hoarding in advance of the century date change.3 M2

velocity in the third quarter rose at an annualized pace of 1 percent, the first increase in two

years (chart 2). The advance likely reflected, at least in part, the rise in the opportunity cost

of holding M2 that occurred in the spring and summer as market interest rates rose.4 M3

growth in October, at a 10-1/4 percent annual rate, was quite robust, owing to strength in

large time deposits and institutional money funds. Bank credit grew only moderately, but

banks shifted funding toward sources inside M3.

(7) Debt of domestic nonfinancial sectors expanded at a pace roughly in line with

the approximately 6 percent growth of nominal GDP since midyear, leaving this aggregate in

3. Depository institutions have prepared for a surge in currency demand. Vault cash
holdings have increased $10-1/4 billion since the end of May, compared with virtually no
change over the same period last year.

4. Revisions to the GDP data have left the pattern of velocity movements unchanged.
Since 1994, velocity has moved more closely in line with predictions based on the previous
historical relationship between M2 velocity and opportunity cost. However, that span still
includes an uptrend in velocity from late 1995 through mid-1997 and a subsequent
downtrend, both of which remain difficult to explain.

the upper part of its annual range. In October, net borrowing by businesses showed signs of

slowing. Although risk spreads in securities markets have narrowed this fall, the November

survey of senior loan officers suggests additional tightening in terms and standards on

business loans. The survey also indicated that households have curbed their appetite for

debt, perhaps reflecting the backup in interest rates over recent months. Meanwhile, the

federal government's favorable budget position has led to a continued paydown of federal

debt.

Policy Alternatives

(8) The staff has again assumed 50 basis points of firming in the federal funds

rate over the course of next year, which is anticipated to be accompanied by a gradual

uptrend in bond rates and flat equity prices. These financial conditions, following the rise in

interest rates and the leveling out of stock prices during 1999, are projected to contribute to

a modest slowing in real GDP growth to a 3-1/2 percent rate over the next two years. This

growth rate is a little below the staffs estimate of that of the economy's potential over this

period, which has been revised up based on the new NIPA definitions and a reassessment

of underlying productivity growth. Hence, the unemployment rate is seen as ticking up

from its low October level, to the same 4-1/4 percent level in the fourth quarter of 2001

that was projected in the last Greenbook. Continued taut labor market conditions, along

with the feed-through to inflation expectations of higher total consumer price inflation in

1999, are projected to induce a noticeable pickup in nominal labor costs. That pickup

outpaces an expected further updrift in the growth of structural labor productivity. The

resulting heightened upward pressures on prices are augmented in the projection by a faster

rise in non-oil import prices associated with a forecasted depreciation in the exchange value

of the dollar. Consequently, core CPI inflation is anticipated to step up 3/4 percentage

point to about 2-3/4 percent by 2001, while total CPI inflation remains flat at just under

2-1/2 percent owing to a drop in energy prices.

(9) Even if the Committee, like the staff, sees forces at work tending to raise core

inflation over time, it may be sufficiently uncertain about that outcome that it still would



-9-

wish to leave the intended funds rate unchanged at this meeting at 5-1/4 percent, as under

alternative B, and to retain the tilt toward firming to convey a sense of the risks. Most

incoming data on prices and labor costs, including GDP prices, the ECI, average hourly

earnings, and unit labor costs, have once again proven to be surprisingly benign despite

increasingly taut labor markets. This string of favorable readings underscores questions

about the reliability of the traditional relationships that lie behind predictions that inflation

will pick up should resource utilization remain around its current level. Indeed, the revised

output data could be read as leaving open the possibility that productivity is continuing to

accelerate, perhaps substantially. While the associated increase in the marginal return on

capital projects would require higher real short-term interest rates at some point, the

economy could be able to produce beyond its long-run potential for a while longer without

an intensification of inflation so long as gains in real wages do not outstrip rising labor

productivity. In this circumstance, further policy tightening would be unnecessary for some

time. In light of the possibility that supply-side relationships continue to be unusually

favorable, the Committee might see considerable benefit from waiting for more solid

evidence that an inflationary upswing was in train. Even if productivity gains do not

materialize, the possible cost of delaying a firming in policy until early next year may not be

considered especially large since longer-term inflation expectations appear to be well

anchored.

(10) Markets have priced in about even odds of a tightening at this meeting, and

an announcement conveying a Committee decision to maintain both the current federal



-10-

funds rate target and an asymmetry toward tightening would prompt a modest rally.

Despite the asymmetry, market participants would likely assume that policy would be on

hold until at least the February meeting, owing to the Committee's evident disinclination to

act during intermeeting periods and the presumption that it would not want to risk

disturbing financial markets around the turn of the year. Initially, bond yields would likely

edge lower, and the exchange value of the dollar could fall. However, longer-term interest

rates would likely edge higher later in the intermeeting period should economic activity

unfold as robustly as in the staff forecast. The equity market would rally on the news of

policy inaction, but the staff anticipates that stock prices would move sideways on net over

the next few months. There is a wide range of uncertainty in predicting financial market

conditions as the century date change approaches; market liquidity may continue to improve

and spreads narrow some more, but most financial markets are likely to be unusually illiquid

as participants pare back their activity until the new year.

(11) The Committee instead may favor a 25 basis point increase in its intended

federal funds rate, as under alternative C. Although the staff has adopted the view that

structural productivity is growing along a higher and steeper trajectory over the forecast

period than previously thought, it still predicts an increase in core inflation over the next

two years that the Committee may find both likely and unacceptable. The Committee may

view the current tautness in labor markets as pointing so strongly toward a pickup in

inflation that the need to firm policy would be unlikely to be called into question by new

information arriving over the next few months. Even if the Committee questioned whether



-11 -

current labor market conditions were so problematic, it may still see a substantial risk that

resource utilization is in the process of tightening further, which in turn would induce rising

inflation. The growth of aggregate demand has continued to outstrip that of aggregate

supply, and only limited data are in hand to indicate that demand will be slowing enough to

bring the two into balance. Indeed, one risk to that balancing is that policy inaction would

provide additional fuel to investor optimism, pushing equity prices higher and providing a

spur to spending. Another risk may emanate from the external sector: Recent news on

foreign economies has been upbeat and has contributed to better conditions in their capital

markets, which may provide more impetus to spending than projected by the staff. The

inflationary impulse from the external sector would be intensified if improving foreign

growth prospects and mounting U.S. net foreign indebtedness were to diminish the appetite

of global investors for dollar assets, placing substantial downward pressure on the dollar,

which would directly feed through to prices as well as demand for U.S. output. To offset

these external forces, firmer financial conditions in the United States would be necessary to

damp domestic demand so as to prevent an intensification of pressures on resources.

(12) The choice of the 1/4 percentage point rise in the funds rate under alternative

C may incline the Committee to return to a symmetric directive. An unbiased directive

could convey a sense that policy makers thought they might have put sufficient cumulative

restraint in place to check inflation or, at least, to buy some time to assess whether

additional firming was needed. Alternatively, the Committee may decide to retain an

asymmetric directive in order to transmit its impression that, despite the higher 5-1/2



-12-

percent funds rate, the risks over a longer time period would still be tilted in the direction of

heightened inflation pressures. If the Committee wanted to be sure that market

uncertainties about near-term policy action did not unduly contribute to strains in the runup

to year end, the announcement could convey a disinclination to act in December.

(13) While financial markets are somewhat illiquid, confidence about Y2K

preparedness and procedures to contain systemic problems has been growing, suggesting

that the 1/4 percentage point firming at this meeting under alternative C--although a bit of a

surprise--would be unlikely to create undue strains. The response of key financial prices

would depend importantly on the type of tilt and the wording of the announcement. An

asymmetric directive and words emphasizing continuing inflation risks over a longer time

period would impart to market participants the impression that further tightening moves

could well be in store beginning fairly early next year. In that case, an appreciable backup in

bond yields, sell-off of stocks, and strengthening of the exchange value of the dollar could

be anticipated. In contrast, a symmetric directive and an announcement suggesting that the

Committee could well stay its hand for some time could lead market participants to mark

down their expectations for cumulative monetary policy tightening and reduce their

uncertainty about near-term actions. In such a case, bond and stock prices could dip only

slightly.

(14) Under either alternative, the staff projects that domestic nonfinancial debt will

grow about 6-1/4 percent over the four quarters of this year, outpacing the expected

nominal GDP growth of 5-1/4 percent but staying within its 3 to 7 percent annual range.



-13-

Such an outcome would imply expansion of total debt at a 4-3/4 percent rate over the last

three months of the year. This slowing is accounted for by a paydown of debt in the federal

sector on a seasonally adjusted basis, and lower borrowing in the business and municipal

sectors, where Y2K concerns are anticipated to reduce participation by both issuers and

investors. After the turn of the year, debt growth should turn up slightly, owing primarily to

a rebound in business borrowing. Even so, at an anticipated 5 percent pace over the first

quarter, debt growth would still be on a slower track than the one laid down so far this year.

Although financial conditions should ease a little early next year after the passage of the

century date change, lenders and investors are expected to be a bit more cautious on balance

in extending credit over the forecast period as economic expansion moderates and profit

margins erode.

(15) Under alternative B, the staff expects that M2 will grow 6 percent this year

and M3 7-1/4 percent, compared with the 5 and 6 percent upper bounds of their respective

annual ranges. Built into these projections is a pickup in growth over the last two months

of the year to a 8-1/4 percent pace for M2 and an 11-1/4 percent pace for M3. The staff

estimates that approximately 2 and 3 percentage points of these respective growth rates will

be attributable to the impact of Y2K concerns in temporarily boosting demands for

monetary assets that are regarded as safe and liquid. These effects are reversed by the end

of February. Smoothing through Y2K effects, the staff forecasts M2 and M3 to expand

from October to March at rates of 6-1/2 and 7-1/4 percent, respectively.
