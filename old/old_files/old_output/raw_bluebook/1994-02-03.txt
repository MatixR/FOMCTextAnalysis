MONETARY POLICY ALTERNATIVES

Recent Developments

(1) Federal funds generally traded quite close to the in-

tended level of 3 percent during the intermeeting period.1 In the

maintenance period spanning year-end, reserve needs were considerable,

reflecting seasonal movements in currency and required reserves as

well as an enlarged demand for excess reserves. To meet these needs,

the Desk arranged a number of rounds of term System repurchase agree-

ments and, as a result, federal funds continued to trade at around

3 percent over year-end and pressures on other money markets were

muted.

(2) Most other market interest rates declined 10 to 20 basis

points, and stock price indexes posted new records over the intermeet-

ing period. Market participants were encouraged by generally good

news on inflation; this information, along with a sense that the

severe weather and earthquake would make it more difficult in early

1994 to gauge the trajectory of the economy, led market participants

to postpone when an expected tightening of monetary policy would

occur. Still, the economy is seen as reasonably robust, and policy

firming is expected to commence within a few months to counteract a

potential buildup of inflation pressures.

1. The allowance for adjustment and seasonal borrowing was kept at
$50 million. Actual borrowing averaged $107 million over the two
complete maintenance periods since the December meeting. Borrowing
spiked on the final day of the first maintenance period when market
factors drained an unexpectedly large volume of nonborrowed reserves;
it also jumped on the second Tuesday of the second maintenance period
in association with computer problems at a large clearing organization
that delayed its wiring of funds to banks.



(3) The dollar's weighted-average foreign exchange value was

about unchanged on balance over the intermeeting period. The dollar

appreciated a little more than 1 percent relative to the mark and less

relative to other European currencies, against the background of

strong U.S. economic data and sluggish economic activity in continen-

tal Europe. Although the Bundesbank's stance in money markets was

unchanged, three-month rates in Germany declined 20 basis points,

while long-term rates were little changed. The dollar depreciated

about 1-1/2 percent against the yen in the context of renewed expres-

sions of U.S. concerns over bilateral trade issues with Japan.

Japanese short- and long-term interest rates rose 10 and 35 basis

points, respectively.

The Desk did not intervene.

(4) The monetary data in this bluebook reflect annual bench-

mark adjustments and seasonal factor revisions. These data con-

firm that M2 rose 1.4 percent from 1992:Q4 to 1993:Q4, within its

downward-revised 1 to 5 percent annual range.3,4 M3 expanded

0.6 percent, also within its reduced 0 to 4 percent range. The in-

creases in both aggregates were not much different than in 1992, and

their velocities climbed considerably further, reflecting the evolving

pattern of financial intermediation: Investors diverted considerable

2. Data incorporating the benchmark adjustments and seasonal
revisions are scheduled to be published in early February and are
strictly confidential until that time. The revisions are discussed in
appendix A.

3. Ml increased 10.5 percent last year. With currency and
transactions deposits both expanding strongly, the monetary base rose
10.4 percent and total reserves increased 12.3 percent. Mortgage
refinancing activity and foreign demands for currency together are
estimated to have added around 3 percentage points to Ml growth and
1 percentage point to M2 growth over 1993.

4. M2 plus bond and stock mutual funds is estimated to have
increased 5-1/2 percent in 1993.



balances from deposits to long-term mutual funds, prompted by a still-

steep yield curve and capital gains in bond and stock markets; bor-

rowers concentrated their funds-raising in long-term markets to take

advantage of the low cost of capital, and thus relied relatively

little on bank credit. Moreover, thrift institution assets continued

to contract. Total domestic nonfinancial debt rose 4.9 percent on a

fourth-quarter-to-fourth-quarter basis, inside its 4 to 8 percent

monitoring range. Nonfederal debt growth firmed further, especially

in the second half of the year, apparently reflecting increased com-

fort with balance sheets and better prospects for employment and in-

come, but the increase in such debt still fell considerably short of

the rise in nominal spending by these sectors.

(5) Growth of the broad monetary aggregates remained rela-

tively slow over December and January, though stronger than over 1993,

with expansion of both M2 and M3 around 2 percent at an annual

rate.5 M1 slowed to a 6 percent average rate over the two months.

In addition to a drop-off in demand deposit growth, the expansion of

M1 was depressed in January--by an estimated 5-1/2 percentage points--

as a large regional bank initiated a program to sweep balances from

some customers' NOW accounts; because such funds are swept into MMDAs,

M2 and M3 are not affected by the program. Recent data on mutual

funds are especially difficult to interpret because reported flows in

December are distorted by the effects of large year-end distributions.

Nonetheless, while flows into stock funds are estimated to have re-

mained quite strong, flows into bond funds over December and early

5. On a pre-benchmark basis, growth of M2 over December and
January, at 1-1/4 percent, was below the staff projection of 2-1/2
percent growth made at the time of the December FOMC meeting. M3
growth, at 1 percent, was equal to the staff expectation. Revisions
to seasonal factors boosted measured growth of M2 and M3 in January
and will continue to increase such growth over the next two months.



January seem to have been below the pace of most of last year in

apparent reaction to the backup in rates last fall. At the M3

level, growth was buoyed by large time deposits, which expanded at the

most rapid rate since last spring, perhaps in association with a

modest acceleration of bank credit, but larger runoffs in its other

components served to slow M3 on balance.7  In January, both

aggregates are within their provisional ranges for 1994.

(6) Nonfederal credit growth seems to be maintaining the

somewhat brisker pace set this past autumn. The pickup remains most

evident among households. Consumer installment credit appears to have

expanded at a robust rate in December, and bank data for January

suggest continued strong growth. Net home mortgage borrowing likely

also continued apace: Although refinancing activity dropped sharply

as mortgage rates stabilized above their October lows, the strength in

sales of new and existing homes no doubt contributed to demand for

mortgage credit. In the business sector, credit demands may have

picked up a little. Business loans at banks are estimated to have

expanded appreciably on average over December and January,

accompanying indications of further easing of loan terms and standards

in the latest Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey. Gross issuance of

bonds by nonfinancial corporations over the past two months remained

considerably below the 1993 average, but much of the fall-off was

probably in refinancing activity. In the tax-exempt sector,

securities issuance rebounded strongly in December, but has dropped

6. M2 plus bond and stock mutual funds is estimated to have
expanded at an average 4 percent rate in December and January.

7. Bank credit is estimated to have expanded at about a 4 percent
rate in January. Part of this growth reflects a change in accounting
procedures that inflates growth of "other securities." Beginning in
January, banks must report on their balance sheets the cash value of
off-balance-sheet items such as swaps and options.

off that pace this month. Reflecting swings in federal debt growth,

total domestic nonfinancial sector debt rose at a 7-1/2 percent rate

in December, but probably slowed this month and remained within its

provisional 4 to 8 percent range for 1994.

Long-Run Scenarios

(7) The scenarios shown in this section are designed to

illustrate several issues related to the conduct of monetary policy

over the rest of this decade. The first set examines three alterna-

tive strategies for policy, each striking a different balance over the

intermediate run between progress toward price stability and progress

toward full employment. The baseline begins with the Greenbook pro-

jection for 1994 and 1995 and continues with a judgmental extension

out through 1999. The baseline strategy maintains a modest degree of

slack in resource utilization and thus makes a little further progress

against inflation. The tighter strategy makes more progress toward

the objective of price stability, while the easier policy moves the

economy to full employment fairly promptly and keeps it there. The

alternatives to the baseline were derived using staff econometric

models of the U.S. and foreign economies. Summary information about

these simulations is presented in the table on the next page and in

Chart 1.

(8) A number of assumptions play key roles in the scenarios.

In the framework underlying these scenarios, the change in the rate of

inflation is influenced mainly by the gap between the natural rate of

unemployment and the actual rate; roughly speaking, a 1 percentage

point gap, maintained for one year, reduces the rate of inflation

about 1/2 percentage point. The natural rate itself is expected to

edge down slightly from its current level of around 6-1/2 percent (as

measured on the new 1994 survey basis), as the dislocations stemming

from defense downsizing and corporate restructuring abate. The growth

rate of potential GDP is assumed to average close to 2-1/2 percent

over the period of the scenarios. Federal fiscal policy is assumed to

remain on a moderately restrictive trajectory over the next few years,

with the structural deficit declining from 2-3/4 percent of potential

GDP in 1993 to 2 percent in 1994 and then holding at roughly 1-1/2

percent for the remainder of the projection period. Money growth is

assumed to return gradually to a more typical alignment with nominal

income growth: the forces disrupting this relationship ebb as the

yield curve returns to a more normal slope and portfolios become more

fully adjusted to the increased availability of mutual funds. 8

(9) Under the baseline policy, the Committee holds the funds

rate at 3 percent into the summer before raising it over the next two

years. To maintain some slack in resource utilization, and thus to

keep inflation edging lower, short-term real interest rates need to

rise from their currently low levels only gradually in light of fiscal

consolidation at home and sluggish growth abroad. As foreign econo-

mies recover and fiscal consolidation comes to an end, the funds rate

rises to about 4-1/2 percent in nominal terms in 1996. Given the

inflation rate prevailing at that time, this level of the funds rate

translates to about 2 percent in real terms. In turn, this level of

the real funds rate and associated levels of long rates in real terms

are sufficient to keep inflation tilting down. By the end of the

period, inflation in the CPI excluding food and energy falls to about

2-1/4 percent. M2 gradually accelerates over the decade as velocity

shifts diminish.

(10) The more rapid progress toward price stability under

the tighter policy involves an unemployment rate over the forecast

period that averages about 1/4 percentage point above that in the

baseline strategy. This additional slack is obtained by moving the

funds rate up more promptly than in the baseline--indeed, starting in

the current quarter. With real interest rates higher, the interest-

sensitive portion of domestic spending is damped; dollar appreciation

also checks aggregate demand and puts additional downward pressure on

prices. Inflation comes down to 1-1/2 percent by 1999 and is headed

and income.



still lower from there. If the anti-inflation resolve embodied in the

tighter policy were to reinforce the credibility of the Committee's

commitment to price stability, an even more rapid decline in inflation

might result.

(11) The greater employment gains delivered by the easier

policy come at the expense of any further progress in reducing infla-

tion. To implement this strategy, the Committee is assumed to keep

the funds rate at 3 percent into early 1995. The dollar is lower than

under the baseline strategy, and part of the economic stimulus and of

the upward pressure on prices comes from the foreign sector. Given

the low level of short-term real interest rates, a 3 percent funds

rate probably is not sustainable, and the Committee eventually must

shift toward a more restrictive stance in order to prevent a pickup in

inflation--indeed, temporarily pushing the nominal funds rate above

that in the baseline.

(12) The outcomes under these three strategies depend impor-

tantly on underlying judgments about the labor-market threshold for

the emergence of faster inflation and about the near-term strength of

aggregate demand. Charts 2 and 3 present scenarios based on alter-

native assumptions about these key elements of the macroeconomy. A

critical aspect in the design of each of these scenarios is the speci-

fication of the responses of monetary policy to these different macro-

economic circumstances. The responses shown are intended to be il-

lustrative of actions that might be taken by a policymaker who places

some weight on both inflation and unemployment in the intermediate

run.

(13) Chart 2 focuses on the implications of different levels

of the natural rate. As before, the solid lines present the baseline

scenario, which embodies a natural rate of around 6-1/2 percent. The

dashed lines present a scenario based on an assumed natural rate of

about 7 percent (just under 6-1/2 percent on the old basis). The lack

of much deceleration in wage inflation this past year may suggest that

the implications of this possibility are worth contemplating. In this

circumstance, the inflation rate currently would be under some upward

pressure, and the Committee is assumed to adopt a more restrictive

stance of policy as that pressure becomes more evident; relative to

the baseline, the funds rate is about 50 basis points higher by the

end of this year and 100 basis points higher by the end of 1995. Even

this tighter stance of policy is not sufficient to prevent a slight

pickup in inflation, given both an assumed lag in identification of

the higher natural rate and the lag in the response of the economy to

the change in policy. Nonetheless, the specified policy eventually

restores a downward tilt to inflation, albeit on a higher trajectory

than in the baseline. In contrast, if the natural rate is about

6 percent (which is equivalent to the 5-1/2 percent rate, on the cur-

rent basis that some economists have asserted) then there is consider-

ably more slack in resource utilization than is assumed in the base-

line. In these circumstances, the Committee could maintain the funds

rate at 3 percent for longer and tighten by less. Even with lower

unemployment rates, it would still make more rapid progress toward

price stability, as illustrated by the dotted lines in Chart 2.

(14) Finally, Chart 3 examines the implications of alterna-

tive assumptions about the strength of aggregate demand this year.

The dotted lines in Chart 3 depict a scenario in which growth of ag-

gregate demand is about 1 percentage point greater in 1994 than in the

baseline, while the dashed lines plot the symmetric case of weaker

aggregate demand. In the case of stronger aggregate demand, the Com-

mittee is assumed to begin moving the funds rate up sooner and by

considerably more this year than in the baseline, as incoming data

reveal the demand shift. Still, the unemployment rate falls fairly

rapidly--to below the natural rate until the tighter policy takes

hold--and inflation edges higher for a time. By contrast, in the case

of a shortfall in demand, the Committee is assumed to ease the stance

of policy for about a year. Nonetheless, the unemployment rate moves

up to about 7-1/4 percent and inflation slows rapidly. Eventually,

however, the lower level of interest rates supports sufficient growth

to bring the unemployment rate back down.

Long-Run Ranges

(15) To aid the Committee in selecting its money and debt

growth ranges for 1994, presented below are the staff's projections

and the provisional ranges for 1994 that were selected by the Commit-

tee last July.9

Actual Staff Forecast Provisional
Growth for Q4 to Q4 1993 1994 1995 1994 Range

M2 1.4 2 2-1/2 1-5
M3 .6 1-1/2 2 0-4
Debt 4.9 5-1/2 5-1/4 4-8

Nonfederal component 3.7 5-1/4 4-3/4

M1 10.5 6-1/2 2-1/2

Nominal GDP 5.1 5-1/2 4-1/2

(16) The projections of money and credit are consistent with

the Greenbook forecast of the economy. In that forecast, growth of

nominal GDP in 1994 strengthens a touch from the pace of 1993 before

slowing some in 1995 to keep inflation pointed down, albeit modestly,

as the economy approaches its potential. As noted in the previous

section, real and nominal short-term interest rates rise beginning in

the second half of 1994. Long-term rates edge lower over the next few

quarters as economic activity decelerates and underlying inflation

remains relatively low. Long rates firm a bit subsequently along with

the upward movement of short-term rates.

(17) With spending in the staff forecast expected to grow a

shade faster than in 1993 and impediments to borrowing and lending

considerably diminished, private credit growth over 1994 is projected

to remain around the somewhat elevated pace of the second half of

1993. In the business sector, external financing needs rise along

with capital outlays, as internal funds expand only sluggishly. While

9. Ranges for previous years and outcomes are shown in appendix B.



-14-

financial conditions will continue to favor raising funds in capital

markets, the more willing lending posture of banks and the expanding

financing needs of those without access to open markets will boost

business loans at banks. Household borrowing should slow a little

from the brisk pace of late, in keeping with a cresting of housing

activity and less rapid growth in spending on durable goods. Mean-

while, borrowing by governments, both federal and municipal, will

moderate with the projected improvement in fiscal positions and sharp-

ly curtailed advance refundings of state and local debt. Overall debt

of domestic nonfinancial sectors is projected to grow 5-1/2 percent

this year, in line with nominal output. (See chart 4.)

(18) M3 in 1994 should be boosted by stronger funding needs

of depository institutions. Although bank credit is expected to

continue to grow at the moderate 5 percent pace posted in 1993, the

contraction in thrift credit should cease. Moreover, banks are ex-

pected to rely less on non-M3 sources; with capital at high levels,

they are presumed to issue a smaller volume of bonds and equity, more

than offsetting further increases in FHLB advances. On balance, M3 is

projected to expand 1-1/2 percent in 1994, a percentage point faster

than in 1993.

(19) The staff projects that M2 will grow 2 percent in 1994,

a bit faster than in 1993. M2 velocity is projected to rise by about

3-1/2 percent in 1994 as households continue to redirect savings into

mutual funds, whose yields would remain well above those on deposits

and whose availability will be further enhanced by increased offerings

through banks. However, this rise in velocity would be the smallest

since 1991. Acting to boost M2 growth and slow velocity increases is

the expectation that households will show a little less appetite for

longer-term investments, especially bond and stock mutual funds. The

flattening of the yield curve and smaller capital gains may reduce

incentives to shift portfolios; greater emphasis by bank and securi-

ties regulators on disclosure of risks inherent in such instruments

might also be a factor.10  On the other hand, the drop-off in mort-

gage refinancing from the torrid pace of late 1993 will depress the

demand deposit component of M2 and limit the pickup in M2 growth this

year. In addition, the rise in short-term interest rates later this

year will restrain M2 growth, mainly through its effects on M1. M1 is

projected to slow appreciably, to 6-1/2 percent in 1994. The new

program to sweep balances from NOW accounts to MMDAs at a regional

bank will shave M1 growth by about 3/4 of a percentage point, but will

have no effect on M2. The velocity of M1 is projected to fall

only marginally in 1994, after three years of very large declines.

(20) In 1995, debt growth is projected to grow at a pace

near that of 1994, exceeding somewhat the growth of income. The broad

money aggregates, however, strengthen a little further as intermedia-

tion patterns move closer to historic norms. Thus, despite the moder-

ation in nominal GDP in the staff forecast, M2 growth is projected to

pick up to 2-1/2 percent next year. Contributing to this pickup is

the expectation of a further reduction in the pace of household in-

vestment in competing instruments--especially bond and stock funds--as

the yield curve continues to flatten and portfolio allocations move

closer to desired alignments. Moreover, the drag on M2 in 1994 from

the slowdown in mortgage refinancing activity should not persist into

1995. The firming in short-term interest rates is likely to exert a

small degree of restraint on M2 but much more on its M1 component,

which is projected to grow only 2-1/2 percent in 1995. Faster growth

10. M2 plus is projected to grow on the order of 4 to 5 percent
over 1994, implying a small rise in its velocity.

11. We are not assuming any significant spread of this program to
other depositories in the current year; the complexity of the software
is said to require long development times.

in M2 in 1995 is expected to show through to M3, which is projected to

pick up to 2 percent next year.

(21) Two alternatives are shown below for ranges for the

broad monetary aggregates and debt for 1994. Even though the Commit-

tee has reduced the importance of these financial aggregates in its

conduct of policy and market participants accordingly attach less

significance to them, the selection of ranges still can convey useful

information to the public about the Committee's expectations for

growth in money and credit consistent with its outlook and intentions

for the economy and inflation. Alternative I consists of the pro-

visional ranges set by the Committee in July for 1994, which were

identical to those put in effect last summer for 1993. Alternative II

lowers the ranges for M2 and debt, centering them on the staff's pro-

jections.

Alternative Money and Debt Ranges for 1994
(Percent)

Alt. I
1993 (Provisional Memo: Staff

ranges ranges) Alt. II projection

M2 1-5 1-5 0-4 2
M3 0-4 0-4 0-4 1-1/2
Debt 4-8 4-8 3-1/2 - 7-1/2 5-1/2

(22) In addition to being about centered on the staff's

projections for money and credit, alternative II might be selected as

a means of underscoring the Committee's commitment to containing and

reducing inflation. If, for example, a pickup in money growth were to

accompany a continued strong and potentially overheating economy, the

Committee might be better positioned to take and explain prompt ac-

tions under this alternative than under the higher provisional ranges.

Moreover, if the Committee tightened reserve conditions to forestall a

potential strengthening of inflation pressures or to bring inflation

down more rapidly--as in the tighter scenario above--the alternative



-17-

II ranges would allow more scope for the lower money growth that might

accompany moderate nominal GDP expansion with higher interest rates

than in the staff forecast. This alternative might also be favored if

it were thought that further large downward shifts in M2 demand are

still in prospect, posing a significant risk that M2 in 1994 could

come in below the lower end of its provisional range, even under the

staff economic forecast.

(23) The staff's M2 forecast is in the lower half of the

alternative I range. This range allows for a greater move toward more

normal velocity behavior than the staff has assumed, should, for

example, public appetites for mutual funds fall off more rapidly than

expected. Even absent such a shift, the alternative I ranges would

not necessarily present problems should the Committee substantially

firm reserve conditions. The responsiveness of M2 to movements in

short-term rates has been muted in recent years, and growth of this

aggregate could still exceed 1 percent if short-term rates rose sig-

nificantly. In part this is because rising short-term rates are like-

ly to be accompanied by some declines in bond and possibly stock

prices, damping shifts to mutual funds from M2 and supporting the

aggregate's growth. Moreover, the M2 ranges in alternative I would be

consistent with the attainment of price stability in the context of a

return over time to a flat trend in M2 velocity, as the staff assumed

in constructing the money growth rates for the long-run strategies.

With flat velocity, M2 growth of about 3 percent--the midpoint of

alternative I--would accompany nominal income growth of the same

magnitude consistent with the staff's estimate of growth in potential

output, given the upward bias in measured inflation rates.



-18-

Short-Run Policy Alternatives

(24) Three policy alternatives are presented below for Com-

mittee consideration. Alternative B involves a continuation of feder-

al funds trading around 3 percent and of adjustment plus seasonal

borrowing averaging initially about $50 million.12  Under alterna-

tive C, the federal funds rate would increase to around 3-1/2 percent

in association with a rise in the borrowing allowance to $75 million.

Alternative A embodies a downward adjustment of the federal funds rate

to 2-1/2 percent and of the borrowing allowance to $25 million.

(25) Market participants now anticipate continuation of the

money market conditions implied by alternative B over the near term,

and FOMC choice of this alternative would not engender any immediate

reaction in security markets. Investors generally expect the Federal

Reserve to put off any policy tightening for a time, given

uncertainties about the extent of moderation in economic activity and

about developing price trends in early 1994--uncertainties that have

been heightened by the earthquake and severe weather. Nevertheless,

most anticipate a tightening within a few months as incoming data

suggest only a limited slowing in economic growth and a cessation of

disinflation. As the intermeeting period progresses, economic data

along the lines of the staff forecast might put modest upward pressure

on short-term interest rates as the time of expected tightening

approaches, but would induce little systematic movement in longer-term

rates. The exchange value of the dollar also is likely to trade in a

relatively narrow range around current levels.

(26) The firming in the stance of policy under alternative C

would come sooner than now built into market quotes and would be re-

flected in increases in short-term rates nearly equal to the 50 basis

12. The borrowing allowance may need to be raised toward the end of
this intermeeting period to take account of the usual rise in seasonal
borrowing.



-19-

point hike in the federal funds rate. The action might help to

resolve any questions about whether the Federal Reserve would take

steps to contain price pressures in advance of actual increases in

inflation. If so, forward interest rates further out the yield curve

might eventually even adjust down slightly, tempering the ultimate

rise in longer-term rates. The exchange value of the dollar would

tend to move higher with the more attractive real returns on U.S.

versus foreign financial assets.

(27) The easing of policy under alternative A would come as

more of a surprise to market participants. Some could interpret the

action as a response by Federal Reserve policymakers to weaker inter-

nal economic forecasts than the market consensus, perhaps owing to

concerns about upcoming fiscal drag. But others would be led to

question the Federal Reserve's anti-inflationary resolve. In those

circumstances, an adverse impact on inflation expectations could well

result, preventing much of a decline in bond yields. Even the fall in

short-term rates could be muted by the view that the policy ease would

soon have to be reversed to forestall excessive price pressures. The

dollar's exchange value could be lowered by both the reduced U.S.

short-term rates and heightened concerns about U.S. inflation.

(28) Growth of the monetary aggregates projected under all

three policy alternatives from January to June is shown in the table

below. (More detailed data are presented in the table and charts on

the following pages.) Under all the alternatives, M2 growth is ex-

pected to be in the neighborhood of 2 percent and M3 growth a little

over 1 percent. Consequently, these aggregates would be positioned at

midyear well within their provisional ranges, with M2 in its lower

portion and M3 somewhat below its midpoint. As usual, only modest

growth differentials are envisioned across the three alternatives,

mirroring the low sensitivity to short-term rates of M2 and M3 so far

in the 1990s.

M3 1-3/4 1-1/2 1-1/4
M1 7-1/4 6-3/4 6-1/4

(29) M2 growth likely will be held down under alternative B

by a reversal of the previous bulge attributable to mortgage refinanc-

ing activity, which had boosted average M2 growth by an estimated 1

percentage point during the October through December months, before

becoming a minor drag in January. Over the February-to-June period,

falling prepayments of mortgage-backed securities are projected to

deduct 1 to 2 percentage points from M2 growth.13 Nevertheless, the

underlying trend of M2 is anticipated to strengthen enough to leave

actual M2 growth at a 2 percent rate from January to June. Inflows to

bond and stock mutual funds through June should be somewhat weaker

than the pace of last year, as a result of the flatter yield curve and

likely smaller capital gains. 14  In addition, previous declines in

offering rates on liquid deposits evidently have brought them into

full alignment with money market rates, so this drag on M2 expansion

13. With demand deposits most affected by mortgage refinancing
activity, M1 growth from January to June will be depressed by around
4 percentage points by this special factor under alternative B.
Growth of M1 is projected at 6-3/4 percent over this period, implying
growth of total reserves and the monetary base of 4-3/4 and 9-1/2
percent, respectively.

14. The staff projects that M2 plus bond and stock mutual funds will
grow at about a 4 percent rate from January to June.

may well have finally played itself out. Even so, the underlying

trend of M2 growth is likely to remain below that of nominal spending,

as some of the anomalous weakness relative to historical patterns that

surfaced in the 1990s is assumed to persist.

(30) M3 is projected to expand at a 1-1/4 percent rate from

January to June under alternative B. The growth of debt of domestic

nonfederal sectors from December to June is projected at a 5-1/4 per-

cent rate, sustaining the faster growth rate recorded during the

fourth quarter of last year. The overall debt aggregate is foreseen

as expanding at a 5-1/2 percent rate through midyear, leaving this

measure somewhat below the midpoint of its provisional monitoring

range.



-23-

Directive Language

(31) Presented below for Committee consideration is draft

language relating to the Humphrey-Hawkins ranges for 1994 and the

operating paragraph for the intermeeting period.

1994 Ranges

The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary

and financial conditions that will foster price stabil-

ity and promote sustainable growth in output. In fur-

therance of these objectives, the Committee at THIS {DEL: its

meeting in July lowered the] ESTABLISHED ranges {DEL: it had

established in February] for growth of M2 and M3 OF ____

TO ____ [DEL: ranges of 1 to 5] percent and ____ TO ___ [DEL:0 to 4]

percent respectively, measured from the fourth quarter

of 1993 -199-2 to the fourth quarter of 1994 [DEL: 1993]. The

Committee anticipated that developments contributing to

unusual velocity increases COULD [DEL: would] persist [DEL: over the

balance of] DURING the year and that money growth within

these [DEL:lower] ranges would be consistent with its broad

policy objectives. The monitoring range for growth of

total domestic nonfinancial debt also was SET AT ___ TO

____ lowered to 4 to 8 percent for the year. [DEL: For 1994,

the Committee agreed on tentative ranges for monetary

growth-, measured from the fourth quarter of 1993 to the

fourth quarter of 1994, of 1 to 5 percent for M2 and

0 to 4 percent for M3. The Committee provisionally set

the monitoring range for growth of total domestic

nonfinancial debt at 4 to 8 percent for 1994.] The

behavior of the monetary aggregates will continue to be

evaluated in the light of progress toward price level



-24-

stability, movements in their velocities, and develop-

ments in the economy and financial markets.

OPERATIONAL PARAGRAPH

In the implementation of policy for the immediate

future, the Committee seeks to DECREASE SOMEWHAT/main-

tain/INCREASE SOMEWHAT the existing degree of pressure

on reserve positions. In the context of the Commit-

tee's long-run objectives for price stability and sus-

tainable economic growth, and giving careful considera-

tion to economic, financial, and monetary developments,

slightly (SOMEWHAT) greater reserve restraint (WOULD/

MIGHT) or slightly (SOMEWHAT) lesser reserve restraint

(WOULD) might be acceptable in the intermeeting period.

The contemplated reserve conditions are expected to be

consistent with moderate (MODEST) growth in M2 and M3

over THE FIRST HALF OF 1994 coming months.



APPENDIX A

MONEY STOCK REVISIONS

Measures of the money stock have been revised to incorporate
the results of the annual benchmark and seasonal factor review. The
attached tables compare growth rates of the old and revised series.
These data should be regarded as strictly confidential until their
release to the public in early February.

Benchmark Revisions

Data for the monetary aggregates have been benchmarked using
call reports through September 1993 and other sources. The benchmark
revisions did not affect the annual growth rates of M1, M2, or M3 over
1993. and for earlier years annual growth rates were revised by no
more than .2 percentage point.

The benchmark folded in historical data for several money
market mutual funds that began reporting for the first time during
1993, and, based on new information from the Investment Company
Institute, also reclassified some institutional money funds as retail
money funds, moving them from non-M2 M3 into M2. These revisions were
distributed over a number of years; by the fourth quarter of 1993,
they raised the level of M2 by $14 billion and the level of M3 by $11
billion. The benchmark also incorporated new estimates of money
funds' holdings of overnight RPs, which are netted out of the
aggregates at both the M2 and M3 levels. These revisions, which
extend back to 1975, shifted up the level of M2 by as much as $5
billion and the level of M3 by as much as $8 billion over the last
decade. Numerous other, smaller revisions were also made to the
aggregates.

The scope of the annual benchmark was somewhat smaller this
year than in past years. Beginning in 1993, we have begun to
incorporate certain data series from Call reports into the aggregates
as soon as these series become available. In previous years, these
data were folded in only at the time of the annual benchmark.

Seasonal Factor Revisions

Seasonal factors for the monetary aggregates have been
revised using the X-11 ARIMA procedure applied to the benchmarked data
through December 1993. The seasonal adjustment procedure used this
year is identical to that employed for the past few years.

Overall, the revisions to seasonal factors shifted the growth
of the major monetary aggregates from the second half to the first
half of the year 1993. The growth rates for the first half of 1993
were raised 1.0 percentage point for M1, and 0.3 percentage point for
M2 and for M3, with corresponding downward revisions in the second
half of the year.

ADOPTED LONGER-RUN GROWTH RATE RANGES FOR THE MONETARY AND CREDIT AGGREGATES
(percent annual rates)

Domestic Non-
M1 M2 M3 financial Debt1

NOTE: Numbers in parentheses are actual growth rates as reported at end of policy period in February Monetary Policy Report to
Congress. Subsequent revisions to historical data (not reflected above) have altered growth rates by up to a few tenths of a percent.

n.s.--not specified.

Footnotes on following page



1. Targets are for bank credit until 1983; from 1983 onward targets are for domestic nonfinancial sector debt.

2. The figures shown reflect target and actual growth of M1-B in 1980 and shift-adjusted M1-B in 1981. M1-B was relabel-
led M1 in January 1982. The targeted growth for M1-A was 3-1/2 to 6 percent in 1980 (actual growth was 5.0 percent); in
1981 targeted growth for shift-adjusted M1-A was 3 to 5-1/2 percent (actual growth was 1.3 percent).

3. When these ranges were set, shifts into other checkable deposits in 1980 were expected to have only a limited effect on
growth of M1-A and M1-B. As the year progressed, however, banks offered other checkable deposits more actively, and
more funds than expected were directed to these accounts. Such shifts are estimated to have decreased M1-A growth and in-
creased M1-B growth each by at least 1/2 percentage point more than had been anticipated.

4. Adjusted for the effects of shifts out of demand deposits and savings deposits. At the February FOMC meeting, the tar-
get ranges for observed M1-A and M1-B in 1981 on an unadjusted basis, expected to be consistent with the adjusted ranges,
were -4-1/2 to -2 and 6 to 8-1/2 percent respectively. Actual M1-B growth (not shift adjusted) was 5.0 percent.

5. Adjusted for shifts of assets from domestic banking offices to International Banking Facilities.

6. Range for bank credit is annualized growth from the December 1981-January 1982 average level through the fourth quar-
ter of 1982.

7. Base period, adopted at the July 1983 FOMC meeting, is QII'83. At the February 1983 meeting, the FOMC had adopted
a QIV'82 to QIV'83 target range for M1 of 4 to 8 percent.

8. Base period is the February-March 1983 average.

9. Base period, adopted at the July 1985 FOMC meeting, is QII'85. At the February 1985 meeting, the FOMC had adopted
a QIV'84 to QIV'85 target range for M1 of 4 to 7 percent.

10. No range for M1 has been specified since the February 1987 FOMC meeting because of uncertainties about its underly-
ing relationship to the behavior of the economy and its sensitivity to economic and financial circumstances.

11. At the February 1990 meeting, the FOMC specified a range of 2-1/2 to 6-1/2 percent. This range was lowered to 1 to 5
percent at the July 1990 meeting.

12. At the February 1993 meeting, the FOMC specified a range of 2 to 6 percent for M2, 1/2 to 4-1/2 percent for M3, and
4-1/2 to 8-1/2 percent for domestic nonfinancial debt. These ranges were lowered to 1 to 5 percent for M2, 0 to 4 percent
for M3, and 4 to 8 percent for domestic nonfinancial debt at the July 1993 meeting.
