Prefatory Note 

 
 

The attached document represents the most complete and accurate version 
available based on original copies culled from the files of the FOMC Secretariat at the 
Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System.  This electronic document was 
created through a comprehensive digitization process which included identifying the best-
preserved paper copies, scanning those copies,1 and then making the scanned versions 
text-searchable.2  Though a stringent quality assurance process was employed, some 
imperfections may remain. 
 

Please note that this document may contain occasional gaps in the text.  These 
gaps are the result of a redaction process that removed information obtained on a 
confidential basis.  All redacted passages are exempt from disclosure under applicable 
provisions of the Freedom of Information Act.    

 

                                                 
1 In some cases, original copies needed to be photocopied before being scanned into electronic format.  All 
scanned images were deskewed (to remove the effects of printer- and scanner-introduced tilting) and lightly 
cleaned (to remove dark spots caused by staple holes, hole punches, and other blemishes caused after initial 
printing). 
2 A two-step process was used.  An advanced optimal character recognition computer program (OCR) first 
created electronic text from the document image.  Where the OCR results were inconclusive, staff checked 
and corrected the text as necessary.   Please note that the numbers and text in charts and tables were not 
reliably recognized by the OCR process and were not checked or corrected by staff.

Recent developments

(1) M2 is estimated to have expanded at about a 30 percent

annual rate in January, after having increased at a 7 percent annual

rate in December. Some of the December increase and much of the surge

in January appear to have been associated with growth in the new money

market deposit accounts (MMDAs). These accounts, which were first

offered on December 14, had grown to $210 billion by late January.

Estimates of the sources of funds diverted to MMDAs are inevitably im-

precise, but the great bulk of the inflows to MMDAs appears to have been

from other components of M2, with roughly one-fifth of the MMDA balances

representing funds shifted from outside of M2.1/ Such shifts likely

boosted M2 growth in January by about 20 percentage points.

(2) Banks and thrifts have responded to the large net inflows

into core deposits in part by running off large CDs. Thus, M3 growth--

estimated at a 1¼ percent annual rate in December and 13 percent in

January--was much less affected by the advent of MMDAs, though the net

effect of shifts into MMDAs could account for a small portion of M3

growth in January. Banks also reacted to the strong inflows into MMDAs

by making large purchases of Treasury and other securities. Reflecting

these large increases in investments as well as a modest rebound in

lending, bank credit grew at a 10½ percent annual rate in December and

an estimated 12¼ percent rate in January, a distinct pickup from recent

months. In addition, banks advanced a large volume of funds to their

overseas branches.

1/ Appendix I discusses sources of funds shifted into MMDAs and the
estimated impact on the growth rates of various aggregates.

(3) M1 is estimated to have grown at an 8¾ percent annual rate

in December and at a 12½ percent annual rate in January. Growth in January

appears to have been little affected on balance by the new deposit accounts.

Shifts out of M1 into MMDAs appear to have been minor, about offset by

relatively small shifts into super-NOW accounts from outside this aggregate.

Super-NOW accounts grew to only about $17 billion by late January.

(4) The same pattern of growth as reported above is evident in

the newly revised money stock data that incorporate definitional changes

and the annual benchmark and seasonal factor review.1/ On the revised

basis, in January M1 grew at a 9 percent annual rate, M2 29 percent, and

M3 11 percent. The definitional changes were to exclude balances in IRA

and Keogh accounts from the aggregates and to include tax-exempt money

market funds in M2 and M3. The net impact of these changes was to reduce

the annual rate of growth of M2 and M3 for 1982 by about ½ and ¼ point

to 9.2 and 10.1 percent, respectively. (Subsequent references to the

monetary aggregates in this bluebook and the data in the table on the next

page are on a revised basis.)

(5) Total and nonborrowed reserves growth slowed from about a

13 percent annual rate in December and to a 3 to 4 percent annual rate in

January. In part, the slower growth resulted from the more moderate

increases in transaction balances near year end, but it also reflected a

substantial reduction in required reserves owing to runoffs of CDs and

shifts out of savings and time deposits at member banks into MMDAs. Growth

of the monetary base, in contrast, accelerated in December and January,

aggregates with the data as previously formulated. The benchmark
revisions had no significant impact on the annual growth rates of

mainly reflecting a rebound in currency growth. The level of adjustment

(and seasonal) borrowing at the discount window implied by the reserve paths

was maintained at $200 million throughout the intermeeting period.1/ However,

with demands for excess reserves extraordinarily strong, borrowing ran

above that level until the two statement weeks just past, when it averaged

about $150 million.2/

(6) Over the intermeeting period, the funds rate generally has

been fluctuating near the 8½ percent discount rate, except around year end

when it was temporarily boosted by statement date pressures. The heavy

calendar of Treasury auctions and the attention focused on future financing

needs by recent discussion of federal budget policy have placed upward

pressure on Treasury yields in particular. Private short-term rates have

shown small mixed changes, but Treasury bill rates have risen 35 to 40

basis points on balance. In long-term markets, Treasury bond rates are

up about 60 basis points, about twice as much as corporate rates. A small

decline in tax-exempt yields appears to reflect the slackened pace of tax-

exempt offerings following the rush of new issues sold in the fourth quarter

in anticipation of new registration requirements.

(7) The dollar has appreciated by about 2 percent on a weighted

average basis and by about 5 percent against sterling since the last FOMC

meeting. The dollar dropped by about 4 percent from the December meeting

1/ See Appendix III for intermeeting reserve path adjustments.

2/ The unusually high level of excess reserves was concentrated at small
member and nonmember banks, and may reflect uncertainties caused by

the extraordinary volume of new deposit flows associated with MMDAs
and the related reduction in required reserves, changing reserve
requirements on the MMDA instrument in the wake of Congressional
legislation, and the general reduction in reserve requirements that
occurred in late December as a result of exempting the first $2.1
million of reservable liabilities.

to early January, then rose sharply afterwards as market participants

revised their expectations about the near-term course of U.S. interest

rates. Under the circumstances, expected cuts in official lending rates

in Germany and Japan did not materialize.



Longer-run targets for 1983

(8) Establishment of longer-run monetary and credit targets

for 1983 is complicated by the need to take account of the redistribution

of funds associated with introduction of MMDAs and super-NOW accounts--

in terms of both their transitional impact on growth rates and on the

longer-run behavioral characteristics of the aggregates. Moreover, other

developments also raise questions about the underlying trend of velocity.

For example, should last year's sharp declines in income velocities of

key monetary aggregates be interpreted as an indication that the public

will over time want to hold more money relative to GNP than historical

patterns would suggest? Should that be the case, velocity growth may not

show its usual cyclical recovery this year and the trend increase in, for

example, M1 velocity over longer periods may be reduced below the 3 percent

annual rate of the post-World War II period. On the other hand, last year's

unusual build-up in liquidity relative to income could be reversed this

year, with a consequent substantial rise in velocity.

(9) These various issues, among others, are involved in assessing

the tentative 1983 monetary targets set by the Committee last July and

alternatives to them. The targets set in mid-1982 for the monetary

aggregates this year were: M1, 2½ to 5½ percent; M2, 6 to 9 percent; M3,

6½ to 9½ percent. The associated range for bank credit was 6 to 9 percent.

Each of these potential ranges, and possible alternatives, is considered

in the paragraphs below, but with the credit discussion focused on total

credit.

(10) The 6 to 9 percent range for M2 applicable to growth from

QIV '82 to QIV '83 does not appear to be feasible, given the strength of

M2 growth in the early weeks of the year related to the shifts to MMDAs.



Assuming that a little more than half of the growth in MMDAs for the

year has already occurred, and that a smaller fraction will come from

market instruments as the year progresses, we would estimate that shifts

into those accounts from sources outside M2 would raise growth for the

year on the order of 3 to 4 percentage points. This would suggest for

the year 1983 that an M2 growth range of 9 to 13 percent could be generally

consistent with the lower tentative range set last year.

(11) Another possible approach to allowing for shifts into MMDAs

would be to base the M2 range for 1983 on the first quarter of the year,

instead of the fourth quarter of 1982, on the ground that the bulk, though

not all, of the year's shift will have taken place by March. An M2 growth

range based on the first quarter of 6½ to 9½ percent at an annual rate--

just ½ point higher than the present tentative range--would encompass a

subsequent underlying growth of 8 percent (the assumption underlying the

staff GNP projection) and leave scope for up to 1½ points of shift effect

over the last three quarters of the year. The staff would anticipate a

shift effect over this period of about that amount; a slightly higher

range would leave more room for the possibilities that shifting may be

greater than we have assumed or that the velocity of M2 will continue to

show an unusual decline in contrast to its more normal stability (exhibited

on average even in recovery periods).

(12) With regard to M3, it is even more problematical to ab-

stract from shifts in an effort to assess what would otherwise have occurred,

since banks have the option of permitting large CDs to run-off in adjust-

ment to MMDA inflows. In general, it might be assumed that banks and

thrifts may employ the new accounts to enhance their share of the credit

market at least to some degree. However, even so, M3 would not necessarily



increase and could even be reduced to the extent money market funds drop.

At the same time, we would expect a rather substantial moderation in

demand for bank credit from businesses this year as they continue with

strong efforts to restructure balance sheets. Thus, maintenance of the

tentative M3 range or possibly a reduction by ½ percentage point, even

with QIV '82 as a base, may be consistent with emerging institutional

developments.

(13) The introduction of MMDAs and super-NOWs thus far has

induced greater distorting effects on the growth rate of M2 than of M1.

This is not entirely unexpected, of course, since it was never clear

whether the two new accounts might or might not be offsetting in terms

of their effect on M1. Still, it remains uncertain how to interpret the

newly emerging M1 as an increasing proportion of the aggregate comes to

bear a market interest rate and is composed of savings-type deposits.1/

These uncertainties, as well as the potential for future distortions in M1

should banks begin marketing super-NOWs more aggressively, argue against

specifying a long-run range for M1 at this point.

(14) On the other hand, the apparent modest size of shifts

thus far into and out of M1 may suggest that some confidence could be placed

in a long-run M1 range. However, if one were specified, a relatively wide

range would seem advisable. We would suggest, as one alternative, a range

of 3 to 7 percent from QIV '82 to QIV '83. Assuming there are no signi-

ficant net shifts into or out of M1 as a result of the new accounts, actual

growth may be around the upper end of this range, consistent with an 8

1/ NOW accounts (including super-NOWs) were 31 percent of the deposit
component of M1 in January '83, up from 25 percent a year ago, and 9
percent in December '80 just prior to authorization of nationwide NOW
accounts.



percent "underlying" M2 growth over the balance of the year. Such M1

growth implies that its income velocity would rise only slightly over the

year, below its trend rate of the postwar period and well below its average

during cyclical recoveries. A relatively slow velocity rise in 1983 for M1

is consistent with our quarterly model's demand for money equation, given

the staff projection of GNP and relatively stable interest rates. This equa-

tion had overpredicted the demand for money for much of the period since

the mid-1970's. However, conditions leading to the earlier sharp downward

demand shifts for money--high and rising interest rates and market innova-

tions that diverted transactions funds from M1 to other instruments--have

faded. Thus, at this point we see a risk that the 2½ to 5½ percent

M1 range--which at the upper end would entail a downward demand shift

of a couple of percentage points according to our quarterly model--would

be overshot unless income is weaker than projected or interest rates rise.

(15) We would anticipate total credit growth in 1983 to be in

an 8 to 11 percent range, as measured by the expansion in domestic non-

financial debt generated out of the flow of funds accounts consistent

with the staff GNP forecast.1/ The mid-point of this range would involve

about the same rate of expansion as last year, when nominal GNP growth was

substantially less than is expected for this year. A continued expansion

of credit in excess of GNP growth during a period of economic recovery,

as is expected for this year, is somewhat unusual, but reflects growth in

1/ Past behavior in this measure of total credit, compared with other
measures of a credit total, is shown in Appendix IV in terms of

amounts, growth rates and relations to GNP. A staff memorandum
accompanying this bluebook employs a number of statistical tests to
attempt to assess the "best" measure of total credit for targeting
purposes. Use of domestic nonfinancial debt seems to be generally
reasonable, though most measures are closely grouped in their statis-
tical properties.

borrowing by sectors generating the recovery--the Federal Government

and households--while the drop-off in borrowing by the lagging sector--

businesses--is less than usual for this stage of a cycle because of the

constrained increase in their internal funds occasioned by a relatively

modest recovery.

(16) Based on the preceding discussion, the table below summarizes

what the staff believes to be a consistent set of relationships among the

money and credit aggregates for 1983, measured from QIV '82 to QIV '83.

Alternative II essentially adjusts the tentative July M2 range for the

shifts in funds generated by the new deposit accounts, and suggests ranges

for the other aggregates that the staff now believes consistent with that

M2 range. We would still expect actual growth to be toward the upper end

of all three ranges. Alternatives I and III embody somewhat easier and

tighter specifications, respectively.

M3 6½ to 9½ 6 to 9 5½ to 8½ 6½ to 9½

1/ If QI '83 were taken as a base for this aggregate, consistent growth
ranges would be 6½ to 9½ percent through 7½ to 10½ percent.

(17) The table on the next page shows possible outcomes for

alternative monetary strategies. Strategy 1 is consistent with the long-

run targets of alternative II for 1983 and assumes an 8 percent underlying

M2 growth in subsequent years. The results shown represent the staff's



-11-

judgmental GNP forecast found in the greenbook, but extended to 1985. The

consequences of other monetary strategies are based essentially on differences

derived from simulations of the quarterly econometric model. Strategy 2

assumes higher M2 growth than strategy 1 in 1983 and 1984--by 1 and ½ per-

centage point, respectively. Strategy 3 slows underlying M2 growth to

about 7 percent over the three-year period. Strategies 4 and 5 are designed

to help evaluate the implications of a possible decrease in the structural

budgetary deficit from currently projected levels.

(18) Results of the first three strategies embodying alternative

monetary approaches indicate, as would be expected, that somewhat higher

money growth leads to faster real economic expansion relative to our basic

forecast but at the expense of a slight acceleration in prices over the

three year horizon rather than a steady deceleration. A deceleration in

prices would be even sharper under the slow money growth assumption, but

accompanied by a noticeably slower economic recovery.

(19) The last two strategies assume various measures of fiscal

restraint--about equally split between spending and tax initiatives--with

effects beginning in 1983 that cumulate to a $60 billion cut in the

structural deficit by 1985. If no change is made in the basic money supply

assumption of strategy 1, the quarterly model would indicate an improved

price performance as time goes on and significantly lower short-term

interest rates, but economic recovery would be slower. However, possible

psychological benefits on longer-term interest rates, as anticipation of

credit demands and inflation are reduced, and on confidence generally from

a package of fiscal restraint would not be captured by the model. If the

tighter fiscal policy is accompanied by the more rapid money growth in

1983 and 1984 of strategy 2, the pace of economic recovery, according to

the model, is slowed only a little in the first year of recovery relative

to our basic assumption, and prices are not much affected, but short-term

interest rates are substantially lower throughout the period. As a result

growth of economic activity accelerates noticeably. The considerable

declines in short-term rates under strategy 5 would help bring long rates

down and encourage business spending on plant and equipment, unless the

more rapid expansion of money assumed in this and the next year generates

inflationary fears that work to hold up longer-term market rates--a poten-

tial reaction not incorporated in these model results.

Near-term targets

(20) Alternative short-run specifications of the monetary

aggregates for the last two months of the quarter are shown in the upper

panel of the following table, with implied growth rates for the entire

quarter shown in the second panel. These specifications are, of course,

highly uncertain, as recent developments make clear. The M2 figures shown

assume some continued shifts into that aggregate in response to the

availability of the new accounts, but at a much slower pace than in late

December and January. The figures for M3 are, we believe, likely to be

much less distorted by shifts. Because M1 thus far seems to have been

relatively little affected by the shifts, an M1 specification is also

shown. (More detailed data for the alternatives are shown in the charts

and tables on the following pages. The quarterly interest rate path

consistent with the staff's GNP projection is contained in Appendix V.)

January rates. M2 growth, however, is expected to remain quite sizable.

Under alternative B, M2 is assumed to grow at an "underlying" annual rate

of 8 percent from the end of January. Actual growth is higher because

of continued, though diminishing,shifts into MMDAs.1/ M1 growth, which

has been quite substantial for several months now, is projected to decele-

rate markedly, partly as the lagged upward effects on growth of this

2/
aggregate of earlier interest rate declines wear off.- Even so, M1 growth

on a quarterly average basis would be around 8¾ percent, implying a slight

further drop in velocity in the first quarter of the year. M3 growth over

the February-March period is expected to expand about in line with its

December-January average.

(22) Alternative B, which might be considered as most consistent

with long-run alternative II, assumes that federal funds generally trade

somewhat below the current 8 percent discount rate. Other market rates

are likely to change little between now and the next Committee meeting

under those circumstances, with the 3-month bill rate generally in an 8 to

8 percent range. Borrowing at the discount window would remain around

$200 million, with total reserves probably falling on the order of 10

percent, and nonborrowed reserves by about 7 percent, as required reserves

contract mainly reflecting continued run-offs in large CDs.

1/ Specifically, the staff is assuming that MMDA growth slows to about $12
billion per week on average in February and $8 billion per week on
average in March from the $40 billion per week pace in the last half
of December and some $30 billion per week in January. This would carry
the level of MMDAs from $200 billion the week of January 26 to about
$300 billion at the end of March. The staff estimates that shifts of
non-M2 assets to MMDAs cumulated to $42 billion by January 26; we are
assuming that only a further $15 billion of such shifts occur by the
end of the quarter. Under these assumptions, and with an 8 percent
"underlying" growth, M2 would expand at about a 12 percent annual rate
from the last week in January to the last week in March. The more rapid
two-month growth shown in the table in paragraph (20) reflects the
difference between working with monthly average figures and month-end
data in a period of rapid change.

2/ We have assumed that the DIDC will not introduce any further new deposit
instrument--such as super-NOWs for businesses--during the short-run tar-
get period. Corporate super-NOWs, as well as some other deregulation
proposals, will be considered by the DIDC at its meeting on March 1;
even if the DIDC were to authorize the former account, implementation
would likely be delayed until April.



-17-

(23) Somewhat easier market conditions are implied by alternative

A, which involves a drop in the funds rate to the 7 to 8 percent area.

Such a decline would probably entail a further ½ percentage point reduction

in the discount rate. Assuming a cut in the discount rate, the money market

specifications of alternative A would generally be consistent with borrowing

in the $150 million to $200 million range. Both short- and long-term market

rates would be expected to adjust downward. However, whether the decline

in long-term rates would be sustainable will depend in part on whether

incoming economic news and the budgetary outlook tend to raise market

concerns about the sustainability of easier money market conditions. The

dollar likely would resume its decline on foreign exchange markets.

(24) Alternative C, which appears most consistent with the

tightest of the longer-run alternatives presented, involves a rise in the

federal funds rate to the 9 percent area. Interest rates would adjust

sharply upward, particularly so over the short run in the Treasury note

and bond area where the market is in process of digesting a substantial

refunding. Private rates would also rise, and a portion of the recent

improvement in quality spreads may be reversed, as concerns about the

viability of major borrowers tend to re-emerge. Borrowing at the dis-

count window, given the present discount rate, would probably rise to

around $500 million, and nonborrowed reserves would contract by about

13 percent at an annual rate. The dollar would probably rise on foreign

exchange markets over the short run.

(25) The debt of domestic nonfinancial sectors in the first

quarter is projected to grow at an annual rate of a little over 9 percent,

little different from its rate of expansion in the fourth quarter, and

about in line with expected growth for the current year. With its need



-18-

to finance a massive deficit, the federal government will continue to be

the predominant borrower in credit markets, accounting for almost half of

total funds raised by nonfinancial sectors. Borrowing by state and local

governments is expected to drop off from the advanced fourth-quarter pace,

when it was boosted by approaching regulatory deadlines as well as lower

interest rates. Even so, fund usage by this sector should remain fairly

strong by historical standards, reflecting in part refunding and advance

refunding of securities issued earlier at higher rates. Home mortgage

takedowns are likely to increase further in lagged response to earlier rate

declines, but installment borrowing by households may ease a bit, having

been shifted to an extent to the fourth quarter by interest rate concessions

on auto financing. Even though corporations' net need for external funds

is expected to change little in the first quarter, business borrowing may

pick up somewhat from its slow fourth-quarter pace and be accompanied by

a more rapid build-up in liquid assets, which had slowed considerably in

the fourth quarter so far as can be told on the basis of limited informa-

tion. As compared with the fourth quarter, relatively more credit expansion

in the first quarter is expected to be financed by banks and other deposi-

tory institutions as they benefit from MMDA inflows. Bank credit growth

over the quarter may be in the 9 to 10 percent annual rate area.



-19-

Directive language is in the process of preparation, and a

draft will be circulated to the Committee prior to the meeting on Tuesday.

The proposed directive will attempt to take account of recent Committee

discussions of longer-run targeting issues and of related questions of

policy implementation--including problems raised by the new money market

deposit accounts, the uncertain prospects for velocity behavior, and the

weight to be given to broader aggregates, and possibly also M1, as guides

to operations.



APPENDIX I

IMPACT OF MONEY MARKET DEPOSIT ACCOUNTS AND SUPER
NOW ACCOUNTS ON THE MONETARY AGGREGATES

The introduction of the money market deposit account (MMDA), and to

a much smaller extent the super-NOW account, had a significant influence on the

behavior of the monetary aggregates in the last two months, but efforts to

determine their impact with any degree of precision are necessarily handi-

capped by the nature of the evidence available. One approach used by the

staff was to evaluate incoming data on the various money stock components in

an effort to determine sources of MMDA and super-NOW increases. Estimates

obtained were cross-checked against survey data and results of econometric

models. The staff's estimates are shown on Table I-1, which shows that

around 20 percent of MMDAs are estimated to have come from sources outside

M2, and 3 percent from M1. These estimates are about in line with the

survey and other data summarized in Table I-2.

As can be seen from the last line of Table I-2, the staff's esti-

mate that on the order of 20 percent of funds placed in MMDAs came from

instruments not included in M2 is roughly consistent with the survey informa-

tion, especially given the inclusion of some large CD funds in the time

deposit category in the table. On the other hand, this evidence suggests

that a somewhat higher proportion of MMDAs came from M1 than the staff's

estimate of 3 percent. However, the survey and econometric results likely

are biased upwards since they probably include funds in the M1 category that

were placed in transaction accounts only temporarily in the process of being

transferred to an MMDA.



-2-

As yet, there are no usable survey data for super-NOW sources.

However, responses from the Reserve Bank Contact Group on this issue indi-

cated that the bulk of the funds were shifted from other transaction accounts,

with most of the rest from savings, small time deposits and possibly sweep

arrangements involving retail RPs. These responses are consistent with our

estimate, based on observing differences in the growth of super-NOWs and

total OCD, that shifts to new transaction accounts from outside M1 amounted

to about $3-1/2 billion in January, approximately one fourth of the average

level of super-NOWs last month.

Estimating the impact of the introduction of the MMDA on M3 is more

problematical because it involves assumptions about the responses of deposi-

tory institutions to the MMDA inflow as well as the sources of the deposits.

Direct shifts of large CDs and shares in institution-only money mutual funds

into MMDAs are estimated to account for about half of the 20 percent of MMDAs

shifted from outside M2; these flows would have no direct impact on M3 growth.

Shifts from outside M3 would tend to boost growth in this aggregate, but unless

depository institutions wanted to increase their total assets or reduce other

managed liabilities, they would reduce CDs, thereby about offsetting any

potential impact on M3. In fact, the decline in large CDs has been much

greater than could be accounted for by direct shifts into MMDAs from these

instruments, suggesting that such an adjustment is in train. On balance,

the staff estimates that MMDAs likely have increased M3 growth by a relatively

small amount.

APPENDIX II

MONEY STOCK REVISIONS

Measures of the money stock have been revised to incorporate annual

seasonal adjustment and benchmark revisions, as well as certain definitional

changes. These revisions are still preliminary and are to be regarded as con-

fidential until published on February 11. This appendix briefly describes

these changes, and compares growth rates of the new series with the old series.

Growth rates are shown in Tables II-1 to 11-3.

Definitional Changes

Two changes in the composition of the broader money stock measures

have been made. One, tax-exempt money market funds which previously had been

excluded from the aggregates are now included on the same basis as taxable

money funds; that is, balances in general purpose and broker/dealer funds

enter at the M2 level and balances in institution-only funds enter at the M3

level. This change boosted both M2 and M3 growth in 1982 by 0.4 percentage

points. Two, all IRA/Keogh balances at depository institutions and money

market mutual funds are now removed at the M2 level. This change reduced M2

growth last year by about 1.2 percentage points and M3 by about 1 percentage

point.

Benchmark Revisions

Deposits of commercial banks, savings and loan associations and credit

unions have been benchmarked to recent call reports. The impact of this bench-

mark is minimal--raising the level of M1 and lowering the levels of the broader

measures slightly, but leaving growth rates largely unaffected.



II-2

In addition, RPs and overnight Eurodollar deposits have been revised.

The overnight and term RP series have been revised using a special survey of

RPs at depository institutions and additional information on money market mutual

fund holdings of RPs. The net effect of these changes was to reduce the level

of net overnight RPs and raise the level of,term RPs; growth rates in 1982 were

affected only marginally by these revisions. The revision to the overnight

Eurodollar component of M2 resulted from broadening the panel of branches of

U.S. banks (previously consisting of selected Caribbean offices) to include

additional Caribbean offices as well as offices in other locations, principally

London; the net impact of this change on both levels and growth rates was minor

after allowing for holdings of such deposits by money market mutual funds.

Seasonal Revisions

Seasonal factors were revised using an X-11-ARIMA procedure adopted

last year. Revisions to seasonal factors tended to be greater than in recent

years, as additional data for 1982 tend to confirm evolving patterns that had

been obscured by unusual circumstances associated with the credit control period

of 1980. With the exception of July, growth in M1 in first months-of-quarters

was lowered, especially in April and October. In general, revised seasonal fac-

tors for M1 are more similar to those derived from the experimental model-based

procedure built from weekly seasonal factors; revisions to the experimental

series were relatively small.

Erratum in Blue Book Table

The figure for bank credit growth in 1982 (page 2, third column)

should read 7.1 percent rather than 7.8 percent. (The corrected figure is

measured from a December-January base, and is not adjusted for shifts of

assets from domestic banking offices to International Banking Facilities.)
