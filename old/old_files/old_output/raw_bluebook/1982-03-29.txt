Prefatory Note 

 
 

The attached document represents the most complete and accurate version 
available based on original copies culled from the files of the FOMC Secretariat at the 
Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System.  This electronic document was 
created through a comprehensive digitization process which included identifying the best-
preserved paper copies, scanning those copies,1 and then making the scanned versions 
text-searchable.2  Though a stringent quality assurance process was employed, some 
imperfections may remain. 
 

Please note that this document may contain occasional gaps in the text.  These 
gaps are the result of a redaction process that removed information obtained on a 
confidential basis.  All redacted passages are exempt from disclosure under applicable 
provisions of the Freedom of Information Act.    

 

                                                 
1 In some cases, original copies needed to be photocopied before being scanned into electronic format.  All 
scanned images were deskewed (to remove the effects of printer- and scanner-introduced tilting) and lightly 
cleaned (to remove dark spots caused by staple holes, hole punches, and other blemishes caused after initial 
printing). 
2 A two-step process was used.  An advanced optimal character recognition computer program (OCR) first 
created electronic text from the document image.  Where the OCR results were inconclusive, staff checked 
and corrected the text as necessary.   Please note that the numbers and text in charts and tables were not 
reliably recognized by the OCR process and were not checked or corrected by staff.

MONETARY POLICY ALTERNATIVES

Recent developments

(1) After growing rapidly over the three months November through

January, M1 contracted in February at a 3¾ percent annual rate, and now

appears to have grown only about 2 percent in March. Thus, over the last

two months behavior of this aggregate has been close to the zero growth

objective for that period specified by the Committee at its February meeting.

Demand deposits contracted sharply over the past two months--more than

offsetting their December-January bulge in growth. However, other checkable

deposits (OCDs) continued to expand at a relatively rapid, though decel-

erating, pace during the period.

(2) The recent performance of M1 has brought it closer to, but

still above, the upper limit of the Committee's longer-run range. As shown

in the next-to-last column of the table on the next page, growth of Ml from

QIV '81 to March '82 is estimated at about a 7¾ percent annual rate;

however, growth on a quarterly average basis for the first three months

of the year was at a more substantial 10¼ percent annual rate.

(3) Growth of M2 thus far this year has been just above its

longer-run target range, with expansion since QIV '81 at a 9¼ percent

annual rate. Over the two-month February-March period, M2 appears to

have grown at about a 7 percent annual rate, a bit below the 8 percent

rate targeted by the Committee. Growth in money market funds, though

picking up recently, has been somewhat slower than anticipated as interest

rate spreads for a time were unfavorable. Savings deposits, which had

expanded rapidly since October, grew slightly over the past two months,

while small time deposits resumed a more rapid rate of expansion.

3. Growth rates for reserves measures are adjusted to remove the effects of

discontinuities resulting from phased changes in reserve ratios under the
Monetary Control Act.

4. Nonborrowed reserves include special borrowing and other extended credit
from the Federal Reserve.



(4) Expansion of bank credit continued at around an 11 percent

annual rate in January and February (adjusted for shifts of assets to

IBFs), paced by strength in business loans. Bank credit growth seems to

have slowed in March, along with a weakening in demand for business

loans, insofar as can be judged from weekly large bank data for the first

half of March. Issuance of commercial paper has remained strong thus far

in March. Business financing obtained from long-term sources receded to

unusually low levels in the first two months of the year, but the pace

has picked up somewhat in March as long-term rates edged off from peaks

reached in early February.

(5) In conjunction with its decision to seek no M1 growth in

February and March the Committee specified an initial level of adjustment

borrowing of $1.5 billion, implying a considerable reduction in nonborrowed

reserves in February. Owing to the weaker-than-targeted money growth

early in the intermeeting period, the level of adjustment borrowing

implied by the reserves path gradually declined, but most recently the

pick-up of required reserves associated with the strengthening of M1

has contributed to a higher level of adjustment borrowing and moderate

1/
growth in total reserves.- For the intermeeting period, adjustment

borrowing averaged about $1.4 billion. Since the beginning of the year,

all of the total reserves growth of about 5¼ percent, at an annual rate,

has reflected expansion in borrowed reserves. Nonborrowed reserves,

despite a substantial rise in March, have declined somewhat on balance

since December.

1/ Reserve paths and adjustments made since the last Committee meetings
are shown in Appendix I.



(6) The federal funds rate has fluctuated generally in a

13 1/2 to 15 1/2 percent range over the intermeeting period. In the most

recent statement week, funds averaged 14 1/2 percent. Other short-term

interest rates, too, have been volatile over the intermeeting period,

reflecting market participants' changing perceptions of the outlook for

money growth and reserve market conditions. Most short-term market

rates have declined on balance to 1 point since the February FOMC

meeting, and long-term interest rates are down 1/2 to 3/4 of a point.

(7) The dollar has risen by about 4 percent since the last

FOMC meeting. While daily movements of the dollar often have been related

to movements in U.S. short-term interest rates relative to foreign rates,

at the end of the period interest differentials were about the same as

at the beginning. The dollar benefited from relatively favorable price

developments and from a general perception that governments abroad may

be shifting to less restrictive demand policies.



Alternative near-term targets

(8) Shown below are alternative targets, and associated

federal funds rate ranges, for M1 and M2 for the second quarter. (More

detailed and longer-run data for the alternatives are contained in the

table and charts on the following pages, and the quarterly interest rate

pattern underlying the staff's GNP projection for 1982 is contained in

appendix II.) Alternative A, calling for a 4½ percent rate of growth of

M1 in the March-to-June interval, would, as shown in Chart 1, maintain

the level of narrow money above the upper end of the Committee's 2½-to-5½

percent longer-run range throughout the second quarter; however, that

rate, if sustained over the second half, would bring M1 down to the upper

end of range by year-end. The 3 percent M1 rate of growth from March to

June of alternative B is designed to bring the level of that aggregate to

about the upper limit of the Committee's longer-run range by around mid-year.

The alternative C specification of 1½ percent M1 growth would place that

aggregate at about the middle of the upper half of the range by mid-year.

Under all three alternatives, M2 would be expected to move within the

1/
upper half of its longer-run range.-

/ The new 91-day deposit instrument authorized by the DIDC, to be effec-
tive May 1, is unlikely to significantly strengthen time deposit growth,
but--reflecting the temporary ceiling rate differential--is likely
to add to thrift deposit expansion relative to that for commercial
banks. Similarly, the new unregulated 3 year deposit is not expected
to add to time deposit growth since about half of the depository
institutions have been offering less than the ceiling rate on the 2
year and over SSC.

(9) Despite the staff's projection of second-quarter growth

in nominal GNP at a 9 percent annual rate, money demand is not expected

to strengthen significantly in the March to June period. M1 growth in

the first quarter was considerably in excess of what might be expected

on the basis of actual income and interest rates, and apparently reflected

the public's increased demand for liquidity in an environment of economic

uncertainty. This demand was reflected in part in a resurgence in growth

of the OCD component of M1. Resumption of economic growth is likely to

reduce uncertainty, with the public in consequence readjusting its

financial asset holdings by drawing on its accumulated money and liquidity

balances for spending and/or investing in other financial assets. Such

behavior would lead to a sharp rise in velocity of the existing money

stock and permit expanding nominal GNP to be financed with relatively

little additional M1. The projected adjustment in money holdings and

liquidity balances is expected to take the form of a further deceleration

in growth of OCD--in the April-June period to a rate of close to 15 percent

per annum, as compared with growth at about a 50 percent annual rate in the

November-February period and at more than a 20 percent annual rate in March.

(10) In setting a path for second-quarter growth in the money

supply, we have allowed for most, and possibly all, of M1 expansion to occur

in April. Growth of M1 in April (seasonally adjusted) accelerated over

the last half of the 1970s. In the past two years, however, M1 has been

quite volatile in April--declining sharply in 1980, presumably reflecting

the credit control program, and rising very rapidly in 1981, partly

reflecting the preceding policy-induced drop of short-term interest

rates. With so volatile a performance of M1 in the most recent years,

it is difficult to judge whether the pre-1980 trend has continued and thus

whether it should be reflected in current seasonal adjustment factors.

Under the circumstances, we have assumed that the odds are tilted toward

the computed April seasonal factor this year having underestimated the

seasonal increase. But uncertainties with respect to April are great,

not only because of the special factors noted above, but also because

there are always questions about how rapidly individuals will pay their

taxes, how they will manage their cash in doing so, how quickly the

Treasury will pay refunds, and how promptly they will collect the checks

mailed in. Thus, while we have allowed for a bulge in growth in April,

a relatively moderate growth cannot be ruled out, particularly if tax

payments are made out of NOW accounts that were built up earlier or out

of money market funds (thereby avoiding a temporary build-up in demand

deposits).

(11) Alternative A, which entails growth of M1 at a 4½ percent

rate from March to June, would call for an increase in total reserves

over the quarter at about an 8½ percent annual rate. Assuming a decline

in adjustment borrowing to about $750 million, nonborrowed reserves would

expand at a 13½ percent annual rate over the quarter. A federal funds

rate of 13 percent or so would be implied, given the present discount

rate.

(12) The 3-month bill rate under this alternative may decline

into the 11 to 12 percent area. Bond yields, too, would be likely to



-9-

decline, although the rally might be limited by a pick-up in corporate bond

offerings. Pressures on thrift institutions would ease a bit, but

operating losses still would continue for most institutions, especially

given the lag between declines in market rates and average deposit

costs. With U.S. interest rates falling, there is likely to be some

tendency for the foreign exchange value of the dollar to decline from

recent advanced levels, though any such weakening would be limited if

foreign monetary authorities took the opportunity to permit their

interest rates to decrease further.

(13) The alternative B specifications, which call for M1 growth

at a 3 percent rate from March to June, imply an increase in total

reserves at a 7 percent rate. Assuming adjustment borrowing of $1¼

billion, nonborrowed reserves would also increase at around a 7 percent

rate, and the federal funds rate would likely fluctuate around 14 percent

or a bit higher. Other interest rates would probably continue to fluctuate

within the range of the past several weeks, absent any substantial change

in the fiscal outlook. In addition, to the extent that the market has

discounted a considerable bulge in money growth in April, market rates

could decline somewhat if such a bulge does not develop.

(14) Alternative C, involving a 1½ percent rate of growth of

M1 over the March-to-June period, would require a growth in total reserves

at a 5½ percent rate. This alternative would appear to be consistent

with adjustment borrowing of near $1¾ billion, implying essentially no

growth in nonborrowed reserves. Under this approach, the federal funds

rate would likely rise into the 15 to 16 percent range over the inter-

meeting period. Such a rebound in the funds rate would probably lead

to a substantial rise in other short-term rates and renewed upward



-10-

pressure on long rates. These rate pressures might be moderated to the

extent that market expectations about the vigor of economic recovery and

future credit demands are dampened. The dollar would come under substantial

upward pressure in exchange markets.

(15) In considering the proposed alternatives for the second

quarter, the Committee may also want to take account of implications for

the second half of the year. If the M1 specification of alternative A is

adopted for the second quarter, this would imply a further deceleration

of M1 growth over the last six months of the year to a 2¾ percent annual

rate to be consistent with growth for the year (QIV to QIV basis) at

4¾ percent rate, the middle of the upper half of the FOMC's M1 range for

the year (see the top line of the "4¾" column in the table below.)

The last column of the table shows that growth at about a 4 percent

annual rate over the last six months of the year would be consistent with

hitting the upper limit of the longer-run range under alternative A--which

would provide more scope for financing expected economic recovery. If

the Committee were to adopt the second-quarter targets of alternatives

B or C, some acceleration in growth over the 6-month June-to-December

period--to just above a 4 percent annual rate under alternative C--would

be in prospect even if growth for the year were constrained to 4¾ percent.

Should the Committee accept growth in M1 for the year at the upper limit

of its longer-run range, even more rapid growth in the second half would

be in prospect (5 to 6 percent, depending on whether alternative B or C

is adopted at this meeting).

Directive language

(16) Given below is a suggested operational paragraph for the

directive. The specifications adopted at the meeting on February 1-2

are shown in strike-through form. The phrase in brackets is presented

as an option that would effectively give added weight to M2 in operations

in the circumstances of the forthcoming period.

IN THE SHORT RUN, the Committee seeks behavior of reserve

aggregates [DEL: over the balance of the quarter] consistent with GROWTH OF

M1 AND M2 FROM MARCH TO JUNE AT ANNUAL RATES OF ABOUT ____ PERCENT

AND ____ PERCENT RESPECTIVELY [DEL: bringing M1 and M2 over time into

their longer run target ranges for the year. Taking account of

the recent surge in growth of M1, the Committee seeks no further

growth in M1 for the January to March period and growth in M2 at

an annual rate of around 8 percent. Some decline in M1 would be

associated with more rapid attainment of the longer-run range

and would be acceptable in the context of reduced pressure in

the money market.] [THE COMMITTEE ALSO NOTED THAT DEVIATIONS

FROM THESE TARGETS SHOULD BE EVALUATED IN LIGHT OF THE POSSIBILITY

THAT M2 WOULD BE LESS AFFECTED OVER THE PERIOD THAN M1 BY DEPOSIT

SHIFTS RELATED TO THE TAX DATE AND BY CHANGES IN THE RELATIVE

IMPORTANCE OF NOW ACCOUNTS AS A SAVINGS VEHICLE.] The Chairman

may call for Committee consultation if it appears to the Manager

for Domestic Operations that pursuit of the monetary objectives

and related reserve paths during the period before the next

meeting is likely to be associated with a federal funds rate per-

sistently outside a range of [DEL: 12 to 16] ____ TO ____ percent.

NOTE: Government securities dealer cash positions consist of securities already delivered, commit-
ments to buy (sell) securities on an outright basis for immediate delivery (5 business days or less), and
certain "when-issued" securities for delayed delivery (more than 5 business days). Futures and forward
positions include all other commitments involving delayed delivery; futures contracts are arranged on
organized exchanges. Underwriting syndicate positions consists of issues in syndicate, excluding
trading positions.

Weekly data are daily averages for statement weeks, except for corporate and municipal issues in
syndicate, which are Friday figures. Monthly averages for excess reserves and borrowing are weighted
averages of statement week figures. Monthly data for dealer futures and forwards are end-of-month
figures for 1980.
