Strictly Confidential (FR) Class I FOMC

MONETARY POLICY ALTERNATIVES

Prepared for the Federal Open Market Committee

By the staff Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System



Strictly Confidential (FR)
Class I - FOMC June 26, 1992

MONETARY POLICY ALTERNATIVES

Recent Developments

(1) Reserve pressures have been left unchanged since the FOMC

meeting on May 19. The federal funds rate has averaged very close to

its expected level of 3-3/4 percent. To account for rising demands for

seasonal credit, the allowance for adjustment and seasonal borrowing was

raised from $100 to $225 million in three steps during the intermeeting

period. Actual borrowing has come in somewhat above its allowance, in

part owing to a stronger-than-expected rise in seasonal borrowing.

(2) In the days following the May FOMC meeting, the failure of

the System to signal an easing action and news reports that a symmetric

directive had been adopted at that meeting prompted a backup in interest

rates. Later in the period, however, monetary and economic data

strengthened the notion that the recovery and credit demands would

remain modest, and interest rates moved lower, especially at intermedi-

ate maturities. On balance, money market yields were unchanged to up 10

basis points over the intermeeting period; long-term corporate and Trea-

sury rates were about unchanged on the period, while fixed-rate conven-

tional mortgages were marked down about 20 basis points. Most long- and

intermediate-term yields, although still somewhat above lows set early

in the year, ended the period 1/4 to 1 percentage point below highs

reached in early March. In the stock market, price indexes declined 3

to 5 percent over the intermeeting period owing to downward revisions to

the markets' ebullient earnings forecast.

(3) The dollar's weighted average exchange value has declined

2-3/4 percent, on balance, since the May Committee meeting. With this

decline, the dollar has retraced all of the increase from its January

low. The growing realization that the pace of the U.S. recovery was not



likely to be strong contributed to the softness in the dollar over the

intermeeting period and since its peak in March. Moreover, German money

growth has remained high in recent months, which has been seen as likely

to postpone any significant easing of German and associated European

interest rates. The German mark was particularly strong against the

dollar in the wake of the confusion over prospects for European mone-

tary union produced by the Danish referendum on June 2. Monetary

authorities in some European countries, Italy in particular, had to push

interest rates up fairly sharply to reassure exchange market partici-

pants after the referendum's defeat in Denmark. Weakness in Japanese

stock prices re-emerged, along with gloomier prospects for economic

activity and profits; major indices declined 12 to 16 percent over the

period, and the Nikkei index reached a six-year low. Short-and long-

term interest rates in Japan fell somewhat.

The Desk did not

intervene.

(4) The monetary aggregates remained weak in May and June.

Over the two months, M2 and M3 are estimated to have fallen at 1-1/4 and

1-3/4 percent annual rates, respectively, in contrast to expectations at

the last FOMC meeting that the two aggregates would increase at about

2-1/2 and 1-3/4 percent rates. Ml growth rebounded strongly in May but

also has turned negative in June.1  The recent contraction in M2

brought its quarterly average growth to zero, far short of the predic-

tion of the standard money demand model using the staff GDP estimate and

short-term market and deposit interest rates. Correspondingly, the

velocity of M2 is estimated to have risen at a 5 percent rate during the

rate, while the monetary base rose at a 5-3/4 percent pace.



current quarter in the face of substantial declines in the second half

of last year in this conventional measure of the opportunity cost of M2.

The weakness over the second quarter has depressed the growth of both

aggregates through June by about a percentage point below their annual

ranges. At the time of the February FOMC meeting, the staff was

projecting M2 and M3 growth over the first half of the year at 3-1/4 and

1-3/4 percent, respectively. The shortfall in broad money growth

relative to expectations has occurred despite slightly lower short-term

interest rates than envisioned in the staff forecast at the time of the

February FOMC meeting and expansion of nominal GDP over the first half

of the year that, at an estimated 5-1/4 percent, was somewhat above the

projection for the February meeting. A rise in velocities in the first

half of the year was anticipated, but by significantly less than the

estimated increases of around 3-1/4 and 5 percent at annual rates for M2

and M3, respectively.

(5) Sluggish monetary growth and sharply rising velocities

during the first half of 1992 appear to reflect an intensification of

some of the influences that depressed the demand for money and buoyed

velocity over 1990 and 1991. In contrast to expectations at the

February meeting, the yield curve steepened further and banks priced

deposits especially unattractively, reflecting weaker loan demand than

forecast and incentives to limit balance sheet expansion. Retail time

deposit rates at intermediate-term maturities have been particularly low

relative to market rates and relative to the original yields on maturing

deposits; rates on liquid deposits have adjusted down more quickly than

has been typical, with sizable reductions in the last few weeks; gener-

ally, depositories have made the largest cuts in the highest-rate liquid



deposits, which may have been held by the most interest-sensitive depos-

itors. The combination of still-elevated yields on bonds and low

returns on deposits evidently prompted heavy flows out of deposits and

into capital markets, either directly or through mutual funds. In

addition, high consumer borrowing costs relative to deposit interest

rates likely have encouraged households to emphasize debt repayment at

the expense of M2 asset accumulation. And RTC activity, at least until

mid-April when resolutions ceased because of the expiration of spending

authority, evidently disrupted banking relationships and prompted

depositors to seek alternative investment outlets. These factors are

associated, in varying degrees, with impediments to the flow of credit

through depository institutions, and thus are likely to be reflected in

both weak monetary growth and, to a lesser extent, some restraint on

spending and output.

(6) Despite heavy federal borrowing, nonfinancial sector debt

is estimated to have expanded at only a 4-1/2 percent rate through May,

leaving this aggregate at the lower end of its monitoring range. Non-

federal debt growth, at 2-1/2 percent, has been especially weak relative

to GDP, partly reflecting efforts to restructure balance sheets. Spend-

ing apparently has been financed out of internal funds, borrowers have

opted to pay down debt rather than hold low-yielding monetary assets,

and equity issuance has been used to reduce indebtedness. On the supply

side, evidence suggests that lending restraint by intermediaries, though

not abating, probably has stabilized, while open markets have become

more receptive to private borrowers, partly reflecting the diversion of

savings from depositories.

Projections for 1992 and 1993

(8) As discussed above, the broader monetary aggregates have

proven to be weaker in the first half of 1992 than envisioned early this

year. Moreover, relative to our expectations early in the year, we now

expect the factors damping money growth and raising velocity in the

2. This bluebook has omitted the 5-year simulation of alternative
monetary policy strategies that had become customary in February and
July. Our view is that questions about money demand relationships are
sufficient to cast considerable doubts about the value of alternative
policies keyed to 1 percent greater or lesser M2 growth. Alternatives
based on relationships between nominal interest rates and the economy
also are unreliable very far into the future. Paragraphs (12) and
(13) below discuss strategies involving different outcomes for output
and inflation that the Committee might follow through 1994 and their
rough implications for money growth and interest rates.



period ahead to be more persistent and the restoration of more normal

relationships between growth in the monetary aggregates and income to be

more gradual. As a consequence, we now anticipate considerably slower

expansion of the broad money aggregates this year, associated with about

the same GDP that was projected in February, and we expect this sluggish

pattern to persist in 1993. Obviously, substantial uncertainty sur-

rounds our estimates of the relationship of money to spending, and in

making the forecast, we have balanced several factors. On the one hand,

bank and thrift asset growth is likely to remain damped, and credit will

continue to be channeled away from these intermediaries. In particular,

implementation of the FDIC Improvement Act (FDICIA) will constrain the

activity of many depositories, raise costs, and accentuate incentives to

bolster capital ratios. Capital itself is likely to remain under some

pressure at a number of banks and thrifts--stemming importantly from

continuing difficulties in the commercial real estate sector. The RTC,

though likely to be dormant over the balance of the year, should resume

closing thrifts in 1993, again damping depository credit and the mone-

tary aggregates. And, demand for depository credit at the wider spreads

that have developed is not expected to pick up much. Under these cir-

cumstances, deposit rates are likely to continue to be adjusted downward

under the greenbook assumption of flat federal funds rates and declining

long-term yields. On the other hand, the effects of these restraining

forces should diminish gradually as: capital positions improve; some

better capitalized banks, including those with ready access to equity

markets, more actively seek profitable lending opportunities; and steady

improvements in business profits and household earnings alleviate some

of the reluctance to lend. Moreover, households' efforts to pare lia-

bilities and to shift assets toward capital market instruments should



abate as their balance sheets are bought into closer alignment with

desired levels.

(9) M2 is expected to pick up some in the months ahead, but

only enough to produce growth for the year of 2 percent, below the cur-

rent annual range. Expansion of nominal income is projected at about

the same average pace in the second half as in the first. Acting to

restrain M2 growth relative to income over the balance of this year are

further downward movements in deposit rates--especially as liquid depos-

it rates move into closer alignment with market rates and as FDICIA

limits begin to constrain some banks' offering rates. In addition,

FDICIA limitations on brokered deposits as well as other provisions that

tend to raise intermediation costs should reinforce tendencies to hold

down deposit growth and spur further portfolio realignments. Partly

offsetting these influences should be recent and prospective declines in

consumer loan rates and capital market yields. The shortfall of M2

growth from standard model predictions is expected to be unprecedented,

on the order of 4 percent this year, and V2 is expected to rise by more

than 3 percent. Slightly faster growth of M2 is projected for 1993. By

then, the portfolio adjustment process will be further along, and GDP

growth in the staff economic forecast is projected to pick up a bit.

However, a decline in short-term interest rates, as occurred in late

1991 and on net likely helped boost M2 in early 1992, is not assumed in

the outlook. Furthermore, a number of additional provisions of FDICIA

that will come into effect in late 1992, including asset growth restric-

tions and early closure of weaker depositories, as well as limitations

on pass-through insurance and on payments to uninsured depositors, will

likely contribute to restraints on growth of the depository sector. On

balance V2 would rise about 3 percent next year as well.



(10) M3 also is projected to remain below the lower bound of

its current range over the balance of 1992. Weakness in bank credit

should abate a little as businesses shift from inventory liquidation to

modest restocking and as other businesses and household outlays expand.

Funding this credit imparts a slight upward tilt to M3 in the second

half of 1992 and in 1993. Over the balance of this year and next, ex-

pansion in core deposits will continue to be more than ample to cover

that growth, implying that managed liabilities in M3 will continue to

run off at a brisk clip. Also tending to buoy M3 over the rest of 1992

is the likelihood that RTC resolution activity will be dormant, owing to

funding constraints that are unlikely to be removed by congressional

action before next winter. In 1993, when depository resolutions by the

RTC and the FDIC pick up, M3 is expected to grow 1/2 percent, only

marginally faster than this year, extending the exceptionally weak

performance of this aggregate in recent years.

(11) Growth of debt of domestic nonfinancial sectors is an-

ticipated to pick up a bit over the remainder of 1992 and to firm a

little more in 1993. Business credit demands will be boosted by the

swing in inventories and a rise in fixed capital spending that outstrips

the improvement in internal funds. Moreover, firms' borrowing will be

augmented by some slowing in net equity issuance from the extraordinary

pace of recent quarters, as opportunities to reduce overall capital

costs by unwinding over-leveraged balance sheets have been more fully

exploited. Further gains in earnings also should ease debt servicing

strains and improve access to credit. Still, restraints on credit

supplies at banks and insurance companies, while abating, are likely to

remain pronounced as these institutions continue to grapple with asset-



-10-

quality problems and regulatory constraints. Consequently, loan take-

downs at both types of institutions are expected to rise only slowly,

and those borrowers with access to open markets are likely to continue

to concentrate their credit demands on the bond market. Household bor-

rowing is expected to strengthen a little, in line with modest expansion

in outlays on consumer goods and housing activity and a moderation in

the deleveraging process. With banks seeking to limit asset growth and

thrifts continuing to run off assets, securitization is expected to

remain the major source of mortgage credit and to be an important source

of funding for consumer credit as well. Borrowing by state and local

governments will be held in check by fiscal pressures that restrain

their capital outlays and by large scheduled retirements of pre-refunded

bonds. In contrast, debt of the federal government will continue to

rise rapidly over the next year and a half, although funding constraints

on the RTC limit federal borrowing over the rest of this year before an

expected return to more normal activity early next year. Total debt of

nonfinancial sectors is projected to grow 5 percent this year, rising

above the lower bound of its range, and 5-3/4 percent next year; such

expansion is in line with growth in nominal GDP in both years.

Alternative longer-run strategies

(12) The staff's economic projection embodies gradual disin-

flation to about 2-3/4 percent on the GDP fixed-weight price deflator in

the second half of 1993. Some further progress on inflation would be

in train in 1994 since the level of the unemployment rate, at 6-3/4 per-

cent at the end of 1993, would still be above the natural rate. Growth

would have to remain moderate and unemployment rates elevated to extend

mild disinflation through 1994 and beyond. With regard to the financial

conditions necessary to achieve these results, the greenbook forecast



-11-

assumes a flat federal funds rate through 1993. Given its current low

level, the real federal funds rate will need to rise at some point to

keep downward pressure on inflation, perhaps requiring upward adjust-

ments in the nominal funds rate as well. While this tightening of

reserve conditions might await 1994, should the economy turn out more

ebullient than expected, an earlier firming in the stance of policy

would be consistent with the gradual disinflation path. Developments in

financial markets that might necessitate an earlier firming would in-

clude a more rapid easing of credit supply constraints than incorporated

in the forecast or a major downward adjustment of real long-term rates

that brought them into better alignment with short-term rates. Nor-

mally, greater underlying strength in the economy would require slower

money growth to hold to the disinflation path. However, declining long-

term rates or ebbing credit restraints would work to lower velocity as

well, complicating assessment of the appropriate money growth path.

(13) Alternatively, the Committee could strive for more rapid

progress toward price stability, which would entail slower economic

expansion and maintenance of greater slack in the economy for a longer

period. Such a strategy would involve a prompter firming of short-term

rates, probably by sometime early next year, to unwind a portion of the

easing undertaken late last year and earlier this year. However, the

greater progress in reducing inflation would imply that nominal short-

term rates need not go much higher than they eventually would in the

gradual disinflation case and likely would begin to retreat sooner.

Money growth would have to be slower than in the former case, appreci-

ably so in 1993. On the other hand, the Committee could put greater

emphasis on reducing unemployment over the next few years, keeping core

inflation around its current levels. Such a strategy would require a



-12-

significant easing of policy over the next year, perhaps involving a cut

in the federal funds rate of a percentage point or so. However, given

the already low level of the funds rate and the moderate degree of slack

in the economy, an aggressive tightening of policy at some point in the

next couple years would be needed to avoid an acceleration of wages and

prices. With regard to money growth, if the staff's assessment of

underlying money demand developments is about right, the initial stages

of this strategy might be produced by hitting the lower end of the cur-

rent M2 range. Thereafter, money growth would have to decelerate to

avoid building in accelerating prices.

Ranges for 1992

(14) Shown below are two alternatives for money and debt

growth in 1992.3 Alternative I retains the current ranges for all

three aggregates while alternative II lowers them by a full percentage

point.

Debt 4-1/2 to 8-1/2 3-1/2 to 7-1/2 5

(15) Alternative II would reduce the ranges, encompassing the

staff projections for M2 and M3. Choice of this alternative would imply

the Committee's readiness to tolerate shortfalls of M2 relative to

earlier expectations, presumably because in the presence of the unusual

-13-

behavior of money demand such slow growth was considered to be consis-

tent with the Committee's desired outcome for spending in 1992 and early

1993. At the same time, this range would permit a substantial accelera-

tion of M2 in the event of a quick return to a more normal relationship

between M2 holdings and income and interest rates; indeed, M2 could

expand at a 10 percent annual pace between June and December without

breaching the upper end of this range. Still, reducing the ranges,

especially if coupled with the choice of ranges for 1993 that were lower

than the current 1992 ranges, might also be seen as pointing in the

direction of the Committee's intention to make further progress toward

price stability. Although the staff projection for M3 is just within

the alternative II range, the chances that this aggregate could fall

below the lower end are greater than for M2, especially in light of the

size of the unexpected contraction in this aggregate in recent months.

By contrast, the alternative II range for debt would be nearly centered

on the staff's expectation for growth of this aggregate this year.

(16) Alternative I might be selected if the prospects for a

return to more normal money demand and therefore M2 growth were seen as

greater than envisioned by the staff. This range also might be pre-

ferred if recent weakness in M2 were thought to be signalling slower

output growth than in the staff forecast--including a risk to the

recovery itself. In addition, as noted, attempts to hit the lower end

of this range would be more consistent with a strategy that endeavored

to make greater progress in reducing unemployment rates than in the

staff forecast. Depending on how it was presented, choice of this

alternative could signal that the Committee would not be complacent

about undershooting its current range; in these circumstances, pressure

to reexamine the System's stance in reserve markets would be present

with growth below the ranges. Instead, the Committee could choose to



-14-

retain the current range because it was so uncertain about money-income

relationships that any change was seen as implying more knowledge of

those relationships and commitment to achieving the new range than it

felt appropriate. In that event, the Committee would need to explain

that shortfalls from the unchanged range might not warrant policy

action. Actions to return M2 to its alternative I range would tend to

move M3 closer to its range; however, since any easing action to boost

M2 growth would have less impact on M3 expansion, there is a greater

4
chance that this aggregate would fail to move into its range.

Ranges for 1993

(17) The alternatives shown for 1993 are the same as those

suggested for 1992.5

M3 1 to 5 0 to 4 1/2

Debt 4-1/2 to 8-1/2 3-1/2 to 7-1/2 5-3/4

(18) Alternative II would tend to be favored if it were

thought that the same forces acting to depress broad money in 1992 were

going to persist through next year. In the staff projections, M2 would

be squarely in the lower half of this reduced range over 1993 and M3

would be a little above the lower end of its range. Thus, this lower

4. In the staff's judgment, a rather prompt and substantial easing
of policy--lowering the federal funds rate by 3/4 percentage point in
the third quarter--likely would be needed to hit the lower bound of
the current M2 range by the end of the year.

between these alternatives, or even to widen the ranges, say by
dropping the lower ends.



-15-

range would accommodate the staff forecast of an economy that was ex-

panding at a pace slightly above its potential growth rate and infla-

tionary pressures that were continuing to abate. While encompassing

more scope for downward shifts in money demand, this alternative also

would embody less room for an acceleration in M2 growth that might

threaten progress toward price stability and greater scope for a rise in

interest rates were that needed to preserve the downtrend in inflation

or to seek an even faster deceleration than in the staff forecast.

(19) Alternative I, the current 1992 ranges, might be chosen

if the Committee wished to temporize about its 1993 choice, given

velocity uncertainties. This alternative would seem a more plausible

choice should the Committee choose to maintain, rather than lower, the

1992 ranges. However, lowering the ranges in 1992 and raising them

again in 1993 could be appropriate if the Committee saw chances of less

robust velocity growth next year. This alternative also could be

communicated as connoting a willingness to take action to counter any

potential stalling out of the economic expansion; the 2-1/2 percent

lower end of this range is equal to the staff's projection, implying

that only a modest shortfall from this expectation would tend to prompt

an easing of policy. Particularly if the money demand shifts do not

persist, this alternative might be more consistent with efforts to

promote somewhat stronger growth in the economy than contained in the

staff forecast. In the staff forecast, M3 expansion would stay below

the lower end of the alternative I range as RTC and FDIC resolutions

pick up. The staff's projection for debt of domestic nonfinancial

sectors is below the midpoint of the alternative I range, but about

centered on the midpoint of the alternative II range.



-16-

Short-Run Policy Alternatives

(20) Three short-run policy alternatives are presented below

for Committee consideration. Under alternative B, the federal funds

rate would continue to center on 3-3/4 percent. Maintaining that un-

changed stance likely would entail retaining the assumption for adjust-

ment plus seasonal borrowing at its $225 million level. Under the

easier alternative A, the funds rate would be reduced to 3-1/4 percent,

placing it 1/4 percentage point below the discount rate, in association

with a borrowing assumption of $200 million. Or this same funds rate

could be achieved by keeping a $225 million borrowing assumption and

reducing the discount rate 1/2 percentage point to 3 percent. Under

alternative C, the funds rate would be raised to around 4-1/4 percent by

selecting a borrowing specification of $250 million. Further upward

technical adjustments to the borrowing assumption likely will be needed

over the intermeeting period with any of the alternatives to account for

a continued upswing in seasonal borrowing.

(21) Market participants appear to have built into interest

and exchange rates some probability of a near-term easing in the stance

of monetary policy next week after the FOMC meeting and release of June

employment data. Thus, in the near-term, rates would rise somewhat

under alternative B. Over the course of the third quarter, with infla-

tion pressures subdued and the pace of economic expansion moderate, as

in the staff forecast, short-term and long-term rates might come back

down. Long-term rates could well end up below current levels, espe-

cially if the lack of Federal Reserve action ultimately contributes to

downward adjustments to inflation expectations. The exchange value of

the dollar would probably average around current levels.



-17-

(22) Under alternative A, most of the drop of 50 basis points

in the funds rate would be transmitted to other money market interest

rates. The prime rate would be cut a half percentage point. The

reaction of bond yields is difficult to anticipate. To the extent mar-

ket participants saw the easing as warranted by prospective economic

weakness, long-term rates would decline further on the policy easing.

On the other hand, to the degree that the action was interpreted as more

aggressive than was justified by economic fundamentals and by the pro-

spects for continued disinflation, heightened inflation concerns and an

enhanced possibility that a policy tightening may be needed in the not-

too-distant future would temper such a decline and could even bring

about some increase in nominal bond rates. Still, the easing would

provide some stimulus to economic activity as real long-term yields

moved lower and the recent weakening in the exchange value of the dollar

was extended.

(23) The increase of 50 basis points in the funds rate under

alternative C would come as a considerable surprise to market partici-

pants. Short-term rates would back up by at least as much, and the

dollar exchange rate would strengthen appreciably. The surprise element

itself could well trigger a flurry of selling pressures on longer-term

securities. Later, market reflection about the System's anti-inflation-

ary resolve, combined with favorable incoming price data, might well

engender a bond-market rally, leaving nominal long-term rates not much

above their current levels.

(24) The table below presents anticipated growth of the mone-

tary aggregates from June to September under the three short-run policy

alternatives. (The charts and table on the following pages show more

detailed data.) Under all the alternatives, M2 and M3 in September



-18-

would remain below the lower bounds of their current ranges. Even

under alternative A, M2 would be on a trajectory that would bring it

closer to, though still a bit below, its lower bound in the fourth

quarter, and M3 also would be expected to remain somewhat below its

current range through year-end. The response of M2 under alternatives A

and C incorporates the reduced interest elasticity now thought to be

embodied in demand for this aggregate, partly as a consequence of

heightened depositor sensitivity to the slope of the yield curve.

(25) While M2 under all three alternatives appears likely to

resume growth over the June-to-September period, under alternative B

this aggregate still is projected to grow at only a 2 percent annual

rate. The same forces that have been evident in recent years will

continue to depress the demand for broad money. Growth in M2 likely

will be damped additionally by runoffs of demand deposits associated

with the slowing in the pace of mortgage refinancing. Partly as a

result, M1 growth probably will be held down to a 6-1/2 percent annual

rate from June to September, about in line with its reduced March-to-

June pace. By contrast, the runoff of the non-M1 component of M2

is expected to come to an end, leaving its level about unchanged over

the June-to-September period. The declines in intermediate-term mar-

ket yields relative to rates on retail time deposits of comparable

maturity during the spring, as well as a prospective flattening of the

yield curve, should damp the shifting out of small time deposits.

(26) The turnaround in M2 growth under alternative B should

show through to M3. After its decline over the second quarter, this

aggregate is projected to expand at a 1/2 percent annual rate over the

next three months. Bank credit growth should strengthen some from its

torpid second-quarter pace, though loan demand would still be rela-

tively weak. Domestic nonfinancial debt is projected to move gradu-

ally above its lower bound in coming months, placing its growth from

the fourth quarter of last year through September at 4-3/4 percent.

This strengthening owes almost entirely to heavy federal borrowing, as

non-federal debt growth is expected to remain sluggish.

(27) Choice of alternatives A or C would entail somewhat

stronger or weaker M2 over the third quarter. Most of the adjustment

would come in liquid money balances, whose offering rates are unlikely

to respond much to changes in short-term market interest rates. M2

growth from June to September could be expected to respond by about

3/4 percentage point to a lowering or raising of the funds rate by 1/2

percentage point. The effect of such a changed policy stance on M3

growth over the same interval would be smaller, however, perhaps on

the order of 1/2 percentage point, reflecting the reaction of loans

demanded to a movement in borrowing costs of this magnitude.

6. With currency and total reserves projected to expand from June
to September at 6 and 7 percent annual rates, respectively, growth of
the monetary base is forecast to be 6-1/4 percent over the three
months.

Directive Language

(28) Presented below for Committee consideration is a draft

of the paragraph relating to the ranges for 1992 and 1993. The lan-

guage in the first set of brackets is offered as a suggestion should

the Committee reaffirm the current ranges and at the same time wish to

indicate an expectation that acceptable growth could be around (implic-

itly including a little below) the lower ends of those ranges. The

language in the second bracket would cover a decision to reduce the

1992 ranges. Were the Committee to chose this option, a second sen-

tence, like the one suggested in this bracket, might be considered to

explain the reason for the reduction.

(29) A draft operational paragraph follows that for the long-

run ranges. The language in brackets at the end of that paragraph

might be considered should the Committee wish to reduce the weight it

places on the near-term growth of the monetary aggregates relative to

Committee expectations as a guide to adjustments in reserve conditions

over the coming intermeeting period.

PARAGRAPH FOR 1992 AND 1993 RANGES

The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and

financial conditions that will foster price stability and

promote sustainable growth in output. In furtherance of

these objectives, the Committee REAFFIRMED at THIS [DEL: its]

meeting THE RANGES IT HAD ESTABLISHED in February

[DEL: established ranges] for growth of M2 and M3 of 2-1/2 to

6-1/2 percent and 1 to 5 percent respectively, measured

from the fourth quarter of 1991 to the fourth quarter of

1992. [THE COMMITTEE ANTICIPATED THAT DEVELOPMENTS CON-

TRIBUTING TO UNUSUAL VELOCITY INCREASES COULD PERSIST IN



-22-

THE SECOND HALF OF THE YEAR, AND UNDER THOSE CIRCUMSTANCES

M2 AND M3 GROWTH AROUND THE LOWER ENDS OF THEIR RANGES

WOULD BE CONSISTENT WITH ITS BROAD POLICY OBJECTIVES.]

[IN FURTHERANCE OF THESE OBJECTIVES, THE COMMITTEE AT THIS

MEETING LOWERED THE RANGES IT HAD ESTABLISHED IN FEBRUARY

FOR GROWTH OF M2 AND M3 TO RANGES OF ____ TO ____ AND ____ TO

PERCENT RESPECTIVELY, MEASURED FROM THE FOURTH QUARTER OF

1991 TO THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 1992. THE COMMITTEE ANTICI-

PATED THAT DEVELOPMENTS CONTRIBUTING TO UNUSUAL VELOCITY

INCREASES WOULD PERSIST OVER THE BALANCE OF THE YEAR, AND

THAT MONEY GROWTH WITHIN THESE LOWER RANGES WOULD BE

CONSISTENT WITH ITS BROAD POLICY OBJECTIVES.] The moni-

toring range for growth of total domestic nonfinancial

debt ALSO was MAINTAINED [DEL: set] at 4-1/2 to 8-1/2 percent

[(ALSO) WAS LOWERED TO ____ TO ____ PERCENT] for the year.

[DEL: With regard to M3, the Committee anticipated that the

ongoing restructuring of depository institutions would

continue to depress the growth of this aggregate relative

to spending and total credit.] FOR 1993, THE COMMITTEE

AGREED ON TENTATIVE RANGES FOR MONETARY GROWTH, MEASURED

FROM THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 1992 TO THE FOURTH QUARTER OF

1993, OF ____ TO ____ PERCENT FOR M2 AND ____ TO ____ PERCENT FOR

M3. THE COMMITTEE PROVISIONALLY SET THE ASSOCIATED

MONITORING RANGE FOR GROWTH OF DOMESTIC NONFINANCIAL DEBT

AT ___ TO ____ PERCENT FOR 1993. The behavior of the mone-

tary aggregates will continue to be evaluated in the light

of progress toward price level stability, movements in



-23-

their velocities, and developments in the economy and

financial markets.

OPERATIONAL PARAGRAPH

In the implementation of policy for the immediate

future, the Committee seeks to DECREASE SOMEWHAT/maintain/

INCREASE SOMEWHAT the existing degree of pressure on

reserve positions. In the context of the Committee's

long-run objectives for price stability and sustainable

economic growth, and giving careful consideration to

economic, financial, and monetary developments, slightly

(SOMEWHAT) greater reserve restraint (MIGHT/WOULD) or

slightly (SOMEWHAT) lesser reserve restraint might (WOULD)

be acceptable in the intermeeting period. The contem-

plated reserve conditions are expected to be consistent

with growth of M2 and M3 over the period from [DEL: April

through] June THROUGH SEPTEMBER at annual rates of about

____ AND ____ [DEL: 2-1/2 and 1-1/2] percent, respectively.

[HOWEVER, THE RECENT UNUSUAL BEHAVIOR OF THESE AGGREGATES

SUGGESTS THAT THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THEIR GROWTH AND

THE COMMITTEE'S LONG-RUN OBJECTIVES IS ESPECIALLY UNCER-

TAIN AT THIS TIME.]

n.s.--not specified.
1. Targets are for bank credit until 1983; from 1983 onward targets are for domestic
nonfinancial sector debt.
2. At the February 1979 meeting the FOMC adopted a QIV'78 to QIV'79 range for Ml of 1-1/2
to 4-1/2 percent. This range anticipated that shifting to ATS and NOW accounts in New
York State would slow M1 growth by 3 percentage points. At the October meeting it was
noted that ATS/NOW shifts would reduce Ml by no more than 1-1/2 percentage points. Thus,
the longer-run range for M1 was modified to 3-6 percent.
3. The figures shown reflect target and actual growth of M1-B in 1980 and shift-adjusted
M1-B in 1981. M1-B was relabeled M1 in January 1982. The targeted growth for Mi-A was 3-
1/2 to 6 percent in 1980 (actual growth was 5.0 percent); in 1981 targeted growth for
shift-adjusted M1-A was 3 to 5-1/2 percent (actual growth was 1.3 percent).
4. When these ranges were set, shifts into other checkable deposits in 1980 were expected
to have only a limited effect on growth of M1-A and M1-B. As the year progressed,
however, banks offered other checkable deposits more actively, and more funds than
expected were directed to these accounts. Such shifts are estimated to have decreased Ml-
A growth and increased M1-B growth each by at least 1/2 percentage point more than had
been anticipated.

(Footnotes are continued on next page)



5. Adjusted for the effects of shifts out of demand deposits and savings deposits into
other checkable deposits. At the February FOMC meeting, the target ranges for observed
M1-A and M1-B in 1981 on an unadjusted basis, expected to be consistent with the adjusted
ranges, were -4-1/2 to -2 and 6 to 8-1/2 percent, respectively. Actual M1-B growth (not
shift adjusted) was 5.0 percent.
6. Adjusted for shifts of assets from domestic banking offices to International Banking
Facilities.
7. Range for bank credit is annualized growth from the December 1981-January 1982 average
level through the fourth quarter of 1982.
8. Base period, adopted at the July 1983 FOMC meeting, is QII'83. At the February 1983
meeting the FOMC had adopted a QIV'82 to QIV'83 target range for M1 of 4 to 8 percent.
9. Base period is the February-March 1983 average.
10. Base period, adopted at the July 1985 FOMC meeting, is QII'85. At the February 1985
meeting the FOMC had adopted a QIV'84 to QIV'85 target range for M1 of 4 to 7 percent.
11. No range for M1 has been specified since the February 1987 FOMC meeting because of
uncertainties about its underlying relationship to the behavior of the economy and its
sensitivity to economic and financial circumstances.
12. At the February 1990 meeting the FOMC specified a range of 2-1/2 to 6-1/2 percent.
This range was lowered to 1 to 5 percent at the July 1990 meeting.
