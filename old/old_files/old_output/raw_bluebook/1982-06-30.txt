Prefatory Note 

 
 

The attached document represents the most complete and accurate version 
available based on original copies culled from the files of the FOMC Secretariat at the 
Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System.  This electronic document was 
created through a comprehensive digitization process which included identifying the best-
preserved paper copies, scanning those copies,1 and then making the scanned versions 
text-searchable.2  Though a stringent quality assurance process was employed, some 
imperfections may remain. 
 

Please note that this document may contain occasional gaps in the text.  These 
gaps are the result of a redaction process that removed information obtained on a 
confidential basis.  All redacted passages are exempt from disclosure under applicable

1 In some cases, original copies needed to be photocopied before being scanned into electronic format.  All 
scanned images were deskewed (to remove the effects of printer- and scanner-introduced tilting) and lightly 
cleaned (to remove dark spots caused by staple holes, hole punches, and other blemishes caused after initial 
printing). 
2 A two-step process was used.  An advanced optimal character recognition computer program (OCR) first 
created electronic text from the document image.  Where the OCR results were inconclusive, staff checked

MONETARY POLICY ALTERNATIVES

Recent developments

(1) Though showing only a very slight rise on balance over the

last two months, M1 grew over the March-to-June period at a 4 percent

annual rate, somewhat above the Committee's 3 percent short-run objective.

From the fourth quarter of 1981 to June, M1 is estimated to have increased

at a 6.3 percent annual rate, almost 1 percentage point above the upper

end of its 1982 range. Following a surge in late 1981 and early 1982,

growth in the OCD component has slowed markedly on balance over the last

few months, roughly in line with expectations built into the intermeeting

M1 path; this slowing suggests some abatement in precautionary demands for

funds.

(2) M2 growth at an 8.7 percent annual rate over March-June also

was somewhat above the Committee's second-quarter path, reflecting stronger

than expected expansion of its nontransaction component as well as the

overshoot in M1. From the fourth quarter of 1981 to June, M2 is estimated

to have increased at a 9.3 percent annual rate, just above its longer-run

range. The strength in M2 growth, accompanied by a substantial decline in

its income velocity, suggests that enhanced liquidity demands affected

this aggregate, as well as M1, over the first half of the year. In June,

however, M2 growth slowed substantially.

(3) Bank credit growth is estimated to have slowed markedly

in June, after growing at about a 9 percent annual rate over the preceding

two months. Business loan growth appears to have remained fairly rapid.

Bank issuance of large CDs accelerated sharply in the past two months,

sustaining growth in M3--which by June was just above the Committee's

1982 range. Businesses have continued to tap the commercial paper market

for sizable volumes of new funds. Bond issuance on domestic markets in

May rose to its highest level since last fall, before subsiding more

recently as bond yields moved higher.

(4) Total reserves expanded at about a 3¼ percent average annual

rate in May and June; with nonborrowed reserves growing at an 8½ percent

rate over the two months, borrowing at the discount window fell about

$340 million from the April level. Throughout the intermeeting period

borrowing has remained above the initial level of $800 million specified

by the Committee, averaging $950 million for the six weeks. Borrowing in

excess of the initial level early in the period partly reflected increased

needs for borrowed reserves resulting from unexpected shortfalls in reserve

factors late in the week as well as apparent difficulties of some large

individual institutions in gauging reserve positions.1/ Most recently,

nonborrowed paths have implied borrowing around $1 billion, as money growth

above Committee objectives has boosted the demand for total reserves rela-

tive to the path for nonborrowed reserves.

(5) The federal funds rate has averaged around 14¼ percent during

the two most recent full statement weeks,2/ compared with the 14½ percent

area prevailing at the time of the May FOMC meeting. At the same time,

however, other interest rates have risen about ½ to 1½ percentage points

over the intermeeting period. Publication of money stock increases in

early June, along with expectations of a further rise in July, affected

market sentiment, as did the approach of a period of heavy Treasury

financing demands and indications that economic activity was no longer

declining. Difficulties associated with the failure of Drysdale Government

Securities in mid-May and the problems of Comark in early June appear not

to have affected the attainment of reserve objectives by the System. How-

ever, these episodes have fostered a heightened awareness of differences in

credit risk throughout the securities markets, and some changes in quality

spreads. Some smaller dealers have had to pay a higher premium for funds.

(6) The rise in U.S. interest rates has contributed to the 7 3/4

increase in the weighted average value of the dollar since the May FOMC

meeting. A secondary factor in the strength of the dollar has been its

attractiveness as a safe-haven currency in the context of intensified

hostilities in the Middle East. On Saturday, June 12, the European Monetary

System realigned its currency band, devaluing the French franc and the lira

and revaluing the mark and the guilder. When trading resumed on the Monday

following the realignment, exchange markets were judged to be disorderly

and the United States intervened for the first time since March 1981,

purchasing $21 million equivalent of marks and $9 million equivalent of

yen.

Longer-run targets

(7) Two options that seem reasonable under current circumstances

in reconsidering the monetary aggregate targets for 1982 are retention of

the present ranges (shown as alternative A below) or adoption of somewhat

higher ranges (shown as alternative B).1/ The desirability of higher ranges

depends in part on whether it is thought that the strong demands for

liquidity of the first half of the year--reflected in declines in velocity

of both M1 and M2--are likely to abate. It also depends, of course, on the

degree of monetary restraint the Committee deems appropriate under current

economic circumstances and on assessment of the expectational impact on

interest rates and the economy of announced changes, if any, in target

ranges.

Alt. A Alt. B

M1 2½ to 5½ 2½ to 6

M2 6 to 9 6½ to 9½

M3 6½ to 9½ 6½ to 10

(8) Whether the Committee retains its current longer-run ranges,

or raises them modestly as in alternative B, a marked slowing in growth of

M1 would be required from the first-half pace of a little over 7 percent at

an annual rate (as measured from QIV '81 to QII '82). If the Committee were

to aim at 5 percent growth for the year, expansion in the second half would

have to slow to around a 2¾ percent annual rate. Second-half growth could

1/ Somewhat the same effect as raising the ranges could be obtained in the
case of M1 by rebasing on the lower limit of last year's growth ranges
rather than basing on the actual outcome, which would effectively
raise the range by 1 percentage point. This had been discussed by
the Committee last February. Whatever the advantages and disadvantages
at that time, there is an added disadvantage now because the considerable
time that has elapsed since the base period tends to make raising issues
in connection with the base seem a bit strained.



-6-

be about 4¾ percent at an annual rate if the Committee were to accept a

6 percent growth for the year.

(9) It is believed that the degree of slowing in M1 growth

implied by retention of the current longer-run target ranges is generally

consistent with the staff's forecast of a moderate pickup in economic

activity in the second half of this year, assuming growth in M1 over the

year near the upper limit of its long-run range. Growth in M2 and M3

would be expected to be around the upper end of their ranges. An accelera-

tion in the velocity of monetary aggregates is expected in the second half

of the year--in the case of M1 to the 4½ to 5½ percent range. Apart

from the positive impact of renewed economic confidence and reduced demands

for precautionary balances on velocity growth, more intensive use of cash

balances could emerge if there is a spread of sweep accounts or shifts

out of cash into the kinds of highly liquid time deposit accounts that are

being considered by DIDC at its forthcoming meeting. On the other hand,

continued unusual demands for liquidity could damp the expected rebound

in velocity, and make it less likely that a significant upturn in economic

activity would occur in the context of money growth within the bounds of

the existing target ranges.

(10) Factors relevant to the setting of tentative targets for

1983 include expectations about the impact on money demand of changes

in financial structure and technology, progress in curbing wage-price

pressures, and the continued need to encourage economic recovery. Un-

certainties about the impact of financial innovation and public attitudes

toward money and other liquid assets argue for maintaining relatively wide

ranges for targets, such as the present 3 percentage points. Continuing



progress toward price stability suggests that these ranges might be

reduced next year, but slower growth in money next year can also be

accomplished, of course, within the present ranges.

(11) A reduction in 1983 of the upper and lower limits of the

ranges for M1, M2, and M3 from their current levels by ½ percentage point

would be consistent with the staff's GNP projection for that year--if

actual growth in the aggregate were permitted to be near the upper limits

of the ranges. The table on the following page summarizes implications

for economic activity of various monetary policy strategies, as indexed

by growth rates for M1. Strategy 1 underlies the staff's judgmental

GNP projection, which is based on growth of M1 at a 5 percent rate in

1982, with growth declining by point in each succeeding year. The

alternative projections are derived from differences calculated by the

quarterly econometric model.

(12) Strategy 2 projects the possible outcome of a modest

increase in the target range for money this year, while returning to the

strategy 1 assumptions for M1 growth in the next years. This approach

tends to have a positive effect on economic activity this year, but it

leads to a somewhat higher inflation rate over time and the probability

of a noticeable rebound of interest rates in 1983 after a drop in the

latter part of this year. This interest rate rebound contributes to

a slowing in growth of economic activity in the latter part of the pro-

jection period. Strategy 4 contemplates an increase in money growth this

year and also more growth than under strategy 2 during the next two years.

Economic activity would tend to be stronger over the three projection

years, but the rate of price inflation, after falling for a while, begins

to accelerate in 1984. The rate of inflation could, of course, pick up

earlier, with economic activity weaker, should such a monetary course

itself have adverse effects on inflationary expectations. Strategy 3,

which contemplates a more rapid deceleration in money growth over the next

two years following 5 percent growth this year, produces the most rapid

progress toward price stability but at the cost of stronger pressures

on short-term interest rate and reduced real growth. With all of the

monetary strategies, short-term interest rates remain relatively high

in real terms. This evolves out of the continued strength in nominal

income and associated money demand relative to money supply targets, with

nominal income sustained by stimulative fiscal policy of the Federal

Government whose credit demands are generally insensitive to interest

rates.

Alternative short-run targets

(13) The table below presents three alternative sets of monetary

targets for the third quarter, plus associated ranges for the federal funds

rate during the intermeeting period. More detailed data for the alternatives

are shown in the table on page 11.

Growth from June to September

M1 5½ 4 2½

M2 8½ 7¾ 7

Federal funds rate range 10 to 15 11 to 16 12 to 17

(14) Under alternative A, M1 over the next three months would

grow at a rate matching that of the upper bound of the Committee's current

longer-run range. Because such a trajectory would mean that there would

be no narrowing of the existing absolute gap relative to the top of the

range, alternative A might be viewed as especially consistent with a deci-

sion to raise the 1982 range or to tolerate a small overshoot. Under

alternative B, M1 would expand at a rate that, if sustained, would result

in growth for the year at about the 5½ percent upper bound of the longer-

run range, while alternative C contemplates growth in M1 which would move

the aggregate to just within this year's range by September. Under all

alternatives, the level of M2 by September would be around its upper limit--

a bit above in the case of alternative A and somewhat below in the case

of alternative C. (See charts on the next two pages).

(15) Under any of the alternatives, growth of M1 in July probably

will be relatively strong owing in part to special factors. The introduc-

tion of lower income tax withholding schedules tends to boost M1 balances

for a while since spending or investing patterns generally take some time

to adjust to changes in disposable income. Growth in July is also likely

to be increased in some small degree by enlarged social security benefits

stemming from this year's COLA which will be paid out just prior to the

long July 4th holiday weekend.

(16) The growth of M1 at a 4 percent pace specified in alterna-

tive B for the whole June-September period is not expected to be accompanied

by upward interest rate pressures despite the anticipated strengthening

in nominal GNP. It seems likely that transaction demands for cash in the

third quarter will be satisfied in part by liquidity built up earlier this

year. The federal funds rate might be at or somewhat below the 14¼ percent

level of recent statement weeks, trading generally in a 13-14¼ percent

range. At the current 12 percent discount rate, adjustment borrowing

from the discount window likely would be in the $800 million to $1 billion

area. With expansion in total reserves at a 5 percent annual rate over

the quarter, a nonborrowed reserve path calling for growth at a slightly

faster rate would be implied.

(17) Other short-term rates might decline some under this

alternative, with the 3-month bill rate moving back toward 12 percent or

somewhat lower. Bond yields might also decline a little, but any break-

out from the rate range of the past few months probably would require in

addition more favorable fiscal policy developments or indications that

economic recovery, and associated private capital demands, will be weaker

than now generally anticipated. However, Treasury borrowing in the third

quarter is currently estimated by the staff at about $50 billion, con-

siderably higher than announced to date by the government and possibly

more than generally anticipated in the market. Barring a large decline

in longer-term rates, corporate bond issues are likely to remain limited.



-13-

Business borrowing at banks and in short-term markets may taper off, but,

if so, is likely to be replaced by a reduced accumulation of liquid assets,

following the apparent second quarter surge. Household borrowing is likely

to remain restrained, owing to the deterrent effects of high real interest

rates and lender caution.

(18) Alternative A, which targets faster growth in M1 than

alternative B, could well produce a fairly substantial decline in money

market rates. An increase in total reserves on the order of 6 ¼ percent

from June to September would be consistent with the 5 ½ percent growth

rate specified for M1 during the quarter. The federal funds rate likely

would decline to a zone somewhat above the present discount rate, with

adjustment borrowing falling into the $300 to $500 million range. Assuming

borrowing were to average about $400 million, growth of nonborrowed reserves

would be 12 percent.

(19) The easing of the funds market likely to occur under this

alternative should result in a substantial lowering of market rates generally.

The 3-month Treasury bill rate probably would fall to around the 11-11½

percent area and the decline in bank costs of funds would likely push the

prime rate down. Mortgage rates would again begin declining, encouraging

moderately stronger loan demand in that sector. Lagging yields on money

market funds would tend to strengthen M2 and M3 a bit in the short run as

more aggressive money managers shift away from market instruments. In

exchange markets, the dollar likely would probably decline substantially;

this tendency could be limited to a degree, however, if foreign central

banks responded by seeking an easing of their domestic interest rates.

(20) Alternative C sets the most restrictive monetary target,

with M1 growth during the third quarter specified at only 2½ percent.



-14-

It seems likely that the more restrained reserve provision consistent

with such growth would place further pressure on the money markets, with

the federal funds rate moving to 15 percent or a bit higher over the inter-

meeting periods. Borrowing at the discount window would rise to the vicinity

of $1½ billion, and nonborrowed reserves would drop at a 1½ percent annual

rate over the quarter.

(21) The firming in the funds market expected under alternative

C should be accompanied by moderately higher market rates generally but

with the likelihood that commercial paper and CD rates may rise more

rapidly than Treasury bill rates as concerns about spreading financial

problems are exacerbated. The 3-month bill rate may be in a 13 to 13½

percent range, and 3-month CD rates could move above 16 percent. Financial

pressures would inhibit the upturn in aggregate demand. The bank prime

rate likely would rise, as would primary mortgage rates. The dollar

probably would come under further substantial upward pressure in exchange

markets.



-15-

Directive language

(22) Given below is a suggested operational paragraph for the

directive. The specifications adopted at the meeting on May 18 are

shown in strike-through form.

In the short run, the Committee seeks behavior of reserve

aggregates consistent with growth of M1 and M2 from March to June

TO SEPTEMBER at annual rates of about [DEL: 3] ____ percent and [DEL: 8] ____

percent respectively. [DEL: The Committee also noted that deviations

from these targets should be evaluated in light of changes in the

relative importance of NOW accounts as a savings vehicle.] The

Chairman may call for Committee consultation if it appears to

the Manager for Domestic Operations that pursuit of the monetary

objectives and related reserve paths during the period before

the next meeting is likely to be associated with a federal

funds rate persistently outside a range of [DEL: 10 to 15] ____ TO ____

percent.

NOTE: Government securities dealer cash positions consist of securities already delivered, commit-
ments to buy (sell) securities on an outright basis for immediate delivery (5 business days or less), and
certain "when-issued" securities for delayed delivery (more than 5 business days). Futures and forward
positions include all other commitments involving delayed delivery; futures contracts are arranged on
organized exchanges. Underwriting syndicate positions consists of issues in syndicate, excluding
trading positions.

Weekly data are daily averages for statement weeks, except for corporate and municipal issues ii
syndicate, which are Friday figures. Monthly averages for excess reserves and borrowing are weighte
averages of statement week figures. Monthly data for dealer futures and forwards are end-of-month
figures for 1980.
