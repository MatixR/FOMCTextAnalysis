MONETARY POLICY ALTERNATIVES 

Recent Developments 

(1) The decision at the May FOMC meeting to raise the federal funds rate 

target 25 basis points to 3 percent, to maintain an assessment of balanced risks to the 

goals of price stability and sustainable growth, and to retain the “measured pace” 

language was widely expected in financial markets and elicited little reaction by the 

end of the day.1, 2  The minutes that were published three weeks later also held few 

surprises for investors.  In the weeks that followed, releases of data on economic 

activity appear to have reassured market participants that solid economic expansion 

will continue and inflation will likely remain benign.  Policy expectations, which were 

buffeted at times by remarks by Federal Reserve officials, ended the period a bit 

higher in the near term but markedly lower at longer horizons (Chart 1).  According 

to options on federal funds futures, market participants are confident that the FOMC 

will hike the funds rate 25 basis points at the June FOMC meeting and view another 

such increase at the August meeting as very likely.  However, high odds are placed on 

a pause in the tightening cycle later in the year, and the expected funds rate at the end 

of 2006 is currently 3.73 percent, down 21 basis points from the level that prevailed 

before the May FOMC meeting.  All twenty-two primary dealers responding to the 

most recent survey by the Trading Desk predict a 25-basis-point rate increase at the 

                                           
1 The statement released at 2:15 p.m. mistakenly omitted the Committee’s observation that 
inflation was well contained, and it was subsequently corrected.  Money market futures rates 
moved in a 5-basis-point range that afternoon but ended the day little changed. 
2 The effective federal funds rate averaged 3.00 percent over the intermeeting period.  The 
Desk purchased $4.3 billion of Treasury coupon securities and $1.25 billion of Treasury bills 
in the market.  The volume of outstanding long-term RPs remained unchanged at $17 
billion.

June meeting and nearly all expect statement language similar to that of the last 

meeting.   

(2) Nominal Treasury yields showed mixed changes, on net, over the 

intermeeting period:  Two-year yields were unchanged and ten-year yields ended the 

period near 4 percent, about 25 basis points below the level at the May meeting.3  The 

decline in longer-term nominal Treasury yields masked an increase in real rates as 

inflation compensation fell appreciably, even though both spot and far-dated futures 

oil prices rose considerably over the same period.  With investors apparently more 

confident about the outlook, five- and ten-year TIPS yields rose 22 and 7 basis points, 

respectively, although after adjusting for lags in inflation indexing the five-year rate 

was up only about 10 basis points and the ten-year rate was about unchanged.  On a 

similarly adjusted basis, inflation compensation fell about 25 basis points across the 

maturity structure, as investors’ concerns about inflation pressures ebbed.  Some 

survey measures of inflation expectations also moved down a little over the 

intermeeting period.  

(3) Corporate securities markets weathered rating downgrades in the auto 

sector over the intermeeting period.  Investors were apparently reassured in part by 

economic news pointing to continued firm expansion.  Spreads on investment-grade 

corporate bonds were little changed over the intermeeting period, while spreads on 

speculative-grade bonds fell 19 basis points—though they remain noticeably above 

the very low levels seen earlier in the year (see Chart 2 and the box “Credit Market 

and Hedge Fund Developments”).  Over the intermeeting period, broad measures of 

corporate credit quality generally remained favorable, implied volatility on equities 

                                           
3 The upward slope of the term structure of forward rates at the time of the May FOMC 
meeting suggests that investors expected the two-year yield to rise 7 basis points over this 
intermeeting period.  However, downward revisions to the expected path for policy beyond 
the end of the year offset this effect.  The level and recent movement of the ten-year yield is 
addressed in more detail in the material sent to the Committee on June 23 by Vincent 
Reinhart, “Some Perspective on Longer-Term Yields.”

Credit Market and Hedge Fund 
Developments 

The difficulties experienced by U.S. automobile 
manufacturers placed strains on the credit 
markets early in the spring.  After rising a good 
bit in March and April, credit default swap (CDS) 
indexes jumped in the wake of earlier-than- 
expected Standard and Poor’s downgrade of Ford 
and General Motors to junk status on May 5.  As 
investors became concerned about the overall 
market impact of the downgrades, implied 
volatility on the investment-grade CDS index also 
surged and market liquidity reportedly 
deteriorated for a time.  Many hedge funds were 
said to have entered the month of May as sellers 
of credit protection and of volatility and may 
have contributed to the strains as they moved to 
reduce their positions. 

Market conditions improved substantially 
beginning in mid-May, and both spreads and 
implied volatilities ended the intermeeting period 
somewhat lower, on net.  However, spreads and 
implied volatilities remain well above the levels 
that prevailed before Ford and General Motors 
revised down their outlooks at the beginning of 
March, most likely evidence of both investors’ 
demand for greater compensation for bearing risk 
and increased perception of risk. 

The fallout in credit markets appears to have 
been limited.  A number of small- and medium-
sized hedge funds suffered substantial losses in 
April and a few of them were subsequently 
closed.  And some large credit derivatives dealers 
reported notable declines in earnings from 
trading in their fiscal second quarter.  However, 
hedge-fund performance appears to have 
improved since April.

moved down, and major equity indexes rose appreciably.  Nonetheless, a rough 

measure of the equity premium—the gap between the twelve-month forward trend 

earnings-price ratio and the real perpetuity Treasury yield—widened some. 

(4) The trade-weighted foreign exchange value of the dollar against major 

currencies rose 3¼ percent on balance over the intermeeting period (Chart 3).4  The 

dollar apparently drew strength from data releases indicating continued solid U.S. 

growth, but its moves against individual currencies varied widely.  The dollar gained 

almost 7 percent against the euro, in reaction to the emphatic rejection of the 

proposed European constitution by French and Dutch voters and several weaker-

than-expected data releases in the euro area.  Comments from ECB officials appeared 

to suggest that the ECB’s next policy move could be a rate cut, and one-year-ahead 

euro futures rates fell 35 basis points over the period.  Recent data on economic 

performance in Japan were more encouraging, but the dollar moved up about 3½ 

percent against the yen.  In contrast, the dollar fell almost 2 percent against the 

Canadian dollar, as stronger employment and trade data prompted upward revisions 

to the outlook for Canadian growth.  Except in Japan, yields on long-term 

government securities in other major industrial countries declined during the 

intermeeting period; yields on some European sovereign issues touched record lows 

earlier in the period.  Share prices in foreign industrial countries registered increases 

that ranged from 4 to 8 percent, often led by high-tech stocks.  Against the currencies 

of our other important trading partners the dollar was about unchanged on balance 

over the intermeeting period, as decreases in its value versus the Brazilian real and the 

Mexican peso were offset by increases against several Asian currencies, including the 

Korean won, the Singapore dollar, and the Thai baht.

(5) With domestic nonfederal debt expected to expand at a somewhat slower 

pace in the second quarter, and higher final payments during the April tax season 

damping federal borrowing, domestic nonfinancial debt is expected to decelerate to a 

6¼ percent rate in the second quarter (Chart 4).  Bond issuance by nonfinancial 

corporations was weak in April and May, as elevated spreads held down offerings by 

speculative-grade firms.  However, issuance has picked up considerably in recent 

weeks, reflecting the decline in long-term interest rates as well as issuance by firms 

that had postponed coming to market in May.  Commercial paper issuance has been 

solid and business loans have continued to expand, likely spurred in part by merger 

and acquisition activity.  Household debt is likely to grow at a brisk rate in the second 

quarter, owing to persistent strength in its mortgage component.  Mortgage demand 

in recent quarters has been driven in part by rapid increases in house prices.  The 

OFHEO purchase-only index rose 10¼ percent over the year ending in the first 

quarter. 

(6) M2 has been weak in recent months—contracting in April and advancing 

sluggishly on net over May and early June—owing to the increased opportunity cost 

of holding M2 assets.  Liquid deposits were especially weak over this period, as rates 

on these deposits adjust slowly to rising short-term market rates.  Despite the recent 

weakness in M2, its velocity in the current quarter is projected to remain below the 

level one would anticipate given historical relationships with opportunity costs.

Economic Outlook 

(7) The staff’s outlook for spending and output has changed little since the May 
FOMC meeting, but its forecast for inflation has been nudged up.  The cumulative 

policy tightening in this projection is the same as in the April Greenbook, although 

the staff now assumes that the firming will be more front-loaded, with a 50-basis-

point increase over the balance of 2005 and 25 basis points in 2006.  Bond yields are 

expected to edge higher, equity prices increase from their current higher levels at a 

pace sufficient to provide risk-adjusted returns in line with those in fixed-income 

markets, and the foreign exchange value of the dollar depreciates gradually, albeit 

from a level that is about 2¼ percent above that anticipated in the last Greenbook.  

The price of West Texas intermediate crude oil, which starts from a spot price that is 

more than $6 per barrel above that foreseen in the April Greenbook, is forecast to 

move sideways over the next two years in line with futures market quotes.  In view of 

recent employment reports and other incoming data, the staff now sees the economy 

as operating with a little less resource slack, and output growth is again projected to 

narrowly exceed that of potential over the next few quarters.  Slack nevertheless 

persists over the forecast period, with the unemployment rate lingering a touch above 

the staff’s estimate of the NAIRU and the output gap edging down to the ¾ percent 

area.  The upward revision to the forecast for inflation partly reflects the direct and 

indirect effects of higher energy prices.  Still, with resources underused, import prices 

rising more slowly, and energy prices flattening out, core PCE inflation is projected to 

edge down from just above 2 percent this year to a touch under 2 percent next year; 

overall PCE inflation is expected to fall from 2½ percent to 1¾ percent over the 

same period.

Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) 10 of 42



Longer-Run Strategy 

(8) To analyze strategies and risks for monetary policy, several sets of 

simulations were conducted using the version of the FRB/US model with the 

following properties:  Policymakers base their decisions on complete knowledge of 

the model and the forces hypothesized to be consistent with the extended Greenbook 

outlook; financial markets—including those for foreign exchange, stocks, and 

bonds—understand how monetary policy is set so that the path of policy is not 

associated with systematic forecast errors by investors; and households and firms 

form their expectations using more limited information, as in the standard version of 

the model. For each model simulation, the optimal path of the funds rate was 

determined based on policymakers’ relative preferences for minimizing deviations in 

unemployment from its natural rate and deviations in inflation from a long-run goal 

(defined in terms of the core PCE index) as well as for minimizing changes in the 

federal funds rate.5  One set of simulations was oriented towards evaluating the 

macroeconomic effects of alternative values of the long-run inflation goal, while a 

second set was conducted to analyze factors instrumental in achieving the inflation 

goal.   

(9) The baseline for these simulations was prepared using the FRB/US model 

(with judgmental adjustments) to extend the staff forecast through 2015.  On the 

supply side, structural labor productivity growth is assumed to moderate toward 

historical norms, slowing from 3 percent this year to 2¼ percent by 2015.  Potential 

output growth is projected to decrease from 3¼ percent to a little below 2½ percent 

by 2015, while the NAIRU is assumed to remain at 5 percent.  As for aggregate 

                                           
5 More precisely, the federal funds rate path is chosen to minimize the equally weighted sum 
of three components:  the squared deviations of unemployment from its natural rate; the 
squared deviations of core PCE inflation from target; and squared changes in the funds rate.  
The last term helps ensure that the optimal funds rate path in the simulation does not exhibit 
much more volatility than that observed in the historical record. 

Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) 11 of 42



demand, the personal saving rate is expected to rise gradually, while the unified federal 

budget deficit remains around 2½ percent of nominal GDP over the next decade.  

Although the real foreign exchange value of the dollar depreciates at an annual rate of 

about 4 percent from 2007 onwards, the current account deficit is projected to widen 

to a peak of nearly 8 percent of nominal GDP by 2011 and to decrease gradually 

thereafter.   

(10) The first set of simulations analyzes the implications of alternative 

specifications of the long-run goal for core PCE inflation.  The solid line in each 

panel of Chart 5 depicts a scenario in which policymakers aim for the core PCE 

inflation rate eventually to settle down at 1½ percent.  In this case, the funds rate rises 

steadily over the next eighteen months and then remains at a plateau of about 4 

percent through the end of 2012.  With that backdrop of moderately tight financial 

conditions, the unemployment rate stays a bit higher than its natural rate over the next 

eight years.  Core PCE inflation remains close to 1¾ percent through 2008 and then 

begins to fall very gradually towards the long-run goal.  A key factor explaining the 

shallowness of the decline in inflation is that the expectations of households and firms 

regarding the long-term average rate of inflation recede slowly from nearly 2 percent 

in 2005 to about 1.6 percent in 2012.  The dashed line in each panel corresponds to a 

lower long-run inflation goal of 1 percent.  In this case, the funds rate reaches a peak 

of about 4½ percent by early next year before easing somewhat in subsequent 

quarters.  Given the tighter path for policy, the unemployment rate moves up to 

around 5½ percent and remains there while inflation moves gradually towards the 

long-run goal, falling below 1½ percent by the end of the decade.  In contrast, a 

somewhat higher inflation goal of 2 percent (dotted line) allows policymakers to 

tighten policy far more gradually this year and next.  This policy does not involve 

substantial gaps between unemployment and its natural rate, because the actual path 

of inflation is fairly close to the central bank’s goal and to the long-run expectations of

households and firms. 

(11) At first glance, an apparently unattractive implication of the preceding 

simulations is that policymakers’ pursuit of their inflation objective appears to be 

rather tepid, with actual inflation still differing noticeably from the goal at the end of 

2012.  However, such an outcome is optimal in the FRB/US model when 

policymakers place equal weights on stabilizing unemployment and inflation.  Because 

the model implies that inflation is quite insensitive to the level of economic activity 

and long-term inflation expectations of households and firms evolve slowly in 

response to realized inflation, policymakers do not find it worthwhile to create 

sufficient resource slack to make more rapid progress in achieving the inflation goal.  

The simulations shown in Chart 6 consider two potential mechanisms within this 

modeling framework that could hasten the attainment of a long-run goal of 1½ 

percent core PCE inflation. First, a stronger focus on inflation can be represented by 

ratcheting down the relative weight on unemployment deviations; in this case, the 

optimal path of policy (as indicated by the dashed lines) is significantly tighter than in 

the benchmark case with equal weights on unemployment and inflation (the solid 

lines).6  Second, the long-term inflation expectations of households and firms might 

move lower, perhaps encouraged by the adoption of an explicit long-run inflation 

objective; 7 under this assumption, the optimal path of the funds rate only rises 

modestly over the next few quarters to a plateau of about 3½ percent.  While both 

approaches succeed in bringing inflation close to the Committee’s assumed goal 

within the next few years, the model indicates that the unemployment costs are 

substantially smaller when this outcome is achieved through less inertial inflation 

                                           
6 Specifically, the weight on the unemployment-gap term is diminished by a factor of one-
twentieth. 
7 To illustrate this possibility, we assume that long-term inflation expectations converge to 
the 1½ percent objective by the end of 2007.

achieve that end remains an open question. 

Short-Run Policy Alternatives 

(12) Table 1 presents three short-run policy alternatives for consideration by the 

Committee.  Under Alternatives A and B, the federal funds rate would be boosted 

another 25 basis points at this meeting.  Apart from updating the description of the 

current economic situation, the announcement associated with Alternative B is little 

changed from that issued after the May meeting.  The announcement accompanying 

Alternative A would indicate that policy accommodation had been substantially 

reduced and would hint at less tightening going forward.  Under Alternative C, the 

Committee would raise the federal funds rate 50 basis points at this meeting, eliminate 

all forward-looking language, and make other significant changes to the 

announcement.  As usual, the Committee could consider combining policy action and 

draft language from more than one alternative or view some of the language choices 

as foreshadowing the future direction of its statement. 

(13) The Committee may see little reason to diverge at this point from its 

established precedent of measured policy firming and thus be attracted to 

Alternative B.  Although aggregate spending and output growth evidently slowed in 

early spring, the economy appears to remain reasonably robust.  Moreover, the recent 

evidence may be read as indicating that the pace of expansion is likely to rebound 

during the second half of the year to a rate somewhat above that of the growth of 

potential output, even with further modest policy tightening.  That outlook is 

consistent with staff estimates of the equilibrium real federal funds rate (Chart 7), 

which mostly lie well above the current level of the real federal funds rate.  

Meanwhile, although recent inflation readings have proven reassuring, further 

increases in energy prices and diminishing slack in the economy may be read by

Equilibrium Real Rate Chart: Explanatory Notes 
 

The equilibrium real rate is the real federal funds rate that, if maintained, would be projected to return 
output to its potential level over time.  The short-run equilibrium rate is defined as the rate that would 
close the output gap in twelve quarters given a model’s projection of the economy, and the medium-run 
concept is the value of the real funds rate projected to keep output at potential in seven years under the 
assumption that monetary policy acts to bring actual and potential output into line in the short run and 
then keep them equal thereafter.  The real federal funds rate employs the log difference of the core PCE 
price index over the previous four quarters as a proxy for expected inflation, with the staff projection 
used for the current quarter.  Since TIPS indexation is based on the total CPI, the TIPS-consistent 
measure incorporates an adjustment for the expected difference between CPI inflation and core PCE 
inflation. 
        

Measure Description 

Single-Equation 
Model  

The measure of the equilibrium real rate in the single-equation model is based on an 
estimated aggregate-demand relationship between the current value of the output gap and 
its lagged values as well as the lagged values of the real federal funds rate.  In light of 
this model’s simple structure, the short-run measure of the equilibrium real rate depends 
only on the recent position of output relative to potential, and the medium-run measure is 
virtually constant. 

Small Structural 
Model 

The small-scale model of the economy consists of equations for five variables: the output 
gap, the equity premium, the federal budget surplus, the trend growth rate of output, and 
the real bond yield.  Unlike the estimates from the single-equation model, values of the 
equilibrium real rate also depend directly on conditions associated with output growth, 
fiscal policy, and capital markets. 

Large Model 
(FRB/US) 

Estimates of the equilibrium real rate using FRB/US—the staff’s large-scale econometric 
model of the U.S. economy—depend on a very broad array of economic factors, some of 
which take the form of projected values of the model’s exogenous variables.  These 
projections make use of several simple forecasting rules which are appropriate for the 
three-year horizon relevant for the short-run concept but are less sensible over longer 
horizons.  Thus, we report only the short-run measure for the FRB/US model. 

Greenbook-
consistent  

Measures of the equilibrium real rate cannot be directly obtained from the Greenbook 
forecast, because the Greenbook is not based on a formal model.  Rather, we use the 
FRB/US model in conjunction with an extended version of the Greenbook forecast to 
derive a Greenbook-consistent measure.  FRB/US is first add-factored so that its 
simulation matches the extended Greenbook forecast, and then a second simulation is run 
off this baseline to determine the value of the real federal funds rate that closes the output 
gap.  The medium-run concept of the equilibrium real rate is not computed because it 
requires a relatively long extension of the Greenbook forecast. 

TIPS-consistent Yields on TIPS (Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities) incorporate investors’ 
expectations of the future path of real interest rates.  The seven-year instantaneous real 
forward rate derived from TIPS yields as of the Bluebook publication date reflects the 
short-term real interest rate expected to prevail in seven years. This forward rate is 
adjusted down for a term premium, assumed to be 70 basis points, and adjusted up for the 
difference between total CPI inflation and core PCE inflation, projected to be 40 basis 
points in the medium run.

members as posing risks to inflation performance.  With the inflation outlook perhaps 

slightly worse than previously anticipated and solid economic expansion seemingly on 

track, the Committee may well be inclined to continue its measured pace of firming at 

this meeting.  In favoring this over a larger move, members might interpret some 

market indicators, including inflation compensation read from TIPS and the 

considerable flattening of the nominal yield curve, as suggesting that an aggressive 

tightening of policy at this time is not warranted.   

(14) The announcement associated with Alternative B would update the wording 

of the May statement in view of incoming data on spending, output, and employment 

but would leave the rest of the statement unchanged.  As shown in Table 1, the 

statement would indicate that “Growth in spending slowed somewhat in the spring, 

and energy prices have risen further.  Nonetheless, recent data suggest that the 

expansion remains solid and that labor market conditions continue to improve 

gradually.”  Regarding inflation, it would modify slightly the wording used in May to 

say that “Pressures on inflation have stayed elevated”—an indirect reference to even 

higher energy prices and slightly reduced economic slack—and delete the mention of 

pricing power, a phenomenon that appears to have received less attention of late.  

The recent evidence on long-term inflation expectations has been good, with readings 

from TIPS down appreciably over the intermeeting period and survey-based measures 

ticking down after rising a bit earlier in the spring.  These circumstances might be seen 

as consistent with a reiteration of the view that “longer-term inflation expectations 

remain well contained.”  With events thus far unfolding broadly in line with the 

Committee’s expectations, it might again indicate that “. . . with appropriate monetary 

policy action, the upside and downside risks to the attainment of both sustainable 

growth and price stability should be kept roughly equal.”  On the same logic, the 

Committee might again be comfortable expressing an expectation that the removal of 

policy accommodation could likely proceed at a measured pace.  

Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) 20 of 42



(15) Financial market participants unanimously expect the FOMC to increase the 

target federal funds rate 25 basis points at Thursday’s meeting.  Also, most if not all 

expect relatively minor changes to the language, with nearly unanimous anticipation 

that the Committee will both retain an assessment that the risks to sustainable growth 

and price stability are balanced and reiterate the “measured pace” language.  Investors, 

however, would likely view the lack of any signal that the Committee intends to pause 

sometime soon, as well as the absence of an acknowledgment of a decline in inflation 

expectations, as a reason to build in a bit more firming. 

(16) The Committee may believe that the 2¼-percentage-point cumulative 

tightening over the past year implied by a 25-basis-point move at this meeting would 

amount to a substantial reduction in the degree of monetary policy accommodation 

and that, after Thursday, the real federal funds rate may be within a notch or two of 

its sustainable level.  As can be seen in Chart 7, a 25-basis-point step next week plus 

one more such action would bring the real funds rate close to the lower edge of the 

range of model-based estimates of the equilibrium real funds rate.  Particularly if the 

Committee is averse to quick reversals in the direction of policy adjustment, it may be 

inclined to move relatively slowly after this meeting in order to allow more time to 

gauge the effects of recent policy actions and to avoid overshooting with its policy 

instrument.  In this case, the FOMC may be attracted to Alternative A’s combination 

of a 25-basis-point hike in the funds rate at this meeting and statement wording that 

hints that the Committee could soon pause, at least for a time, in its process of policy 

firming.  Members might view such an indication as allowing for a smoother 

transition toward a reasonably sustainable policy stance.  And with economic growth 

having slowed somewhat in the second quarter and investors’ concerns about 

inflation apparently having diminished significantly in recent weeks, the Committee 

may see little risk that such a signal would compromise its credibility regarding the 

pursuit of its price stability objective.  If the Committee saw a 2 percent inflation 

Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) 21 of 42



target as appropriate, then, as shown in Chart 5 of the previous section of the 

Bluebook, monetary tightening going forward can be considerably more gradual than 

it has been over the past year.  Winding down the process of tightening, at least for 

now, would also presumably be favored to the extent that members read the net 

reduction in, and low level of, long-term yields as a signal that market participants 

harbored doubts about the continued robustness of economic expansion. 

(17) The draft statement associated with Alternative A could be explicit that 

“The Committee believes that the degree of monetary policy accommodation has 

been substantially reduced.”  Presuming that the FOMC would again wish to indicate 

that robust underlying productivity growth was supporting the economic expansion, 

the announcement could follow that indication with “Nonetheless, growth in 

spending slowed somewhat in the spring” while again acknowledging that labor 

market conditions apparently continue to improve gradually.  With regard to prices, 

the statement could accentuate the positive by indicating that “Readings on inflation 

have been subdued in recent months, and longer-term inflation expectations have 

declined.”  Finally, the FOMC could indicate that remaining policy accommodation 

can likely be removed at a measured pace.   

(18) Market participants continue to expect that the path of the intended federal 

funds rate will flatten out somewhat in the second half of the year, but market 

commentary and survey evidence suggest that investors do not anticipate that the 

FOMC will overtly signal any such development next week.  Accordingly, a statement 

employing the draft wording shown in Alternative A would likely produce a 

noticeable downward shift in money market futures quotes, a rally in bond and equity 

markets, and some depreciation in the foreign exchange value of the dollar.  The 

extent of the rally, however, would likely be limited by the clear implication that some 

further tightening was still likely in prospect.  Policy uncertainty arguably could 

Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) 22 of 42



increase a little, as market participants might become a little less sure as to the timing 

and magnitude of remaining policy actions. 

(19) If the Committee, by contrast, has become more concerned about the 

potential for an upcreep in inflation in response to developments over the 

intermeeting period, then it may favor the 50-basis-point increase in the federal funds 

rate of Alternative C.  The staff forecast for inflation has been revised up since the 

April Greenbook in response to data pointing to a narrower output gap, higher labor 

costs, a narrower price markup, and—most importantly—substantial further increases 

in crude oil prices.  Indeed, far-futures oil prices, having risen even more steeply than 

spot prices in recent months, currently suggest that significant relief from elevated 

energy prices is unlikely.  The Committee may now see greater inflation risks than 

does the staff or find the inflation outcome in the Greenbook to be unsatisfactory.  If 

so, somewhat tighter money market conditions than assumed by the staff would seem 

to be in order.  Indeed, the policy rules presented in Chart 8, especially those based on 

an inflation target of 1½ percent, recommend substantial further tightening in coming 

months.8  And, as indicated in Charts 5 and 6, the projection-based optimal control 

exercises presented in the previous section suggest that, should the FOMC wish to 

pursue an inflation rate of 1 percent, or to make more rapid progress in achieving a 

1½ percent goal in the face of sluggishly adjusting expectations, the federal funds rate 

would need to be boosted considerably by the middle of next year.  Given the 

resilience that spending and output have shown to date in the face of higher energy 

prices, the Committee might wish to pick up the pace of tightening, especially if it 

believes that the low level of long-term interest rates represents financial 

accommodation that has to be offset.  The Committee may also see an advantage in 

                                           
8 The results of the policy rules for the third quarter of 2005 and beyond have generally been 
revised up since the April Bluebook by ¼ to ½ percentage point, reflecting a narrower 
output gap and higher inflation rate—either estimated, actual, or projected, depending on 
the specification of the particular rule.

tightening policy in a relatively large, ½-percentage-point increment at this meeting if 

it is worried that the measured tightening of policy to date, and especially the FOMC’s 

repeated indications that measured tightening can likely continue, may be fostering a 

degree of complacency among investors about risks—including the risks of investing 

in housing. 

(20) A number of modifications to the Committee’s statement would be required 

to accommodate the selection of Alternative C.  For instance, the FOMC might wish 

to delete the reference to “robust underlying growth in productivity,” given that actual 

productivity growth appears to have dropped sharply in the second quarter.  Although 

the staff believes that trend productivity continues to expand briskly, the Committee 

might be sufficiently uncertain about that assessment to be uncomfortable continuing 

to assert strength in underlying productivity.  As for aggregate demand, the 

Committee could summarize recent developments by saying that “Recent data suggest 

that the underlying pace of spending growth remains solid despite elevated energy 

prices”—striking the prior reference to the slowing of growth in the spring—and 

could go on to mention that “Labor market conditions continue to improve,” 

eliminating both “apparently” and “gradually.”  The FOMC could implicitly 

acknowledge the further run-up in energy prices and reduction in labor market slack 

by noting that “Pressures on inflation have picked up further in recent months, 

although measures of longer-term inflation expectations remain well contained.”  As 

discussed in the April Bluebook, the Committee might also take this opportunity to 

eliminate the forward-looking language from the statement, dropping both the risk 

assessment and the reference to the measured pace of tightening.   

(21) With nary a hint heretofore of an upshift in the pace of policy tightening, 

market participants would be shocked by the combination of a 50-basis-point increase 

in the funds rate at this meeting and the announcement suggested for Alternative C.  

The statement would likely lead investors to conclude that the FOMC expected to 

Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) 26 of 42



continue to tighten policy for some time—and, with the elimination of the measured 

pace language, to anticipate that at least some future policy moves could come in 

additional 50-basis-point increments.  Such a revision to policy expectations would 

likely trigger a sharp sell-off in fixed-income and equity markets and a rise in the 

foreign-exchange value of the dollar, although the increase in long-term yields could 

be limited should investors foresee that policy tightening might well lead to weakness 

in the economy and subdued inflationary pressures.  The pairing of the language of 

Alternative C with a 25-basis-point move would also catch investors unawares, 

probably leading them to ratchet up their expectations of policy firming considerably 

and prompting a sell-off in fixed-income markets.  

Money and Debt Forecasts 

(22) Under the Greenbook forecast, M2 growth is projected to remain quite 

damped at just a 2 percent annual rate from May through December, as the rising 

opportunity costs associated with further increases in the federal funds rate restrain 

money demand.  For 2005 as a whole, M2 growth would also be about 2 percent, a 

good deal slower than the 5¼ percent pace of 2004, and M2 velocity would climb 3¾ 

percent.  M2 is projected to accelerate somewhat in 2006, as the pace of monetary 

tightening slows and deposit rates begin to catch up to market interest rates, but 

velocity would still increase appreciably.  Domestic nonfinancial sector debt growth is 

forecast to decelerate somewhat this year and to slow further in 2006.  Household 

sector borrowing is expected to drop off considerably over the next six quarters, 

reflecting a moderation in increases in house prices and a slight rebound in the saving 

rate.  Federal borrowing is also likely to slow a little as the budget deficit narrows a bit.  

Despite rising capital expenditures, business borrowing is projected to remain 

moderate this year and next, owing in part to slower accumulation of liquid assets.  

Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) 27 of 42



Overall, domestic nonfinancial sector debt is expected to expand 7¾ percent in 2005 

and 6½ percent in 2006, down from about 8½ percent in 2004.

Directive and Balance of  Risks Statement 

(23) Draft language for the directive and draft risk assessments identical to those 

presented in Table 1 are provided below. 

Directive Wording 
The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and financial 

conditions that will foster price stability and promote sustainable growth 

in output.  To further its long-run objectives, the Committee in the 

immediate future seeks conditions in reserve markets consistent with 

MAINTAINING/increasing/REDUCING the federal funds rate 

AT/to an average of around ____________ 3 percent. 

Risk Assessments  

A. The Committee perceives that, with appropriate monetary policy, the 

upside and downside risks to the attainment of both sustainable 

growth and price stability should be kept roughly equal.  With 

underlying inflation expected to be contained, the Committee believes 

that remaining policy accommodation can be removed at a pace that is 

likely to be measured.  Nonetheless, the Committee will respond to 

changes in economic prospects as needed to fulfill its obligation to 

maintain price stability. 

B. The Committee perceives that, with appropriate monetary policy 

action, the upside and downside risks to the attainment of both 

sustainable growth and price stability should be kept roughly equal.  

With underlying inflation expected to be contained, the Committee 

believes that policy accommodation can be removed at a pace that is 

likely to be measured.  Nonetheless, the Committee will respond to

changes in economic prospects as needed to fulfill its obligation to 

maintain price stability. 

C. The Committee will respond to changes in economic prospects as 

needed to fulfill its obligation to foster the attainment of both 

sustainable economic growth and price stability.
