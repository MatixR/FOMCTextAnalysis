Recent developments

(1) The record decline in demand deposits in April led to a

contraction in all of the targeted monetary aggregates last month. M-LA

and M-1B showed particularly sharp rates of decrease, even after allowing

for a probable 5 to 8 percentage point impact from larger-than-seasonal

reductions in private demand balances in connection with the Treasury's

quicker processing of nonwithheld tax payments. The underlying

weakness in money supply over the past several weeks most likely reflects

not only the lagged effect of previous high interest rates, but also

net repayment of bank debt at a time of sizable reduction in economic

activity. The non-transactions component of M-2 also was weaker in April,

largely as a result of marked slowing of the growth of MMMF shares that

followed the Board's March 14 actions and of reductions in overnight RP

and Eurodollar deposits. Total managed liabilities at banks declined as

bank credit contracted. Owing mainly to the April developments, the growth

in the monetary aggregates over the first four months of 1980 has been

considerably below the target pace for the first half set at the last

Committee meeting. In early May, there was a substantial increase in both

demand deposits and money market fund shares.

(2) With the aggregates weakening in April, required reserves

in the four-week intermeeting period began to fall well below levels built

into the total reserve path thought to be consistent with the Committee's

April decision. As the Desk adhered to the nonborrowed reserves path

(defined to include special borrowings, which have averaged about $775 million

during the period), the weaker demand for reserves by banks led to a sharp

reduction in adjustment borrowing; such borrowings averaged only about

$200 million in the last complete statement week, down from $1.9 billion

in the week of the April meeting.1/ Total reserves over the four-week

intermeeting period turned out to be about $850 million below path.2/

(3) As the demand for reserves weakened, the federal funds rate,

which had averaged above 18 percent just before the April meeting, almost

immediately began to fall below the 16 percent level. In a telephone consulta-

tion on April 28, the Committee reconfirmed that the federal funds rate could

fluctuate in the full 13 to 19 percent range adopted at the April meeting. In

early May, the funds rate began to approach the lower limit of the range, and

on May 6 the Committee voted to reduce the lower limit to 10½ percent.

Later in the day, the Board eliminated the 3 percent surcharge on continuous

intermeeting period.



borrowing. In the most recent complete statement week, the federal funds

rate averaged 10-7/8 percent, and, as noted above, adjustment borrowing

fell to minimal levels.

(4) The broad rally in debt markets gained momentum during the

intermeeting period, as market participants reacted to evidence that a

recession had begun, to the sustained money stock weakness, and to the

decline in the federal funds rate. Treasury bill rates and private short-

term rates have fallen substantially further; the 3-month bill rate is

currently around 9 percent and the 3-month CD rate around 10 percent.

Most short-term rates are now about 5 to 8 percentage points below their

recent highs. The prime lending rate at banks, however, has declined only

about 3½ percentage points from its 20 percent peak, as banks attempt to

maintain profit margins.

(5) Capital markets have also rallied further since the last FOMC

meeting, with bond yields declining ½ to 1½ percentage points. In response

to the lower levels of bond yields--down 2½ to 3 percentage points since

their March highs--corporate and municipal bond offerings increased

markedly in April and early May, far eclipsing the first quarter pace. The

Treasury conducted its quarterly financing auction in early May, and in the

ebullient market atmosphere the $7.5 billion offering of two notes and a

long bond was well bid; the new issues did, however, soon drop below their

auction prices. The average rate on new mortgage commitments at S&Ls declined

to 14.68 percent in early May from the record high of 16.35 percent, and

recent press reports indicate much larger cuts in mortgage rates at some

S&Ls as these lenders anticipate larger deposit inflows at the lower short-

term market rates of interest.



(6) Since the last FOMC meeting, the dollar has declined by

about 3 1/2 percent on a weighted-average basis, reflecting the relative

decline in U.S. short-term interest rates. Toward the end of the period

the dollar stabilized as some market participants began looking for some

back-up in U.S. interest rates and as news of the April Producer Price

Index provided some indication of a slowing of U.S. inflation.

rates of change, in percent, for selected monetary and financial flows over

Prospective developments and short-term targets

(8) The recent shortfall in money growth appears to make it

impractical to achieve the Committee's December to June targets for the M's

adopted at the last meeting. To reach these targets, M-1A would have to

expand at a 16¾ percent annual rate over the two months of May and June,

M-1B at 15 percent rate, and M-2 at an 11 percent rate. Attempts to

encourage such a large rebound over a short period would probably entail a

drop in the funds rate in the near term to levels as low as in the 1 to

5 percent range. It would also very probably entail a sharp subsequent

reversal of those rates to keep money growth in later months within the

Committee's longer-run ranges.

(9) The staff expects some rebound of money growth to occur

in any event in May and June--for example, a growth of 7 percent on average

in M-1A at around current interest rate levels and growth of about 7¾

percent in M-2. The recent contraction in transactions balances implies

a need by the public to rebuild their cash holdings to sustain growth

in nominal economic activity in the second quarter at the projected 4½

percent annual rate. Moreover, the lagged impacts of the recent sharp

drop in interest rates should serve to increase the quantity of money

demanded in the months ahead. Our projected expansion of M-1A in May-June

would generate a 1¼ percent annual rate of growth over the 6 months from

December to June, and a one percent rate of growth from the QIV '79 average

level to the QII '80 average. Associated growth in M-2 over the December

to June period would be about 5¾ percent, 1/ somewhat closer to the

Committee's target than in the case of M-1.

1/ And 5 percent from QIV '79 to QII '80.



-7-

(10) Against this background, the Committee, in framing its

approach to operations between now and the next meeting, may wish to

consider policies that recognize the high probability of a shortfall in

growth of the aggregates over the first half of the year and that aim to

get the aggregates back on path over a longer period. Two such alternatives

are presented below, and depicted in the charts on the following pages.

Alternative A is designed to achieve a level of M-1A in December equal

to that implied by the midpoint growth path of the 3½ to 6 percent range

for this aggregate over the QIV '79 to QIV '80 period. Alternative B

is designed to return M-1A to the midpoint path by September. Growth in

M-2 would follow similar patterns. (More detailed specifications, with

implied rates of growth over various time periods, are shown in the

tables on pages 8 and 9.)

-10-

(11) Alternative A calls for growth in M-1A at about a 7½

percent annual rate between April and September, and continuation of that

growth rate over the remainder of the year. For purposes of monetary

targeting between now and the July 9 FOMC meeting, however, the Committee

may wish to target a somewhat slower money growth of 7 percent for the

two months of May and June, given the relatively moderate growth that is

apparently in train for May. As noted in paragraph 9, such a growth rate

is not likely to involve any appreciable change in the funds rate from its

recent trading range of 10½ to 11½ percent. The federal funds rate range

suggested for alternative A is 10 to 14 percent. The suggested lower

limit is a bit lower than that currently in place to provide for some

operational flexibility. The proposed upper limit has been lowered to 14

percent on the thought that the Committee might wish to limit fluctuations

on the upside, given the recent shortfall in money growth and the apparent

weakness in the economy.

(12) Looking beyond the current quarter, some upward pressure

on interest rates might develop. The recent weakness in M-1A has left it

well short of what might have been expected on the basis of historical

relationships among money, income, and interest rates. Thus, although

nominal GNP is projected to rise at only a 5½ percent annual rate in the

second half of the year, our econometric models would suggest that, at

current interest rates, money would tend to grow much more rapidly than

that, and probably somewhat in excess of the 7½ percent alternative A path,

as the public attempts to restore recently depleted cash balances. This

would generate upward rate pressures at a time when income velocity of M-1A



-11-

would be declining, a reversal of the normal situation.1/ If, however,

the recent evident weakness in M-1A should prove largely to represent a

lasting shift in the public's liquidity preferences, then upward rate

pressures might be minimal, or indeed there could be some further downward

drift in rates.

(13) The specifications for alternative A call for a considerable

pick-up in growth of M-2 for the May-June period, to about a 7¾ percent

annual rate. The implied rate of growth for the nontransactions component

of this aggregate period--at around an 8 percent rate--is considerably

higher than has occurred recently. A return to MMMF growth after the decline

associated with the March 14 actions appears already to have begun, and with

market rates far below their recent peaks, growth of small time and savings

deposits, especially the 2½ year variable ceiling certificates, is expected

to pick up.

(14) With the federal funds rate essentially unchanged in the

near term, as contemplated under alternative A, other market interest rates

probably would hold near current levels or edge upward a bit, especially

if and as monetary growth strengthened perceptibly. A limited back-up in

market rates, however, is unlikely to halt the downtrend of bank loan and

mortgage rates, rates that are still high relative to competitive instruments.

Business credit demands in the period ahead may still fall relatively heavily

on the corporate bond markets, as firms continue efforts to restructure

their balance sheets at what appear to be relatively attractive long-term

yields. But even so loan growth at banks could pick up, particularly if

recent loan weakness makes banks a bit more sanguine about their ability

to remain within loan restraint guidelines.

1/ Of course, at this point it seems likely that the opposite, and also
unusual, pattern will prevail in the second quarter--a sharp rise in
velocity and a substantial decline of interest rates.



-12-

(15) To achieve the growth in aggregates for the May-June period

specified under alternative A, total reserves would have to expand at about

a 4 percent annual rate from April to June. Nonborrowed reserves would

expand at about a 27 percent annual rate, assuming a frictional level of

adjustment borrowing from Reserve Banks on the order of $100 to $200 million

(and continued special borrowing of about $750 million).

(16) Alternative B contemplates a more rapid growth in the monetary

aggregates than alternative A over the short run--for example, an 8 per-

cent annual rate of growth in M-1A over the May-June period--in the process

of reaching the Committee's longer-run path by September (rather than by

December as in alternative A). Such an approach involves a greater likeli-

hood that interest rates, particularly short-term rates, will decline further

over the weeks ahead. The proposed federal funds rate range for this

alternative is 9 to 14 percent.

(17) A decline of the funds rate into the 9 to 10 percent range

would probably lead to a 3-month bill rate in the 7½ to 8 percent range.

Bond yields could drop further, although such a decline would be limited

if growth in the monetary aggregates began to pick up substantially. Inflows

to thrift institutions would probably strengthen as they benefit from full

ceiling rate differentials on both the 6-month money market certificate and

the higher-yielding 2 year certificate. This would tend to make thrifts

more eager to lend and encourage further declines in rates on new mortgage

loans. In foreign exchange markets, the dollar would probably weaken, as

short rates fell further relative to foreign interest rates.



-13-

(18) To attain the aggregates of alternative B over the May-

June period, total reserves would have to increase at a 5 percent annual

rate. With borrowing at frictional levels, as in alternative A, nonborrowed

reserves would increase at a 28 percent rate. For both alternatives A

and B, it should be pointed out that if growth of money stock deposits

and related required reserves over the weeks immediately ahead runs below

target, attainment of the nonborrowed reserve path in the short-run would

involve adding to banks' excess reserves (since there are practically no

borrowings to be paid off). This would generate downward pressure on

interest rates, of course, and possibly very substantial downward pressures,

particularly on the funds rate, if banks are not very willing to hold excess

reserves at relatively high interest rate levels. Thus, the lower limits

of the funds rate ranges could rather promptly become the operative guides

for open market operations.



-14-

Directive language

(19) Given below are suggested operational paragraphs for the

directive consistent with either of the short-run policy alternatives dis-

cussed earlier. The proposed directive contains only qualitative language

for the objectives for monetary aggregates over the months ahead. The

specific numerical guidelines decided on by the Committee for the aggregates

seem likely to involve relatively rapid growth to compensate to some degree

for the recent large shortfalls. It was felt that such numerical specifica-

tions might be omitted from the directive and included only in the policy

record, where they would be fully explained and less subject to misunder-

standing.

In the short run, the Committee seeks expansion of reserve

aggregates consistent with growth [DEL:over the first half of 1988 at an

annual rate of 4½ percent for M-1A and 5 percent for M-1B, or some

what less] OF M-1A, M-1B, AND M-2 OVER A PERIOD OF MONTHS AT RATES THAT

WOULD PROMOTE ACHIEVEMENT OF THE COMMITTEE'S LONGER-RUN OBJECTIVES FOR

MONETARY GROWTH, provided that in the period before the next regular

meeting the weekly average federal funds rate remains within a

range of [DEL: 13 to 19] ____ TO ____ percent. [DEL: The-Committee-believes

that, to be consistent with this short run policy, M-2 should grow

at an annual rate of about 6¼ percent over the first half and that

bank credit-should grow in the months ahead at a pace compatible

with-growth over the year as a whole withing the range agreed upon.]

If it appears during the period before the next meeting that

the constraint on the federal funds rate is inconsistent with the

objective for the expansion of reserves, the Manager for Domestic

Operations is promptly to notify the Chairman who will then decide

whether the situation calls for supplementary instructions from

the Committee.

NOTE: Weekly data for columns 1, 2, 3, and 5 through 10 are statement week averages of daily data. Weekly data in column 4 are average rates set in the auctions
of 6-month bills that will be issued on the Thursday following the end of the statement week. For column 11, the weekly date is the mid-point of the calendar week
over which data are averaged. Columns 12 and 13 are 1-day quotes for Friday and Thursday, respectively, following the end of the statement week. Column 14 is an
average of contract interest rates on commitments for conventional first mortgages with 80percent loan-to-value ratios made by a sample of insured savings and loan
associations on the Friday following the end of the statement week. Column 15 gives FNMA auction data for Monday preceding the end of the statement week. Column
16 is a 1-day quote for Monday preceding the end of the statement week. The FNMA auction yield is the average yield in a bi-weekly auction for short-term forward
commitments for government underwritten mortgages. GNMA yields are average net yields to investors on mortgage-backed securities for immediate delivery, assuming
prepayment in 12 years on pools of 30-year FRA/VA mortgages carrying the coupon rate 50 basis points below the current FHA/VA ceiling.

NOTE: Government security dealer trading positions are on a commitment basis. Trading positions, which exclude Treasury secu-
rities financed by repurchase agreements maturing in 16 days or more, are indicators of dealer holdings available for sale over
the near-term. Underwriting syndicate positions consist of issues still in syndicate, excluding trading positions. Weekly data
are daily averages for statement weeks, except for corporate and municipal issues in syndicate which are Friday figures.

* Strictly confidential.
** Monthly averages for excess reserves and borrowings are weighted averages of statement week figures.
