The attached document represents the most complete and accurate version 
available based on original copies culled from the files of the FOMC Secretariat at the 
Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System.  This electronic document was 
created through a comprehensive digitization process which included identifying the best-
preserved paper copies, scanning those copies,1 and then making the scanned versions 
text-searchable.2  Though a stringent quality assurance process was employed, some 
imperfections may remain. 
 

Please note that this document may contain occasional gaps in the text.  These

scanned images were deskewed (to remove the effects of printer- and scanner-introduced tilting) and lightly 
cleaned (to remove dark spots caused by staple holes, hole punches, and other blemishes caused after initial 
printing).

MONETARY POLICY ALTERNATIVES

Recent developments

(1) Since the February FOMC meeting, reserve paths have been

constructed assuming adjustment plus seasonal borrowing of $200 million, in

accordance with the Committee's decision to maintain the slightly reduced

degree of reserve pressure sought in the days preceding the meeting. This

level of borrowing was expected to be associated with federal funds trading

around 6-1/2 percent, once the market had perceived the degree of Federal

Reserve easing. Over the three complete maintenance periods since the FOMC

meeting, adjustment plus seasonal borrowing has averaged $238 million, and

the federal funds rate has averaged 6.59 percent. The difficulties of some

Texas banks and the associated surge of extended credit have had little

apparent impact on reserve markets. The Desk readily offset the increased

supply of reserves, and bank reserve management does not seem to have been

affected. Excess reserves have fallen on balance over the intermeeting

period in typical seasonal fashion, and willingness to tap discount credit

does not appear to have diminished further.

(2) Most other interest rates have risen somewhat over the

intermeeting period, especially in bond markets where yields increased

around 3/8 of a percentage point. Data and reports on the economy

suggested more strength than had been anticipated, prompting a shift in

market sentiment about prospects for future inflation and Federal Reserve

policy. Despite the Texas bank situation, spreads between private and

Treasury rates have continued to fluctuate in a narrow range, well below

the relatively high levels reached after the stock market collapse, though

prices of bank stocks fell following reports of those problems. Broad

stock price indexes posted sizable gains through most of the period,

reaching their highest levels since last October. They have retreated in

the last week, perhaps prompted by renewed concerns about the prospects for

interest rates and the dollar; however, substantial stock price declines in

the last two days were accompanied by decreases in Treasury bill and bond

rates, in a pattern similar to last October.

(3) The dollar's weighted average exchange value against 10

major currencies declined by about 1-1/2 percent since the last Committee

meeting. Although January trade figures were generally better than

expected, incoming economic data were interpreted as suggesting stronger

domestic demand, calling into question the prospects for reducing external

imbalances. Sterling was particularly strong, pushing through Britain's

de facto target ceiling rate of 3.00 marks per pound, later prompting a

1/2 percentage point reduction in the Bank of England's official lending

rates. Elsewhere, interest rate movements were fairly narrow. As the

dollar weakened at the end of the intermeeting period the Desk

bought dollars against yen, with Desk purchases amounting to

$148 million.

(4) The broader monetary aggregates expanded rapidly again in

February and March. Over the two months combined, M2 and M3 increased at 9

and 8-3/4 percent rates, respectively, leaving M2 a little above and M3 at



the upper bound of the Committee's 6 to 7 percent November-to-March growth

ranges. On a quarterly average basis, both broad aggregates increased at a

6-3/4 percent rate in the first quarter, implying a small decline in

velocity (based on the Greenbook GNP projection)--the first since the last

quarter of 1986. The strength in M2 and drop in its velocity reflected the

decrease in the opportunity costs of holding deposits in this aggregate

that has resulted from the fall in market interest rates on balance since

October. Within M2, liquid retail components as a whole increased in the

first quarter following several months of declines, as rates on these

instruments fell more slowly than those on time deposits or market instru-

ments; even so, flows into small time deposits remained quite rapid, owing

to their still large rate advantage. Flows into money funds, both at the

M2 and M3 levels, continued strong in February, but in March shares of

institution-only money funds leveled out as their rates fell into closer

alignment with market rates. Issuance of large time deposits was brisk in

February. Bank credit growth picked up last month, while reliance on

funding from foreign offices was reduced; the supply of funds in Euro-

dollar markets may have contracted as foreign official institutions shifted

dollar investments to U.S. government securities. In March, however,

issuance of large time deposits decelerated sharply, perhaps associated

with the weakness in credit at large banks that is suggested by data for

the first part of the month.

(5) M1 slowed sharply in February, but growth is estimated to

have rebounded in March. On balance over the two months, NOW accounts have

increased at a relatively robust pace, but demand deposits have declined



further. Owing to the weakness in demand deposits, the velocity of M1

continued to increase in the first quarter, though at a slower pace than

over the second half of 1987. With transactions accounts relatively

sluggish on balance and excess reserves declining, total reserves advanced

at only a 3 percent rate over February and March. Relatively flat reserve

growth along with slowing expansion in currency led to a deceleration in

the monetary base over February and March, holding the rise from November

to March to 7-1/2 percent.

(6) Expansion of nonfinancial debt picked up to a double-digit

pace in February and early indications are that growth has continued strong

in March. Overall business borrowing has been sizable, in part reflecting

heightened merger and acquisition activity, and has been focused increas-

ingly on longer-term markets in response to the decline in bond rates since

last fall. Tax-exempt bond issuance also increased in the last two months,

spurred by a resumption of refinancings. Bank data suggest that consumer

installment borrowing remained substantial in February and early March.

Treasury borrowing has strengthened in February and March, but sales to

foreign official institutions and state and local governments have enabled

it to hold down offerings to the general public.



Policy alternatives

(7) Three short-run policy options are presented below. Alter-

native B would retain the $200 million assumption for adjustment plus

seasonal borrowing now used in constructing paths for nonborrowed reserves,

with federal funds rates remaining generally in the 6-1/2 percent area,

once any quarter-end pressures were past. Under alternative C, the

borrowing objective would be raised to $400 million and the funds rate

would move up to the vicinity of 7 percent. Under alternative A, federal

funds would be expected to trade around the current 6 percent discount

rate; this could be accomplished by reducing the discount rate by 1/2 point

while keeping the $200 million borrowing objective, or by decreasing this

objective. The staff estimates that borrowing on the order of $100 million

might represent the level associated with this alternative. However, this

estimate is subject to considerable uncertainty as we have very limited

experience with operating at borrowing around frictional levels. More-

over, at very low levels of borrowing, the funds rate might become quite

sensitive to relatively minor changes in borrowing behavior. Such changes

could include the normal pattern of seasonal credit as well as other

influences.

(8) The relationship between the funds rate-discount rate

spread and borrowing specified in alternatives B and C (and A with a

discount rate cut) corresponds to average experience over the period since

December. Although depository institutions may be somewhat less reluctant

1. The only period in recent years in which the federal funds rate
fluctuated around or below the discount rate for some time was from late
1982 to the spring of 1983. The borrowing objective averaged $225 mil-
lion through this period.



to be seen at the window than they were immediately after the stock market

crash, some concern seems to remain, and achieving a given spread appears

to require targeting about $100 million less borrowing than suggested by

the relationship from early 1986 through mid-October 1987. The specifi-

cations of the policy alternatives also assume that the Texas bank situa-

tion and indications of other difficulties of depository institutions will

not alter overall borrowing behavior in the period ahead. And they

abstract from any effects at low total borrowing levels of rising seasonal

borrowing expected over coming months. The Committee may wish the Manager

to remain alert to any need for revisions to intended borrowing should the

relationship to money market conditions be affected by these potential

influences on discount window use.

(9) The anticipated growth in the monetary aggregates from

March to June implied by these policy alternatives is shown in the table

below, together with the associated federal funds rate ranges. (More

(10) With recent conditions in the reserves market maintained

under alternative B, interest rates would tend to remain around current

levels, at least for a time. But given the staff economic forecast, which

implies a flow of data that would not allay market concerns about

potentially inflationary pressures on resources, the market might well

remain edgy. In addition, if signs of further expansion in domestic demand

were combined with trade data suggesting sluggish adjustment of U.S.

external imbalances, the dollar could come under further downward pressure

which, in this context, would be likely to contribute to some increases in

U.S. interest rates.

(11) Given the financial conditions associated with alternative

B, M2 and M3 are expected to grow at 7 and 6-1/2 percent annual rates,

respectively, from March to June, leaving them well into the upper halves

of their 4 to 8 percent annual ranges. Although the broader aggregates

would be expected to slow somewhat from the pace of the last three months,

2
growth would still exceed the projected expansion of nominal income. An

important impetus to growth of M2 will continue to be the reduced oppor-

tunity cost of holding retail interest-bearing accounts. To be sure,

opportunity costs are likely to widen a little once again in coming months

as returns on retail balances edge off further in lagged response to the

2. On a quarterly average basis the growth rates of M2 and M3 would
increase somewhat in the second quarter; this pattern primarily reflects
the damping effects on the first quarter growth of the weakness in money
growth late in 1987. The velocities of M2 and M3 would be expected to
decline in the second quarter by 2-1/2 and 1-1/2 percentage points,
respectively, somewhat more than seems in train in the first quarter.



-10-

previous decline in market rates. Nevertheless, the expected second-quar-

ter spread between market rates and the average return on retail balances

in M2 still would represent a very substantial reduction from its peak in

the third quarter of last year. Inflows to these accounts might be sup-

ported by other influences as well: the personal saving rate is projected

to remain high relative to last year, and additions to IRAs should be

considerably smaller than in recent years in response to tightened tax-

reform restrictions.

(12) M3 growth in the spring and early summer will be damped by

weaker inflows to money market mutual funds as their rate advantage over

short-term market instruments narrows further. Depositories are expected

to maintain the recent pace of issuance of managed liabilities to fund

credit expansion in the face of a moderation in core deposit growth. Bank

credit growth is projected to be supported by some strengthening in

business loans, reflecting a projected widening financing gap and continued

rapid share retirements. However, consumer lending at banks is likely to

weaken a little, as the rise in consumer spending moderates. Mortgage

borrowing should remain at around the first-quarter pace. For thrifts,

asset growth at around the moderate pace of recent months would continue to

be bolstered by demand for ARMS, which are retained in their own portfolios

to a greater extent than are fixed-rate mortgages. Overall, however, the

debt of domestic nonfinancial sectors is projected to slow to around an

8 percent rate over the second quarter, leaving this aggregate just above

the midpoint of its 7 to 11 percent annual range. The deceleration results

entirely from a marked slowdown in federal borrowing, as the Treasury trims



-11-

its auctions to moderate the surge in its cash balance associated with

higher-than-usual spring tax payments.

(13) M1 growth in April might be boosted by a buildup in trans-

action balances associated with tax payments, which are projected to exceed

the typical volume reflected in the transactions account seasonals, though

3
not matching last year's exceptional surge. Any such effect will have

abated by early May. On a March-to-June basis, M1 is expected to increase

at a rate of about 4-1/2 percent under alternative B. Demand deposits are

anticipated to strengthen only a little on balance over the next three

months, after the somewhat inexplicable weakness through the first quarter.

NOW account growth, while moderating from recent rapid rates, would remain

above the pace of the second half of 1987. M1 velocity would continue to

increase, but at a slower rate than in the first quarter.

(14) The more restrictive monetary posture of alternative C, at

least at this time, would come as some surprise to financial markets. With

the funds rate averaging around 7 percent, the 3-month Treasury bill rate

could move into an area around 6-1/4 percent. Rate spreads between bank

and thrift paper and Treasury bills could widen, if concerns about their

asset quality and earnings prospects intensify, which might be more likely,

given the already troubled status of many depository institutions. A good

portion of the increases in short-term rates might show through in longer-

term rates. But, an upward movement in U.S. interest rates, especially if

viewed as reflecting Federal Reserve resolve to avoid inflation and faster

external adjustment by containing domestic demand, would help to support

3. A special adjustment was made to prevent last year's tax payments
from distorting demand deposit seasonal factors.



-12-

the dollar in the near term, and over time the net increase in bond yields

could be limited.

(15) The broader monetary aggregates under alternative C would

post a more marked slowing over the course of the quarter than under the

other alternatives, as the effects of the rebound in market interest rates

increasingly took hold. Both aggregates would end the quarter a bit

closer to, though still above, the midpoints of their longer-run ranges.

The attractiveness of transactions and other liquid accounts would be

lessened further, as their rates lag in typical fashion behind market

yields. M1 probably would be growing very sluggishly by June, leaving its

growth from the fourth quarter to June a bit below its current 4 percent

rate through March.

(16) Under alternative A, the easing of reserve market condi-

tions would ripple through other financial markets. The 3-month Treasury

bill would drop to below 5-1/2 percent, but declines in longer-term rates

might be small. Absent a weaker economic picture than contemplated under

the staff forecast, market participants may not expect such a policy easing

to be sustained for long. The dollar could come under substantial downward

pressures, particularly if concerns about inflation and external adjustment

increased.

(17) With the lower short-term market interest rates of alter-

native A, M2 growth would not be expected to moderate much over the next

three months. Expansion of this aggregate, at an 8 percent rate from March

to June, would leave M2 only a little below the upper end of its annual

target cone. Opportunity costs of holding retail deposits within M2 would



-13-

continue the declines begun last fall. Inflows into small time deposits

might abate as their rates completed their downward adjustment, but growth

of NOWs, savings deposits and MMDAs could pick up noticeably. With some

boost to required compensating demand balances of businesses also coming

from lower market rates, M1 might well grow at a 6 percent annual rate from

March to June. M3 would be strengthened somewhat less than the other

aggregates over the three months, as lower market interest rates shift some

credit demands to nonbank sources in light of lagging bank lending rates,

but this aggregate would still record a 7 percent increase from March to

June.

Directive language

(18) Draft language for the operational paragraph, including

the usual options and updating, is shown below. The second sentence

calling for continued flexibility in operations is shown in brackets. The

decision on whether to retain this or a similar sentence might depend on

an assessment of the state of financial markets as well as the Committee's

discussion of operating procedures.

OPERATIONAL PARAGRAPH

In the implementation of policy for the immediate

future, the Committee seeks to DECREASE SOMEWHAT (Alt. A)/

maintain (Alt. B)/INCREASE SOMEWHAT (Alt. C) the {DEL: slightly

reduced] degree of pressure on reserve positions {DEL: sought-in

recent-days]. [The Committee agrees that the current more

normal approach to open market operations remains

appropriate; still sensitive conditions in financial

markets and uncertainties in the economic outlook may

continue to call for some flexibility in operations.]

Taking account of conditions in financial markets, somewhat

(SLIGHTLY) lesser reserve restraint WOULD (MIGHT), or

somewhat (SLIGHTLY) greater reserve restraint would (MIGHT)

be acceptable depending on the strength of the business

expansion, indications of inflationary pressures, develop-

ments in foreign exchange markets, as well as the behavior



-15-

of the monetary aggregates. The contemplated reserve

conditions are expected to be consistent with growth in

[DEL: both] M2 and M3 over the period from [DEL: November-through] March

THROUGH JUNE at annual rates of about ____ PERCENT AND ____ [DEL: 6

to-7] percent, RESPECTIVELY. The Chairman may call for

Committee consultation if it appears to the Manager for

Domestic Operations that reserve conditions during the

period before the next meeting are likely to be associated

with a federal funds rate persistently outside a range of

____ TO ____ [DEL: 4-to-8 percent].
