MONEY MARKET AND RESERVE RELATIONSHIPS

Recent developments

A marginal reduction in market pressures has developed since

the last meeting of the Committee in the wake of fiscal legislation and

of open market operations. In the market for day-to-day money, the

effective Federal funds rate has centered around 6 per cent, as com-

pared with 6-1/8 per cent during the 3 weeks prior to the previous

Committee meeting, and dealer loan rates have also eased fractionally.

The rate charged on System RP's to dealers was reduced from the 5-3/4

per cent rate prevailing since late April to 5-5/8 per cent.

The reserve position of banks also has been under less pressure

in recent weeks. After averaging about $735 million in the last two

statement weeks of June, member bank borrowings declined to an average

of around $450 million in the first two statement weeks ending in July,

as major banks accelerated their borrowing from the Euro-dollar

market and as the basic reserve deficit of principal money market banks

improved seasonally. Net borrowed reserves fluctuated between $100

and $300 million in the past two weeks; country banks first reduced

and then increased excess reserves, though the average level was lower

than usual for this time of year.

Yields on nearly all maturities in the U.S. Government

securities market are about 20 basis points below levels prevailing

on June 18, with the 3-month bill most recently around 5-3/8 per cent.

However, other short-term rates have declined less and some not at all;

for example, yields on commercial and finance company paper remain un-

changed from their mid-June levels. These yields are typically less

sensitive to expectations than yields on Treasury securities, and tend

to move more in relation to current flows of funds. Yields in private

long-term capital markets showed little change for most of the period

since the last Committee meeting, but corporate bond yields declined

in the past two days, triggered by the good market reception accorded

the key Jersey Standard bond issue. Municipal yields, too, declined

in recent days.

In the days immediately following the last Committee meeting,

bill rates were pushed sharply lower, as a combined result of several

factors; demands for bills by holders of maturing June tax bills which

had not been turned in for taxes, unusually large System bill purchases

to offset the reserve effects of international developments, and initial

reactions to the passage of the fiscal package. While all bill rates

declined, the 3-month bill fell most sharply, dropping 40 basis points

to 4.20 per cent bid on June 21, below the lower end of the range

anticipated in the last Blue Book. The 3-month bill rate dropped low

relative to other short-term rates largely because of a technical short-

age of such bills for trading; the rate rebounded to around the mid 5.30's

within two days. Other bill yields, which had not declined quite as

much, did not rebound like the 3-month bill.

Bank credit expanded at a 6 per cent annual rate in June, the

upper end of the range anticipated in the last Blue Book. As bill rates

declined, banks were able to rebuild CD's substantially after the mid-

June tax date. Over the month of June, outstanding CD's declined only



CONFIDENTIAL (FR)

$250 million, which is about half the seasonal decline. Banks reduced

offering rates on maturities of 6-months or longer to around 6-1/8 per

cent. Rates on 3-month maturities remain at their ceilings.

The money supply in June rose at about a 7 per cent annual

rate, a shade below the range of expectations. U.S. Government deposits

showed a very small increase during the month.

increase) is shown for longer time periods in the table below.

CONFIDENTIAL (FR)

Prospective developments

Bank credit and deposit growth in July and August together

will be strongly influenced by the need to supply reserves to the

banking system to help finance $7.5 billion of Treasury cash needs

(including the $4 billion of tax bills already marketed in July), as

well as private demands associated with the tax legislation. If

currently prevailing money market conditions--as specified below--are

to be maintained under these circumstances, total reserves would have

to grow at a 7 - 9 per cent annual rate, on average, during the two months.

But nonborrowed reserves are likely to grow more rapidly, reflecting a

tendency for member banks to borrow less from the Federal Reserve with

market interest rates having moved lower relative to the discount rate.

Most of the increase in the reserve aggregates will be reflected in the

August figure, but much of the expansion will be underway in the latter

half of July and carry through to August.

Outstanding bank credit in July, as measured on a daily average

basis by the proxy, is expected to be about 1 - 4 per cent (annual rate)

above the average amount outstanding in June. The trend of growth in

the course of the month is expected to be rising, as banks position or

finance the March and April tax bills sold by the Treasury with 100 per

cent tax and loan credit (for payment July 11) and as banks help finance

the $1 billion or so of additional tax payments to be made by corporations

in mid-July in connection with the new tax law. In August, the bank

credit proxy may rise in a 10 - 12 per cent annual rate range, on average--

assuming the Treasury raises another $3 billion of new cash during the

July 12, 1968



CONFIDENTIAL (FR) -5- July 12, 1968

month, a substantial part of which possibly will be at the time of the

mid-August refunding. For the two months taken together, the bank credit

proxy may be expected to rise in a 6 - 8 per cent, annual rate, range.

It is too early to have a very precise idea of Treasury

financing plans for August, however. Apart from the need to raise new

cash, the Treasury will have to roll over $3.7 billion of publicly held

securities maturing in mid-August. It is possible that all of the

financing need (apart from continued cash additions to the weekly bill

auctions) could be satisfied through a combination of relatively short-

and longer-term notes; however, depending on the market outlook and

other factors, some of the cash could be raised through a PC, and/or

through additional tax bills. The specific nature and timing of the

financing(s) will, of course, affect the credit proxy measure.

Euro-dollar borrowings may add about 2 percentage points to

the above bank credit figures in July, but it is not expected that such

borrowings will be sufficient to add significantly to bank credit growth

in August. It is even possible that liabilities of U.S. banks in the

Euro-dollar market will decline by August, if confidence is restored in

the franc and sterling and if domestic funds remain somewhat more readily

obtainable.

This bank reserve and credit outlook for the weeks immediately

ahead assumes that the Federal funds rate remains around 6 per cent, but

is not infrequently below that rate; that net borrowed reserves are

generally in a $200 - $350 million range; that member bank borrowings

are in a $500 - $600 million area (as borrowings remain below their

May-June average, but rise from recent seasonally low levels); and



CONFIDENTIAL (FR) -6- July 12, 1968

that the 3-month bill rate is most frequently in a 5.30 -- 5.55 per

cent range. Bill rates would not be expected to decline much

from recent levels; and they might rise, because the pressure on bank

reserve positions implicit in the specifications above would probably

be sufficient to keep dealer financing costs fairly high, with 6-1/8 --

6-3/8 per cent the most frequent charge for new money in New York.

Dealer bill positions in the longer bill area have built up

substantially in recent days as dealers have bought from banks a fairly

sizable proportion of the new tax bills. Dealers have been willing

buyers in the expectation that monetary conditions would probably ease

in the weeks ahead. But continued relatively high financing costs are

likely to erode dealer willingness to position bills unless private

demand for bills is unusually strong. Mainly for seasonal reasons, the

System is not expected to be a very large net buyer in the market

between now and the next meeting of the Committee, in contrast to its

large net purchases of securities over the past few weeks. The System

is likely to have to absorb a moderate amount of reserves during the

next two weeks, and will return to the buying side of the market in late

July and early August; but foreign operations may be a factor continuing

to complicate domestic open market operations.

With bill rates remaining around or somewhat above recent

levels, banks would be able to add to outstanding negotiable CD's.

Under these conditions, we expect such CD's outstanding to rise by

around $1 billion in July, which would be about twice the seasonal in-

crease. Such a pace of expansion may not be sustained in August, however,



CONFIDENTIAL (FR) -7- July 12, 1968

partly because banks might bid less aggressively if loan demands diminish

after the July tax borrowing has passed.

Consumer-type time and savings deposits are expected to recover

in July and August from their sharply reduced growth rate of the second

quarter. But their rate of expansion is expected to remain moderate,

mainly because the combination of prevailing money market conditions

and further Treasury financings are likely to inhibit declines in both

short- and long-term market interest rates. The tax increase may also

absorb some funds that would otherwise flow into savings accounts.

Over-all, total time and savings deposits of banks may rise in a 7 - 10

per cent annual rate range in July, and about the same in August.

The money supply in July is expected to expand in a 8 - 10

per cent, annual rate, range. This high average rate of expansion for

the month in large part reflects the accelerated growth in private demand

deposits during the three statement weeks ending July 3, a period when

U.S. Government deposits were declining sharply. Money supply growth

is expected to slow sharply in the latter part of July and in August,

when Treasury cash balances are expected to rise substantially on balance.

For August the money supply may show little change on average.

While deposit growth is likely to pick up in the weeks ahead,

such growth may not be sufficient to enable banks to rebuild very much

liquidity or to adopt easier lending terms. Banks may be expected to

become somewhat more active in longer-term markets. However, in view

of the Treasury financing in prospect, significant declines in long-term



CONFIDENTIAL (FR)

rates might not develop until current large corporate bond market

demands moderate, or if signs of weaker business activity become more

evident to the market.

Policy alternative. Open market operations oriented toward

attaining somewhat easier money market conditions would probably en-

courage some further reductions in bill rates, a downward movement in

the more sluggish short-term rates, and declines in long-term interest

rates. Such easier conditions could entail a Federal Funds rate around

5-3/4 per cent, a net reserve position of banks in a 0 to minus $200

million range, and member bank borrowings in a $350 - $500 million range.

The 3-month bill rate would likely be in a 5-1/8 -- 5-3/8

per cent range under these circumstances. And expectations of a discount

rate decrease might be generated in the market as the spread of the

discount rate above the bill rate widens. Such expectations might dis-

courage some borrowing over the short-run in capital markets, and encourage

some investors to move funds into the market, thus exerting downward

pressures on longer-term interest rates.

With a lower over-all interest rate level, it is possible that

bank credit expansion will be somewhat more rapid than under currently

prevailing money market conditions. Interest rates are unlikely to fall

enough to stimulate business loan demand, which would be held down by the

expected cut-back in inventory building. But banks may become more eager

to rebuild their portfolio positions in order to capture the available

relatively high yields. Over-all, under the easing policy alternative

specified, one might expect a bank credit growth in a 7-9 per cent

annual rate range for July and August together.

1968, and $190 million



Explanation of Projections in Table B-1

1. Changes in Federal Reserve credit indicate reserves needed to offset projected changes in
required reserves and factors affecting the supply of reserves.

2. Projected changes in currency outside banks reflect seasonal movements plus an allowance for
growth of about $50 million per week.

3. Projected effects of Treasury operations, included in "technical factors," reflect scheduled
and assumed calls in current two weeks and thereafter, maintenance of Treasury balances with
Federal Reserve at $1.0 billion.

4. Projected changes in required reserves assume the existing net reserve position of banks and
the structure of interest rates in the market, as well as the current economic outlook. On
the basis of these assumptions, projections reflect expected movements in bank credit and
money in the period ahead, including the effects of such elements as the public's loan demand,
repayments of previous loans, bank's investment preferences and willingness to supply loans,
bank's desires and abilities to obtain time and savings deposits, and the Government's financing
needs. The projections thus encompass normal seasonal developments, temporary bursts of
loan demand and expected associated repayments not currently reflected by the seasonals, and
whatever cyclical and growth demands for money and credit are expected in the projection period.
Assumed Treasury financing operations include: $0.1 billion increase in the weekly Treasury bill
auction through August 14; $4.0 billion, July 11.
