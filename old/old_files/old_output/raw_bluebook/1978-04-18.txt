The attached document represents the most complete and accurate version 
available based on original copies culled from the files of the FOMC Secretariat at the 
Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System.  This electronic document was 
created through a comprehensive digitization process which included identifying the best-
preserved paper copies, scanning those copies,1 and then making the scanned versions 
text-searchable.2  Though a stringent quality assurance process was employed, some 
imperfections may remain. 
 

Please note that this document may contain occasional gaps in the text.  These

scanned images were deskewed (to remove the effects of printer- and scanner-introduced tilting) and lightly 
cleaned (to remove dark spots caused by staple holes, hole punches, and other blemishes caused after initial 
printing). 
2 A two-step process was used.  An advanced optimal character recognition computer program (OCR) first 
created electronic text from the document image.  Where the OCR results were inconclusive, staff checked

Recent developments

(1) Growth in M-1 was at a moderate annual rate of 3.5 per

cent in March, but it is projected to accelerate to a rate of almost 10

per cent in April. Over the March-April period, growth of M-1 is thus pro-

jected at about a 6-3/4 per cent rate, somewhat above the mid-point of

the range specified by the FOMC at its March meeting. The interest-

bearing component of M-2 has been increasing at a rate near the reduced

pace of recent months, and M-2 appears to be expanding over March and

April at a 7 per cent annual rate, near the mid-point of the Committee's

range. Deposit growth at nonbank thrift institutions remained weak in

March.

(2) The System Account Manager continued to aim for a

Federal funds rate of around 6-3/4 per cent throughout the intermeet-

ing period. The actual rate tended to exceed this target in late March

when Desk operations were constrained by a shortage of readily avail-

able collateral. The shortage was alleviated in early April by the

Treasury's issuance of $6 billion of cash management bills, and most

recently funds have generally traded at around 6-3/4 per cent.

(3) Even though the Federal funds rate returned to around

6-3/4 per cent, market interest rates generally were under upward pres-

sure through most of the intermeeting period, rising 15 to 20 basis

points. These pressures appeared to reflect the recent deterioration

of the U.S. balance of payments position, the accelerated increase in

the wholesale and retail price indexes, and concern about a possible

surge in growth of the monetary aggregates in April. In private short-

term markets, rate increases also have been associated with continued

sizable offerings of large CD's and a pickup in commercial paper

issuance by nonfinancial corporations. In longer-term markets, the

volume of bonds offered by corporations and State and local governments

also expanded markedly in March. Most recently, however, following

publication of increases in the monetary aggregates for early April

that were much lower than many had anticipated, Treasury bill rates

have retraced their earlier increases, and the 3-month bill rate is

now below the level at the time of the last FOMC meeting.

(4) Commercial bank credit expanded in March at a 9 per

cent annual rate--a bit slower than the rate earlier in the first



-3-

quarter--as a decline in investment holdings partly offset a further

sharp rise in loan portfolios. The growth in loans was widespread

among major categories, with business loan expansion particularly

strong. A significant part of the growth in banks' earnings assets

was financed by issuance of large-denomination time deposits.

(5) With deposit flows at nonbank thrift institutions remain-

ing relatively weak, conditions in the mortgage market have continued

to tighten in recent weeks. Yields on new conventional mortgages have

edged up further, and field reports indicate that the thrifts have become

less accommodative in extending new commitments and in making "spot"

loans. A significant proportion of S&L's surveyed at the end of March

reported that the present supply of mortgage funds was below normal

for this period of the year.

(6) The table on the next page shows percentage annual rates

of change in related monetary and financial flows over various time

periods.

Prospective Developments

(7) The table below presents for Committee consideration

alternative longer-run growth ranges for the monetary aggregates

over the QI '78 to QI '79 period, along with ranges currently in place.

Alternative B would continue the ranges for M-1 and M-2 adopted

by the Committee in February for the QIV '77 to QIV '78 period. The

longer-run range for M-3 has been reduced, however, largely because

higher market rates of interest are now projected for late 1978 and

early 1979 and because recent deposit inflows to thrift institutions

have continued relatively weak. Alternatives

respectively, somewhat more and somewhat less

(8) The demand for M-1 is expected to be quite strong over

the one-year period from QI '78 to QI '7 9 , when nominal GNP is projected

to rise at a rate of almost 12 per cent, about one percentage

point more than had been projected a month ago. A little more than half

of the increase in the rate of expansion in nominal GNP for the QI '78-

QI '79 period reflects an upward revision in the projected rate of

1/ Each of the alternatives assumes that ceiling rates on small
denomination time deposits at banks and thrift institutions will
be raised 50 basis points this summer. Without such an increase
in deposit rate ceilings, the level of market rates thought
necessary to restrain M-1 growth to the midpoint of the indicated
ranges would lead to expansion in M-2 and M-3 in the lower half of
their respective ranges.



inflation over the year. The balance reflects the weather- and coal-

strike induced reduction in the rate of growth of real GNP in QI '78--

projected to be largely made up in QII '78--which lowers the base

quarter for the new four-quarter policy period. To hold M-1 growth

over the coming year to a rate around the mid-point of the 4 to 6

per cent range of alternative B would, under the circumstances, require

a larger increase in interest rates than the staff had earlier

expected. As indicated in Appendix I, we would anticipate a Federal

funds rate averaging around 8¾ per cent by early next year if the mid-

points of the longer-run ranges of alternative B are to be attained.

Interest rates would be slightly lower and slightly higher under

alternatives A and C, respectively.

(9) All of the alternatives imply relatively rapid increases

in the income velocity of M-1, and also a rise in the income velocity

of M-2, as shown in Appendix II. Assuming M-1 growth at the 5¼ per

cent mid-point of the alternative B range, V-1 would be projected

to rise by about 7 per cent over the coming four quarters, more than

twice the average rate of the past two years. The projected rise in

interest rates would tend to increase the public's willingness to

economize on cash balances and thus would contribute to an accelera-

tion in velocity growth. However, the staff has assumed that there

also will be a further downward shift in the demand for money over the

period ahead, partly because higher market interest rates may once

again lead to new financial innovations that substitute for demand

deposits, and to more intensive marketing of earlier innovations

and cash management services, as financial institutions



attempt to retain funds. Whether such a further downward shift

in demand for M-1 will actually occur is quite uncertain, however.

If it does not, efforts to constrain growth in M-1 to the mid-point

of the ranges presented are likely to involve interest rate levels

higher than those projected, and consequent growth in real GNP

below the projected rate.

(10) Even if growth in M-1 and M-2 were at the mid-points

of their ranges over the year ahead, growth in these aggregates over

more extended periods ending in QI '79 would--because of the

relatively rapid rates of expansion of the aggregates in 1977--be

above the mid-points of the proposed ranges under each alternative.

For example, as shown in the table below, M-1 growth at around the

5¼ per cent mid-point of the alternative B range for the QI '78-

QI '79 period would lead to a 6.3 per cent annual rate of expansion

over the 24-month period starting in the first quarter of 1977, almost

1/
at the upper end of the range.- M-1 growth over the next four

quarters at around the 5 per cent mid-point of the proposed alternative

C range would still imply M-1 growth over the 24-month period

beginning in QI '77 at a rate well above the mid-point of the current

FOMC range.

1/ Implied growth rates for even more extended periods are shown
in the growth triangles in Appendix III.

April-May period. As contemplated under alternative B, a Federal funds

rate centered on the recently prevailing 6-3/4 per cent level is likely

to be associated with M-1 growth over the two-month period at an annual

rate in a 6 to 10 per cent range. In terms of quarterly averages, we

would expect expansion in M-1 from the first to the second quarter to

be at a rate of about 6 per cent. However, growth would be more

rapid over the course of the second quarter--with M-1 expansion at

about an 7½ per cent rate from March to June.

(13) Growth in M-2 over the April-May period is likely to

be in a 6½ to 10½ per cent annual rate range under alternative B.

Savings deposits at commercial banks are expected to show very small

growth at best, though larger-than-seasonal tax refunds to individuals

may temporarily strengthen flows into these deposits in coming weeks.

With market yields remaining above ceiling rates, small-denomination

time deposits at commercial banks are also likely to grow only moderately.

However, in view of continued strong loan demands, banks probably will

maintain their reliance on large-denomination time deposits. Since a

major portion of these deposits is included in M-2, the interest-bear-

ing component of this aggregate is expected to continue at near its

recent pace.

(14) Under alternative B, inflows to savings and loan associa-

tions and mutual savings banks over the April-May period can be expected

to remain at near the 6 to 7 per cent average monthly rate prevailing

since year end. Consequently, thrifts are likely to continue to reduce



-12-

their portfolio liquidity and to increase their borrowing from the

Federal Home Loan Banks and others. At the same time, the commitment

and other mortgage lending policies of thrift institutions are likely

to be tightened further.

(15) Even with the Federal funds rate remaining around

6-3/4 per cent over the intermeeting period, market interest rates may

come under some upward pressure. Market expectations of a near-term

tightening of monetary policy are likely to be stimulated again if,

as seems likely, incoming data indicate a strengthening of economic

activity, continued substantial advances in prices, and an accelera-

tion of growth in the monetary aggregates. In addition, expected strong

demands for short-term funds by nonfinancial businesses should result in

further increases in commercial paper issuance and in continued heavy

offerings of large CD's by banks seeking funds to accommodate business

loan demands. Sponsored Federal agencies are also expected to continue

issuing a substantial volume of short-term debt over this period. On

the other hand, tendencies for bill rates to rise will be tempered by

the Treasury's repayment of $12 billion of cash management bills in the

latter half of April and the relatively low level of dealer bill inven-

tories. It is also likely that the Treasury will engage in net debt

repayment in the mid-May refunding.

(16) In longer-term markets, offerings of corporate, municipal,

and Federal agency issues are likely to remain sizable in the next few

weeks. On April 26, the Treasury will announce the terms on which it



-13-

will refund about $6 billion of publicly held issues maturing in mid-May.

It is expected that the Treasury will offer a sizable amount of inter-

mediate- and long-term securities in this operation. The recent

increases in bond yields and the adjustments in dealer positions, with

U.S. Government dealers now showing a sizable net short position in

coupon issues, suggest that much of the impact of this additional

supply may already have been discounted by the market. However,

mortgage yields appear likely to continue to drift higher in response to

the continued slow expansion of deposits at thrift institutions.

(17) Over the balance of the year and into early 1979, both

short- and long-term interest rates are likely to rise further as the

Federal Reserve takes actions to restrain money growth. Such rate

increases would be accompanied by a reduction in liquid asset holdings

of depository institutions, continued large commercial bank offerings

of large-denomination time deposits, and large additional borrowing

by Federal housing agencies undertaken to support the mortgage market.

As time goes on, the willingness and ability of depository institutions

to finance credit demands may be significantly limited by growing strains

on their balance sheets. While bond yields would also be under upward

pressure, rate increases would be cushioned by a reduction of State and

local advance refundings, a further shift of corporate financing from

capital markets to banks, and continued substantial demands for long-

term securities by insurance companies and pension funds.



-14-

(18) Under alternative C the Federal funds rate would

rise over the intermeeting period to the mid-point of a 7 to 7½ per

cent range. M-1 growth would likely be in a 5½ to 9½ per cent annual

rate range over April and May and M-2 growth in a 6 to 10 per cent

range. Under these circumstances, private short-term rates would

probably rise about percentage point, while Treasury bill rates

may increase somewhat less because of sizable bill paydowns. The

prime rate would also be likely to increase, particularly since

loan demands are expected to remain strong, and bond yields should

continue to move up somewhat. With the rise in market rates, member

bank borrowing from Federal Reserve Banks would expand sharply from

recently reduced levels, increasing pressures for a discount rate

advance. The rise in short-term rates under alternative C may provide

some support for the dollar in international exchange markets.

(19) The near-term increase in interest rates under

alternative C would be a step toward reducing the longer-run rate

of growth of the monetary aggregates, but further upward adjustments

in interest rates over the coming year would be required to limit M-1

growth to the mid-point of its 4 to 6 per cent longer-run range.

The funds rate would probably have to rise to 9 per cent by late

this year.

(20) Alternative A calls for a reduction in the Federal

funds rate over the intermeeting period to the mid-point of a 6 to

6 per cent range. Such an action would surprise market participants,

in view of the increased rate of inflation and the probability that

the data to be published in coming weeks will be indicating more



-15-

rapid M-1 growth. Downward pressure on short-term rates would tend

to be moderate since participants would expect a reversal in the

funds rate over the near term. Thus, the 3-month bill rate might

still remain somewhat above 6 per cent, and private short-term rates

would decline only marginally. Long-term rates probably also would

be little affected. On the other hand, the dollar would almost

certainly decline in foreign exchange markets.

(21) Alternative A is consistent with a policy designed to

encourage more rapid growth in the aggregates over the longer-run.

However, given expected nominal GNP growth over the policy period,

the near-term decline in the funds rate would soon have to be

reversed to restrain growth in M-1 to the mid-point of its longer

run range. By late spring, the funds rate would have to begin

rising again, reaching 8 per cent by late in the year.



-16-

Directive language

(22) Given below are alternatives for the operational

paragraphs of the directive. The first formulation, like the direc-

tive adopted at the last meeting, places main emphasis on near-term

rates of growth in monetary aggregates; it shows--in strike-through

form--the specifications adopted at the last meeting. The second

formulation places main emphasis on money market conditions. As

suggested below, the particular language needed in the opening lines

of the money market formulation would depend on the specific condi-

tions sought; the three alternatives shown--calling, respectively,

for somewhat easier, prevailing, and somewhat firmer money market

conditions--are intended to be associated with the specifications

discussed in the preceding section under alternatives A, B, and C.

"Monetary Aggregates" formulation

The Committee seeks to encourage near-term rates of growth

in M-1 and M-2 on a path believed to be reasonably consistent

with the longer-run ranges for monetary aggregates cited in the

preceding paragraph. Specifically, at present, it expects the

annual growth rates over the [DEL: March-April] APRIL-MAY period to be

within ranges of [DEL: 4 to 8] ____ TO ____ per cent for M-1 and [DEL: 5-1/2

to-9] ____ TO ____ per cent for M-2. In the judgment of the Com-

mittee such growth rates are likely to be associated with a

weekly-average Federal funds rate of about [DEL: 6-3/4] ____ per cent

(or at about the current level). If, giving approximately equal

weight to M-1 and M-2, it appears that growth rates over the



-17-

2-month period will deviate significantly from the midpoints of

the indicated ranges, the operational objective for the Federal

funds rate shall be modified in an orderly fashion within a

range of [DEL: 6-1/2 to 7] ____ TO ____ per cent. In the conduct of

day-to-day operations, account shall be taken of emerging financial

market conditions, including the conditions in foreign exchange

markets.

If it appears during the period before the next meeting

that the operating constraints specified above are proving to be

significantly inconsistent, the Manager is promptly to notify the

Chairman who will then decide whether the situation calls for

supplementary instructions from the Committee.

"Money Market" formulation

At this time, the Committee seeks to maintain about the

prevailing money market conditions (or to achieve somewhat easier

or somewhat firmer money market conditions) during the period

immediately ahead, provided that monetary aggregates appear to

be growing at approximately the rates currently expected, which

are believed to be on a path reasonably consistent with the

longer-run ranges for monetary aggregates cited in the preceding

paragraph. Specifically, the Committee seeks to maintain the

weekly-average Federal funds rate at about the current level (or

to reduce or to increase the weekly-average Federal funds rate

somewhat from the current level), so long as M-1 and M-2 appear

to be growing over the April-May period at annual rates within



-18-

ranges of ____ to ____ per cent and ____ to ____ per cent,

respectively. If, giving approximately equal weight to M-1 and

M-2, it appears that growth rates over the 2-month period are

approaching or moving beyond the limits of the indicated ranges,

the operational objective for the weekly-average Federal funds

rate shall be modified in an orderly fashion within a range of

____ to ____ per cent. In the conduct of day-to-day opera-

tions, account shall be taken of emerging financial market condi-

tions, including the conditions in foreign exchange markets.

If it appears during the period before the next meeting

that the operating constraints specified above are proving to be

significantly inconsistent, the Manager is promptly to notify the

Chairman who will then decide whether the situation calls for

supplementary instructions from the Committee.

borrowing at Federal Reserve less net Federal funds purchases. Weekly data are daily averages fpr statement weeks, except for corporate and
municipal issues in syndicate which are Friday figures.

* Strictly confidential.
** Monthly averages for excess reserves and borrowings are weighted averages of statement week figures.

NOTE: Weekly data for columns 1, 2, 3, 5, and 6 are statement week averages of daily data. Data in column 4 are 1-day Wednesday quotes. For columns 7
through 10, the weekly date is the mid-point of the calendar week over which data are averaged. Columns 11 and 12 are 1-day quotes for Friday and
Thursday, respectively, following the end of the statement week. Column 13 is an average of contract interest rates on commitments for conventional
first mortgages with 80 per cent loan-to-value ratios made by a sample of insured savings and loan associations on the Friday following the end of the
statement week. Column 14 gives FNMA auction data for Monday preceding the end of the statement week. Column 15 is a 1-day quote for Monday preceding
the end of the statement week. The FNHA auction yield is the average yield in bi-weekly auction for short-tert forward commitments for Goverment
underwritten mortgages. GNMA yields are average net yields to investors on mortgage-backed securities for immediate delivery, assuming prepayment in
12 years on pools of 30-year FHA/VA mortgages carrying the coupon rate 50 basis points below the current FHA/VA ceiling.
