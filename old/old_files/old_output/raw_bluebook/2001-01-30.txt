Prefatory Note 

 
 

The attached document represents the most complete and accurate version 
available based on original copies culled from the files of the FOMC Secretariat at the 
Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System.  This electronic document was 
created through a comprehensive digitization process which included identifying the best-
preserved paper copies, scanning those copies,1 and then making the scanned versions 
text-searchable.2  Though a stringent quality assurance process was employed, some 
imperfections may remain. 
 

Please note that this document may contain occasional gaps in the text.  These 
gaps are the result of a redaction process that removed information obtained on a 
confidential basis.  All redacted passages are exempt from disclosure under applicable 
provisions of the Freedom of Information Act.    

 

                                                 
1 In some cases, original copies needed to be photocopied before being scanned into electronic format.  All 
scanned images were deskewed (to remove the effects of printer- and scanner-introduced tilting) and lightly 
cleaned (to remove dark spots caused by staple holes, hole punches, and other blemishes caused after initial 
printing). 
2 A two-step process was used.  An advanced optimal character recognition computer program (OCR) first 
created electronic text from the document image.  Where the OCR results were inconclusive, staff checked 
and corrected the text as necessary.   Please note that the numbers and text in charts and tables were not 
reliably recognized by the OCR process and were not checked or corrected by staff. 



  1.  Federal funds traded at rates near the FOMC’s targets over the intermeeting period,
except on the last business day of the year.  On that day, the Desk’s generous reserve
provision pushed the effective rate down to 5.41 percent, a fairly typical deviation from
target for a year-end.  Since the last FOMC meeting, the Desk has redeemed $1.8 billion of
Treasury securities, mostly Treasury coupon issues, to continue bringing SOMA holdings
into conformance with the per-issue limits.  In part to offset the resulting reserve drain, the
Desk purchased $3.5 billion of Treasury coupon securities in the market and $670 million of
Treasury bills from  foreign custom ers.  To accom modate the  seasonal runo ff in currency, it
trimmed the volume of outstanding long-term RPs by $9 billion, to $13 billion.

MONETARY POLICY ALTERNATIVES

Recent D evelopments

(1) Interest rates backed up slightly and equity markets sold off following

the announcement that the FOM C had left the stance of policy unchanged at its

December meeting.1  However, yields generally declined over subsequent days, as the

wording of the Committee’s announcement and weaker economic data apparently

fostered a sense that an easing of monetary policy was imminent.  Even so, the timing

and size of the FOM C’s 50 basis point cut in the target federal funds rate on January 3

surprised market participants, and many inferred that additional monetary easings

would occur sooner than they had expected.  Over the entire intermeeting period,

interest rates on short-term Treasury securities and the highest-grade private debt fell

substantially, in some cases by nearly a percentage point, with only a small portion of

the declines on private debt reflecting an unwinding of year-end premiums.  Current

futures quotes indicate that investors place high odds on an additional 50 basis point

easing at this meeting and anticipate that the federal funds rate will be about 125 basis

points below its current level by year-end (chart 1).  However, options quotes suggest

a relatively high degree of uncertainty  about this extended out look. 

(2) The Committee’s action and the market’s inference about the likelihood

of future easings apparently contributed to a sense that the odds of a prolonged

period of economic weakness had diminished.  This revision to sentiment bolstered

equity markets, with broad equity price indexes increasing, on balance, over the

intermeeting period despite further substantial downward revisions to analysts’ near-

term earnings expectations.  Moreover, yields on lower-tier investment-grade bonds

and junk bonds fell 35 and  116 basis points, respectively.  The abatement of safe

haven demands, along with heightened prospects for a large tax cut and perhaps some

increase in inflation compensation, contributed to a small rise in longer-term Treasury

yields.  In some segments of financial markets, however, concerns about risk appeared

to escalate.  Results from the January Senior Loan Officer O pinion Survey indicate

that a majority of banks have further tightened their standards and terms on business

loans.  Moreover, risk spreads on lower-rated com mercial paper have widened

significantly since early January, as the defaults of California utilities, along with the

earlier downgrades of other prominent commercial paper issuers, seem to have

increased investor wariness.  To date, fallout from the difficulties of the California

utilities has been limited, although rating agencies have announced that the debts of

some corporations and municipalities affected by the West Coast electricity situation

have been downgraded or are being mon itored for possible downgrade.

(3) In December, overall business debt grew at a moderate pace, but the

patterns of financing continued to reflect heightened investor concerns about risk

(chart 2).  Although issuance of investment-grade bonds was brisk, virtually no

equities or junk bonds were brought to market.  Bank business loans grew rapidly,

with the advance owing  partly to lower-rated comm ercial paper issuers  temporarily

drawing down lines of credit at banks to avoid paying high year-end premiums, and

commercial paper outstanding declined.  Since the intermeeting po licy move in early

January, a substantial volume of corporate bonds, including a number of junk bonds,

has been issued in response to lower yields in more receptive markets.  Business loans

have continued to advance briskly in January, likely boosted by further substitution

out of the commercial paper market.  With lower-rated borrowers dissuaded by

elevated interest rates and unable to issue at maturities beyond a few days, the

outstanding amount of commercial paper has continued to run off in January.  In the

household  sector, consumer credit is estimated  to have decelera ted sharply in

December , and bank loan data suggest continued  moderation early  this year. 

Mortgage growth is estimated to have remained relatively strong, however, supported

by declines in mortgage rates.  Federal debt continued to contract late last year and in

January.  Data for debt growth in recent months are partial and preliminary, but on

balance it appears that nonfederal and total debt expanded at a moderate pace, similar

to that recorded in the third quarter of last year.

(4) M2 growth p icked up sharply in December and appears to have risen

further in January.2  The strength likely reflects in part investors’ decisions to seek the

safety and liquid ity of M2 assets, such as retail money funds and liquid deposits, in

response to the rise in equity market volatility in November and December.  Also, the

recent declines in short- and intermediate-term rates have narrowed the opportunity

cost of holding M2.  M3 has grown even more rapidly than M2, boosted in part by

faster issuance of large time deposits to fund a pickup in bank credit, which

accelerated to an 11 percent annual growth rate in December.  In addition,

institutional money funds have ballooned  as their yields, which  adjust to changes in

market rates with a lag, have become more attractive with the fall in short-term

market interest rates.

(5) While the weaker econom ic outlook in the United Sta tes, along with



4

lower interest rates, tended to put downward pressure on the foreign exchange value

of the dollar, economic stagnation in Japan exerted  a countervailing influence.  Since

the December FOMC meeting, the dollar was about unchanged, on net, against the

currencies of the major industrialized countries.  The dollar lost 3 percent of its value

relative to the euro , on net, as econom ic growth in Europe came to be seen as likely to

outpace that in the United States.  The dollar also depreciated vis-à-vis the Canadian

dollar as the momentum in domestic spending and the prospect of considerable fiscal

stimulus in Canada were thought likely to cushion the impact on Canadian exports of

softening U.S. aggregate demand.  By contrast, incoming economic data for Japan

proved disappointing to hopes that economic recovery had gained a foothold, and the

dollar appreciated 4½ percent against the yen over the intermeeting period.  The bleak

Japanese economic picture revived talk that the Bank of Japan may return its official

interest rate, now at ¼ percent, to zero, and money market futures rates, as well as

longer-term yields, shifted down a touch.  The exchange value of the dollar rose about

1 percent against a  basket of currencies of our other important trading partners. 

General concerns about the effects on Latin America of a slow ing in U.S. growth

supported the dollar relative to the Mexican peso and the Brazilian real.  The

currencies of many Asian em erging market economies that are viewed as especially

vulnerable to a slowing in global demand for electronic goods also slipped against the

dollar.  Still, in most emerging markets, bond spreads narrowed somewhat, and prices

rose in equity markets.  U.S. authorities did not intervene in foreign exchange markets

over the intermeeting period;

Longer-Term Strategies

(6) This section considers longer-term strategies for m onetary policy as well

as the policy implications of several of the alternative scenarios presented in the

Greenbook.3  All of the charts include a baseline scenario in which the Greenbook

forecast is extended through 2005 using the FRB/US model, adjusted to preserve the

key characteristics of the economy embodied in the judgmental forecast.  In this

extension, potential supply is assumed to expand  at the same rate  as in 2002, with

structural labor productivity growth continu ing at 3 percent per year.  The earlier

acceleration of structural productivity had helped to hold down price increases

because efficiency gains outpaced the lagging pickup in real wages.  But with the

leveling out of structural productivity growth, this disinflationary effect wanes, and the

degree of labor market slack consistent with steady inflation (the effective NAIRU)

edges up from about 4¾ percent currently to about 5¼ percent by 2005.4  Also after

2002, the federal surplus on a NIPA basis remains roughly stable at its current value

of about 2 percent of GDP.  The dollar is predicted to depreciate at a 5 percent rate

per year in real terms, and foreign economic growth picks up somewhat.  Together,

these last two factors roughly stabilize the ratio of the current account deficit to GDP.

(7) In the alternative strategies for monetary policy shown in chart 3, the

baseline policy keeps the federal funds rate unchanged at 5¾  percent beyond 2002.  In

contrast to the conditions underlying the long-run scenario section of a number of

bluebooks in recent years, potential supply and aggregate demand are approximately

in balance at the end of the Greenbook forecast in 2002, and little impetus to raise or

lower inflation rates is in the pipeline.  Moreover, the real federal funds rate at that

1.  The real federal funds rate is calculated as the quarterly nominal funds rate minus

2.  The Taylor rule uses a concept of potential output corresponding to the effective NAIRU, rather than corresponding to
the long-run NAIRU as in the original specification of the Taylor rule.

  5.   In the policy rule, coefficients on the contemporaneous output and inflation gaps are
equal to ½.

output gap of zero, but would do so in the longer run.

time is close to its equilibrium level (recognizing , of course, the cons iderable

uncertainty that surrounds this  and al l other  aspects of our projections).  

Consequently, under this policy, the unemployment rate remains in the vicinity of the

effective NAIRU from 2002 to 2005, and core PCE inflation is little changed.  The

Taylor rule policy sets the federal funds rate in response to core PCE inflation and the

gap between actual output and the level of output consistent with the effective

NAIRU.5  The equilibrium real interest rate used in the rule is that implicit in the

extended Greenbook baseline (slightly above 4 percent), while targeted inflation is set

at 1½ percent.  As shown by the dot-dash lines, the path for the federal funds rate

given by the Taylor rule follows the baseline assumption reasonably closely, although

the nominal and real federa l funds rates are a b it lower in the near term and a bit

higher later.6  With the price stability policy, the Committee p laces inflation on a  path

to virtual price stability–as measured by core PCE inflation at a 1 percent rate.  In

order to accomplish this objective, policy has to be tighter than the baseline at some

point.  In the alternative shown, the funds rate is kept at its current 6 percent level for

a time so that the required tightness occurs early in the simulation period, and thus

inflation is on a perceptible downward track beginning in 2002.

(8)  Chart 4 presents alternative supply-side scenarios.  The 4 percent

NAIRU scenario has been designed to  explain the good performance of inflation in

recent years in terms of a permanently lower long-run NAIRU, rather than on the

basis of transitory effects o f accelerating productivity.  Again , monetary po licy is

assumed to  follow a Taylor rule, but one that incorporates a lower inflation  target

(1 percent) than was used in the baseline’s Taylor rule, as the Committee takes

advantage of the “opportun ity” of emerging slack to make further progress toward

price stability.7  As shown by the dot-dash line, the federal funds rate is eased

aggressively over the next two years to limit the rise in the unemployment rate, but the

lower NAIRU means that a decline in inflation to 1 percent still can be achieved.  The

productivity slowdown scenario retains the staff view of the NAIRU and the role of

changes in structural productivity growth in the inflation process, but assumes that the

rate of structural productivity growth going forward falls permanently to 1½ percent

(its 1973-94 average)  rather  than continuing to run at 3 percent as in the baseline. 

Slower trend growth raises the effective NAIRU sharply, which  puts upward pressure

on inflation, but it also weakens demand; on balance, demand is restrained more than

potential supply relative to the baseline, lowering the equilibrium real interest rate.  If

policy follows the Taylor rule, as assumed in this scenario, the federal funds rate drifts

down, but by less than the decline in the equ ilibrium real funds rate in order to check

the rise in inflation.

(9) Chart 5 considers the implications of alternative demand-side

scenarios presented in the Greenbook, but under the assumption that monetary

policy follows the Taylor rule.  In the recession scenario (dot-dash lines), weakness in

aggregate demand is more pronounced than in the baseline by enough to push the

economy into an outr ight recession.  The downward impetus to demand reverses fully

during 2002.  As shown, the unemployment rate rises to 6 percent in 2002 even

though the  federa l funds rate is  reduced to about 4½ percent  by the end of 2001. 

Even with the unemployment rate rising well above the effective NAIRU, inflation

increases slightly in 2002 as lower interest rates induce a steeper drop in the exchange

value of the dollar than in the baseline, raising import prices.  In the growth pause

scenario, the near-term weakness in aggregate demand stems solely from excess

business inventor ies and not also from a slowing in final demand, as in the baseline. 

After excess inventories are worked off, the greater underlying strength in final

demand shows through to aggregate output growth.  As shown by the dotted line, the

Committee lowers the federal funds rate to 5¾ percent in the current quarter but

promptly reverses this action.  With final demand persistently stronger than in the

baseline scenario, after 2001 both nominal and real interest rates need to rise further.

Medium-term Projections of M2 Growth

(10) This section briefly reviews the growth of M2 last year and presents staff

projections for the  next two years that are consistent  with the Greenbook forecast. 

(See table below.)  Since the mid-1990s, in contrast to earlier in that decade, the

demand for this aggregate has conformed fairly well on average with historical

relationships to opportunity cost and spending (chart 6).  In that context, analysis of

the deviations of M2 growth from projections, against the backdrop of other

developments in financial markets, could be helpful in understanding the evolution of

financial conditions and their implications for the economic outlook.  Moreover, in

the very long run, trends in M2 and prices should be related.

(11) Even though velocity and opportunity cost have moved together on

average over recent years, significant divergences also are apparent that may be related

in part to the unusual behavior of the equity market.  Beginning in 1996, investors

apparently began to view equity returns as quite attractive, and flows into equ ity

mutual funds surged at the expense of M2, with the result that velocity trended higher

through mid-1997.  However, velocity subsequently moved back down as the further

runup of equity prices boosted stock market wealth appreciably relative to income,

  8.  The rate of g rowth of M 2 at price stability is derived under the assumption of stable
velocity by summing the staff’s estimate of potential real GDP for the next two years (about
4 percent) and the residua l bias in the  GDP deflator (½  percent).

and households seemed to take steps to rebalance portfolios by reallocating funds to

assets in M2.  M2 velocity has been flat over the past two years.  In 2000, the damping

effect on money demand of the rise in opportunity cost appeared to be offset by the

response of households to equity market volatility and to a flat, and at times inverted,

yield curve, which gave investors little incentive to shift funds out of M2 assets and

into longer-m aturity capital market instruments. 

(12) M2 growth is expected to moderate somewhat in 2001 as the expansion

of nominal income slows.  The downshift in M2 growth is tempered, however, by the

reduction in short-term interest rates stemming from the assumed 75 basis points of

policy easing in the first quarter and by the anticipated flatness of the yield curve.  In

addition, lower mortgage rates in the forecast spur a wave of mortgage refinancing

activity that pushes up M2 growth as mortgage servicing agents temporarily place the

prepayments in transaction accounts before remitting them to holders of mortgage-

backed securities.  Moreover, households are expected to favor M2 assets in view of

the disappoin ting returns in the equity market anticipated in  the staff forecast.  With

M2 growth slowing considerably less than nominal income, M2 velocity is projected  to

fall notably this year.  In 2002, the staff assumes that short-term rates hold steady and

that savers will have largely completed their adjustments to the flat yield curve and

lower expected returns on holding equities.  In this environment, M2 growth is

expected to level out, running at about the same pace as nominal income.  Even

though inflation persists over the next two years in the staff forecast, M2 growth on

average in 2001 and 2002 is only modestly above the 4½ percent average pace that

would be associated with price stability because of shortfalls in the growth of real

output relative to  that of potential.8 



12

Short-run policy alternatives 

(13) The staff has again revised down its outlook for economic growth in the

near term, reflecting weaker expansion in aggregate dem and than previously projected

and more aggressive production  cutbacks to a lign inventories better wi th sales. 

However, final demands over the forecast horizon are supported by the effects on

consumption and investment of continuing elevated structural productivity gains and

are augmented by the substantial declines in most interest rates over recent months as

well as by projected decreases in energy prices and the foreign exchange value of the

dollar.  As a result, the inventory correction is completed fairly promptly, and

projected economic growth resumes in  the spring and  picks up thereafter.  Despite

the economic rebound, the sizable shortfall from potential output growth in the next

few quarters quickly pushes up the unemployment rate to around 5¼ percent by year-

end.  By then, though, aggregate demand is expanding at a pace just short of potential

and the unemploym ent rate edges only a bit higher over the remainder of the forecast

period.  With structural productivity growth leveling out, the rise in the

unemployment rate is seen as necessary to keep core consumer inflation rates near

current levels.  Against this backdrop, the staff forecast assumes only a small

addit ional cut in the federal funds rate in  the near term . 

(14) If the Committee found the staff assessment o f the outlook to  be both

reasonable and acceptable, it might opt for alternative A, which would lower the

federal funds rate 25 basis points to 5¾ percent.  In the context of this forecast, such

an easing leans against softness in aggregate demand while resisting an eventual pickup

of inflation in circumstances of continued pressures on labor resources.  In light of

the considerable uncertainty about the prospects for spending, such a measured step

could be seen  as striking a balance between two possible scenarios for aggregate

demand discussed earlier–a recession and a growth pause.  To be sure, the market has



13

a more substantial easing at this meeting built into interest rates, but this expectation

was shaped in part by the Committee ’s unexpectedly aggressive action earlier this

month.  Over a som ewhat longer horizon, the structure of interest rates incorporates

a drop in the funds rate to 4¾ percent by year-end–more than  the Committee may see

as likely to be necessary to restore acceptable growth.  If so, it may view disappointing

markets a little as possibly fostering more sustainable and stabilizing financial

conditions.  Indeed, the Committee may be concerned that another 50 basis point

action hard on the heels of the January 3 move risks leading investors to expect even

more ease at future meetings than currently.  Such a reaction would heighten the

possibility that the stimulus emanating from financial markets would give additional

impetus to a rebound in  spending that might soon be underway in any event.  Given

the lags in the effects of monetary policy, any resulting price pressures could be

difficult to contain even with a relatively quick turnaround in po licy.

(15) If the Committee were to  choose this alternative, it might want to retain

the current statement that the risks are  weighted toward economic weakness, unless it

were confident tha t the economy had s tabilized and  moderate growth  was in  prospect. 

With on ly a 25 basis point easing, market in terest rates probab ly would back up, credit

spreads would widen some, and stock prices wou ld decline as the policy move fell

short of market expectations and concerns about a pro longed period of economic

weakness re-intensified. 

(16) If the Committee thought the economy might well be weaker than in the

staff forecast, it may wish to take another substantial easing action by cutting the

federal funds rate 50 basis points at this meeting, as in alternative AN.  As the

recession simulation illustrated, a substantial shortfall in demand would require

prompt and forceful policy action.  Even  if the Committee thought the staff forecast

was the most reasonable po int estimate, it might still favor a 50 basis point easing if it



14

perceived that the probabilities around that outcom e were skewed toward

considerably softer demand than in that forecast.  With inflation and inflation

expectations likely to remain quiescent for a while, a substantial easing to cushion

downside risks to economic activity is unlikely to boost materially the risk of greater

inflation pressures.  Indeed, a substantial easing might also be viewed as appropria te if

the Committee did not see outsized downside risks to demand but thought price

pressures were unlikely to intensify at an unemployment rate near its current level, as

in the 4 percent NAIRU simulation earlier in this bluebook.  Financial market

participants currently have built in high odds of a ½ percentage point cut in the funds

rate at this meeting.  Although conditions in some segments of financial markets have

improved in recent weeks, developments in the commercial paper and bank loan

markets indicate that suppliers of funds remain quite wary.  Under these

circumstances, the effects of surprising the markets with a smaller easing could be

especially adverse.  

(17) The market response to a 50 basis point reduction in the federal funds

rate would depend importantly on the wording of the announcement and balance of

risks statement that accompanied the action.  Retaining  a statement of risks weighted

toward economic weakness would seem appropriate if, in light of the evident

softening in demand and subdued readings on price and wage inflation, the

Committee saw the possibility of below-trend growth as a more serious problem in

the foreseeable futu re than the chance of a rise in inflation.  Market participants

expect the Committee  to announce continued unbalanced  risks toward economic

weakness as well as to ease policy by 50 basis points.  S till, markets might rally some if

participants see th is combination as confirming that the Federal Reserve intended to

continue to counter economic weakness relatively aggressively.  The dollar  could

weaken on foreign exchange markets as m ajor foreign central banks are unlikely to



15

match the System easing at this time.  A statement that risks were balanced would be

justified if the Com mittee thought the 100 basis points of easing over the last month

were likely to be sufficient to promote a rapid return to sustainab le growth, which

would keep labor markets relatively tight.  Such a statement would cause market

participants to reassess the prospects for future policy actions and roll back much of

the expected easing going forward.  In consequence, asset prices could give back some

of their recent gains while the dollar could even strengthen a bit on foreign exchange

markets.

(18) The Committee may choose the unchanged federal funds rate of

alternative B if it is dissatisfied with recent rates of core inflation  and wants to

establish a downward trajectory for inflation, as in the price stability scenario in the

second section of this bluebook.  The rationale for this policy choice would be

strengthened if the Committee saw the recent slowdown in the  growth of aggregate

demand as likely to be more temporary than does the staff and thus the recent policy

easing as probably sufficient to counter the sluggishness in the econom y that emerged

recently.  Regard less of the balance of risks statement, leaving the funds rate

unchanged would come as a considerable surprise to market participants and would

spark a sell-off in asset markets as participants reassessed the economic outlook and

the Committee’s posture.  The backup in interest rates and drop in equity prices

would prompt still more caution on the part of loan officers and investors.

(19) Under the Greenbook forecast, borrowing by the business and

household sectors combined over the first half of 2001 is expected to stay around the

reduced pace of the second half of last year.  Consumer cred it is projected to

decelerate further over the first half, largely reflecting weaker outlays on consumer

durables and  some rising caution by households experiencing uncomfortable  debt-

servicing burdens.  Recent declines in mortgage rates are expected to spur continued



16

heavy mortgage refinancing activity, mostly to reduce debt-servicing costs on existing

debt but in a number of cases also to extract some equity.  Lower bond rates and an

improved tone to the corporate bond market already have begun to boost issuance;

going forward, overall business borrowing should run somewhat above the subdued

pace of the latter part of last year, when firms seemed inclined to ho ld off on their

borrowing plans.  Business borrowing from banks is expected to m oderate, in part

reflecting the increased reliance on bond offerings but also the more restrictive

posture of loan  officers.  Debt of nonfederal sectors is projected to grow at about a

6½ percent rate from December to June and total debt to grow at a 4¼ percent rate,

held down by paydowns of federal debt.

(20) M2 is projected to grow at a 5½ percent annual rate over the January-to-

June period under the Greenbook forecast, well above the projected 2¾ percent

growth of nominal GDP over the first half of this year.  M2 growth should be

boosted relative to that of nominal income by the decline in short-term market rates

following the January policy easings and by a continuation of the heightened

preferences of households for the more stable assets that comprise M2.  Mortgage

refinancing activity  also is likely to lift M2 notably over th is period.  M3 is expected to

grow at a 7 percent annual rate over the January-to-June period.  Growth of

institutional money funds is projected to be quite brisk as the yields on these funds lag

the downward m ove in short-term market interest rates.

Directive and Balance-of-Risks Language

(21) Presented below for the mem bers' consideration is draft wording for  

(1) the directive and (2) the “balance of risks” sentence to be included in the press

release issued after the  meeting (not part of the directive).

                                              (1) Directive Wording

The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and financial

conditions that will foster price stab ility and promote sustainable growth in

output.  To further its long-run  objectives, the Committee in the immediate

future seeks conditions in reserve markets consistent with MAINTAINING/

INCREASING/reducing the federal funds rate AT/to an average of around

___ 6 percen t.  

                                                   (2) “Balance-of-Risks” Sentence

Against the background of its long-run goals of price stability and

sustainable economic growth and of the information currently available, the

Committee believes that the risks [ARE BALANCED WITH RESPECT TO

PROSPECTS FOR BOTH GOALS] [CONTINUE TO BE WEIGHTED

MAINLY TOWARD CONDITIONS THAT MAY  GENERATE

HEIGHTENED INFLATION PRESSURES] [are weighted mainly toward

conditions that may generate economic weakness] in the foreseeable  future .
