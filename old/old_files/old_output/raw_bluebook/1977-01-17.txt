Prefatory Note 
 
 
The attached document represents the most complete and accurate version available 
based on original copies culled from the files of the FOMC Secretariat at the Board 
of Governors of the Federal Reserve System.  This electronic document was created 
through a comprehensive digitization process which included identifying the best-
preserved paper copies, scanning those copies,1 and then making the scanned 
versions text-searchable.2   Though a stringent quality assurance process was 
employed, some imperfections may remain. 
 
Please note that some material may have been redacted from this document if that 
material was received on a confidential basis.  Redacted material is indicated by 
occasional gaps in the text or by gray boxes around non-text content.  All redacted

1  In some cases, original copies needed to be photocopied before being scanned into electronic 
format.  All scanned images were deskewed (to remove the effects of printer- and scanner-introduced 
tilting) and lightly cleaned (to remove dark spots caused by staple holes, hole punches, and other 
blemishes caused after initial printing). 
 
2 A two-step process was used.  An advanced optical character recognition computer program (OCR) 
first created electronic text from the document image.  Where the OCR results were inconclusive, 
staff checked and corrected the text as necessary.  Please note that the numbers and text in charts and 
tables were not reliably recognized by the OCR process and were not checked or corrected by staff.

Recent developments

(1) M1 expanded at an 8.1 per cent annual rate in December,

after remaining unchanged in November. For the December-January period

growth is estimated at about a 7-1/4 per cent annual rate--somewhat

above the Committee's operating range. Savings deposits at commercial

banks have continued to expand at a very rapid pace in December and early

January, but inflows of M2-type time deposits have slowed considerably.

Consequently, for the two-month period M 2 is expected to grow at around

an 11 per cent annual rate, near the mid-point of the Committee's range.

Deposit flows at nonbank thrift institutions accelerated somewhat in

December from their November pace. Nonborrowed reserves appear to be

rising at about a 10 per cent annual rate over the December-January

period, reflecting strong bank demands for excess reserves in recent

statement weeks as well as the pick-up in growth of demand deposits.

(2) Throughout most of the intermeeting period, incoming data

suggested that growth in M1 and M2 over the December-January period would

be within their respective two-month ranges, and the Desk continued to

seek a Federal funds rate of around 4-5/8 per cent. While data available

in the past few days suggested that M1 growth for the period may be some-

what above its range, M growth remained near the mid-point of its range,

and the Desk--with the FOMC meeting only a few days away--decided to con-

tinue aiming for a funds rate of around 4-5/8 per cent.

(3) Interest rates were generally stable in the last half of

December, but in early January there were substantial upward rate pres-

sures, especially on intermediate-term Treasury coupon issues. The

continued stability of the funds rate at a time when many market partici-

pants had expected this rate to decline further appears to have contributed

somewhat to the backup in market rates. Rate increases were intensified

by press reports regarding possible fiscal stimulus and Federal deficits,

by indications that the pace of economic activity has picked up in recent

months, and by more rapid M1 growth than anticipated. On balance, since

the last FOMC meeting, rates in short-term markets have advanced 10 to 30

basis points; yields on intermediate Treasury issues have increased as

much as 60 basis points; and interest rates on long-term corporate and

Treasury bonds have risen 10 to 25 basis points.

(4) Short-term business credit demands increased modestly in

December as a rise in commercial paper issuance was nearly offset by a



-3-

decline in business loans at commercial banks. Activity in the capital

markets was light over much of the intermeeting period reflecting the

normal holiday lull. Most recently, however, the volume of corporate

and municipal issues brought to market has increased sharply and the

forward calendar has built up substantially, apparently reflecting the

decision of borrowers to take advantage of the relatively low yields

prevailing in bond markets. The Treasury has raised $3.8 billion of new

money since the December meeting, and is expected to borrow much more

heavily in the four weeks following the January meeting.

centage annual rates of change) related monetary and financial flows over

various time periods.

Prospective Developments

(6) Three alternative sets of longer-run ranges for the

monetary aggregates applicable to the one year QIV '76-QIV '77 period

are shown below. Alternative B continues the same ranges currently in

place except for the bank credit proxy for which the range is higher

than the present 5-8 per cent. The relationship of the proposed ranges to

shorter-run specifications and longer-run interest rate and monetary

developments is discussed in ensuing paragraphs. (End-point levels for

M1 and M 2 implied by current and proposed longer-run ranges are compared

in appendix I).

(8) Under alternative B, with a Federal funds rate centered

within a 4¼-5 per cent range, we would expect M1 to grow in a 3 -7 per

cent annual rate range over the January-February period. This represents

a slightly higher 2-month range than has been presented in recent blue

books, and reflects the pick-up in M1 growth that has occurred during the

past few weeks as well as the stronger demand for money expected to be

associated with the projected acceleration in growth of nominal GNP in

the first quarter.

(9) Growth in M2 over the January-February period may be in a

7 -11 per cent annual rate range under alternative B. The time and

savings deposit component of M2 is expected to grow less than in the

fourth quarter, largely because banks have become less aggressive in

seeking out time deposit funds. Offering rates reportedly have been cut,

and longer-term certificates are apparently not being offered by some

banks.

(10) Interest rates might show little further change between

now and the next Committee meeting if the funds rate remains around 4-5/8

per cent, although some further rate increase would not be surprising

in view of market conditions. Demands by corporations and state and

local governments on bond markets are expected to be quite heavy, as a

large number of new issues have been accelerated to take advantage of

current relatively low yield levels. Treasury cash needs in the first

quarter are large--probably about $24 billion. The Treasury may raise

about $4-5 billion of new cash in connection with the mid-February-

refunding, to be announced on January 26. Perhaps the chief factor that



could cause market rates to rise somewhat over the next few weeks, however,

would be the effect on market expectations of any further evidence of a

strengthening in the economy, monetary aggregates, and fiscal stimulus.

(11) To maintain growth in monetary aggregates over the

QIV '76-QIV '77 period within the longer-run ranges proposed under

alternative B, the staff expects that the Federal funds rate would have

to begin rising by early spring, and would reach a 1977 peak of around

6½ per cent in the fourth quarter of the year. The rise in short-term

rates more generally that would be associated with such an increase in

the funds rate would tend to curb the growth in time and savings deposits

at banks and thrift institutions. As a result growth in M2 and M3 is

expected to slow progressively as the year goes on. At the same time

banks would probably begin to offer CD's more aggressively to accommodate

credit demands generated by the projected substantial expansion in GNP.

Bank credit expansion in 1977 is likely to be considerably more rapid

than in 1976, when banks permitted outstanding CD's to drop sharply.

(12) Growth in M1 also is expected to be slower in the second

half of the year than in the first half, partly reflecting the cumulative

impact on money demand of a gradual tightening in money market conditions.

In addition, growth in the first half is likely to be raised relative

to the second half as a result of the particular fiscal stimulus being

proposed. We have assumed that $10 billion of tax rebates and one-time

social security payments would be made during the spring, which would

enlarge growth in M1, as well as M2 and M3, in that period. Tax refunds

in late winter and early spring are expected to be larger than last year

and could also have a transitory impact on M1.



(13) Alternative A encompasses a reduction in the Federal

funds rate to the mid-point of a 3-4 per cent range over the next

few weeks. Under this assumption, M1 and M 2 over the January-February

period would be expected to grow at annual rates of 4-8 and 8-12 per

cent respectively. Interest rates would be expected to decline over

the next few weeks, but reductions maybe limited, particularly in

long-term markets. Expectations that interest rates would soon rise

might develop as the market observes faster growth in the aggregates and

as the pace of economic expansion picks up.

(14) Over the longer-run, under alternative A, we would not

expect a very substantial rise in interest rates to develop, however,

since the higher longer-run growth in the monetary aggregates embodied

in that alternative would be more accommodative of money and credit

demands. The funds rate would probably have to rise under this alterna-

tive, given the projected strength of the economy, but perhaps to no

more than an average level of around 5¼ per cent by the fourth quarter

of the year.

(15) Alternative C involves a tightening of the Federal funds

rate over the next few weeks to the mid-point of a 4 ¾-5½ per cent range.

Over the January-February period M1 growth may be in a 3-7 per cent

range--a step toward attaining the lower longer-run ranges for the

monetary aggregates proposed for this alternative. The staff would

expect that further pressures would have to be applied to the money

market as the year progresses if growth in M1 over the QIV '76-QIV '77

period is to be constrained to around the mid-point of the 3½-5½ per



cent alternative C range. The funds rate might reach about 7¼ per cent

by the fourth quarter.

(16) An increase in the funds rate over the next few weeks

by about ½ percentage point would probably cause the 3-month bill rate

to rise into a 5-5¼ per cent range. And rate increases in the intermediate-

term Treasury coupon market could be substantial, since dealer coupon

positions remain fairly sizable and because of the large amount of cash

that may be raised in this area in connection with the forthcoming

Treasury refunding. Corporate and municipal bond yields would also be

likely to rise, but postponements of issues recently scheduled to take

advantage of lower rates could moderate the increase.

Proposed directive

(17) Presented below are four alternative formulations for the

operational paragraph of the directive. The first three are couched in

terms of desired growth in monetary aggregates over the months ahead and

are intended to correspond to the similarly lettered policy alternatives

discussed in the preceding section. The fourth alternative is proposed

in the event that the Committee again wishes to formulate its instructions

in terms of money market conditions and to maintain the conditions now

prevailing.

Alternative "Monetary Aggregates" Proposals

Alternative A

To implement this policy, while taking account of developments

in domestic and international financial markets, the Committee seeks

to [DEL: maintain prevailing] ACHIEVE bank reserve and money market condi-

tions CONSISTENT WITH SUBSTANTIAL GROWTH IN MONETARY AGGREGATES over

the period [DEL: immediately] ahead [DEL:, provided that monetary aggregates appear

to be growing at about the rates currently expected].

Alternative B

To implement this policy, while taking account of developments

in domestic and international financial markets, the Committee seeks

to [DEL: maintain prevailing] ACHIEVE bank reserve and money market condi-

tions CONSISTENT WITH MODERATE GROWTH IN MONETARY AGGREGATES over

the period [DEL: immediately] ahead [DEL: , provided that monetary aggregates appear

to be growing at about the rates currently expected].



-11-

Alternative C

To implement this policy, while taking account of developments

in domestic and international financial markets, the Committee seeks

to [DEL: maintain prevailing] ACHIEVE bank reserve and money market condi-

tions CONSISTENT WITH MODEST GROWTH IN MONETARY AGGREGATES over the

period [DEL: immediately] ahead, [DEL: provided that monetary aggregates appear

to be growing at about the rates currently expected].

"Money Market" Proposal

To implement this policy, while taking account of developments

in domestic and international financial markets, the Committee seeks

to maintain prevailing bank reserve and money market conditions over

the period immediately ahead, provided that monetary aggregates appear

to be growing at about the rates currently expected.

NOTE: The last three columns assume that growth around the mid-points
of the proposed ranges is achieved and are the same numbers as
shown in the table on p. 5a.

The above tabulation indicates that the proposed alternative B

implies levels of M1 in the latter half of 1977 little different from

those implicit in the current longer-run range based on the third

quarter of 1976. Because of the more rapid growth in M1 now expected

in the first half of 1977, the third quarter 1977 level under alternative

B is slightly higher (.3 of a per cent), but the fourth quarter level is

virtually the same.

For M2, however, the proposed alternative B implies substantially

higher levels in the latter half of 1977 than are implied by the mid-point

of the current growth range based on QIII '76. By the third quarter,

M 2 would be about 1½ per cent, and by the fourth quarter about 1 per

cent, higher under proposed alternative B. The levels of alternative C

are considerably closer to the previously implied mid-point levels.

NOTE: Government security dealer trading positions are on a commitment basis. Trading positions, which exclude Treasury securities financed by repurchase
agreements maturing in 16 days or more, are indicators of dealer holdings available for sale over the near-term. Underwriting syndicate positions consist
of issues still in syndicate, excluding trading positions. The basic reserve deficit is excess reserves less borrowing at Federal Reserve less net Federal
funds purchases. Weekly data are daily averages for statement weeks, except for corporate and municipal issues in syndicate which are Friday figures.

NOTE: Weekly data for columns 1 to 4 are statement week averages of daily data. Columns 5 and 6 are 1-day Wednesday quotes (prior to 1976, figures shown
are for 60-89 day and 90-119 day ranges, respectively). For columns 7 and 10, the weekly date is the mid-point of the calendar week over which data are
averaged. Columns 8 and 9 are 1-day quotes for Friday and Thursday, respectively, following the end of the statement week. Column 11 gives FNMA auction
data for Monday preceding the end of the statement week. Column 12 is a 1-day quote for Monday preceding the end of the statement week. The FNMA auction
yield is the average yield in bi-weekly auction for short-term forward commitments for Government underwritten mortgages. GNMA yields are average net
yields to investors on mortgage-backed securities for immediate delivery, assuming prepayment in 12 years on pools of 30-year FHA/VA mortgages carrying
the coupon rate 50 basis points below the current FHA/VA ceiling.
