MONETARY POLICY ALTERNATIVES

Recent developments

(1) Growth in M1 accelerated to about a 12-1/4 percent annual

rate on average in May and June. As a result, expansion over the March to

June period, at about an 8-1/4 percent rate, was well above the Committee's

specification for that period of 6-1/2 percent. In contrast to M1, growth

in the broader monetary aggregates was about in line with anticipations,

in the case of M3 in line with the upward revised expectations of the last

Committee meeting. Over the March to June period, M2 grew at a 7-3/4

percent annual rate and M3 at a 10-1/4 percent rate. Compared with the

longer-run ranges adopted at the February meeting, M1 by June was somewhat

below its upper limit, M2 a little below the middle of the range, and M3

above the range.

(2) Domestic nonfinancial debt is estimated to have expanded

at about a 13 percent annual rate over the past three months, with both

federal and private borrowing continuing at about their advanced first-

quarter pace. Borrowing related to mergers is estimated to have accounted

for about one percentage point of total debt growth in the first half of

the year.

(3) Total reserve growth accelerated to a 10-3/4 percent rate

in May and further to a 26 percent annual rate in June, owing to a larger

demand for excess reserves and rapid growth of required reserves in June

which reflected especially strong demand deposits in that month and a

surge in large time deposits that began in May. After adjustment for

borrowing by Continental Illinois before it was formally classified

-3-

as extended credit in early June, nonborrowed reserves rose at about a

22 percent rate over the last two months. Adjustment plus seasonal

credit remained very close to $1 billion in each of the complete 2-week

statement periods since the last Committee meeting. Thus far in the

current statement period, borrowing has averaged $662 million.

(4) The federal funds rate has risen from the area of 10-1/2

percent at the time of the May meeting to an average of around 11 percent

in June, with trading mostly in an 11 to 11-1/2 percent range thus far

in July. Money market pressures were especially marked around the mid-June

tax date and in the reserve maintenance period containing the quarter-end

statement date and the July 4 holiday. Generally, over the whole period

since the last Committee meeting, federal funds have traded at a higher

rate than might have been expected relative to the average level of discount

window borrowing, perhaps partly because large banks seem to have become

somewhat more conservative in their reserve management (for example, more

reluctant to use the discount window) in light of market concerns generated

by Latin American debt problems. Given these concerns, the spread of CD over

bill rates widened further and there were indications of tiering within the

CD market. Spreads have narrowed somewhat in recent days, but over the

intermeeting period 3-month CD and Euro-dollar rates rose around 50 basis

points on balance, while the 3-month T-bill rate was about unchanged. Mar-

ket concerns also appear to have affected private credits in general to some

degree. The bond market has been quite volatile since the FOMC meeting, with

Treasury bond yields currently about 15 to 40 basis points below levels at

the time of the last FOMC meeting. Private longer-term market rates, on

the other hand, are about unchanged on balance over the same period, while

rates on conventional fixed-rate home mortgages have risen about 65 basis

points.



-4-

(5) The dollar's exchange value has risen, net, about 4

percent on a weighted average basis since the last Committee meeting.

Appreciations against major foreign currencies range from 3 percent

against the Canadian dollar to almost 6 percent against sterling. The

dollar weakened early in the period at the time of greatest concern about

large banks, but the rise in U.S. short-term interest rates and indications

of stronger than expected U.S. growth contributed to a sharp rise in the

weighted average dollar to a new peak.



-5-

Longer-run ranges for 1984 and 1985

(6) The table below shows the 1984 growth ranges for the

monetary and credit aggregates that are currently in place, an alternative

set that might be considered, and actual growth through the first half of the

year. The alternative encompasses somewhat higher growth ranges for M3 and

credit than in the current set of ranges.

Actual Growth
Current Alternative QIV to QII QIV to June

M1 4 to 8 4 to 8 6.7 7.5

M2 6 to 9 6 to 9 7.0 7.1

M3 6 to 9 6-1/2 to 9-1/2 9.7 9.8

Debt 8 to 11 9 to 12 13.0 13.0

(7) As may be seen from the table, the growth to date for M1

and M2 suggests little need to alter their longer-run ranges. Despite

growth in nominal GNP over the first half of the year that has been about

2-1/2 percentage points faster than projected by the staff at the beginning

of the year, expansion of these two aggregates has been within their ranges.

Growth in their income velocities accelerated to annual rates of around

4-1/2 to 4-3/4 percent, in part reflecting the one to two percentage point

rise in short rates since the fourth quarter, following velocity increases

in the second half of last year in the neighborhood of 2-1/2 percent for

both aggregates. The largest velocity increases for M1 and M2 occurred in

the first quarter of this year, and velocity growth in the second quarter

was more in line with experience in the second half of last year. Assuming

that velocity continues to rise at a moderate pace, and also assuming some

little further rise in short-term interest rates, M1 growth over the balance

of the year is likely to remain in the upper half of its range and M2

growth around its midpoint, given the staff's GNP projection.



(8) In contrast to M1 and M2, growth of M3 and total debt

has been above their longer-run ranges thus far this year, as the

velocities of these aggregates have not accelerated from their pace in

the second half of last year. The alternative set of ranges for 1984

provides an option of raising growth of M3 and debt by 1/2 and one

percentage points, respectively, while retaining the current M1 and M2

ranges. This could be considered as needed to reflect the impact of merger

activity. Credit growth for the year might be above the upward adjusted

range, though, given the strength of demands for goods and services in the

staff's GNP forecast. On the other hand, there is also some, though small,

probability that M3 and debt growth could come within their present longer-

run ranges by year-end. This could occur if concerns about the fragility

of financial institutions and markets were to intensify, making it more

difficult for institutions to raise funds and leading to more conservative

lending practices generally. It may also occur if for other reasons the

economy were to slow more than currently projected and merger activity were

to subside much more rapidly than assumed.

(9) Three alternative sets of tentative ranges for 1985 are

shown in the table below for Committee consideration. Alternative I simply

represents the current ranges. Alternative III reduces all of the ranges

by 1/2 point-with an option shown in parentheses for narrowing the M1

range while retaining the alternative III midpoint should the Committee

wish to indicate a little more confidence in M1 as a guide. Alternative II

is in between. No alternative providing higher ranges is shown on the

thought that would be inconsistent under existing economic circumstances-



particularly so in the market's view--with the Committee's intention to

continue making progress toward reasonable price stability.

I II III

M1 4 to 8 4 to 7-1/2 3-1/2 to 7-1/2 (or 4 to 7)

M2 6 to 9 6 to 8-1/2 5-1/2 to 8-1/2

M3 6 to 9 6 to 9 5-1/2 to 8-1/2

Debt 8 to 11 8 to 11 7-1/2 to 10-1/2

(10) How much, if any, reduction in growth of the aggregates

the Committee might wish to consider for 1985 depends in part on assessment

of the trend in velocity. It also depends on the desirability of a more or

less gradual strategy of monetary growth rate reductions given price

pressures, the need to sustain the economic expansion, and implications of

various strategies for overall financial and economic stability.

(11) With regard to the underlying trend in the velocity of M1,

that cannot be known with any real certainty, given the relative recentness

of institutional changes affecting that aggregate. The trend since the

Second World War after taking out the effect of the rise of interest rates

over that period appears to be around 2 percent. The most probable outcome

under current circumstances would seem to be under 2 percent, as the intro-

duction of interest-bearing checkable accounts may well have increased the

income elasticity of demand for M1 by making transactions accounts more

attractive as savings instruments and also may have worked to reduce the

pace of technological innovation in money substitutes. With regard to the

trend velocity of M2, our best estimate continues to be around zero, al-

though M2 velocity has proven to be quite variable. At the beginning of

1985, the minimum denomination on MMDAs and super-NOW accounts will fall

from $2,500 to $1,000. We have assumed that this change will have only a

minimal impact on M1 and M2.



(12) At this point monetary policy is expected to confront

greater upward price pressures next year than this, as we go into the third

year of economic expansion with relatively limited excess labor and plant

capacity and assuming a drop in the dollar on exchange markets. If, as

currently projected by the staff, price increases next year are on the

order of 5 to 5-1/2 percent while economic growth decelerates to a pace

more consistent with its potential, it seems probable that a slowing in M1

growth in 1985 to the area of 5-1/2 to 6 percent-as assumed for the GNP

projection and consistent with alternatives II or III--might generate

a little further upward pressure on short-term interest rates. In 1985, we

would anticipate M1 velocity growth of 2 to 2-1/2 percent associated with

the projected GNP increase of around 8 percent. The increases in velocity

of M1 over the third year of four previous expansions that have lasted at

least that long have averaged in the neighborhood of 4 percent, but they

have generally been accompanied by rather sizable interest rate increases

and occurred in an era when the underlying velocity trend was probably

higher than can now be expected. Maintenance of an M1 range of 4 to 8

percent as in alternative I--and with actual M1 growth expected to remain

above the midpoint-might involve no further upward interest rate pressures

next year.

(13) The growth of debt is expected to moderate noticeably next

year, on the assumption of reduced merger activity and in view of the

impact on credit demands of the projected 2-1/4 percentage point slowing

in growth of nominal GNP. As demands taper off, credit at banks and thrifts

also is projected to grow more slowly, accompanied by more moderate M3

expansion. However, with both debt and M3 running above their ranges this

year, even a substantial slowing may not allow scope for more than the

one-half percent reduction in ranges suggested under alternative III, and



-9-

growth would be expected near the upper ends of these ranges. Under

alternative II the current ranges for both credit and M3 are suggested to

be retained, although this would of course represent a reduction if the

Committee chose to adjust upward the existing 1984 range.



-10-

Short-run alternatives

(15) Shown below are three possible approaches to policy

implementation for the period immediately ahead. Specifications for

the monetary aggregates are presented for the June-to-September period,

along with proposed federal funds rate ranges. (More detailed material

can be found on the charts and table on the following pages.)

M3 9-1/2 9-1/4 9

Federal funds
rate range 7-1/2 to 11-1/2 8 to 12 8-1/2 to 12-1/2

(16) All of the alternatives call for deceleration in growth

of M1 and M3 over the next three months from their March-to-June pace;

however, on a quarterly average basis growth in M1 would be stronger in

the third than the second quarter because of the carryover effect on the

averages of the rapid growth in money in the latter part of the second

quarter. For M1, a deceleration over the third-quarter months is

needed to keep long-run growth from the fourth quarter of 1983 base

from moving closer to the upper limit of the Committee's current 4 to 8

percent range. In the case of M3 the contemplated deceleration would

still leave that aggregate above its long-run range. In all cases, M2

remains at or a little below its midpoint.

(17) Alternative B--which underlies the staff's GNP projection-

contemplates a marked slowing in M1 growth to around a 5-1/2 percent

annual rate over the June-to-September period in the process of bringing

-12-

growth of that aggregate closer to the midpoint of its longer-run range

by the end of the year. Such June-to-September growth, distributed

fairly evenly over the quarter, would entail a 7-3/4 percent quarterly

average increase in M1. That growth in money may not involve much, if

any, further rise of interest rates over the summer, assuming nominal GNP

grows no faster than the 9-1/2 percent annual rate currently projected

for the third quarter and given the rise of interest rates that has already

taken place.

(18) The deceleration of M1 growth under alternative B is

not expected to be accompanied by any significant slowing of M2 from its

rate of growth of the previous three months. Growth of the latter

aggregate is likely to be sustained, given the projected reasonably

strong growth in personal income and assuming little change in the

personal savings rate. Somewhat more rapid expansion in the nontrans-

actions component is expected, partly reflecting a lagged response of

the public to the increased rate attractiveness of time deposits and

MMDAs relative to demand deposits and regular NOW accounts. However,

expansion of M3 over the summer might well slow from its unusually

rapid second-quarter pace. Banks may have less need to issue CDs as

merger-related financing demands are reduced, and in any event the

recent tightening of markets and widening of yield spreads against

banks might encourage a somewhat less aggressive posture by banks in

credit markets. Even so, with the economy and underlying credit demands

expected to be fairly strong, M3 growth would probably be high relative

to its long-run range.

(19) Growth of domestic nonfinancial debt is expected to

decelerate moderately in the months ahead, but credit demands seem likely



-13-

to be strong enough to generate growth at around an 11-1/2 percent

annual rate pace over the third quarter, with only a small further falling

off in prospect later in the year. Although the pace of borrowing by

businesses is expected to slow, this reduction reflects only the assumed

abatement of merger activity. Underlying demands for funds by business

are expected to strengthen in the third quarter as the financing gap

(the excess of capital spending over internal funds) widens, and to be

even stronger in the fourth quarter. Federal government credit demands

are expected to moderate slightly between the second and third quarters,

but to remain relatively large over the balance of the year. The more

fundamental slowing in credit growth in prospect is in the household

sector and depends on a weakening in spending for homes and durables.

(20) Expansion in the aggregates as specified in alternative B

would probably entail growth of nonborrowed reserves at about an 8 percent

annual rate from June to September, with borrowing continuing to average

around $1 billion. If recent experience is any guide, the federal funds

rate would probably average in the 11 to 11-1/4 percent area. However,

should investors gain more confidence in banks, and should bank attitudes

toward reserve management and the discount window become less cautious, the

funds rate could well trade consistently below 11 percent for S1 billion

in borrowing. If that occurred, it might entail greater expansion over

time in nonborrowed reserves--as banks more willingly lend and add to

deposits-and hence more money growth than assumed for this alternative.

(21) Interest rates generally might show little net change

under alternative B, though probably edging higher from the most recent

levels if funds traded consistently around 11-1/4 percent. Speculation

about a discount rate increase could become more widespread in markets,



-14-

and this could itself add to upward pressures, at least temporarily, on

federal funds and other rates. The dollar may well remain generally firm

on exchange markets.

(22) The degree of tightness in bank reserve positions under

this alternative would also work to restrain money and credit growth later

in the year. Thus, alternative B may be consistent with growth in M1 over

the year 1984 in the area of 6-1/2 percent with only a little further

upward movement of interest rates. Growth of M3 and credit for the year

would probably be somewhat above the upper limits of their current longer-

run ranges, though expanding somewhat more slowly in the second half than

in the first half of the year. Growth of M2 would be expected to be

around the midpoint of its long-run range.

(23) Alternative A involves a policy approach that keeps M1

growth nearer the upper end of its longer-run range. The 7 percent

annual growth rate for this aggregate from June to September would bring

growth from QIV '83 to September to just under 7-1/2 percent. Such money

growth, when translated to a quarterly average basis for the third

quarter, implies only a small rise in the income velocity of M1 over

the months ahead and is probably consistent with some drop in money

market rates from recent levels under existing circumstances, particularly

considering the lingering restraining effects on money demand of the

rise of interest rates over recent months. Nonborrowed reserves are

likely to expand at a 14 percent annual rate under this alternative,

with borrowing about $750 million. Borrowing in that area might involve

a federal funds rate of around 10-1/2 percent-unless the recent relative

reluctance of banks to borrow from the discount window abates, in which

case the funds rate could be lower for such a level of borrowing.



-15-

(24) Such reserve and money market conditions appear to be

on the easy side of current market expectations. Should they be sustained,

bond prices might be expected to rise, assuming the economy does not

unexpectedly strengthen, no major disappointments occur with respect to

the budget, and M1 does not grow much faster than specified. The

3-month Treasury bill rate may drop about 25 basis points to around

9-3/4 percent; private short-term rates, particularly for CDs, may

decline by more in such a market atmosphere. Whether these rate levels

would be sustainable or reversed later in the year or in 1985, depends

in part on the likelihood that the rate declines themselves help generate

a strengthening of money and credit growth inconsistent with the Commit-

tee's long-run objectives. A reversal of the rate declines and a

further rise seems most likely, given the projected overall strength of

money and credit demands, if such objectives encompass M1 growth in

1984 and 1985 in the 6-1/2 and 6 percent areas, respectively.

(25) Alternative C contemplates a very considerable decelera-

tion in M1 growth-as more consistent with growth around the midpoint

of its longer-run range over the year as a whole-and greater restraint

on growth of the broader money and credit aggregates. The 4 percent annual

rate of growth in M1 from June to September would bring expansion of this

aggregate from QIV '83 to September to 6-1/2 percent at an annual rate.

Growth at a 3-1/4 percent annual rate from September to December would

be needed to hit 6 percent for the year as a whole.

(26) Such a deceleration of money growth over the next three

months would probably require a sharp slowing of nonborrowed reserve

growth to a one percent annual rate, assuming a rise in borrowing to

$1-1/4 to $1-1/2 billion. The federal funds rate would probably rise to



-16-

around 12 percent, and other rates would adjust sharply upwards. Quality

rate spreads-such as between bills and CDs, or high grade industrial

and bank holding company commercial paper--would probably widen. Large

banks may be viewed as coming under even more pressure because of

increasing difficulties many borrowers would have in meeting higher

debt service payments. In addition, thrift institutions-which still

have a sizable portion of their portfolio in fixed-rate mortgages--would

be moving into a negative earnings position. The dollar may rise

further on exchange markets, but this could prove to be temporary

should the market come to the view that the financial system is coming

under excessive strain.

Directive language

(27) Given below is draft directive language related to the

Committee's decisions on the longer-run ranges (draft language for the

operating paragraph is shown in paragraph (28)). Suggested deletions

from the current directive are shown in strike-through form with pro-

posed additions in caps and certain alternatives bracketed. Deletion of

the two full sentences concerning M1 is suggested on the ground that

behavior of that aggregate over recent quarters has been somewhat more

"normal" in relation to GNP and other economic variables. The consider-

able uncertainties that still remain in interpreting M1 and the other

aggregates, given ongoing adaptation to institutional changes by banks

and the public and the potential for financial market disturbances,

appear to be clearly encompassed by the language of the second paragraph

below.

The Federal Open Market Committee seeks to foster mone-

tary and financial conditions that will help to reduce inflation

further, promote growth in output on a sustainable basis, and

contribute to an improved pattern of international transactions.

IN FURTHERANCE OF THESE OBJECTIVES the Committee AGREED AT THIS

MEETING TO REAFFIRM THE RANGES FOR MONETARY GROWTH THAT IT HAD

ESTABLISHED IN JANUARY: [DEL: established growth ranges for the

broader aggregates of] 4 TO 8 PERCENT FOR M1 AND 6 to 9 percent

for both M2 and M3 for the period from the fourth quarter of

1983 to the fourth quarter of 1984. /WITH REGARD TO ______,

THE COMMITTEE CHANGED THE RANGE(S) FOR 1984 TO ___________.



-18-

[DEL: The Committee also considered that a range of 4 to 8 percent

for M1 would be appropriate for the same period, taking account

of the possibility that, in the light of changed competition

of M1, its relationship to GNP over time may be shifting. Pend-

ing further experience, growth int hat aggregate will need to be

interposed in the light of of the growth in the other monetary

aggregates, which for the time being would continue to receive

substantial weight.] The associated range for total domestic

nonfinancial debt was ALSO REAFFIRMED [DEL: set] at (RAISED TO) 8 to

11 (____ TO ____) percent for the year 1984. FOR 1985 THE COMMITTEE

AGREED ON TENTATIVE RANGES OF MONETARY GROWTH, MEASURED FROM THE

FOURTH QUARTER OF 1984 TO THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 1985, OF ____ TO

____ PERCENT FOR M1, ____ TO ____ PERCENT FOR M2, AND ____ TO ____

PERCENT FOR M3. THE ASSOCIATED RANGE FOR NONFINANCIAL DEBT WAS

SET AT ____ TO ____ PERCENT.

The Committee understood that policy implementation would

require continuing appraisal of the relationships not only among

the various measures of money and credit but also between those

aggregates and nominal GNP, including evaluation of conditions in

domestic credit and foreign exchange markets.

(28) Given below is suggested language for the operating

paragraph of the directive. The specifications adopted at the meeting

on May 22 are shown in strike-through form.

In the short run, the Committee seeks to DECREASE SLIGHTLY

(ALT. A)/ maintain (ALT. B)/INCREASE SLIGHTLY (ALT. C) existing

pressures on bank reserve positions. This ACTION is expected to

be consistent with growth in M1, M2, and M3 at annual rates of

around [DEL: 6-1/2, 8 and 10] ____, ____, AND ____ percent, respectively,

during the period from [DEL: March to] June TO SEPTEMBER. Somewhat

greater reserve restraint might be acceptable in the event of

more substantial growth of the monetary aggregates, while some-

what lesser restraint might be acceptable if growth of the

monetary aggregates slowed significantly. In either case, such

a change would be considered only in the context of appraisals

of the continuing strength of the business expansion, inflation-

ary pressures, financial market conditions, and the rate of

credit growth. The Chairman may call for Committee consultation

if it appears to the Manager for Domestic Operations that pur-

suit of the monetary objectives and related reserve paths dur-

ing the period before the next meeting is likely to be associated

with a federal funds rate persistently outside a range of [DEL: 7-1/2

to 11-1/2] ____ TO ____ percent.
