MONETARY AGGREGATES AND
MONEY MARKET CONDITIONS

Recent developments

(1) RPD and the money supply aggregates all appear to be growing

at slower than expected annual rates during the January-February target

period--well below the upper limits of the Committee's ranges of

tollerance--as shown in the table below;

rate 5-3/4--6-3/8 6.21 .(week ending 2/7)

(2) The narrowly defined money supply showed no growth on

average in January, partly reflecting a drop in State and local

government deposits following a contra-seasonal rise in December when

revenue sharing payments first began. It does not appear that dollar

outflows abroad had much effect on recent M1 behavior. Large outflows

began only in early February, and the fragmentary data available for



the first week of that month give no evidence of sizable shifts directly

out of cash into foreign assets. When the erratic December-January move-

ments in Mh are averaged together, they show an annual growth rate for

the two months combined of about 6-1/2 per cent, about the same as the

average rate for the past six months.

(3) In the discussion at the last Committee meeting, it

was noted that the upper limits of the ranges of tolerance adopted for

growth rates in RPD and monetary aggregates were below those most likely

to be associated with the then prevailing Federal funds rate of 5-5/8--

5-3/4 per cent. In addition, the Committee recognized that any Desk

action to slow growth in the aggregates would need to take place in the

early part of the inter-meeting period, so that resulting upward adjust-

ments in short-term rates would be largely completed before the

January 31 announcement of terms on the Treasury refinancing. Finally,

the Committee indicated a willingness to tolerate substantially slower

expansion in RPD and the monetary aggregates if growth rates at given

interest levels fell short of expectations. Given these guidelines, the

Desk acted early in the inter-meeting period to tighten up on the pro-

vision of reserves through open market operations.

(4) The tightening effects of Desk action were quickly

reflected in the Federal funds rate which advanced to a little over 6

per cent in the statement week immediately following the meeting, and

then into a 6-1/4--6-3/8 per cent range over the two succeeding weeks.

After the start of the "even-keel" period, Desk reserve strategy was to



achieve relative stability in money market conditions, with the Federal

funds rate continuing to range generally between 6-1/4 and 6-3/8 per

cent. Since the last meeting of the Committee, member bank borrowings

have averaged about $1,2 billion.

(5) The terms of the Treasury refinancing were initially

well received, but between the announcement date and opening of books

the market atmosphere surrounding the operation deteriorated. This

seems to have been due partly to an initial assumption by market parti-

cipants that the Federal funds rate and dealer financing costs would

stabilize during the "even-keel" period at levels below those which

actually developed. Also, with the dollar under attack in foreign ex-

change markets, and rumors of a general rise in the bank prime rate,

market expectations of future interest rate advances strengthened signif-

icantly (apart from expectation of a temporary decline in the bill rate

as a result of foreign official demand for bills). Attrition in the

rights exchange for new 3-1/2 year notes amounted to just under 50 per

cent of public holdings of maturing issues. And in the cash auction,

market professionals received an unexpectedly large 70 per cent of the

new 6-3/4 year note. Most recently, the tone of the Treasury coupon

market has improved and the new issues have risen in price.

(6) The Treasury bill market has been greatly strengthened

by the heavy speculative outflows of dollars. Foreign central banks

receiving dollars have made, or are about to make, sizable acquisitions



-4-

of Treasury debt, partly in the bill market but mainly from the Treasury

in the form of special non-marketable certificates. In fact, foreign

purchases of special Treasury certificates appear large enough to cover

all of the Treasury's prospective March need for cash. This abrupt turn-

around in the bill market outlook has been strongly reflected in bill yields.

For example, the rate on 3-month bills, which had earlier reached a high

around 5-3/4 per cent--some 50 basis points above the level prevailing at

the last meeting--has most recently retraced most of this advance and is

currently trading around 5.45 per cent.

(7) Rates on other short-term market instruments have shown

only little tendency to decline with the down-turn in bill yields.

Advances in such markets since the last meeting generally range to about

40 basis points. In capital markets,'however, demands for funds

have remained on the moderate side since the last meeting, and increases

in yields have been limiteo in most cases to about 15 basis points. The

roll-back of the prime rate increase at three banks in response to CID

inquiries, and the abandonment of its rate formula:by the last of the

"floating" banks, helped to moderate upward rate pressures in these

markets.

(8) The table on the following page compares recent changes

in money and credit aggregates (seasonally adjusted annual raues) with

those for selected earlier periods.

Prospective developments

(9) Transaction demands for money will be expanding in the

first half of 1973, given the projected rise in nominal GNP of almost

11 per cent. However, the recent sharp further advance of short-term

market interest rates will likely be acting to retard demand for money

between now and mid-year. Thus, the financial relationships tabulated

in the next paragraph for Committee consideration suggest that the longer-

run target path that encompasses a 5--6 per cent annual rate of growth for

ML might be attained with little change from current money market conditions

(alternative B). Moving down into a 4--5 per cent growth rate range for M1

would likely involve a tightening of the money market over the next few

weeks (alternative C), and moving up to a 6--7 per cent rate would probably

entail an easing (alternative A).

(10) The three alternatives are presented below in summary

form (with figures for aggregates representing seasonally adjusted annual

rates of growth). More detailed monthly and quarterly figures are shoan

(11) The Federal funds rate range shown for alternative B

represents a range around the prevailing 6-1/4--6-3/8 per cent. The

range for alternative C is meant to indicate, however, that the staff

would expect the funds rate to move up from prevailing levels to close

to the top of the range shown between now and the next Committee meeting,

as reserve growth is constrained. Consequently, in alternative A, a movement

of the funds rate down through the range shown would be anticipated.

(12) Growth in H1 in February-March is shown at a 7--9 per

cent annual rate in alternative B and at close to those rates in the other

alternatives. These growth rates are more rapid than the longer-run

targets. Given prevailing interest rates, money balances are expected

to pick up temporarily in February and March partly because of larger

than normal payments of tax refunds. With the bulge in Ml growth in the

period ahead, and taking account of the January weakness, expansion in the

first quarter would be around 5--6 per cent. In the second quarter, as

the refunds are phased out, continuation of an M1 growth rate in this range

seems likely at around current money market conditions, given the restrictive

effect on money demand still being exerted by relatively high interest rates,

(13) At the moment the 3-month bill is moving well below its

normal relationship to other market rates because of foreign official demand

for Treasury securities generated by large dollar outflow -Given the

prevailing Federal funds ra-e range, the 3-month Treasury 'zll rate would

be likely to move back to around 5-3/4 per cent as and when market purchases

by foreign official institutions come to an end. A bill rate around 5-3/4

per cent would still be low relative to the funds rate, reflecting the



concentration of demand in the Treasury area resulting from the inter-

national flows. The dollar outflows, while difficult to trace as to their

source, probably came out of investments in domestic securities generally

or bank loan proceeds, but there may also have been some temporary drawdown

of existing cash balances. To the extent there is smaller volume of funds

seeking investment in private short-term markets, short-term rates in

those markets may continue under some upward pressures, particularly as

further strong business loan demands on banks lead to aggressive bidding

for CD funds.

(14) Between now and the next Committee meeting, it is possible

that the Treasury may not have to raise any net new cash, assuming they

sell about $4-1/2 billion of special non-marketable securities to foreign

official recipients of the recent dollar outflow. The mid-February

refunding will be in the process of distribution during the period, but

even-keel considerations should be minimal since the settlement date is

on February 15, shortly after the Committee meeting. If the recent

improved market atmosphere continues, distribution of the long note may be

readily accomplished.

(15) A tightening of the money market, such as might accompany

alternative C, would probably lead to substantial upward adjustments in

both short- and long-term interest rates. Under these circumstances the

viability of the current discount rate and of CID efforts to defer

increases in the prime loan rate would come more clearly into question.

And there could be some acceleration of capital market borrowing, as



-10-

corporations attempted to safeguard themselves against higher rates later

or more stringent institutional borrowing conditions. Mortgage market

conditions would also tend to tighten as interest rates reached the zone

where a significant diversion of savings flows from banks and other

savings institutions became increasingly probable.

(16) The analysis of the preceding paragraphs has assumed that

the dollar exchange crisis will soon abate. However, should it continue,

or intensify, there is the possibility that domestic psychology would be

affected as investors and businesses become increasingly uncertain about

how monetary policy will be adjusted and as to the nature of possible

changes in trade restrictions and exchange rate structure. Under those

circumstances a sizable increase in domestic demands for liquidity, in-

cluding possible cash balances, could develop on precautionary grounds.

Depending on the particular problems at the time, policy may wish to

consider accommodating such an increased precautionary demand rather than

permitting the sharp rise in the Federal funds rate that could develop if

the reserves necessary to support enlarged liquidity demands were not

being supplied.



-11-

Proposed directive

(17) Presented below are three alternative formulations for

the operational paragraph of the directive, which might be taken to

correspond to the similarly lettered policy alternatives discussed in

the preceding section. In all three alternatives, it is proposed to

delete the reference to Treasury financing because the current financ-

ing will be substantially completed by the date of the Committee's

meeting. Retention of the reference to credit market developments is

proposed only for alternative C, the only alternative that contemplates

a significant tightening of the money market. A reference to inter-

national developments is suggested for the three alternatives because

of the possibility that exchange market speculation, if continued,

could have disturbing effects on market psychology generally, alter

cash and liquidity demands, and/or distort the interest rate structure.

Alternative A

To implement this policy, while taking account of

the- ortheeing-Treasry-f e g-and-pessibe-eredit-m ske

INTERNATIONAL developments, the Committee seeks to achieve

bank reserve and money market conditions that will support

ssteve growth in monetary aggregates over the months ahead
