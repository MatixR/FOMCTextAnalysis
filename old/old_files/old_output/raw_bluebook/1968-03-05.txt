MONEY MARKET AND RESERVE RELATIONSHIPS

Recent developments

The bank credit proxy rose on average in February at a 10 per

cent annual rate, at the upper end of the range projected in the pre-

vious blue book. Most of the strengthening became evident in the

latter part of the month, as banks experienced a sharp expansion in

security loans and also held on to a relatively large proportion of the

new 15-month note issued for cash by the Treasury (payable through full

crediting to tax and loan accounts).

In view of the rise in bank credit, open market operations

became more restraining to the extent permitted by the progress of the

Treasury financing, and banks were induced to increase borrowings from

the Federal Reserve to obtain reserves required by deposit expansion.

As a result, the net reserve position of member banks moved from average

free reserves of $120 million in the first two statement weeks in

February to average net borrowed reserves of $93 million in the last

two statement weeks. Between those periods, average borrowings in-

creased from $312 million to $424 million.

With the reserve position of banks under increasing pressure,

Federal funds traded around 4¾ per cent, and not infrequently at 4-7/8

per cent. Rates on such short-term instruments as Treasury bills,

bankers' acceptances, and Agency issues generally have moved slightly

higher than they were before the last Committee meeting, with the

March 1, 1968.

3-month bill rate rising about 10 basis points to around 5 per

cent.
short-term

These / yield increases were relatively small partly

because business loan demands were not especially strong, so that banks

were under little pressure to compete actively in the short-term market

through issuance of negotiable CD's. In addition, major reporting

banks continued to run only a relatively small basic reserve deficit--

one considerably less deep than a year ago--as they remained cautious

in managing their money positions and as Euro-dollar funds continued

generally available at relatively favorable rates. Moreover, with the

wider spread of the Federal funds rate over the discount rate in

February as compared with January, some banks preferred to use the

discount window to help finance their basic reserve deficits. In

consequence, dealer new loan rates in New York have thus far changed

little from the 5 -- 5-1/8 per cent range reached in early February;

and, with financing outside New York fairly readily available, there

has not been much additional pressure from financing costs on dealers'

still-large inventories of bills, not to mention their moderate-sized

holdings of notes and bonds.

Dealers did not acquire an exceptionally large position in

either the 5¾ per cent 7-year note issued in the mid-February re-

financing or the 5-5/8 per cent 15-month note issued in the February 21 cash

financing. In the case of the longer note, this was partly because

the volume acquired in exchange was on the conservative side; in the

March 1, 1968.



CONFIDENTIAL (FR)

case of the shorter note, it was partly because banks have been quite

willing to hold on to their acquisitions as an investment. Since the

new issues have held up very well in price, dealers have been under

little compulsion to effect sharp reductions in their holdings. Their

positions in securities maturing in more than one year were $407 million

on February 29, down only about $100 million from peak holdings during

the month.

With short-term interest rates rising only moderately, bank

time deposits rose, on average, in February at a 9 per cent annual

rate--at the upper end of the range of expectations--following a small

decline in January on average. Most of the rise was in consumer-type

deposits. As noted above, major banks showed little inclination to

solicit funds aggressively through CD's. Toward the end of the period,

however, an uptick of bank interest appeared, perhaps representing the

beginning of preparation for the March and April tax periods.

Money supply growth in February was relatively small, at an

annual rate of about 2½ per cent. This represented a substantial

reduction from the January rate of growth, consistent with staff

expectations. Growth in private demand deposits in February was

somewhat above anticipations, however, partly offsetting a smaller

than projected rise in U.S. Government deposits.

Over the period since the shift in policy late last fall, key

monetary variables have shown annual rates of increase as shown below,

in comparison with increases over the preceding seven months of relatively

stable money market conditions.

Prospective developments

Relationships among money market and monetary variables with

no policy shift. Given prevailing money market conditions, the bank

credit proxy is likely to show a smaller annual rate of increase in

March than in February--perhaps in a 5 to 7 per cent range, and the

figure would be this large only because of the carry-over effect in

the monthly average comparison of the sharp late February credit

expansion associated with the $4 billion Treasury cash financing. From

the end of February to the end of March, the proxy is likely to show

little growth.

Prevailing money market conditions might be taken to include

a net borrowed reserve position for banks in a zero to $150 million

range, member bank borrowings generally in a $350 - $450 million range,
the

Federal funds most frequently trading in/ 4-3/4 -- 4-7/8 per cent area,

and new dealer loan rates in New York around 5 -- 5-1/8 per cent. The



CONFIDENTIAL (FR) -5- March 1, 1968.

3-month bill rate is likely to remain in a 4-7/8 -- 5-1/4 per cent

range. The rate could be near the lower end of the range because of

seasonal downward pressures stemming in part from anticipation of re-

investment demand from maturing March and April tax bills. An offset

to such seasonal forces could develop if rising Federal expenditures

lead the market to anticipate sizable Federal Government new cash needs

during the months immediately ahead, or if the persistence of net

borrowed reserve figures alters market attitudes further. Some

upward pressure could also develop out of the cumulative impact of the

current $100 million additions to the weekly bill auctions.

The slower rate of growth anticipated for the bank credit

proxy in March reflects mainly the absence of sizable Treasury cash

financings, such as there were in January and February. And an even

more moderate growth rate is in prospect for April unless the Treasury

accelerates its financing schedule or unless business loan demand

strengthens considerably further. Banks have responded to the gradual

tightening of policy since late fall mainly through reducing the rate

of acquisitions of state and local government issues, and, at times,

by selling Treasury bills rather than bidding aggressively for CD

money.

In part, bank reluctance to compete for high-cost funds

reflects the still relatively moderate pace of business loan demand.

Growth in outstanding business loans at banks thus far in 1968 appears

to have been somewhat faster than in late summer and early fall of

1967, though well below the unusually rapid December rate. Reports



CONFIDENTIAL (FR) -6- March 1, 1968.

of a build-up in loan commitments, and continued inventory expansion,

suggest that such loans could grow at a faster pace in coming months.

However, corporate income tax payments in March and April, though

sizable, are not expected to be quite as large as in the spring of

last year.

Unless business loan demands strengthen considerably further,

or unless expectations of an even tighter monetary policy became more

widespread, it is not expected that banks will be highly aggressive in

the CD market--though probably evincing more interest than in recent

weeks in view of the large maturities in prospect with the approach

of the March and April tax periods. A maximum likelihood estimate

of the change in outstanding CD's in March would be for a small

decline of $200 - $300 million, or about in line with seasonal

expectations.

With such CD developments, and consumer-type time deposits

growing at near their February rate, the total of time and savings

deposits in March is expected to rise in a 9 - 11 per cent range.

Private demand deposits are expected to rise further in March, largely

reflecting a decline during the month in U.S. Government deposits.

The money supply may increase in a range of 4 - 6 per cent, annual

rate. With a somewhat slower rate of growth projected for bank credit

and total bank deposits, and with the bulk of deposit expansion in the

form of time deposits, total member bank reserves in March are likely

to rise in a range of 2 - 5 per cent, annual rate, well below the

February pace.



CONFIDENTIAL (FR)

Long-term rates may change little from current levels in

the weeks immediately ahead, though some updrift is possible. Municipal

yields have already adjusted substantially upwards in light of the

reduced bank interest and the large calendar of new issues, and could

come under further upward pressure from a surge of industrial revenue

bond issues; however, any further rise in municipal yields could be

moderated by postponements of prospective new issues. Market

participants have not yet begun to focus on the possible magnitude

of remaining Treasury cash needs, which may be financed in part through

PC issues. In the corporate market, the calendar appears relatively

light. Interest rates would be most likely to rise if the market

sensed a renewed upsurge in defense spending--and one not likely to

be offset by a tax increase--a further tightening in monetary policy,

and re-appearance of anticipatory borrowings at banks and in the

security market.

Further restraint through open market operations. If the

Committee wishes to add further to pressure on bank reserve positions

and the money market, it may want to consider conditions including

net borrowed reserves in a $100 - $250 million range and member bank

borrowings generally in a $450 - $550 million range. Federal funds would

be likely to trade most frequently around 5 per cent, although bank

preferences for meeting reserve needs through the discount window could

tend to moderate upward pressures on the funds rate. Along with an

associated rise in dealer new loan rates to around 5¼ - 5 per cent,

March 1, 1968.



CONFIDENTIAL (FR)

the 3-month bill rate may move into a 5-1/8 -- 5-3/8 per cent range--

moving more toward the upper end if expectations of a discount rate

increase became more prevalent.

Such a tightening of money market conditions may have

relatively little effect on bank credit and deposit expansion in March,

although the additional restraint would force banks to rely more on

borrowed reserves in meeting their reserve requirements. It is

possible that the most immediate effect of the tightening would be a

sharp burst of bank interest in expanding outstanding CD's to secure

funds in advance of large maturities in the weeks ahead. But in so

doing, banks would place further upward pressures on market interest

rates, and their capacity to continue acquiring new CD funds, except

in the very shortest maturities, would quickly become severely

constrained.

Apart from any temporary spurt, bank credit growth is likely

to moderate further in the wake of the tighter policy posture, as

higher market interest rates lead to a further slowdown in time deposit

growth following the spring quarterly interest-crediting period--as

would also be true for deposit accounts in thrift institutions. With

the cumulative effect of the further tightening action coinciding with

an expected lull in major Treasury cash financing demands, bank credit

and deposit expansion in April would probably be quite small. And as

banks become even less willing buyers of U.S. Government and municipal

securities, and perhaps reappraise their over-all lending policies,

upward pressures on long-term interest rates would become more marked.
