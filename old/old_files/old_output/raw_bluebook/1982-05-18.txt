Prefatory Note 

 
 

The attached document represents the most complete and accurate version 
available based on original copies culled from the files of the FOMC Secretariat at the 
Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System.  This electronic document was 
created through a comprehensive digitization process which included identifying the best-
preserved paper copies, scanning those copies,1 and then making the scanned versions 
text-searchable.2  Though a stringent quality assurance process was employed, some 
imperfections may remain. 
 

Please note that this document may contain occasional gaps in the text.  These 
gaps are the result of a redaction process that removed information obtained on a 
confidential basis.  All redacted passages are exempt from disclosure under applicable 
provisions of the Freedom of Information Act.    

 

                                                 
1 In some cases, original copies needed to be photocopied before being scanned into electronic format.  All 
scanned images were deskewed (to remove the effects of printer- and scanner-introduced tilting) and lightly 
cleaned (to remove dark spots caused by staple holes, hole punches, and other blemishes caused after initial 
printing). 
2 A two-step process was used.  An advanced optimal character recognition computer program (OCR) first 
created electronic text from the document image.  Where the OCR results were inconclusive, staff checked 
and corrected the text as necessary.   Please note that the numbers and text in charts and tables were not 
reliably recognized by the OCR process and were not checked or corrected by staff.

MONETARY POLICY ALTERNATIVES

Recent developments

(1) M1 growth in April on average was at a relatively sub-

stantial 11¾ percent annual rate, but weakness in late April and early

May brought the level of this aggregate below the path consistent with

the Committee's 3 percent (annual rate) growth objective for the March

to June period. The NOW account component of M1 declined in late April,

mainly reflecting collection of mid-April tax payments, and has shown

little net change thus far in May. Given its recent weakness, M1 has

moved down somewhat more rapidly than targeted toward the upper end of

the FOMC's longer-run range.

(2) M2 has been running close to the FOMC's March-to-June

path in April and early May as variations in its M1 component have been

about offset by compensating changes in its nontransactions component.

Thus, it is approaching the long-run path about as planned.

(3) Bank credit growth in April continued at an 8¾ percent

annual rate, as lending to businesses slowed somewhat further while

acquisitions of Treasury securities picked up. Virtually all of the

business loan expansion last month was at large banks; data for early

May suggest a strengthening of loan growth at such banks. Business

borrowing from other sources also has moderated in April, with issuance

of commercial paper slowing substantially and offerings of new stocks

and bonds remaining sluggish.

3/ Nonborrowed reserves include special borrowing and other extended credit from the

4/ Includes seasonal borrowing.



(4) Total reserves expanded at a modest 2-3/4 percent seasonally

1/
adjusted annual rate in April.- Virtually all of the increase in total re-

serves was provided through the discount window. As M1 accelerated above

target levels in the first part of April, the demand for total reserves

rose, and adjustment (including seasonal) borrowing increased above the

2/
$1,150 million level assumed for initial construction of the reserve paths.

During the first four weeks of the intermeeting period such borrowing

averaged about $1,330 million. However, with the monetary aggregates

beginning to weaken in late April, the demand for reserves has dropped,

and banks most recently have borrowed close to $1 billion from the discount

window on average.

(5) The recent easing in bank reserve positions was not immediately

reflected in a corresponding drop of the funds rate. Until today's drop into

the 14¼ to 14 percent area, the funds rate had been trading around 15¾ per-

cent on average in the first part of May, little different from its trading

area at the time of the last meeting. Other short-term rates, however,

tended to decline somewhat through the intermeeting period as market parti-

cipants assumed the funds rate would drop in the future with an expected re-

versal in the April bulge in money growth, especially in view of indications of

continuing weak economic performance. Short-term interest rates have fallen

by ½ to 1¼ percentage points since the March FOMC meeting, and long-term

rates have declined similarly. It is doubtful that recent developments in

the Congress on the budget, in view of the general uncertainties surrounding

1/ The substantial differential between the rates of growth in total re-
serves and M1 in April reflects the impact of lagged reserve accounting,
a reduction in the average reserve ratio on transactions accounts, and
also a drop in excess reserves.

the process, have had an appreciable effect on recent market rate

movements.

(6) After rising further following the last FOMC meeting, the

dollar declined sharply in the exchange markets, mainly reflecting some

easing of U.S. interest rates and a belief in foreign exchange markets

that U.S. interest rates would recede further. Over the entire period

since the FOMC meeting, the dollar is off about 4 percent on a weighted

average basis.



Alternative near-term targets

(7) The upper panel of the following table shows three alter-

native targets for M1 and M2 for the second quarter. The middle panel

indicates the implied two-month April-to-June targets for each alternative,

given the April growth rates that have already occurred, and the last

row of the table shows associated intermeeting federal funds rate ranges.

More detailed and longer-run data for the alternatives are shown in the

table and charts on the following pages, and the quarterly interest rate

path underlying the staff's GNP projection for the balance of 1982 is

contained in Appendix II.

M2; the M1 target implies a contraction at about a 1 percent annual rate

in the remaining two months of the quarter, while M2 would expand at about

a 7 percent annual rate. By June, M1 would still be a bit above the

upper end of its long-run range, but M2 would be about at the upper

end of its range. Alternative A, calling for M1 growth from March to

June at a 4 percent rate, would be consistent with a slower approach

of both M1 and M2 toward the upper ends of their ranges. Alternative C

calls for more restrictive short-run targets than either A or B, and both

aggregates would be within their long-run ranges by June.

(9) Under alternative B, we would expect some further downward

drift in short-term rates between now and mid-year. The transactions

demand for money is expected to be more moderate than anticipated at the

time of the last meeting, with projected growth in nominal GNP in the

second quarter revised down to only a 6½ percent annual rate. In addi-

tion, we would anticipate the relatively strong precautionary demands

of early this year and late 1981 to begin to moderate as economic prospects

improve.

(10) The small decline in M1 over May and June called for by

alternative B would appear to be consistent with a 6 percent growth in

total reserves over the two months. With short-term interest rates

expected to decline--indexed by the federal funds rate drifting down to

the 13½ percent area--depository institutions might be expected to

borrow about $800 million at the current 12 percent discount rate. On

that assumption, nonborrowed reserves would expand by 14 percent at an

annual rate over the two months.

(11) The 3-month bill rate under this alternative is likely

to decline to around the 11½ to 12 percent area. Business credit demands

are expected to remain moderate, given the continued inventory liquidation

and a scaling down of fixed investment outlays. The prime rate under this



alternative would probably drop from its current 16 percent level. Reduced

private credit demands should leave room for the Treasury's remaining

financing needs over the quarter of $8 to $10 billion to be readily met

in short- and intermediate-term markets--the required maturity range

unless the Congress authorizes additional leeway for the Treasury to issue

bonds. Bond yields would probably decline further, with the extent of

decline depending in part on the fiscal outlook and in part on the extent

to which any short rate declines are viewed as reflecting the beginnings

of a longer-run trend toward lower rates as inflation abates. Declines in

U.S. short-term interest rates could extend the recent reduction in the

foreign exchange value of the dollar from its current relatively high

level.

(12) Alternative A, which calls for a 4 percent annual rate of

growth in M1 from March to June, probably would result in appreciable

interest rate reductions along the maturity spectrum. While relatively

little money growth is implied by this alternative in May and June on

average, money demands are expected to be quite weak over the balance of

the quarter, given the build-up in money balances through April. The

funds rate might move to a level somewhat above the current discount rate,

with borrowing dropping to around $500 million. Total reserves would

expand over May and June at about an 8 percent annual rate and nonborrowed

reserves at a 20 percent rate. Growth in M2 could be expected to be

somewhat higher than under alternative B, largely reflecting the stronger



growth in M1 and possibly greater interest in MMCs and MMMFs, both of

whose yields lag declines in market rates.

(13) The 3-month bill rate under alternative A would probably

drop below the current discount rate, and range around 11 percent. A

substantial bond market rally might well ensue, especially if it appeared

that Congress was in process of significantly reducing federal budget

deficits. A considerable depreciation of the dollar on exchange markets

might also take place, although this trend would be limited if foreign

monetary authorities took the opportunity to permit their interest rates

to decline further. Reduced deposit costs would diminish earnings

pressures over time on thrifts, work toward making them more willing

mortgage lenders, and contribute to further declines in mortgage rates.

(14) Alternative C, which calls for limiting M1 growth to a 1½

percent rate from March to June, implies an increase in total reserves

over the latter period at a 4 percent rate. Assuming adjustment borrowing

at around $1.1 billion, nonborrowed reserves would increase at only a

7½ percent rate over the last two months of the quarter. The federal

funds rate would probably be around the 14 to 14½ percent area, below

its range of recent weeks. Short- and long-term rates would likely show

little net change, since some easing in money market conditions has

probably been anticipated, and on balance the exchange rate would also

change little.



-10-

(15) The staff is projecting an appreciable expansion in GNP in

the second half of the year under the impetus of the mid-year tax cut and

an end to the current inventory liquidation. Underlying this projection

is the assumption that a marked acceleration of the growth of nominal GNP

to about a 9¼ percent annual rate can be financed by relatively modest

growth of narrow money--keeping Ml growth within the upper portion of its

longer-run range--without upward interest rate pressures in the second half.

Under alternative B, for example, growth in M1 in the second half of the

year of 3 to 4¾ percent, as shown in the table below, would be consistent

with growth for the year at the upper limit or just below. The implied

velocity expansion, with no rise of interest rates, depends not only

on increased willingness to draw on previously accumulated liquidity to

finance spending but also on a downward impact on money demand from the

continued spread of financial innovations, such as sweep accounts.

Alternative A would provide less room for growth of M1 in the second

half of the year, assuming the present longer-run target range is retained.

Alternative C, of course, provides the most scope for monetary expansion

in the second half, but has a slightly greater risk of delaying the onset

of economic recovery.

Directive language

(16) The Committee could simply reaffirm the directive adopted

at the previous meeting, since the behavior of the aggregates has not been

far off track and since many of the same problems of interpretation of

aggregate behavior remain. That directive is shown below. The language

would be most consistent with alternative B, although it also could be

adapted to alternatives A and C. If the Committee adopted alternative B,

it might wish to note that it has reaffirmed objectives adopted at the

last meeting (with possible language shown in brackets).

In the short run [,reaffirming its decision at the previous

meeting,] the Committee seeks behavior of reserve aggregates con-

sistent with growth of M1 and M2 from March to June at annual

rates of about [DEL: 3] ____ percent and [DEL: 8] ____ percent respectively. The

Committee also noted that deviations from these targets should be

evaluated in light of the probability that M2 would be less

affected over the period than M1 by deposit shifts related to the

tax date and by changes in the relative importance of NOW accounts

as a savings vehicle. Some shortfall in growth of M1, consistent

with progress toward the upper part of the range for the year as a

whole, would be acceptable in the context of appreciably reduced

pressures in the money market and relative strength of other

aggregates. The Chairman may call for Committee consultation if

it appears to the Manager for Domestic Operations that pursuit

of the monetary objectives and related reserve paths during the

period before the next meeting is likely to be associated with a

federal funds rate persistently outside a range of [DEL: 12 to 16]

____ TO ____ percent.

NOTE: Government securities dealer cash positions consist of securities already delivered, commit.
ments to buy (sell) securities on an outright basis for immediate delivery (5 business days or less), and
certain "when-issued" securities for delayed delivery (more than 5 business days). Futures and forward
positions include all other commitments involving delayed delivery; futures contracts are arranged on
organized exchanges. Underwriting syndicate positions consists of issues in syndicate, excluding
trading positions.

Weekly data are daily averages for statement weeks, except for corporate and municipal issues in
syndicate, which are Friday figures. Monthly averages for excess reserves and borrowing are weighted
averages of statement week figures. Monthly data for dealer futures and forwards are end-of-month
figures for 1980.
