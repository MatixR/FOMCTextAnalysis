CONFIDENTIAL (FR) 1969.

MONEY MARKET AND RESERVE RELATIONSHIPS

Recent Developments

(1) Since the last Committee meeting, most yields in money

and credit markets have moved markedly higher, with short-term rates

generally up 25 to 50 basis points. The yield increases reflected

the interaction of monetary policy moves, seasonal strains in short-

term markets here and abroad, and shifts in market attitudes. The

announcement of the discount rate increase, the accompanying tighter

open market posture, the maintenance of Regulation Q ceilings, and two

successive jumps in the prime loan rate all served to convince market

participants that credit expansion was likely to be curtailed.

(2) Under the circumstances, the 3-month Treasury bill rate

rose sharply to a peak of around 6.29 per cent on December 24. However,

bill market pressures subsequently moderated, and the 3-month bill closed

on January 10 at 6.11 per cent. In the past several days, there has

been sizable demand for bills from, among others, State and local

governments and corporations--including investors who are switching

funds out of CD's. The recent Treasury announcement of a $1-3/4 billion

June tax bill to be auctioned January 14 and paid January 20 through

100 per cent tax and loan credit was taken in stride by the market.

(3) The effective Federal funds rate fluctuated widely

since the last Committee meeting, reflecting in part money market

churning related to the aftermath of large mid-December tax payments

and to year-end window-dressing activities. In general, the Federal



-2-

funds rate was most frequently in a 6-1/4 - 6-5/8 per cent band,

although an effective rate of 6-7/8 per cent, with trading as high

as 7-1/8 per cent, was reported on the Friday preceding the year-end

statement date. New loan rates to dealers reported in New York have

largely followed the pattern of the Federal funds rate and have often

been in a 6-3/4 - 7 per cent range, although even higher rates have

been posted at times when reserve pressures have been particularly

severe.

(4) Member bank borrowings averaged about $815 million

during the most recent four statement weeks, compared with $515 million

in the preceding four weeks. The sharp rise in average borrowing over

the past four statement weeks includes the exceptionally high borrowing

levels in the week ending December 25 and particularly in the week

ending January 1. In the latter week borrowing reached a 16 year high

of $1.3 billion, influenced by year-end statement date maneuvering,

large CD run-offs at the end of the month, and a sharp mainly seasonal

drop in Euro-dollar availabilities. But much of the additional borrow-

ing was offset by large accumulations of excess reserves, and average

net borrowed reserves deepened by only around $90 million from the

preceding four week period to around $380 million.

(5) Given existing Regulation Q ceilings, banks have been

unable to avoid substantial attrition of maturing large denomination

CD's and there is also some evidence of diminished net inflows of

consumer-type time and savings deposits. Thus, a pronounced slowing in

bank credit expansion is developing. However, the bank credit proxy in

December still showed an average annual rate of expansion of around



-3-

13 per cent; about 1-1/2 points would be subtracted when allowance

is made for the reductions in the level of the banks' Euro-dollar borrowing.

Growth in the money supply and in time deposits took place at rates of

around 6 and 14-1/2 per cent, respectively, in December on average.

(6) The CD run-off in December as a whole now appears to

have been about $1.5 billion, or about $600 million more than seasonal.

The CD attrition in December and, from early signs, the further attrition

in January have been concentrated at large money market banks. But partial

data covering the interest-crediting period suggest more widespread

slackening in net inflows of consumer-type time and savings deposits.

(7) The following table summarizes the rates of change in

major reserve and deposit aggregates since late 1967. The recent policy

actions will begin to show most of their impact on the magnitudes in

data for January, as indicated in the succeeding paragraphs.

Prospective Developments

(8) The specification of money and short-term market condi-

tions over the coming three weeks is complicated by the combination of

a heightened market sensitivity to indicators construed as reflecting

policy, potentially very large CD run-off at banks, and a fairly sizable

Treasury refunding operation in prospect possibly in combination with

additional cash borrowing. The Treasury's recent announcement of addi-

tional June tax bills still leaves $1-1/2 - $2 billion or so of new

money to be raised before early March. This may be raised in connection

with, or around the time of, the mid-February refunding of $5.4 billion

of publicly-held maturing issues; the refunding will be announced around

the end of January. Finally, market conditions generally will be in-

fluenced, of course, by the forthcoming budgetary estimates in the

Budget Document, and especially the handling of the surtax.

(9) Money market conditions will also be affected by the

extent to which banks attempt to moderate or postpone further loan and

portfolio adjustments by short-term borrowing at the discount window or

in the Federal funds and Euro-dollar markets, and by the extent to which

dealers are willing to take positions in the forthcoming financings.

On balance, it appears likely that money market conditions consistent

with a market appraisal of an unchanged stance for open market operations

might involve a Federal funds rate frequently around 6-3/8 - 6-1/2 per

cent, member bank borrowings in a $550-$800 million range, and net

borrowed reserves of $250 to $600 million.



(10) The 3-month bill rate consistent with these conditions

may be in a 6 to 6-1/4 per cent range, assuming a CD run-off of the

order magnitude specified in paragraph (12) below. The technical

position of the bill market is good, with dealer bill holdings relatively

low, particularly shorter maturities. Thus, there is a possibility

that the 3-month bill rate could drop below 6 per cent for "scarcity"

reasons, especially if there should be sizable liquidity demands,

including demands from investors temporarily out of the stock market

or switching from CD's. However, the supply of new bills being offered

by the Treasury will tend to replenish dealer total holdings of bills

as banks quickly sell off the newly offered tax bills; and the System is

likely to be a net seller to the market in the latter part of January.

(11) Dealer holdings of coupon issues are also down, as

they managed a further net reduction of around $280 million in such

issues maturing in over a year (the great bulk in the 5-10 year area)

during the past month of rising interest rates. Thus, the dealer

market is in a fairly good position to participate in the forthcoming

financings, but the ability and willingness of banks to acquire and

hold U.S. Government securities is quite limited, given current

Regulation Q ceilings. As a result, one might expect some upward

interest rate pressures in the process of distributing securities to

holders largely outside the banking system. However, the prospects of

large net debt repayment in the spring--estimated at around $10-1/2

billion over the four months March through June (mainly maturing tax

bills)--should at least moderate upward interest rate pressures, and

could even lead to some interest rate decline, particularly in the bill

market as time goes on.



-6-

(12) Largely because of continued and contra-seasonal CD

attrition likely under present interest rate relationships, expansion

in the bank credit proxy in January may drop into a 0 to 3 per cent,

annual rate, range, given the money and short-term market conditions
and (10)

noted above in paragraphs(9)/and no change in Regulation Q ceilings.-/

If Lhe 3-month bill rate were to move close to the lower end of its

projected range--for expectational or other reasons--bank credit would

be more likely to rise at around, or somewhat above, the upper end of

the range projected for it, since banks might be able to moderate CD

attrition. Assuming, however, a bill rate averaging near the middle

of the 6 - 6-1/4 per cent range, the staff has projected a decline in

outstanding CD's of around $1-1/4 to $1-1/2 billion for January. This

would be about the same actual decline as in December, but, because

outstanding CD's normally rise in January (and decline in December),

it would be much more of a decline seasonally adjusted than in the

previous month.

(13) Net inflows of consumer-type time and savings deposits

at banks are likely to be on the weak side in January, as consumers also

take advantage of high market yields. This taken together with the

expected CD attrition is likely to lead to some decline in the average

level of outstanding time and savings deposits in January--perhaps by

a 1 to 4 per cent annual rate.

1/ Euro-dollar borrowings usually rise slightly over the course of
January, for seasonal reasons, and CD attrition is likely to put
further pressure on that market. In the first week of January,
Euro-dollar borrowings of major banks rose sharply, reversing
all of recent declines;such borrowings would add 2 percentage
points or so to the proxy if they remained near current levels.



-7-

(14) The money supply, enigmatically, is expected to rise

rather sharply in January, on average, possibly in a 7 - 10 per cent,

annual rate range. A very substantial expansion in money supply

developed at the end of December and in early January, and this acts

to augment the average for the month of January, even though substantial

declines in outstanding cash balances are projected over the remainder

of the month. No obvious explanation is at hand for the very recent

money supply growth, although it is possible that large transfers

around year-end--e.g., corporate payments to pension funds, repatriation

of liquid funds from abroad, and churning associated with switches

from CD's to market securities--may have led to some temporary accumulations

of cash in a period of uncertainty.

(15) There is very little reason at this point to expect

any significantly stronger bank credit performance in February than in

January. The further Treasury financing may enhance credit demands on

banks. But banks' ability to expand resources to accommodate Treasury

and other demands is likely to remain constrained under existing

Regulation Q ceilings. While there is a possibility that short-term

market rates could decline somewhat in the course of February--perhaps

after the financing period--further CD attrition at banks still appears

a likely outcome for the month as a whole. Moreover, private demand

deposits may well decline rather substantially for the month, on

average, as the various new Treasury issues are sold off to the

nonbank public.



-8-

(16) The outlook presented in this Blue Book is, in a sense,

sanguine in that a severe crunch on the banking system and credit

markets is not forecast. The basic reason for this is a presumption

that the market will be expecting a slowing in business activity, and

that private demands for credit will be relatively moderate. However,

it is possible that as a substantial CD run-off continues through

January and into February banks may become less and less willing to

hold onto the State and local government issues bought last year and

to continue making real estate loans in size. It is also possible that

savings withdrawals from nonbank institutions could be greater than

industry expectations. Under these circumstances, debt markets could

become severely strained at a time when a large Treasury refunding is

in process. And the odds on such a development would be enhanced if

business developments do not show signs of an economic slowing and

moderation of inflationary pressures.
