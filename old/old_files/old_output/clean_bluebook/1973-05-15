Prefatory Note 
 
 
The attached document represents the most complete and accurate version available 
based on original copies culled from the files of the FOMC Secretariat at the Board 
of Governors of the Federal Reserve System.  This electronic document was created 
through a comprehensive digitization process which included identifying the best-
preserved paper copies, scanning those copies,1 and then making the scanned 
versions text-searchable.2   Though a stringent quality assurance process was 
employed, some imperfections may remain. 
 
Please note that some material may have been redacted from this document if that 
material was received on a confidential basis.  Redacted material is indicated by

1  In some cases, original copies needed to be photocopied before being scanned into electronic 
format.  All scanned images were deskewed (to remove the effects of printer- and scanner-introduced 
tilting) and lightly cleaned (to remove dark spots caused by staple holes, hole punches, and other 
blemishes caused after initial printing). 
 
2 A two-step process was used.  An advanced optical character recognition computer program (OCR) 
first created electronic text from the document image.  Where the OCR results were inconclusive, 
staff checked and corrected the text as necessary.  Please note that the numbers and text in charts and 
tables were not reliably recognized by the OCR process and were not checked or corrected by staff.

Recent developments
(1) Both M1 and M2 appear to be expanding at annual rates somewhat
above the upper ends of the Committee's April-May ranges of tolerance. Growth
in RPD for the same period, however, seems to be falling short of its range,
as shown in the table. The divergent tendencies evident in money supply
and RPD expansion are attributable to a lower than anticipated average
level of excess reserves in May; to greater than anticipated growth in
currency, which swells M but does not absorb required reserves; and to a
difference (still partly projected) in the weekly pattern of deposits from
that projected earlier (which affects the required reserve component of RPD
with a lag).

(2) The tendency for money supply growth to exceed the Committee's
target ranges became evident soon after the last meeting, and the Desk, while
May 11, 1973
taking account of even-keel, adopted a somewhat more reluctant reserve
supplying strategy. This was expected to raise the Federal funds rate from
the 6-7/8 to 7 per cent range prevailing at the time of the last meeting
into a 7-1/4--7-1/2 per cent range. In the week ending May 2 the average
funds rate rose to 7.43 per cent, and then in the most recent week to
7.60 per cent. During these two statement weeks, member bank borrowings
averaged $1.7 billion, little different from the preceding four weeks.
(3) The recent rise in the funds rate to more than 7-1/2 per
cent reflected unexpected shortages in the supply of reserves arising
partly from a large shortfall in float over the week-end of May 5, which
was partly related to delays in transfers of funds to banks because of a
computer failure. In response to developing money market tightness in the
most recent period, the Desk supplied reserves mainly through repurchase
agreements. The impact of the higher funds rate on market attitudes was
blunted by the reserve supplying efforts of the Desk, by the relatively
low volume of total dealer positions, and by the ready availability of
dealer financing at favorable rates from non-bank institutions.
(4) During most of the inter-meeting period, interest rates on
market securities showed little net response to the rise in the Federal
funds rate. While average issuing rates in the auction of the Treasury's
new 6-7/8 per cent note and 7 per cent bond were apparently nudged upward,
these securities dropped somewhat in yield in the immediate post-auction
period, and yields on short-term bills declined about a quarter of a
percentage point, with the 3-month issue moving to just under 6 per cent.
This drop reflected both current and prospective shortages in the market
supply of Treasury bills. In addition to the usual April and June redemptions
of tax bills, the Treasury recently initiated a cut-back of its regular
bill auction by $100 million a week; $1.7 billion of the maturing May
securities will be redeemed--creating potential demands for bills; the
rest of the May maturities were refunded into longer-maturity notes and
bonds; and it was announced that the initial Treasury cash borrowing in
the new fiscal year might not come until early August.
(5) Following the 1/4 point rise in the discount rate to 5-3/4
per cent on April 23, a further increase to 6 per cent was announced
Thursday. Yesterday's announcement was received relatively quietly by
the market. Bill rates initially adjusted upward about 10 basis points,
but rose further on Friday as the day progressed, perhaps in part due to
persisting money market tightness on that day. The 3-month bill most
recently was quoted 6.23 per cent bid. There were minor price declines
in Treasury and other bond markets. On balance, since the last Committee
meeting, corporate and municipal bond yields have changed little, while
mortgage rates have edged up and longer-term Government securities have
advanced about 1/8 of a percentage point in response to the Treasury's debt
lengthening operation.

the funds rate between now and the next Committee meeting probably moving
up toward the top of the 7-1/4--8 per cent range shown. This represents
somewhat tighter money market conditions than were specified at the time
of the last meeting as consistent with the given longer-run objectives for
the aggregates. This specification of tighter money market conditions re-
flects the greater strength of money supply in recent weeks and the sizable
upward revision in the projection of nominal GNP for the second quarter.
(9) In May-June, M 1 growth is indicated to be less rapid than
in April. Income tax refunds will be tapering off in the forthcoming
period, and growth will also be held down by the cumulative impact of past
interest rate increases together with the restraint on reserve growth
targeted. By the third quarter, a further modest slowing in M 1 growth
would be needed to attain the longer-run target. This might be accomplished
without any additional tightening in money market conditions beyond the 7-1/4--8
per cent funds rate range, particularly if, as projected, the rate of growth
in GNP moderates.
(10) Between now and the next Committee meeting the 3-month
Treasury bill rate is likely to move back up into a 6-1/4--6-5/8 per cent
range under alternative B. The recent rise in the discount rate and the
somewhat tauter money market conditions anticipated will put pressure on
dealer financing costs and will also give banks a further incentive to sell
or liquidate bills as compared with other forms of adjustment. In addition,
a $1--$2 billion drop in the Treasury balance at the Fed is anticipated prior
to mid-June tax receipts and this will cause the System to sell more bills
than otherwise into the market. The bill rate is still expected to remain
unusually low relative to the funds rate, however. The Treasury's favorable
cash position has enabled it to pay down maturing coupon issues and bills, and
the Treasury has also stressed debt lengthening in its refunding operations.
In this assessment of the bill market, we have not assumed any substantial
reflow of funds from abroad.
(11) Pressure on bank liquidity positions is expected to persist
in the weeks ahead as bank lending continues to grow at a rapid pace. There
has been some moderation of business loan demands as the shift of commercial
paper borrowers to banks has abated. Nevertheless, the projected rapid
rate of business inventory accumulation and large plant and equipment outlays
indicate basic strength in credit demands.
(12) These demands are likely to be financed in large part by
issuance of CD's in sizable volume, though diminished from the record first
quarter pace. If the cost of issuing CD's is increased (by raising reserve
requirements), the amount of CD's issued will probably be cut back some-
what because of the higher effective rate, banks will shift to other
forms of raising funds (such as selling securities), and lending terms to
business may righten somewhat further.
(13) The availability of bank credit to finance demands will
also be dampened by an expected further slowing of net inflows of consumer-
type time and savings deposits as short-term interest rates edge higher.
The staff has not assumed a rise in Regulation Q ceilings that pertain to
such deposits. Given this assumption, a more marked slowing of consumer-
type time deposit flows is anticipated around the mid-year interest crediting
period and continuing into the third quarter, when Treasury bill rates are
expected to rise further.
(14) Long-term interest rates seem likely to rise somewhat under
the conditions of alternative B partly as restraint on bank credit availa-
bility leads banks to participate relatively little as suppliers of funds
in securities markets. Reduced flows of funds to nonbank savings institu-
tions will also work toward upward pressure on mortgage rates and on debt
markets more generally as Federal agencies offer sizable amounts of
securities to help support the mortgage market. Demands on long-term bond
markets, however, still appear quite moderate, and this may permit a rise
in short rates to develop without significant impacts on long rates. But
expectations are very important in the determination of long rates, and
should monetary actions be interpreted as implying that credit will
tighten substantially further, or remain tight for a more extended period
than expected, long rates could well come under more upward pressure.
(15) Alternative A indicates specifications that appear consis-
tent with a policy move toward a higher growth rate for the aggregates
than encompassed in alternative B. This alternative implies some easing
of money market conditions in the weeks ahead.
(16) Under alternative C, which moves toward a lower long-run
growth rate for the aggregates, it would appear that the Federal funds
rate would probably have to rise above 8 per cent over the period imme-
diately ahead. Because of lags the main impact on M1 growth would not
occur until the third quarter, when--to achieve the 4--4-1/2 per cent
long-run objective--M1 growth would have to fall to a 3 per cent annual
rate. M2 growth also would slow sharply, given the significantly higher
short-term rates and assuming no increase in Regulation Q ceilings for
consumer-type time deposits. Given the low growth rates for the aggre-
gates expected for the third quarter under this alternative, the Committee may
find it necessary to ease money market conditions in the course of summer
if it desires to stay on the longer-run growth paths of alternative C
Proposed directive
(17) Presented below are three alternative formulations for
the operational paragraph of the directive, which might be taken to
correspond to the similarly lettered policy alternatives discussed in the
preceding section. In light of the comments by a number of members at the
previous Committee meeting about the disadvantages of using such qualita-
tive terms as "moderate" or "modest" to characterize the desired growth
rates in the monetary aggregates, such objectives have been expressed
relative to the actual growth over the past 6 months. These 6-month growth
rates are shown in the table on page 4. The diverse behavior of the various
monetary aggregates, however, creates difficulties in characterizing future
targets in the same way relative to past performance for all aggregates.
(18) The 6 month comparison works quite well for M1, since
the long-term target range specified under alternative B (5--5-1/2 per
cent) and the short-run range of tolerance encompass the 5-1/4 per cent
growth rate experience in the past 6 months; the ranges specified under
A and C are, respectively, somewhat above and somewhat below the 6-month
pace. For the bank credit proxy, actual growth over the past 6 months
exceeds both the long-run target and near-term expectations under all
three alternatives. For RPD and M2 , the situation is a little more compli-
cated, but for the most part the previous 6-month rates of expansion are
above specifications in the three alternatives (with some exceptions in
alternative A).
(19) The directive language below attempts to take account of
the differences in specified future movement of the aggregates relative to
the past. As will be noted, an instruction to take account of credit market
developments is included in alternative C since the relatively sharp tightening
of money market conditions contemplated could lead to undesirably rapid
adjustments in credit markets generally.
Alternative A
To implement this policy, [DEL: while taking account of forthcoming
Treasury financing] the Committee seeks to achieve bank reserve
and money market conditions consistent with SOMEWHAT FASTER
[DEL: moderate] growth in [DEL: monetary aggregates] THE NARROWLY DEFINED
MONEY STOCK over the months ahead THAN OCCURRED IN THE PAST
6 MONTHS ON AVERAGE BUT SOMEWHAT SLOWER GROWTH IN OTHER KEY
MONETARY AGGREGATES.
Alternative B
To implement this policy, [DEL: while taking account of forthcoming
Treasury financing] the Committee seeks to achieve bank reserve
and money market conditions consistent with [DEL: moderate] growth in
[DEL: monetary aggregates] THE NARROWLY DEFINED MONEY STOCK over the
months ahead AT ABOUT THE AVERAGE RATES OF THE PAST 6 MONTHS
AND SLOWER GROWTH IN OTHER KEY MONETARY AGGREGATES.
Alternative C
To implement this policy, while taking account of [DEL: forthcoming
Treasury financing] CREDIT MARKET DEVELOPMENTS, the Committee seeks
to achieve bank reserve and money market conditions consistent with
SOMEWHAT SLOWER [DEL: moderate] growth in monetary aggregates over the
monnths ahead THAN OCCURRED ON AVERAGE IN THE PAST 6 MONTS.
