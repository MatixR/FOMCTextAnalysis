MONETARY POLICY ALTERNATIVES
Recent Developments
(1) Over the intermeeting period, the degree of reserve pres-
sure remained unchanged and the federal funds rate averaged quite close
to its intended level of 3 percent. Other short-term rates were
little changed on balance. Money market rates were pushed up early in
the period on media reports indicating that the FOMC had shown an
increased willingness to tighten policy at its May meeting. This con-
cern particularly pressed on market sentiment after the publication of
surprisingly robust employment figures for May. Subsequent data, how-
ever, suggested slower inflation and a hesitancy to spending, fostering
the view that policy, while tilted toward restraint, was unlikely to
tighten soon. With the outlook for the economy somewhat weaker, and in
light of progress in the Congress on a package of deficit cuts, inves-
tors apparently revised down their expectations for credit demands well
into the future, pulling longer-term interest rates down 15 to 40 basis
points. Long-term Treasury yields reached the lowest levels in more
than 20 years, as did fixed-rate mortgage rates. Bolstered by these
rate declines, major equity indexes rose 1 to 3 percent.
(2) Despite the outlook for weaker credit demands in the
United States, the dollar's weighted average exchange value has risen
about 2-3/4 percent on balance since the May FOMC meeting. Apprecia-
tions of 4-1/2 percent against the mark and somewhat less against other
European currencies more than offset a 2-3/4 percent depreciation
against the yen. Weakness in the mark generally reflected a further
deterioration of the economic outlook in Germany that strengthened
expectations of lower German interest rates; on July 1 the Bundesbank
reduced its discount rate by 1/2 percentage point and its Lombard rate
by 1/4 percentage point. With this action largely anticipated, German
3-month interest rates were about unchanged over the period, but inter-
mediate- and longer-term rates fell somewhat. The mark was weak enough
in the European Exchange Rate Mechanism to allow several other ERM
countries to lower official lending rates by more than in Germany.
Despite a momentary setback engendered by the fall of the Miyazawa
government, the yen continued to strengthen on the basis of huge
Japanese trade and current account surpluses and market perceptions that
the United States and Japan's other G-7 partners favored yen apprecia-
tion. Japanese short-term interest rates were about unchanged, while
long-term rates declined about 25 basis points. The Desk intervened to
buy dollars against yen on several occasions in late May and early June,
for total yen sales of $1.1 billion equivalent, split evenly between the
System and Treasury.
(3) From April to June, M2 rose at a 7 percent rate, about
1-1/4 percentage points more than expected in the previous bluebook.
The bulk of this increase was recorded in its Ml component, which posted
growth rates of 27-1/2 percent in May and 7-1/2 percent in June.2
The growth in liquid deposits owed in part to the latest wave of mort-
gage prepayments, which set a record in May and are expected to remain
high in June. Additionally, with individual nonwithheld tax payments
well below last year's pace, there was less buildup in liquid deposits
to meet tax liabilities in April and, consequently, less runoff in May.
Seasonal factors, expecting a more abrupt swing, transformed the modest
drawdowns in late April and May into seasonally adjusted strength in
May. These identifiable special factors probably account for a con-
siderable portion of the two-month growth, suggesting that the underly-
ing trend to the aggregate has remained subdued, though perhaps a little
less so than over the first four months of the year. Capital market
instruments have retained their allure, with inflows to stock and bond
funds in May remaining near their record April pace and anecdotal
reports suggesting continued strength in June. In June, M2 remained
below the lower bound of its target cone.
(4) From the fourth quarter through June, M2 growth on balance
was about in line with staff projections at the time of the February
FOMC meeting, despite what now appears to be lower growth of nominal
income. Special factors have apparently contributed more to M2 growth
than had been expected; in particular, the bulge in mortgage refinancing
activity, touched off by the late-winter rally in the bond market,
boosted M2 in the second quarter. Underlying demand for M2 relative to
income during the first half appears to have remained weak. M2 velocity
is estimated to have increased at a 2-3/4 percent rate in the second
quarter and a 4-1/2 percent rate in the first half.
(5) M3 increased at a 4-3/4 percent rate over the April-to-
June period, about 3/4 percentage point faster than was projected at the
time of the May meeting. The strength in M3, which increased at a 9-1/4
percent rate in May but was about unchanged in June, was mostly account-
ed for by its M2 component. From the fourth quarter to June, M3 has
contracted slightly, leaving it below the 1/2 percent lower bound of its
growth cone. The decline in M3 over the first half was about that
anticipated by the staff in February. While bank credit growth was a
little stronger than foreseen, banks relied to an unexpected extent on
nondeposit sources of funds; bank capital probably provided a large
volume of funds, as banks likely retained a substantial proportion of
robust earnings and continued to issue new equity shares and subordi-
nated debt at a brisk pace.
(6) Bank credit grew at a 9 percent rate in May and appears
to have about maintained that pace in June. This pickup includes a
substantial rise in bank lending, which has averaged about 9 percent
over the past two months after having declined at a 2 percent rate over
the preceding months of the year. The rise in total loans was wide-
spread, with all the major components of bank loans posting higher
growth rates in the second quarter. This improved performance seems
mainly to evidence some stirring in loan demand, as well as the
increased willingness to lend, as shown in survey responses.
(7) The strengthening in bank credit was part of a pickup in
the growth of overall domestic nonfinancial debt in recent months.
April growth is now seen as 5-3/4 percent and probably moved higher
still in May. With tax receipts on the skimpy side and the Treasury
seeking to build its cash balance, federal debt grew at a double-digit
pace in April and May. Nonfederal debt growth also increased. Continu-
ing rapid issuance by state and local governments to take advantage of
low rates, while mostly to refinance older issues, has probably raised
some new cash as well. Meanwhile, the string of increases in consumer
credit provides some evidence that consumers have become more willing to
take on debt. However, gross issuance of corporate bonds slowed a bit
in the second quarter as it appears that internal funds remained about
sufficient to fund the spending of the nonfinancial corporate sector.
From the fourth quarter of 1992 through May, domestic nonfinancial debt
expanded at a 5 percent rate, placing it near the lower end of its 4-1/2
percent to 8-1/2 percent monitoring range; this growth was about in line
with projections early in the year.

Alternative Long-Run Strategies
(8) The table on the following page shows three alternative
monetary policy strategies and the associated implications for infla-
tion, output, and resource utilization. Strategy I, the baseline, is a
judgmental extension of the Greenbook forecast for 1993 and 1994. It is
characterized by very gradual decreases in both inflation (2.7 percent
by the end of the simulation) and unemployment (6 percent). Under the
tighter strategy, denoted by II, the Committee is assumed to put greater
emphasis on its price stability objective, bringing inflation below
2 percent near the end of the period. In the easier strategy, denoted
by III, the Committee is assumed to put more weight on reducing unem-
ployment over the next few years.
(9) The stance of monetary policy in each of the scenarios is
indexed by the federal funds rate path and the growth rate of M2. There
is considerable uncertainty about the rate of M2 growth associated with
a given funds rate path and nominal income. The paths for money growth
were determined judgmentally, relying in part on a variety of models of
M2 demand. In the extended forecast, M2 remains subdued for a while as
the depository sector continues to downsize somewhat relative to other
sectors supplying credit and as investors continue to enlarge their
holdings of capital market instruments. Eventually, however, these
adjustments are completed, and the expansion of M2 comes into better
alignment with growth in nominal GDP--albeit at a higher level of veloc-
(10) All of the strategies assume that fiscal policy remains
moderately restrictive throughout the period, as the structural fiscal
deficit declines from 4-1/4 percent of GDP in 1993 to less than 3 per-
cent by 1998. Such a decline is in line with the Administration's
budget proposal and with the bills moving through the Congress.

On the supply side of the economy, potential real GDP is assumed to grow
a little more than 2 percent per year. The various scenarios incor-
porate the staff's judgment that the natural rate of unemployment will
remain around 6 percent. In the extension of the baseline and in the

alternative strategies, the response of inflation to variations in the
unemployment rate around the natural rate is in line with historical
experience. That is, a 1 percentage point unemployment gap sustained
for one year lowers inflation by about 1/2 percentage point.5 Thus,
we have made no allowance past the Greenbook forecast for adverse shifts
in the short-run inflation/output tradeoff that might result from such
things as added regulation, trade protection, or increases in taxes to
pay for health care.
(11) The baseline policy entails some continuing slack in
resource utilization over the simulation period. Current real long-term
rates are still relatively high, especially in light of the fiscal
policy assumed by the staff, and they decline somewhat over the simula-
tion period, which brings output to potential. Real short-term rates,
on the other hand, appear too low to be sustained, and in the baseline
these rates rise, though to a level below that incorporated in market
rates. As a result of persisting slack, inflation edges down gradually
to 2.7 percent by the end of the simulation period.
(12) The stronger anti-inflation stance of Strategy II is
implemented by increasing the funds rate to 4 percent by the fourth
quarter of 1993 and holding it there, while accepting the resulting
reduction in money growth. Real short-term rates rise promptly under
this scenario and remain elevated, keeping real long-term rates high.
The tighter stance of policy prevents the unemployment rate from falling
appreciably, and the higher level of slack maintains noticeable downward
pressure on inflation. Ultimately, the nominal long rate falls below
that in the baseline strategy, as inflation expectations abate.
(13) To achieve more rapid gains in employment, Strategy III
cuts the nominal funds rate to 2 percent by the fourth quarter of this
year and maintains a lower rate than the baseline in the following year.
Money growth generally runs somewhat higher than in the baseline path.
The unemployment rate drops through the natural rate half-way through
the simulation period. As a result, no progress is made on reducing
inflation, which indeed accelerates later in the period. To limit the
overheating in the economy, the initial policy move must be quickly
reversed and ultimately nominal short-term rates end up the highest
under this strategy.
Long-Run Ranges
(14) Presented below are the staff's projections for money and
debt growth in 1993 and 1994, along with actual growth through June and
the ranges for 1993 adopted by the Committee in February. (Appendix A
gives projections for M2+.)
Money and Debt Growth
(Percent change, annual rate)
Q4:1992 Staff projections
Current ranges to June 1993 1994
Nominal GDP 4-3/4 4-3/4 5
(15) M2 growth consistent with Greenbook income and interest
rates is projected to average about 1 percent from June through the
fourth quarter, leaving the increase for 1993 at 1 percent, below the
current 2 to 6 percent annual range. Income is projected to grow at the
same rate in the second half of this year as in the first. Moreover,
interest rates also are expected to have about the same influence on M2
growth over the second half as the first. In the Greenbook projection,
longer-term rates drift down further as inflation worries recede, short-
term rates remain on a lower trajectory than anticipated by the market,
and fiscal restraint in the deficit-reduction package is implemented. A
lower level of longer-term rates should make shifts into longer-term
debt instruments a bit less attractive, once the transitory effects of
capital gains wane. However, rates on NOW and other very liquid depos-
its have not yet fully adjusted to lower money market rates, and further
declines in these rates will damp M2 demand. With mortgage refinancing
projected to decline from record levels, temporary factors will be
depressing M2 growth over the second half of the year.6 With improv-
ing balance sheets of borrowers and lenders, underlying M2 growth is
expected to strengthen a bit. Nevertheless, credit demands are pro-
jected to remain focused on longer-term markets, limiting institutions'
needs to bid for retail deposits. On balance, the velocity of M2 is
expected to rise 3 percent during the second half, slower than the 4-1/2
percent rise over the first two quarters. (See charts on following
pages for actual and projected velocity for the monetary aggregates and
(16) M3 is projected to expand at a very subdued pace over the
second half of 1993; even subdued expansion, however, would represent a
strengthening from the declines registered through June. The aggregate
is projected to be flat for the year, leaving it 1/2 percentage point
beneath its range. The pickup in the second half of the year does not
reflect greater asset growth at depositories; in fact, bank credit
expansion is expected to flag some from the first-half pace, and thrift
credit is likely to be weaker than in the first half, damped late in the
year by a resumption of RTC resolution activity. But banks may rely
more on deposits and less on other sources of funding than earlier this
year, having built capital to high levels.
(17) Debt of domestic nonfinancial sectors is expected to
expand a bit more slowly over the second half of the year than in the
first, as federal borrowing falls back from its rapid first-half pace.
Growth of the debt of nonfederal sectors picks up slightly further as
borrowers and lenders become more comfortable with their financial situ-
ations. Growth of domestic nonfinancial sector debt should come in at
5 percent for the year, about 1/2 percentage point above the lower end
of its range and slightly less than anticipated at the time of the
February meeting. Federal debt expansion is expected to decelerate to
9 percent this year, while growth of nonfederal debt is projected at
3-3/4 percent--up from last year's 3 percent rate.
(18) The basic forces influencing the growth of money and
credit in 1994 are likely to differ only a little from those prevailing
in 1993. Nominal GDP growth is projected to expand at about this year's
pace, balance sheet constraints to ease slightly further, and long-term
rates continue to drift down. Consequently, nonfederal debt is expected
to strengthen slightly further next year, though staying below the pace
of private-sector spending. Federal borrowing, however, should slow,
reflecting the cyclical and structural forces narrowing the deficit.
Total domestic nonfinancial debt growth is projected to remain at about
this year's 5 percent rate. Bank credit is likely to accelerate
slightly along with nonfederal debt, to a 4 percent pace. In the thrift
sector, the shrinkage in credit may accelerate as new funding for the
RTC permits more resolution activity. With financing needs of deposi-
tory institutions remaining modest, M3 growth is projected to move up
only to 1 percent in 1994. Bidding for retail deposits by depositories
should again be quite muted, given their limited needs for funds, and
the still-steep yield curve likely will continue to attract deposit
balances into bond funds. M2 is projected to accelerate only to a 2
percent rate in 1994, and its velocity would rise at a 3 percent rate,
in comparison to the 3-3/4 percent rise projected for this year.
Ranges for 1993
(19) Presented below are three alternative sets of ranges for
money and debt growth in 1993. Despite the reduced emphasis on monetary
aggregates as guides to policy, the choice of ranges can convey informa-
tion about what money and credit growth would be consistent with the
economic outcomes envisioned by the Committee and can be used to signal
the Committee's longer-term intentions. Alternative I retains the
current ranges, while alternative II lowers the ranges for M2 by a full
percentage point and those for M3 and debt by 1/2 percentage point.
Alternative III would make more substantial reductions from the current
ranges to encompass the staff forecast.
Alternative Money and Debt Ranges for 1993
(Percent)
Alt. I Memo:
(current Staff
ranges) Alt. II Alt. III projection
M2 2 to 6 1 to 5 0 to 4 1
M3 1/2 to 4-1/2 0 to 4 -1 to 3 0
Debt 4-1/2 to 8-1/2 4 to 8 3-1/2 to 7-1/2 5
(20) The staff projections for M2 and M3 growth this year are
below the lower boundaries of their current ranges. A downward revision
of the ranges, as in alternative II or III, could be viewed as a recog-
nition that velocity shifts are apparently more intense than had seemed
likely in February. The lower ranges of alternative III might better
convey the Committee's expectations for money and credit and limit the
risk that money might fall short of the ranges even with expected nomi-
nal income growth. From another perspective, a reduction of the ranges
for 1993 also might signal a willingness of the Committee to accept
lower money and nominal income growth than had been projected in Febru-
ary, perhaps in an effort to lean against potential inflation pressures.
Since money growth has been so anemic thus far this year, the upper ends
of these ranges would permit considerable strengthening of the monetary
aggregates: M2 could grow at a 10 percent rate from June to December
and still be within the upper end of the alternative III range.
(21) Alternative I ranges might be chosen if contrary to
the staff's prediction, the Committee expected the extraordinary shift
in demand for M2 to abate soon, causing M2 velocity to level out. A
higher track for M3 might be appropriate if bank and thrift credit do
not fall back to the extent that the staff envisions or if the unusual
use of non-M3 funding were expected to subside. The current ranges also
might be retained were the Committee concerned that the weak performance
of M2 and M3 had been associated with unacceptably sluggish economic
growth and would continue to be in the future.7
Ranges for 1994
(22) Shown below are options for preliminary ranges for money
and debt growth in 1994. They are the same as those shown for 1993.
Alternative Money and Debt Ranges for 1994

Alt. I Alt. II Alt. III projection
M2 2 to 6 1 to 5 0 to 4 2
M3 1/2 to 4-1/2 0 to 4 -1 to 3 1
Debt 4-1/2 to 8-1/2 4 to 8 3-1/2 to 7-1/2 5
(23) Many of the arguments for the alternatives in 1993 carry
over into the choice of ranges for 1994. In particular, lower ranges
might give a more realistic view of expected money growth. In addition.
if uncertainty about the future behavior of velocity is seen as motivat-
ing retention of the current ranges for 1993, those same ranges might be
proposed for 1994 on the strength of the same considerations. Alterna-
tively, next year's ranges could be lowered, even if the current ranges
for 1993 were retained, to signal the Committee's intention to continue
on a disinflation path. A lower range for 1993 would seem to argue for
the same or possibly an even lower range in 1994.
Short-Run Policy Alternatives
(24) Three policy alternatives are given below for Committee
consideration. Under alternative B, federal funds would remain in a
trading range around 3 percent, in association with an initial allowance
for adjustment plus seasonal borrowing of $250 million, an increase of
$50 million from the current allowance to accommodate the normal pattern
in seasonal borrowing at this time of the year. Under alternative A,
the funds rate would be reduced to the area of 2-1/2 percent, either by
choosing a $225 million borrowing allowance or by cutting the discount
rate 1/2 percentage point, to 2-1/2 percent, while retaining a $250
million borrowing allowance. Under alternative C, which could be imple-
mented through a $275 million borrowing allowance, the funds rate would
vary around 3-1/2 percent.
(25) Although market participants believe that the next mone-
tary policy action is more likely to be a tightening than an easing,
they do not expect any move to occur over the coming intermeeting
period. Consequently, market interest rates would not respond initially
to the implementation of alternative B. Rates would tend to remain
near current levels or edge lower over subsequent weeks should data on
economic activity and prices prove to be about in line with the staff
projection and should the Congress continue to make progress on passage
of a deficit reduction package. Interest rates would back up across the
maturity spectrum, however, if adverse information on price pressures
generates expectations of a near-term tightening of monetary policy, or
if a major snag occurs in the process of deficit reduction. The
exchange value of the dollar is expected to fluctuate around recently
established levels; staff forecasts for continued monetary policy easing
abroad are broadly consistent with expectations already embedded in
interest and exchange rates.
(26) The immediate tightening of reserve market conditions
under alternative C is not built into financial market quotes and would
induce a rise in short-term market interest rates that about matched the
1/2 percentage point increase in the federal funds rate. In response to
higher funding costs, banks likely would boost the prime rate, perhaps
by the same amount. (In light of the currently wide spread of the prime
rate over banks' cost of funds and their professed greater willingness
to make loans, banks will be less inclined to raise the prime in reac-
tion to an increase in the federal funds rate of only 1/4 percentage
point.) Longer-term market rates also would likely rise, though by
considerably less than short-term rates, as the policy action worked to
relieve the market's residual inflation concerns and to put a damper on
household and business spending and credit demands. Buoyed by more
attractive relative interest returns in the United States, the dollar
would tend to strengthen on foreign exchange markets.
(27) The easing of reserve conditions embodied in alternative
A would represent an unexpected direction for policy, especially in
light of the market's understanding of the Committee's recent policy
predilection. The Federal Reserve would be seen as putting more
emphasis on supporting economic growth, perhaps in light of the recent
weaker economic data and the possible restraining effects of the fiscal
package. Market participants would expect short-term rate declines to
be reversed eventually, but still would anticipate that rates would
trade around lower levels over the coming year than currently built into
the term structure. Consequently, the downward adjustment of short- and
intermediate-term market rates would be close to the 1/2 percentage
point drop in the federal funds rate. As usual, bond yields would not
fall by nearly as much, partly because investors might become a little
more worried about future inflation. The exchange value of the dollar
would be depressed. Implementing this alternative would reduce
financial intermediaries' costs of funds, encouraging them to relax
their terms and conditions for business and consumer loans.
(28) Expected growth rates of the monetary aggregates from
June to September under the three alternatives are shown in the table
below, together with anticipated growth from the fourth-quarter base
through September. (More detailed data are presented in the table and
charts on the following pages.) Under all the alternatives, the broader
aggregates are expected to grow from June to September, but at markedly
slower rates than over the second quarter. The deceleration of M2
predominantly reflects some unwinding of the second-quarter bulge in
mortgage refinancings. This effect, which derives largely from the
associated prepayments of mortgage-backed securities, is projected to
retard M2 growth by about 1 percentage point over the next three months,
after having augmented it by 1-1/2 percentage points over the previous
three. M3 expansion is anticipated to be held back by a slowing in bank
credit from its rapid rate in the second quarter to a pace more consis-
tent with the attractiveness of capital market alternatives to borrow-
ers. Under all the alternatives, the broader aggregates would remain
below the lower bounds of their annual ranges through September, with M2
somewhat, and M3 a bit, below the bottom edges of their parallel bands.

Q4:1992 to September
(29) Projected M2 growth over the third quarter diverges rela-
tively little across the three alternatives, ranging from 1/2 percentage
point under alternative C to 1-1/2 percentage point under alternative A.
The similar growth rates reflect the diminished sensitivity on balance
of M2 demand to short-term market interest rates in recent years, as
capital market instruments have become closer substitutes for M2 bal-
ances in household portfolios. If, for example, short-term market rates
are reduced. M2 is boosted as deposit rates fall by less. This effect,
which attracts funds from money market instruments, is partly offset by
shifts into capital market instruments, whose realized returns are
boosted temporarily by capital gains and whose yields over time drop by
less than deposit rates. Given this damped interest rate response, even
if the money market conditions of alternative A continued through year-
end, M2 growth over the year would still be only 1-1/4 percent, notice-
ably below the 2 percent lower bound of the Committee's current annual
range. By contrast, M1 seems to have retained its greater sensitivity
to changes in the funds rate that emerged after the nationwide introduc-
tion of NOW accounts in the early 1980s. Projected growth of this nar-
row aggregate from June to September ranges from 4-3/4 percent under

alternative C to 6-3/4 percent under alternative A. From the fourth
quarter of 1992 through December, projected M1 growth would range from 8
to 9 percent across the three policy alternatives.
(30) Across the three policy alternatives, M3 is expected to
grow from 0 to 1/2 percent over the third quarter. Bank credit expan-
sion is foreseen to abate from its elevated pace of May and June, cur-
tailing funding needs of depositories; moreover, these needs will con-
tinue to be met from nondeposit sources, including retained earnings and
issuance of equity and subordinated debt. The contraction of thrift
credit and funding requirements probably will be sustained. For the
year, M3 would be little changed under all the alternatives.
(31) The debt of domestic nonfinancial sectors is anticipated
to expand at a 4-3/4 percent rate over the four months ending in Septem-
ber, bringing its growth rate from the fourth quarter about 1/2 percent-
age point above the 4-1/2 percent lower bound of its monitoring range.
The growth of nonfederal debt is expected to strengthen to a 4 percent
rate over this interval, but federal debt, after sizable growth in June,
is poised to slow in the third quarter, as the Treasury meets a portion
of its funding needs by drawing down its bloated cash balance.
Directive Language
(32) Presented below are draft paragraphs relating to the
ranges for 1993 and 1994. For 1993, Option 1 would reaffirm the current
ranges, while Option 2 would cover a decision to reduce those ranges.
Within Option 1, language is suggested in brackets if the Committee
wanted to indicate that money growth could be around the lower ends of
the ranges.
(33) With regard to the tentative 1994 ranges, Option A would
cover a Committee decision to extend to next year whatever 1993 ranges
the Committee adopts at this meeting, while Option B proposes wording
for changes from the 1993 ranges.
Paragraphs for 1993 and 1994 Ranges
The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and
financial conditions that will foster price stability and
promote sustainable growth in output.
Alternatives for 1993
Option 1--Reaffirm Ranges
In furtherance of these objectives, the Committee RE-
AFFIRMED at THIS its meeting THE RANGES IT HAD ESTABLISHED in
February [DEL: established ranges] for growth of M2 and M3 of 2 to 6
percent and 1/2 to 4-1/2 percent respectively, measured from
the fourth quarter of 1992 to the fourth quarter of 1993. The
Committee expects that developments contributing to unusual
velocity increases are likely to persist during the year.
[AND IN THAT EVENT M2 AND M3 GROWTH AROUND THE LOWER ENDS OF
THEIR RANGES WOULD BE CONSISTENT WITH ITS BROAD POLICY OBJEC-
TIVES.] The monitoring range for growth of total domestic
nonfinancial debt ALSO was MAINTAINED [DEL:set] at 4-1/2 to 8-1/2
percent [WAS LOWERED TO ____ TO ____ PERCENT] for the year.
Option 2--Reduce Ranges
IN FURTHERANCE OF THESE OBJECTIVES, THE COMMITTEE AT
THIS MEETING LOWERED THE RANGES IT HAD ESTABLISHED IN FEBRUARY
FOR GROWTH OF M2 AND M3 TO ____ TO _____ PERCENT AND ____ TO ____ PER-
CENT RESPECTIVELY, MEASURED FROM THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 1992 TO
THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 1993. THE COMMITTEE ANTICIPATED THAT
DEVELOPMENTS CONTRIBUTING TO UNUSUAL VELOCITY INCREASES WOULD
PERSIST OVER THE BALANCE OF THE YEAR AND THAT MONEY GROWTH
WITHIN THESE LOWER RANGES WOULD BE CONSISTENT WITH ITS BROAD
POLICY OBJECTIVES. The monitoring range for growth of total
domestic nonfinancial debt was MAINTAINED [DEL:set] at 4-1/2 to
8-1/2 percent [(ALSO) WAS LOWERED TO ___ TO ___ PERCENT] for the
Alternatives for 1994
Option A--Retain 1993 Ranges
FOR 1994, THE COMMITTEE AGREED ON A TENTATIVE BASIS TO
RETAIN THE 1993 RANGES (AS REVISED AT THIS MEETING) FOR GROWTH
OF THE MONETARY AGGREGATES AND DEBT, MEASURED FROM THE FOURTH
QUARTER OF 1993 TO THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 1994. The behavior
of the monetary aggregates will continue to be evaluated in
the light of progress toward price level stability, movements
in their velocities, and developments in the economy and
financial markets.
Option B--Change 1993 Ranges
FOR 1994, THE COMMITTEE AGREED ON TENTATIVE RANGES FOR
MONETARY GROWTH, MEASURED FROM THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 1993 TO
THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 1994, OF ___ TO ____ PERCENT FOR M2 AND ____
TO ____ PERCENT FOR M3. THE COMMITTEE PROVISIONALLY SET THE
MONITORING RANGE FOR GROWTH OF TOTAL DOMESTIC NONFINANCIAL
DEBT AT ____ TO ____ PERCENT FOR 1994. The behavior of the mone-
tary aggregates will continue to be evaluated in the light of
progress toward price level stability, movements in their
velocities, and developments in the economy and financial
(34) The draft operational paragraph would continue the prac-
tice first adopted at the March meeting of not indicating specific
growth rates for M2 and M3 over the shorter run.
OPERATIONAL PARAGRAPH
In the implementation of policy for the immediate
future, the Committee seeks to DECREASE SOMEWHAT/maintain/IN-
CREASE SOMEWHAT the existing degree of pressure on reserve
positions. In the context of the Committee's long-run objec-
tives for price stability and sustainable economic growth, and
giving careful consideration to economic, financial, and mone-
tary developments, slightly (SOMEWHAT) greater reserve re-
straint would (MIGHT) or slightly (SOMEWHAT) lesser reserve
restraint (WOULD) might be acceptable in the intermeeting
period. The contemplated reserve conditions are expected to
be consistent with [DEL:appreciable] MODEST growth in the broader
monetary aggregates over the THIRD [DEL:second] quarter.
APPENDIX A
PROJECTIONS FOR M2+
The table below presents staff projections for growth of M2+
(M2 plus bond and stock mutual funds) over 1993 and 1994 consistent with
Greenbook forecasts of income and interest rates. The projections of
3-3/4 percent M2+ growth in 1993 and 3-1/4 percent in 1994 represent a
slowing from a 4-1/2 percent pace over 1992 and 4-1/4 percent this year
through May. The slowdown in M2+ growth anticipated over the remainder
of 1993 and during 1994 reflects the effects of the more gradual decline
projected in long-term rates over coming quarters. This trajectory for
rates implies a decline in realized capital gains, which are included
directly in the value of the measured aggregate and indirectly affect the
demand for it.
