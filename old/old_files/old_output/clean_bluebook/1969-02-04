Prefatory Note 
 
 
The attached document represents the most complete and accurate version available 
based on original copies culled from the files of the FOMC Secretariat at the Board 
of Governors of the Federal Reserve System.  This electronic document was created 
through a comprehensive digitization process which included identifying the best-
preserved paper copies, scanning those copies,1 and then making the scanned 
versions text-searchable.2   Though a stringent quality assurance process was 
employed, some imperfections may remain. 
 
Please note that some material may have been redacted from this document if that

1  In some cases, original copies needed to be photocopied before being scanned into electronic 
format.  All scanned images were deskewed (to remove the effects of printer- and scanner-introduced 
tilting) and lightly cleaned (to remove dark spots caused by staple holes, hole punches, and other 
blemishes caused after initial printing). 
 
2 A two-step process was used.  An advanced optical character recognition computer program (OCR) 
first created electronic text from the document image.  Where the OCR results were inconclusive, 
staff checked and corrected the text as necessary.  Please note that the numbers and text in charts and 
tables were not reliably recognized by the OCR process and were not checked or corrected by staff.

MONEY MARKET AND RESERVE RELATIONSHIPS
Recent Developments
(1) Yields in short-term credit markets have shown little net
change since the January 14 Committee meeting, although longer-term
interest rates have recently come under increased upward pressure.
The Treasury on Wednesday afternoon announced a "rights" exchange of its
February maturities, offering holders the option of either a 15-month
6.29 per cent. The refunding announcement was received quietly in the
market, with minor price adjustments. The System's subsequent publication
of a large net borrowed reserve number Thursday night resulted in some
further price declines in the note and bond market.
(2) After declining to near the lower end of the 6 - 6-1/4
per cent range specified in the last Blue Book in the wake of heavy
early January investor demands, the 3-month Treasury bill rate moved
up to near 6.20 per cent, a shade higher than the level prevailing around
the time of the last Committee meeting. System sales of bills for both
its own and foreign accounts, a waning of investor demands, and the
liquidation of Treasury bills in the market by banks, including relatively
rapid sales out of the $1-3/4 billion of additional June tax bills
auctioned on January 15, contributed to the firming of bill yields.

(3) Despite continued large CD and other time deposit
attrition in January, the major money market banks in New York have
moved into a comfortable money position--swinging, partly for seasonal
reasons, from a large basic reserve deficit to, in recent days, a basic
reserve surplus. These banks have built up their net borrowing from the
Euro-dollar market to a new high (although in the past several days such
borrowings have shown little further net change), demands on them for
day-to-day money from the dealer market have remained relatively light,
and they have apparently reduced holdings of earning assets. Under the
circumstances, with major banks no longer large net borrowers in the
funds market, the Federal funds rate tended to decline, requiring
sizeable offsetting System open market operations. Over the past two
statement weeks the Desk made nearly $3 billion of matched sale-
purchase transactions, in addition to selling outright or redeeming
more than $500 million of bills. Member bank borrowings from the
System rose to an average of $835 million over the period, but with
reserve distribution temporarily skewed in favor of major money market
banks, borrowing was concentrated at country banks and reserve city
banks other than major money market banks. The Federal funds rate was
generally around 6-1/4 - 6-3/8 per cent, and net borrowed reserves in a
$570 to $750 million range.
(4) The continued sizeable CD run-offs at major banks in
January was accompanied by a weaker than expected deposit expansion at
other banks. As a result, the bank credit proxy is now estimated to
show a decline of 4-1/2 per cent, annual rate, in January on average.
Bank borrowing in the Euro-dollar market would add back about 3 per-
centage points, so that the adjusted proxy would decline at a 1-1/2 per
cent annual rate.-
(5) With large CD run-offs, and with weakness developing in
flows of other time deposits, the total of time and savings deposits
in January is estimated to have declined at a 10-1/2 per cent annual
rate, almost twice as much as earlier projected. Money supply growth
was also slower than anticipated, rising, on current estimates, at
about a 4-1/2 per cent annual rate. The bulge in money supply in the
weeks about year-end has faded rather rapidly, reflecting the transitory
nature of year-end money flows as well as recent net transfers from
private demand to U.S. Government deposits as banks sold out the new
June tax bills.
(6) The following table shows rates of change in major
reserve and deposit aggregates estimated for January, as compared with
other recent periods. The growth in January of total and nonborrowed

liabilities to foreign branches for all banks involved; the
previous series used represented an average of Wednesday figures
for all banks during the month. The previously used series
would show a 4 percentage point increase in Euro-dollar
borrowings from December to January.
reserves at a time of contraction in total member bank deposits reflects,
in about equal parts, the impact of lagged reserve requirements and the
shift in January in deposit composition from time to demand deposits.

Prospective Developments
(7) As February progresses, the basic reserve position of
major money market banks can be expected to worsen, partly as the recent
seasonal easing reverses and possibly also because of increased demands
for day-to-day funds which might stem from the Treasury refunding. The
Federal funds and dealer loan rates may, therefore, tend to rise somewhat
from recent levels, for any given level of total member bank borrowings.
Moreover, continued CD run-offs may tend to impel somewhat greater
borrowing demands from the Federal Reserve. If borrowings are in a
$600-$850 million range in February, the funds rate might be most
frequently around 6-3/8 - 6-5/8 per cent. The 3-month bill rate, under
these conditions, may be expected to be in a 6 - 6.30 per cent range.
(8) A little downward pressure on bill rates could develop
out of the Treasury financing. Given the current market atmosphere,
the staff is not expecting sizeable bill demands by holders of "rights",
but part of the attrition--projected around $1-1/4 billion--could find
its way into the bill market. However, the Treasury has made known its
expectation of raising $2-$3 billion of cash before early April; some
part of this may be raised through a bill strip offering at an earlier
date, particularly if attrition in the refunding is sizeable. This
prospect should lead dealers to remain willing sellers of bills over
the next few weeks. Market attitudes also appear highly sensitive to
many of the cross-currents in economic and financial news. A more
widespread conviction that monetary policy will be restrictive should
keep bill rates under upward pressure; however, news of economic weakness
could tend to have a countervailing effect.
(9) Assuming the bill rate averages around the mid-point of
the range, the bank credit proxy (as measured by total member deposits)
in February is expected to decline further--perhaps in a 3 to 6 per cent
annual rate range. The principal factor in this decline continues to
be relatively rapid run-off in large negotiable CD's, but private
demand deposits in February are also expected to decline on average.
Even if Euro-dollar borrowings by U.S. banks rise no further from the
level to which they had advanced in the course of January, they would
still add about 3 percentage points on average to the February credit
proxy projection. In that case the adjusted bank credit proxy would
be in a 0 to -3 per cent range for February.
(10) The CD run-off for February is projected at around
$1-1/4 billion. This represents a smaller absolute decline than in
January, reflecting for the most part smaller maturities estimated for
February. Other time and savings deposits are expected to continue
weak, although not as weak as in January when one-time asset shifts
were made following the year-end interest-crediting period.
(11) While the extent of CD run-off remains, as always,
uncertain, perhaps the greater uncertainty in coming weeks concerns the
behavior of private demand deposits and the money supply. Despite
sizeable attrition in the Treasury refunding, U.S. Government deposits
are expected to rise substantially further, on average, during the
month, partly as receipts from the $1-3/4 billion June tax bill issue
paid for in late January affect the February monthly average figures.
This rise would be associated with some net transfers out of private
demand deposits. The outstanding money supply in February is expected
to decline, probably in a 1 - 4 per cent, annual rate, range. However,
a smaller than projected attrition in the Treasury refunding and/or a
marked slowing of business loan demand could enlarge the decline in
money supply. Some slowing of banks' business loan growth from the
recent rapid pace is anticipated, in any event, as inventory accumula-
tion is expected to moderate.
(12) The continued reduction in bank credit outstanding, on
average, will probably be accompanied by further liquidation of U.S.
Government securities--including some attrition of bank holdings in
the refunding--and limited, if any, bank net purchases of municipals.
Thus, prospects are for further upward pressure on long-term rates.
although postponements or cancellations of capital issues, particularly
by State and local governments, may moderate the upward course of
