through a comprehensive digitization process which included identifying the best-
preserved paper copies, scanning those copies,1 and then making the scanned 
versions text-searchable.2   Though a stringent quality assurance process was 
employed, some imperfections may remain.

Recent developments
(1) M1 remained essentially unchanged in September, but appears
to be increasing at a relatively rapid rate in October. For the two months
combined its growth is now projected at about a 3.5 per cent annual rate,
a shade below the low end of the Committee's 4 to 8 per cent operating
range. However, expansion in bank time and savings deposits other than
money market CD's has been substantially stronger than anticipated during
both September and early October, so that growth in M2 appears to be run-
ning above the mid-point of its range. Deposit inflows at nonbank thrift
institutions have continued at an unusually high rate.

1/ These figures do not incorporate the regular quarterly benchmark revi-
sion of monetary aggregates that will be published on Thursday,
October 21. The revisions (based on the March call report) are gen-
erally quite small, however. The level of M1 for each month of this
year was revised up no more than $100 million, and quarterly growth
rates for M1 for the first three quarters of the year hardly changed.
The level of M2 , however, was revised downward more substantially
and its quarterly growth rates were lowered by about 1/2 percentage
point. All tables on subsequent pages of this report (with the excep-
tion of tables 1 and 2 following the charts) are based on the new series.
The new and old series are compared in Appendix Table IV.
(2) Despite expansion of M1 and M2 in the September-October
period, nonborrowed reserves appear to be showing little net change over
2/that time.2/ This divergent behavior in part reflects the effect of lagged
reserve requirements. In addition, total demand deposits at banks (includ-
ing Government and interbank) are declining somewhat on balance, releasing
reserves to support expansion in time and savings deposits.
(3) In the week immediately following the September Committee
meeting, incoming data suggested that growth in M1 and M2 would be well
within the Committee's two-month ranges. Accordingly, the Desk continued
to aim at a Federal funds rate of 5-1/4 per cent. In the following two
statement weeks, however, new data indicated a weakening in demand deposit
flows. As a result, the projected 2-month growth rate for M was lowered
to below Committee's range but M2 remained around the mid-point. The Desk
responded by gradually lowering its Federal funds rate objective to the
5 per cent currently prevailing.
(4) Short-term interest rates have dropped 10 to 35 basis points
since the September Committee meeting, while yields on Treasury issues in
the 2 to 4 year maturity range have dropped 50 basis points. This flatten-
ing of the yield curve in part may reflect market expectations of less
upward interest rate pressure for some time ahead. In the bond area,
yields have declined 5 to 25 basis points over the past four weeks. The
reduced average level of market rates resulted from the easing in money

reserves in the weeks between the September and October meetings rela-
tive to the behavior that was expected to be consistent with the Com-
mittee's short-run ranges for monetary growth.
market conditions brought about by Desk operations, from weak M1 data
published for late September, and from widely publicized downward revi-
sions in market forecasts of economic growth over the next several
quarters. The unfavorable economic news has apparently also dampened
enthusiasm in the stock market, resulting in a substantial decline in
stock prices.

age annual rates of change) related monetary and financial flows over

Prospective developments
(6) Current longer-run growth ranges and three alternatives for
Committee consideration are shown below. In keeping with usual procedures,
the proposed longer-run ranges pertain to the one-year period from QIII
'76 to QIII '77. (The current ranges relate to the QII '76-QII '77 period.)
Current Alt. A Alt. B Alt. C
M1  4½-7 5½-8 4½-7 3½-6

(7) It appears that the longer-run relationship between M1 and
the other monetary aggregates may be changing from earlier expectations.
From the second to the third quarter of 1976 M1 grew at a 4 per cent annual
rate--somewhat below the lower limit of the FOMC's longer-run range. How-
ever, over that period M2 expanded at about a 9-1/4 per cent annual rate,
close to the upper limit of its longer-run range, and M3 rose at a rate
slightly above the upper end of its range. The staff had expected rela-
tively rapid growth in M2 and M3 in the third quarter. Growth in M1 over
the third quarter was slower than anticipated, however, and interest rates
somewhat lower.
(8) The staff anticipates continued moderation in M growth
relative to M2 and M3. In some part, this reflects an expectation that
shifts from demand to savings deposits will be a little larger than the staff
had earlier anticipated. In addition, in view of the less expansive economy
now projected, market interest rates are expected to be under less upward
pressure over the next few quarters than previously thought. Therefore,
investors are likely to have a somewhat greater preference than earlier
assumed for time and savings deposits relative to market instruments.
(9) Under the circumstances, the three lettered alternatives
incorporate a different relationship between M1 and the broader aggre-
gates han is contained in the set of longer-run ranges currently in
place. Under alternative C, the growth ranges for the broader monetary
aggregates are about the same as those that now prevail, but the range
for M1 is lower. Alternative B continues the current growth range for
M1, but involves somewhat higher ranges for M2 and M3 . Alternative A--
which contemplates little change in interest rates over the next year--
contains higher ranges for all of the monetary aggregates.1/
(10) Shorter-run specifications for the monetary aggregates
and the Federal funds rate thought to be consistent with the proposed
longer-run alternatives are summarized below. More detailed data--includ-
ing one-year growth rates for the QII '76-QII '77 period as well as for
the QIII '76-QIII '77 period--are shown in the tables on the following
two pages.
1/ Levels of the monetary aggregates for QII '77 implied by growth from
QII '76 at the mid-point of the ranges currently in place relate to
the proposed alternatives in the following way. The implied QII '77
level for M1 is midway between alternatives A and B. For M2 and M3,
the implied levels for QII '77 are best approximated by alternative C,
after taking account of the downward revision in levels associated
with the new benchmark revision.

(Inter-meeting period)
(11) Alternative B, which has a Federal funds rate range centered
on 5 per cent, assumes that money market conditions remain unchanged between
now and the next Committee meeting. Growth in M1 under this alternative is
expected to accelerate into a 4-1/2 to 8-1/2 per cent annual rate range
over the October-November period--in large part because of the substantial
increase that has already occurred in early October. Moreover, nominal GNP
is projected to expand at about an 11-1/2 per cent annual rate in the fourth
quarter, up from an 8-1/2 per cent rate in the third, and this should strengthen
transactions demands for money. Growth in M2 is expected to remain quite
large over the 2-month period, reflecting not only the projected rebound in
M1 growth but also the expectation that net inflows into time and savings
deposits (other than money market CD's) will continue large as market inter-
est rates over the next few weeks remain low relative to offering rates on
these deposits.
(12) The staff would still expect interest rates to rise over
the longer run under alternative B, given the projected pace of economic
activity. However, we would now anticipate a Federal funds rate no higher
than about 6 per cent by mid-'77 and perhaps rising to around 6-1/2 per cent
later that year, as may be seen from Appendix Table II. This represents
both more delayed, and less, interest rate pressure than anticipated
earlier. M2 and M3 would, as a result, probably show somewhat more
strength over the longer run relative to M1 than previously expected--
although growth rates in the broader monetary aggregates would, of
course, be expected to slacken over the next few quarters.
(13) Over the next few weeks, interest rates would be likely
to show little net change under alternative B. About $4 billion of pub-
licly-held debt maturing on November 15 will need to be rolled over, and
the Treasury may also take the opportunity to raise about $2-1/2 billion
of new cash. Private credit demands in short-term markets, including
demands at banks, are likely to remain quite moderate over the next few
weeks. With banks expected to receive large inflows of funds from M2
deposits, they probably will permit CD's to run off somewhat further over
the next few weeks and may also be substantial investors in intermediate-
and short-term issues offered in the Treasury refunding. Thus, interest
rates in short- and intermediate-term market sectors are not likely to be
under any pressure from market forces over the period immediately ahead.
However, some upward pressure on private long-term rates may be generated
if the Treasury offers a substantial amount of the new issues in the 10-
year and longer maturity area, given the existing relatively narrow spread
between Treasury and corporate issues and the sizable forward calendar of
corporate and State and local government bonds.
(14) Alternative C involves a rise in the funds rate over the
next few weeks to the 5-1/2 per cent mid-point of a 5-6 per cent range.
Under those conditions, market interest rates would, of course, rise
between now and the next Committee meeting. The increase might be fairly
sharp since a sizable Treasury financing will be in process and since cur-
rent dealer positions in Treasury securities remain substantial, although
not quite as large as a month ago. Net inflows of funds to banks and
thrift institutions through interest-bearing deposits, particularly savings
deposits, would be constrained somewhat by such a move in the funds rate--
which would probably be accompanied by a rise in the 3-month bill rate back
to near 5-1/2 per cent. However, the net inflows of interest-bearing
deposits would still remain ample, and banks and thrift institutions would
not be likely to tighten non-price lending terms, even though the prime
loan rate, and perhaps mortgage rates, might edge upwards.
(15) Further increases in interest rates can be expected over
the longer-run under alternative C, assuming M1 growth over the QIII '76-
QIII '77 period is constrained to around 4-3/4 per cent. As shown in the
appendix table, a funds rate as high as 7-3/4 per cent might develop by
the fall of 1977.
(16) Alternative A encompasses an easing of the money market
between now and the next Committee meeting. Such an approach seems most
consistent with an effort to raise longer-run growth rates from those cur-
rently in place. The contemplated 1/2 point reduction in the Federal funds
rate in the near-term would lead to a significant decline in market rates--
and also probably in the prime loan and primary mortgage rates--over the
next few weeks. There would be some further increase in net inflows of
interest-bearing deposits at banks and thrift institutions. As such
inflows continued, and as market rates declined, it is likely that earn-
ings experience would place these institutions under some pressure to
reduce interest rates offered on deposits. However, no substantial
reductions would be likely over the next few weeks.

(17) Presented below are four alternative formulations for the
operational paragraph of the directive. The first three are couched in
terms of desired growth in monetary aggregates over the months ahead and

in the event that the Committee wishes to formulate its instructions in
terms of money market conditions and to maintain the conditions now
