Prefatory Note
The attached document represents the most complete and accurate version 
available based on original copies culled from the files of the FOMC Secretariat at the 
Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System.  This electronic document was 
created through a comprehensive digitization process which included identifying the best-
preserved paper copies, scanning those copies,1 and then making the scanned versions 
text-searchable.2  Though a stringent quality assurance process was employed, some 
imperfections may remain.
Please note that this document may contain occasional gaps in the text.  These 
gaps are the result of a redaction process that removed information obtained on a 
confidential basis.  All redacted passages are exempt from disclosure under applicable 
provisions of the Freedom of Information Act.
1 In some cases, original copies needed to be photocopied before being scanned into electronic format.  All 
scanned images were deskewed (to remove the effects of printer- and scanner-introduced tilting) and lightly 
cleaned (to remove dark spots caused by staple holes, hole punches, and other blemishes caused after initial 
printing). 
2 A two-step process was used.  An advanced optimal character recognition computer program (OCR) first 
created electronic text from the document image.  Where the OCR results were inconclusive, staff checked 
and corrected the text as necessary.   Please note that the numbers and text in charts and tables were not 
reliably recognized by the OCR process and were not checked or corrected by staff.

MONETARY POLICY ALTERNATIVES
Recent Developments
(1) The effective federal funds rate, at 5.82 percent,
averaged a bit above the FOMC's intended level of 5.75 percent over
the intermeeting period. The overage reflected strong demands for
reserves at the close of two maintenance periods as well as pressures
associated with the bunching of the settlement of several Treasury
issues caused by debt ceiling disruptions and with the mid-December
corporate tax date.1 As they did at the time of the last meeting,
market participants appear to expect a cumulative easing of about 50
basis points in the federal funds rate between December and next
April. As the expected easing drew nearer, shorter-term rates moved
down 5 to 15 basis points over the intermeeting period.2
(2) Long-term rates declined about 1/4 percentage point over
the intermeeting period, as markets interpreted incoming information
as suggesting that spending would be restrained and inflation less
likely to pick up. Available survey evidence suggests that inflation
expectations have been falling (chart). The rate on the thirty-year
Treasury bond has returned to levels last seen in late 1993--before
the tightening in monetary policy. The Treasury yield curve out to
ten years is now at or below the current federal funds rate, which is
a fairly rare occurrence (chart). However, the inversion in the cur-
rent term structure is slight--much less than before past recessions.
Moreover, for the most part, previous flattenings and inversions of
the yield curve have occurred when the Federal Reserve was tightening
and long-term rates rose by less than short-term rates. An exception
occurred in 1986, when, much like now, long-term rates declined more
than short-term rates. That episode was followed by a strengthening
in the economic expansion. Over the recent intermeeting period,
equity prices continued to move upward about in tandem with bond
prices; since early this year, bond and equity prices are up about 30
(3) The dollar's weighted-average exchange value rose nearly
2 percent over the intermeeting period, appreciating more against
European currencies and less against the yen. With growth in many
foreign industrial countries disappointing, interest rates abroad
fell; over the past several days, monetary policy interest rates were
eased 25 to 50 basis points in every major European country except
Italy. Mexican financial markets stabilized somewhat during the
period, perhaps reflecting signs that the Mexican economy has bottomed
out. The peso appreciated 2 percent against the dollar, and Mexican
short-term interest rates declined 5 to 15 percentage points.
monetary authorities did not intervene.
(4) Recent data suggest that the federal and nonfederal
components of the domestic nonfinancial debt aggregate have continued
to expand at a slower pace than earlier in the year. Nonfederal debt
is estimated to have risen in October at about a 4 percent pace.
Federal borrowing has been held down by restrictive continuing resolu-
tions and the Treasury running down its cash balance in the face of
the debt-ceiling constraint. Owing to strength earlier in the year,
however, growth of the debt of all nonfinancial sectors from the
fourth quarter of 1994 through October was at a rate of 5-1/4 percent,
about at the midpoint of its monitoring range. The moderation of
borrowing in the second half of the year apparently indicates reduced
credit demands, as little evidence has emerged of any significant
tightening in credit supply conditions. Yield spreads on investment-
grade debt have widened slightly this year but remain narrow by his-
torical standards; for high-yield instruments, the widening has been
more marked, but spreads remain appreciably below those prevailing
from 1989 to as recently as 1993. As for the household sector, banks
have given only scant indication that they have tightened lending
conditions despite increases this year in delinquency and charge-off
rates on consumer loans; it appears, however, that moves toward
greater credit accommodation have ceased.
(5) Bank credit expansion in recent months has been held
down by a shift of funding toward capital market instruments as long-
term rates have fallen. Partly as a result, M3 growth slowed to a
1-1/2 percent rate in November. Even so, M3 expanded at a 6 percent
rate from the fourth quarter of 1994 through November, at the upper
bound of its 1995 growth range. Such growth implies a decline in the
velocity of M3 this year after eight years of increases. The
turnaround in velocity reflects the greater volume of funds supplied
by depository institutions as well as a reduced reliance by banks this
year on their foreign offices as a source of funding. 3
(6) M2 advanced at a 3 percent rate last month, following a
slight contraction in October. As a result of its robust growth ear-
lier in the year, however, M2 remains in the upper half of its 1995
growth cone, posting an increase of 4-1/4 percent since the fourth
quarter of last year. The velocity of M2 is likely to be about
unchanged in 1995, the first year since 1991 in which it has failed to
register a significant increase. M2's advance this year has been
somewhat stronger than predicted by the staff's standard model. This
error may reflect the behavior of long-term rates, a variable not
included in that model but whose substantial decline this year may
have made M2 assets more attractive.4
(7) M1 contracted at a 3-1/2 percent rate last month, as
more banks initiated programs to sweep funds out of other checkable
deposits. Abstracting from these new sweeps, M1 is estimated to have
grown at about a 1 percent rate in November. The other components of
M1 also were weak last month: Demand deposits edged down and currency
expansion slowed to a 1-1/2 percent rate.5  The recent sluggishness
in currency expansion appears to owe mainly to lackluster demand from
abroad, likely reflecting a reluctance to acquire large denomination
bills in advance of the scheduled introduction of the new $100 note
next year. For 1995, M1 has contracted around 2 percent; the initial
effects of sweeps have depressed this aggregate around 3 percentage
points this year.

Policy Alternatives
(8) As noted above, credit markets seem to have priced in a
drop of about a half percentage point in the federal funds rate over
the next few months; their expectations include about even odds on a
25 basis point move at the December meeting. Disentangling expecta-
tions about the path of the federal funds rate from the yield curve
beyond the next several months is problematic, but judging from the
current Treasury term structure, as well as from Eurodollar futures
rates, market participants do not appear to have strong convictions as
to subsequent policy moves. The flat profile of nominal rates over
the longer horizon--after a near-term downward adjustment to the
stance of policy is made--would seem to be consistent with stable,
moderate inflation over time, which in turn would imply that the
economy is anticipated to remain around its potential. This reading
from market quotes is broadly in line with the outlook of professional
forecasters, as represented by the Blue Chip survey.
(9) In these circumstances, adoption of the unchanged money
market conditions of alternative B could prompt a small backup in
market interest rates. The rise in yields is likely to be damped, as
investors would continue to expect monetary policy easing before long.
The sense that policy action was merely postponed would be more pro-
nounced if a budget agreement had not been reached by the time of the
Committee meeting. Maintenance of the current monetary policy stance
over time, however, particularly after a budget agreement has been
struck, would lead market participants to reexamine their expectations
for monetary policy. If they saw the current 5-3/4 percent funds rate
being sustained for a considerable period in the context of a satis-
factorily performing macroeconomy, then long-term rates might ulti-
mately rise by no more than the approximately 1/2 percentage point
"surprise" in the funds rate. Such an increase would reverse only a
small portion of the drop in rates over the last year, returning
nominal long-term rates to about their levels of late summer, while
leaving real rates perhaps a bit higher than they were at that time
given the downward drift in inflation expectations over recent months.
(10) The Greenbook forecast embodies a backup of longer-term
yields of this magnitude with a flat federal funds rate through most
of the forecast period. Nonetheless, because the staff assessment is
that aggregate demand will be slightly stronger than implicit in
financial markets or the Blue Chip survey, the higher trajectory of
interest rates is seen as consistent with output remaining close to
potential and inflation running around 3 percent over the next two
years. Accordingly, in the staff forecast, alternative B keeps policy
on a path that produces results for economic growth and inflation over
1996 closely in line with the Committee's expectations for next year
that were reported in July.
(11) Although market participants expect monetary policy to
be eased over the next few months, a reduction of 50 basis points in
the federal funds rate implemented at this meeting, as called for
under alternative A, would be larger than generally expected. Other
short-term rates would fall appreciably, and the value of the dollar
would probably decline on foreign exchange markets. The response of
long-term yields would depend on the market's interpretation of this
action, which in turn could be influenced by the content of the
announcement. Bond rates might decline only modestly to the extent
that the action were viewed as merely realigning nominal rates to the
surprisingly damped inflation of the last half of the year. If mar-
kets thought the Committee were anticipating further moderation of
inflation, especially as a consequence of underlying weakness in
aggregate demand that implied lower real as well as nominal rates
going forward, then rate declines would be more pronounced. Such
substantial reductions in bond yields would fuel additional increases
in equity prices as investors discounted expected earnings at the
lower rates. While there is some risk that market participants would
interpret an easing as indicating insufficient regard for the longer-
term inflation outlook, this risk would be greater for a 50 basis
point cut than for a 25 basis point move. The latter is closer to
market expectations and, judging from the yield curve, would be seen
as consistent with moderate economic growth. Thus, the smaller cut is
less likely to spark major changes in market rates.
(12) Under the staff forecast, alternative A would risk
fostering greater inflation pressures, and the move would eventually
need to be reversed. Thus, choice by the Committee of this alterna-
tive would presumably be based on an assessment that aggregate demand
is more likely to flag than under the staff forecast and that infla-
tion and inflation expectations are more likely to decline. Optimism
on inflation might be based on the observation that inflation has come
in lower than expected at mid-year and inflation expectations have
abated significantly. As a consequence, real short-term rates are
perhaps higher than the Committee had anticipated when it established
the 5-3/4 percent funds rate. The good performance of the economy in
the face of these real short-term rates may be seen as reflecting in
part the rally in capital markets, which, however, has been based to a
degree on expectations of policy ease. In the absence of policy
action, real longer-term interest rates and exchange rates would be
pushed higher, and an easing could be based on concern that these
higher real rates risked an unduly sluggish economy in the future.
Indeed, the favorable inflation-output mix of the second half of 1995
might be seen as indicating that the economy is capable of operating
on a sustained basis at a higher level of output and hence lower
levels of real interest rates than in the staff forecast.
(13) With market participants expecting an easing rather than
a tightening of policy, the 50-basis-point increase in the federal
funds rate under alternative C would lead to a sharp jump in other
money market interest rates. Yields on intermediate- and longer-term
issues would likely rise as well, as real interest rates expected over
coming quarters firmed considerably, and probably by more in the short
run than any decline in inflation expectations. The value of the
dollar on foreign exchange markets would increase appreciably.
(14) The FOMC might select alternative C if it saw the risks
to inflation at current interest rates as reasonably well balanced and
wished to gain more assurance of making longer-term progress toward
price stability. Despite declines this year, survey-based measures of
inflation expectations have only reached levels of recently observed
inflation and still do not anticipate further disinflation. Given the
demand and inflation relationships incorporated in the staff forecast,
the rise in the federal funds rate under alternative C would tilt the
inflation rate down slightly in 1997. With the economy already
operating in the neighborhood of its potential and aggregate demand
possibly bolstered by the sharp declines in interest rates of the past
year, an increase in inflationary pressures cannot be ruled out.
Although growth of the standard monetary aggregates has been slow
recently, the broad aggregates have expanded fairly briskly for 1995
as a whole, and credit through intermediaries and in the securities
markets remains readily available.
(15) The table below presents staff forecasts for money and
credit growth for the November-to-March period under the unchanged
money market conditions of alternative B.7 Broad measures of money
and credit are expected to pick up some in coming months, partly in
conjunction with stronger growth in nominal GDP. Credit supply condi-
tions should remain favorable under that outlook, especially for
firms. Households reduce their borrowing a bit in view of slackening
growth of spending on durables and rising debt-service difficulties,
but growth of their debt still outpaces that of nominal income. Busi-
ness borrowing picks up, buoyed by a brisk pace of merger deals.
Although firms are drawn to the bond market by attractive long-term
rates, borrowing from shorter-term sources, including banks, remains
substantial. Total debt growth accelerates to a 5 percent pace over
the November-March period, leaving domestic nonfinancial sector debt
near the middle of its provisional 3-to-7 percent monitoring range.

(16) In the staff forecast, bank credit growth edges up in
the next few months from its recent depressed rate, as banks stop
running off securities. With Japanese branches and agencies already
having shifted financing to their home offices or other affiliates,
the runoff of CDs at these institutions should wind down, so that
going forward depository institutions as a whole rely more on liabili-
ties in M3 to finance credit growth. Expansion of M3 picks up to a
5-3/4 percent annual rate over the November-to-March period under
alternative B. M2 growth also firms from its unexpectedly weak pace
so far in the fourth quarter. The projected rebound in nominal income
growth supports an acceleration of retail deposits, and the lagged
effects of recent declines in short-term rates and associated reduc-
tions in opportunity costs also buoy money demand. M2 would be just
above the upper end of its provisional 1 to 5 percent annual range in
March, and M3 would be at the upper end of its tentative 2 to 6 per-
cent range.
(17) In contrast to the rebound projected for the broader
aggregates, M1 is forecast to continue to decline, at a 3-3/4 percent
annual rate, from November to March. The expected weakness in this
aggregate mainly reflects anticipation that retail sweep accounts will
continue to spread. Supporting money growth, the expansion of
currency, particularly its foreign-held component, should rebound
beginning in February, when the new series $100 bill becomes avail-
(18) The spread of retail sweep accounts will be reflected in
a further decline in required and total reserves.10  The drop in
required reserve balances poses the possibility that required operat-
ing balances (required reserve balances plus required clearing bal-
ances) may not satisfy demands for such balances at all times and
could on occasion prompt increased and unpredictable demands for
excess reserves. In early 1991, following a reduction in reserve
requirements by the Federal Reserve, required operating balances fell
to a low of around $18 billion--apparently lower than the level banks
needed at that time for clearing purposes. As a result, excess
reserve demands temporarily increased on average and fluctuated
appreciably, and money market conditions became quite volatile.
Absent an unexpected explosion of sweep activity in the next few
weeks, the staff projects that required operating balances generally
will remain above $20 billion through the first quarter, though they
could fall below this level temporarily, reflecting seasonal declines
in transaction deposits. How low operating balances would need to
fall before presenting problems is an open question; banks have made
improvements in their reserve management over the past few years, and
the banks introducing sweep programs evidently believe they can manage
their reserve position with balances lower than current requirements.
Nonetheless, the prospects for further erosion of reserves caused by
sweeps suggest that increased volatility could be encountered at some
