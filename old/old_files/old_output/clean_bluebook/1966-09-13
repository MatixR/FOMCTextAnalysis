tilting) and lightly cleaned (to remove dark spots caused by staple holes, hole punches, and other 
blemishes caused after initial printing). 
 
2 A two-step process was used.  An advanced optical character recognition computer program (OCR) 
first created electronic text from the document image.  Where the OCR results were inconclusive,

MONEY MARKET AND RESERVE RELATIONSHIPS
Money markets
Recent developments. Treasury bill rates have continued to
rise in recent weeks. The 3-month bill has risen nearly 20 basis points
since late August to 5.21 per cent, which represents an investment yield
of almost 5.35 per cent. Some of the longer maturities currently are
trading at an investment yield equivalent of around 6 per cent. Other
short-term rates have remained stable or have advanced only slightly
The bill market has reflected continued bank selling of the
March and April tax bills which were auctioned by the Treasury on August 18.
Upward pressure on bill rates also has stemmed from dealers who have
resisted adding to their inventories in light of current high financing
costs and the difficulty encountered in securing financing even at these
high rates. In addition, bill rates have recently been influenced by
expectations that additional Governmental cash financing will be more
concentrated in the bill area if there is a delay or curtailment in
previously expected financing through sales of participation certificates
and Agency issues.
Money market tightness also reflected the development of
sizable reserve needs at major New York City banks at a time when other
major reporting banks were running large basic reserve deficiencies. As
New York banks needed funds, they became aggressive buyers in the Federal

funds market partly in an attempt to postpone resort to the discount window.
The result was that Federal funds rates were pushed to new highs this week
when a considerable amount of trading occurred at rates in the 6-6¼ per cent
Net borrowed reserves averaged $370 million in the 3 weeks ending
September 7 as compared with an average of $407 million in the previous
3 weeks. In both periods these averages before revisions were about $425
million. The downward revisions reflected mainly higher vault cash and
weaker required reserves than had been projected for country banks. Member
bank borrowings averaged $720 million in the latest 3-week period, down
from an average of $763 million in the previous 3 weeks.
Prospective developments. Banks and other money market
participants are approaching the period ahead very cautiously. While
business loans have shown little strength over the past few weeks, a
resurgence is expected in the coming weeks and months. Most immediately,
mid-September tax payments are likely to generate renewed business loan
expansion. The relatively limited ability of banks and the market
generally to accommodate such needs has already been reflected in the
fairly sizable adjustments in sensitive money market rates that have
recently taken place.
It is possible that banks will lose about one-third of their
maturing CD's in coming weeks. (Some $5¼ billion of CD's matures in
September, and $3.5 billion of October maturities are outstanding at
present.) These run-offs will in part be a substitute for direct loan
- 2 - September 9, 1966
CONFIDENTIAL (FR) - 3 - September 9, 1966
demand on banks, as businesses use the proceeds to pay taxes and for other
purposes. Still, under the circumstances, demand for borrowing from the
Federal Reserve is likely to increase, and at the same time individual
banks probably will continue to sell assets (and borrow as much as
possible from non-Federal Reserve sources) as they attempt to maintain
their reserve position in the face of greater loan demand, outflows of
time deposit funds, or both.
In view of the new program for administration of the discount
window and current seasonal and other strains in the money market,
considerably different levels of net borrowed reserves--say, between
$350 and $600 million--could be consistent with continuation of the
current policy of monetary restraint. Where in the range net borrowed
reserves are likely to be will depend on the extent to which banks choose
to undertake reserve adjustments with or without recourse to the discount
window. In any event, bill rates may rise somewhat further in the period
immediately ahead. Once pressures associated with the mid-September tax
date abate in late September-early October, yields could tend to stabilize
as funds that would otherwise go into the CD market may be invested in
bills. On the other hand, the Treasury is likely to be financing in the
bill market during October, and private loan demands are likely to
remain strong. The best guess as of this writing is that the 3-month
bill rate will be in a 5.15-5.40 per cent range over the next three
weeks, although fluctuations outside the range are not unlikely.
CONFIDENTIAL (FR) - 4 - September 9, 1966
Federal funds may be expected to trade more frequently above
6 per cent, and therefore dealer loan rates should remain high and probably
advance somewhat further. Other short-term rates, notably those on
commercial paper, finance company paper, and bankers' acceptances, may
also move higher.
It is not clear that the current lower level of bond yields
can continue in the face of upward rate pressures in the money market.
Expectational factors are probably the key to this at the present time.
The President's proposed fiscal program and other recent official activities
(such as talk of curtailing Agency financing) have reduced expectations of
continuously rising long-term interest rates, with the result that long-
term investments have become more attractive to investors relative to
short-term outlets. Whether this continues will depend importantly on
implementation of the tax and expenditure program, and more careful market
consideration of their effectiveness, especially in light of any step-up
in Federal spending related to Vietnam as it becomes evident to the market.
It will depend, in short, on a continuing conviction that monetary policy
will not need to become tighter than it is.
Reserve flows, bank credit, and money
Recent developments. Bank credit, deposits, and reserves during
recent weeks have for the most part turned out to be weaker than earlier
projected. The credit proxy declined from week to week between early
July and late August; on a daily average basis for the month of August,
CONFIDENTIAL (FR) - 5 - September 9, 1966
it dropped at an annual rate of 2.5 per cent. This brought the annual
rate of expansion in the credit proxy down to 6.2 per cent for the first
eight months of the year, compared with 9.1 per cent for the year 1965.
Private demand deposits declined 4.5 per cent in August on a
daily average basis, even though U.S. Government deposits were reduced
sharply at the same time. On the other hand, rapid expansion in time
deposits continued at only slightly below the 14 per cent July rate.
However, the rate of expansion in time deposits fell off sharply after
mid-August, as major banks began to experience run-offs of CD's.
Prospective developments. As noted earlier, there will be
very large CD maturities during the month, with more than a fifth of
these maturing on the midmonth tax date. Estimates of the size of CD
run-offs for the month as a whole still are conjectural, but it does seem
clear from the evidence of recent weeks that a substantial run-off--perhaps
$1.5 to $2.0 billion over the month--is in prospect. With time deposit
growth as a whole already slackening in late August and with a small
decline estimated in the first week of September, this range of net CD
run-offs would result in virtually no growth or perhaps a small net
decline in daily average time deposits for the month.
The end of September will bring another interest-crediting
period for financial institutions, with the possibility of a temporary
renewal of moderate growth in time deposits as banks pick up consumer-
type time deposits. But the potential may be more limited than earlier
CONFIDENTIAL (FR) - 6 - September 9, 1966
since competing savings institutions have higher rates now, and market
rates of interest are also more attractive. Thus no significant resurgence
in total time deposit growth appears in prospect.
At the same time, projections suggest that banks will continue
to lose U.S. Government balances in the September-October period, even
though the acceleration program for payments of withholdings will net an
estimated $2.7 billion of receipts in October that would normally have
been paid in November. The projected net decline of these deposits assumes
that the Treasury will issue $2.5 billion more of tax bills in the next-
to-last week of October.
These large declines in Government deposits, which may accumulate
to an unprecedented total of $3.6 billion more than seasonal from August
through October,add to the liquidity problems of major banks. On the
other hand, expenditure of these Government balances,along with CD run-
offs, should contribute to renewed expansion of private demand deposits
in the next two months. Growth could be as high as a 10 to 15 per cent
annual rate if at the same time money demands are bolstered by strong
transactions needs.
Even with a large private demand deposit growth, daily average
expansion of the bank credit proxy in September and October is likely to
continue substantially below the 6 per cent expansion rate posted for
the first 8 months of the year and initially projected for September.
In fact, if September CD run-offs are in the range of $1.5 to $2.0 billion,
it now appears that changes in the credit proxy might fall within a
CONFIDENTIAL (FR) - 7 - September 9, 1966
range of +1 to -1 per cent. Any bank credit growth is likely to be
associated with a relatively larger expansion in required reserves
because of expected shifts between time and demand deposits.
