format.  All scanned images were deskewed (to remove the effects of printer- and scanner-introduced 
tilting) and lightly cleaned (to remove dark spots caused by staple holes, hole punches, and other 
blemishes caused after initial printing).

Recent developments
(1) Weekly deposit data now available on a preliminary basis
through December 30 and on a partial basis through January 6 indicate
that growth in the narrowly-defined money supply was at an annual rate
of about 6.7 per cent on average in December, and only about 3.6 per
cent for the fourth quarter. While the rate of growth in money supply
during December exceeded that of any previous month since August, it
still fell appreciably short of the projected 9.5 per cent rebound that
was indicated at the last meeting of the Committee. Moreover, the
November money supply growth rate was revised downward to 2.8 per cent
from the 4.5 per cent rate estimated in mid-December. The combination
of these developments resulted in a fourth quarter money supply growth
rate that was about 1-1/2 percentage points below the roughly 5 per
cent rate of growth that had been expected in consequence of the FOMC's
decision at the last meeting. In the case of the adjusted bank credit
proxy, it too grew somewhat less in December than had been indicated
at the mid-December meeting, but the rate of growth was still substan-
tial as extremely strong time deposit growth more than offset further
declines in non-deposit funds. The latest estimates and the original
target paths for the various monetary aggregates are compared in the
following table:

(2) That there might be a significant shortfall in money supply
did not become evident until December 28, although there were some tentative
indications of the direction of movement just before the long Christmas
weekend. During the final days of December, it was still not known
whether the preliminary estimate of a shortfall for the week of the
23rd would be revised upward--as_had happened at times in the past--or
how much of a year-end bulge in deposits might develop from the widely
predicted heavy seasonal repatriation of Euro-dollars by corporations
seeking to comply with balance of payments regulations. By January 4,
however, more complete data indicated that the drop in the week of the
23rd was even larger than suggested earlier; the drop apparently re-
flected the accompanying very large pay-off of business loans and a
marked increase in the Treasury balance.
(3) The day-to-day behavior of the Federal funds rate since
the last meeting of the Committee has been particularly volatile, as is
often the case during the period around year-end. During the last two
statement weeks of December the funds rate averaged 4.83 per cent, and
then in the week ending January 6 it dropped to 3.82 per cent, largely
because bank reluctance to borrow on the year-end statement date produced
a low Federal funds rate which carried through the turn-of-the year holiday
weekend. In the past two days, Federal funds have been trading mostly
in a range of 4-3/8--4-3/4 per cent, with the Desk aiming most recently
at about 4-1/2 per cent rate in view of the weakness that has developed
in the aggregates. Net free reserves averaging about $120 million were
published for the last two statement weeks, with year-end maneuvering
and bad weather conditions leading to sizable excess reserves.
(4) After a period of hesitation and even back-up in the
last half of December, interest rates have declined in the last two
days, with the largest drop in corporate bond yields. In early
January the bank prime loan rate was reduced to 6-1/2 per cent, following
the reduction to 6-3/4 per cent just before Christmas. The Federal
Reserve discount rate was cut another 1/4 point to 5-1/4 per cent
effective January 8; this reduction had already been well discounted by
the market. Most recently the 3-month bill was quoted around 4.75 per

Prospective developments
(6) Taking the December figures as a starting point, the
table on the next page shows three patterns of growth for the monetary
aggregates over the first quarter which the Committee may wish to
consider. The three growth paths shown for the narrowly-defined money
supply present alternatives that take account in differing ways of the
recent shortfalls relative to expectations, as follows:
(A) Alternative A shows a pattern consistent with a 6 per
cent annual rate of growth for M1 over the first quarter of 1971. This
would be equal to the rate of growth for the quarter that the Committee
indicated as the minimum acceptable at its last meeting, at a time when
it was expected that fourth quarter growth would be 5 per cent. Thus
alternative A does not make up for the fourth quarter shortfall. The
growth rate for the fourth and first quarters taken together would be
only about 4-3/4 per cent, as compared with the 5-1/2 per cent previously
desired. As a result, under alternative A the March level of the money
supply would be about $1 billion below previous expectations.
(B) Alternative B shows a growth path for the first quarter
which makes up for the shortfall in December and in the fourth quarter.
The first quarter growth rate in this alternative is 7-1/2 per cent,
which would lead to a March level for the money stock equal to that
resulting from the earlier 5-1/2 per cent path for the fourth and first
quarters taken together.
(C) Alternative C, which has an 8-1/2 per cent annual rate of
growth in the first quarter for M1, makes up for the shortfall and raises
the growth rate in money supply for the September-to-March period back up
to the 6 per cent rate of expansion experienced over the first three
quarters of 1970.

(7) The range of money market conditions, as typified by
the Federal funds rate, expected to be consistent over the next few
weeks with the various paths for the aggregates are noted below. The
large increases in the money stock, given the Federal funds rate, depend
mainly on the resurgence in economic activity expected to result from the
catch-up in GM auto output during the first quarter. How strong a
resurgence will develop and how such a temporary bulge will affect
money demand are additional uncertainties that compound the usual
difficulties of specifying relationships between money market conditions
and monetary aggregates.

(8) The weekly paths between now and the next meeting for the
various alternatives are shown in the table on the next page.
(9) Realization of alternative A aggregates would require, in
the staff's judgment, pushing the Federal funds rate up from its recent
trading range of around 4-1/2 per cent. With nominal GNP projected to
rise at an 11.7 per cent rate in the first quarter, strong transaction
demands for money and a pick-up in short-term private credit demands are
expected. Should the GNP projection and these money and credit demands
be realized, short-term rates would rise in the process of keeping money
growth down to 6 per cent. Although a tightening of the money market
following a reduction in the discount rate would be rather puzzling

to the market, it would probably be interpreted as an effort to keep
short rates up, and, with some lag, the 3-month bill rate would likely
move back up toward the new 5-1/4 per cent discount rate. Marginal
reserve measures would be tighter than recently prevailing.
(10) Under alternative B, the money market may have to be
eased from currently prevailing conditions; the funds rate was around
4-1/2 per cent on Friday and might have to be moved down into the lower
half of the 4--4-3/4 per cent range specified. The 3-month bill rate
would likely go into a 4--4-5/8 per cent range, but may not drop to the
lower end of the range unless the Federal funds rate falls to 4 per cent
or below for a sustained period of time. Under alternative C, which
would probably require a funds rate below 4 per cent, the bill rate might
also decline below 4 per cent, although expectations that rates were
bottoming out might tend to inhibit such a decline in the 3-month rate.
In either case, movements in the bill rate would be influenced by ex-
pectations as to future discount rate actions as well as by the nature of
forthcoming Treasury financings.
(11) The Treasury is expected to announce its mid-February
refunding on January 20. Books will be open until Wednesday, January 27
on the exchange portion, and if there is a cash portion, an auction would
be likely and would be held in early February. About $5 billion of
publicly-held securities mature in February, but the Treasury is also
likely to include in the exchange $1 billion of maturing March coupon
issues, and may pre-refund other later maturing issues. A large refunding
that accomplishes a noticeable amount of debt extension would tend to
lower short-term interest rates,-partly as a result of demand for bills
from holders of maturing issues not wishing to lengthen. Recent upward
adjustments in interest rates on intermediate-term Government securities
were partly in anticipation of such an enlarged refunding.
(12) With the forthcoming Treasury refunding probably largely
discounted by the market, with recent corporate issues well received, and
in light of the still large spread of long- over short-term rates, it
seems likely that longer-term interest rates will drop further, except
under conditions specified for alternative A. Interest rate declines
would tend to accelerate should the Federal funds rate move down
significantly from prevailing levels.
(13) Banks over the period ahead are likely to continue to be
aggressive buyers of municipal and U.S. Government securities in order to
lock in existing yields, Even though business loan demand may rise, net
inflows of total deposits to banks are likely to be sufficiently strong
to leave them with a substantial surplus of investment funds. Growth
in time and savings deposits other than CD's, as well as large CD's, may
slow somewhat from the advanced rate of the last half of 1970, in light
of the projected acceleration in consumer durable goods spending, but
is still likely to remain vigorous. Relatively more expansion in time
deposits would be expected under alternatives B and C, in view of the
anticipated further declines in market interest rates. With respect to
nondeposit sources, banks will become even less willing holders of Euro-
dollars to the extent that domestic short-term interest rates decline
further relative to Euro-dollar rates. The actual movement of bank Euro-
dollar holdings will depend in large part on any further official action
that may be taken to affect them. For the present projection, we have
assumed a further drop in Euro-dollar holdings of about $300 to $400
million per month under Alternatives B and C.
Possible directive language
(14) This section presents possible language for the second
paragraph of the directive for the three alternative policy courses dis-
cussed above. As will be noted, all three alternatives have the same
second sentence, calling for bank reserves and money market conditions
consistent with the objectives described in the first sentence. Also,
the second sentence includes a reference to the forthcoming Treasury
financing; as mentioned in paragraph (11), above, an announcement of
the terms of this financing is expected on January 20. Finally, it will
be noted that the structure of all three alternatives is similar to that
in the directives the Committee was issuing before the December 15 meet-
ing; it has been assumed that the Committee adopted a different structure
in the second paragraph of the December 15 directive primarily because of
special circumstances it expected to prevail during the period, encompass-
ing the year-end, to which that directive applied.
(15) Alternative A. This alternative is proposed for possible
use if the Committee decides upon a 6 per cent target growth rate for the
money supply in the first quarter, despite the shortfall in the fourth
quarter from the 5 per cent rate that had been expected at the time of the
last meeting.
To implement this policy, THE COMMITTEE SEEKS TO PROMOTE
MODERATE GROWTH IN MONEY AND ATTENDANT BANK CREDIT EXPANSION
OVER THE MONTHS AHEAD. System open market operations UNTIL
THE NEXT MEETING OF THE COMMITTEE shall be conducted with a
view to maintaining BANK RESERVES AND [DEL: the recently attained]
money market conditions CONSISTENT WITH THOSE OBJECTIVES,
TAKING ACCOUNT OF THE FORTHCOMING TREASURY FINANCING [DEL: until
the next meeting of the Committee, provided that the expected
rates of growth in money and bank credit will at least be
Unlike alternatives B and C below, the first sentence of this alternative
does not indicate that the Committee desires to promote easier conditions
in credit markets. Such a statement has been omitted since this directive
might entail tighter money market conditions with potential consequences
for credit markets generally.
(19) Alternative B. This alternative is proposed for possible
use if the Committee decides that the fourth-quarter shortfall in money
should be made up in the first quarter. As indicated in paragraph (6B)
above, attainment of the average March level of money contemplated by the
Committee at the December 15 meeting would involve a growth rate for money
over the first quarter of about 7-1/2 per cent.
To implement this policy, THE COMMITTEE SEEKS TO PROMOTE
SOME EASING OF CONDITIONS IN CREDIT MARKETS AND MODERATE GROWTH
IN MONEY AND ATTENDANT BANK CREDIT EXPANSION. System open
market operations UNTIL THE NEXT MEETING OF THE COMMITTEE
shall be conducted with a view to maintaining BANK RESERVES
AND [DEL: the recently attainged] money market conditions CONSISTENT
WITH THOSE OBJECTIVES, TAKING ACCOUNT OF THE FORTHCOMING
TREASURY FINANCING [DEL: until the next meeting of the Committee,
provided that the expected rates of growth in money and
bank credit will at least be achieved].
The phrase "some easing of conditions in credit markets" has been
reintroduced here in line with the expectation noted in paragraphs (10)
and (12). That interest rates--encompassing intermediate- and longer-
term as well as short-term rates--would decline under this alternative.
(20) Alternative C. This alternative is proposed for
possible use if the Committee decides to seek growth in money over the
first quarter at a faster rate than would be required simply to make
up the fourth quarter shortfall. One possible growth rate under this
alternative--8-1/2 per cent--was noted in paragraph (6C) above.
To implement this policy, THE COMMITTEE SEEKS TO
PROMOTE EASING OF CONDITIONS IN CREDIT MARKETS AND MORE
RAPID GROWTH IN MONEY, WITH ATTENDANT BANK CREDIT
EXPANSION, OVER THE MONTHS AHEAD. System open market
operations UNTIL THE NEXT MEETING OF THE COMMITTEE shall
be conducted with a view to maintaining BANK RESERVES
AND [DEL: the recently attained] money market conditions
CONSISTENT WITH THOSE OBJECTIVES, TAKING ACCOUNT OF THE
FORTHCOMING TREASURY FINANCING [DEL: until the next meeting of the
Committee, provided that the expected rates of growth in
money and bank credit will at least be achieved].
Whereas alternative B includes a statement to the effect that "the
Committee seeks to promote some easing of conditions in credit markets,"
the word "some" is omitted in the corresponding statement in this alter-
native. This difference reflects the expectation that interest rates
would decline somewhat more under this alternative--which calls for
"more rapid growth in money"--than under alternative B.
