# FOMC Text Analysis Project
## Authors: Jose Luis Montiel Olea, Oliver Giesecke, Anand Chitale
### Purpose: This repo contains tools to download, extract, and analyze information from the FOMC Website
## Organization:
The Repo is Organized as follows:
All relevant code is contained in the *src* folder

The src folder is broken down into three subfolders:

1. **Collection**: Contains tools for scraping, downloading, and extracting raw text from documents on the FOMC website.

2. **Derivation**: Contains tools for deriving information(such as alternatives and economic indicators) for each meeting from collected data

3. **Analysis**: Contains tools for analyzing the information we have derived on meetings and alternatives and produces figures for publication

Each of which contains the following grouped by programming language:
1. **Data**: Manually downloaded or modified files which must be read in
2. **Scripts**: Programs which produce some output
3. **Output**: Content generated by scripts


## Collection

This folder contains scripts used in order to read and download all documents from the FOMC website.

Key Files:
1. python/scripts/download_raw_doc_metadata.py:\
Reads through each page of the FOMC website to meeting dates, docuemnts and links for each year. Produces output file **raw_data.csv**

2. python/scripts/extract_derived_data.py:\
Reads in the raw_doc_metadata and produces a derived file derived_data.csv containing the following fields
['year', 'start_date', 'end_date', 'event_type','file_name', 'file_size','file_type', 'link', 'grouping','document_class']

3. python/scripts/perform_collection.sh:\
The other files in this folder are responsible for downloading and extracting raw text from specific files, as well as manually downloaded data from the data folder. This shell script executes all downloads and text extractions. Execute by running ./perform_collection.sh

## Derivation
This folder contains scripts to extract meeting specific information. For the purposes of our experiment, this consisted of policy alternatives extracted from the bluebook of meetings during the greenspan period.

Key Files:
1. src/derivation/python/scripts/obtain_bluebook_alternatives.py:\
Reads in the raw text of the bluebooks from collection/python/output/bluebook_raw_text and produces a regular expression analysis to find all sentence mentions of a policy alternive for each meeting. Exports extracted information to derivation/output/bluebook_alt_and_class_output.csv

2. src/derivation/python/scripts/produce_final_derived_file.py\
Reads in the and merges meeting information for relevant data and output to provide a final derived file containing the following information:

start_date,end_date,event_type,statement_policy_change,statement_policy_action,d_statement,FFF_0_rate,FFF_1_rate,FFF_2_rate,FFF_3_rate,FFF_4_rate,FFF_5_rate,FFF_6_rate,wsj_article_count,nyt_article_count,ft_article_count,DFF_Before_meeting,DFEDTR_before,DFEDTR_end,bluebook_treatment_alt_a,bluebook_treatment_size_alt_a,bluebook_justify_alt_a,bluebook_treatment_alt_b,bluebook_treatment_size_alt_b,bluebook_justify_alt_b,bluebook_treatment_alt_c,bluebook_treatment_size_alt_c,bluebook_justify_alt_c,bluebook_treatment_alt_d,bluebook_treatment_size_alt_d,bluebook_justify_alt_d,bluebook_treatment_alt_e,bluebook_treatment_size_alt_e,bluebook_justify_alt_e,bluebook_comments,year

Produces final_derived_file.csv


## Analysis
These scripts read in information from the derived output in order to produce figures, charts, graphs, and data counts for use in published reports.

Key Files:
1. src/analysis/python/scripts/extract_fed_targets_with_alternatives.py:\
Reads in derived alternative data from final_derived_data.csv in order to produce a time series of fed targets before and after each meeting, along with the rate change proposed by each alternative.

2. src/analysis/python/scripts/overleaf_production/produce_overleaf_files.sh:\
this shell script runs every file placed in the overleaf_production folder, exporting produced graphs, charts, and figures  overleaf_files output folder.
