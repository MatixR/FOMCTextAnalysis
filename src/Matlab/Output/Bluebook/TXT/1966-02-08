The attached document represents the most complete and accurate version available

of Governors of the Federal Reserve System.  This electronic document was created 
through a comprehensive digitization process which included identifying the best-
preserved paper copies, scanning those copies,1 and then making the scanned 
versions text-searchable.2   Though a stringent quality assurance process was 
employed, some imperfections may remain. 
 
Please note that some material may have been redacted from this document if that

format.  All scanned images were deskewed (to remove the effects of printer- and scanner-introduced 
tilting) and lightly cleaned (to remove dark spots caused by staple holes, hole punches, and other 
blemishes caused after initial printing). 
 
2 A two-step process was used.  An advanced optical character recognition computer program (OCR) 
first created electronic text from the document image.  Where the OCR results were inconclusive, 
staff checked and corrected the text as necessary.  Please note that the numbers and text in charts and 
tables were not reliably recognized by the OCR process and were not checked or corrected by staff.

MONEY MARKET AND RESERVE RELATIONSHIPS
Money markets
Recent developments. After exhibiting considerable tautness
over the first half of January, the general tone of the money market
became somewhat less tight after mid-month. Two developments contributed
to this result. First, there was a sharp swing from a large deficit
to a small surplus in the basic reserve position of major New York City
banks, in response to some seasonal loan repayment, some liquidation
of investments and an enlarged net inflow of CD money. Second, there
has been a continued strong demand for Treasury bills, which has also
tended to spill over into other short-term debt markets.
The recent abatement of pressures in the central money market
has been reflected in some easing of the Federal funds rate, which had
held mainly at 4-5/8 per cent during the first half of January, and
some reduction in dealer financing costs. Treasury bill rates and other
short-term rates extended their earlier advance through mid-January,
but since then bill rates have receded from their peaks. CD rates
posted by several major banks in New York have recently tended to
stabilize at 5 per cent on maturities of around 3 months.
In contrast with the lessening of money market pressures,
yields on intermediate- and long-term Treasury securities have risen
recently after declining in the first half of January. These yields
are currently close to their peaks previously reached around the turn
of the year. Yields in other sectors of the capital market have
shown small mixed changes recently, with municipals relatively stable
but upward pressures developing in the corporate market.

In the four statement weeks ending January 26, net borrowed
reserves averaged almost $50 million, but week-to-week fluctuations
have been exceptionally large. Member bank borrowings averaged $430
million over this period, about the same as in December. Borrowings
were very high in the first half of the period, but dropped sharply
after mid-month.
Prospective developments. While the general economic outlook
and associated credit demands suggest that debt markets may come under
considerable pressure in the months ahead, the near-term outlook indicates
some offsetting influences at least in the shorter-end of the market,
particularly if some seasonal bank loan repayments and demands for short-
term securities continue in evidence. The Treasury's current combination
refunding-pre-refunding operation can also be expected to add to the
seasonal demand for bills. The rate impact of this additional demand
may by now have been discounted by the market, however, as indicated
by the decline of the 3-month bill to 4.56 per cent on January 27, the
day after the financing was announced.
Assuming that net borrowed reserves average around $100 million
during the next four weeks, the 3-month bill rate may average within a
construed in the market as consistent with an even keel policy. Departures

from this rate range are distinct possibilities, however, as markets
continue to adjust to a new structure of interest rates in an environ-
ment marked by uncertainties relating to Viet Nam--which may give rise
to short-run interest rate fluctuations over a wider range than has
generally characterized recent years.
In early February, during the period of Treasury financing
and heavy System buying for reserve purposes, the 3-month bill may remain
in the lower end of the range noted. Afterwards the rate might tend to
rise, although that will be strongly influenced by the strength of business
credit demands and the consequent aggressiveness with which banks are
led to bid for CD money.
Treasury financing operations may exert less upward pressure
on short-term markets over the remainder of the current fiscal year.
The Treasury has indicated that it would need to raise only $500 million
of additional new cash in the market, while $7.5 billion of tax bills
will be retired in March and June (typically about two-thirds of these
are turned in for taxes).
In the long-term market, the outlook points to upward pressures
on bond yields. The new 5 per cent coupon offered by the Treasury for
a 4-3/4 year issue may induce some further swapping out of longer-term
Governments. It may also attract investor funds that might otherwise have
gone into private long-term markets, either directly or through financial
intermediaries. The key factors in the bond market, however, will be the
size of the corporate calendar, which appears to be building up, and the
extent to which banks make further portfolio adjustments in Governments
and municipals.

Reserve flows, bank credit, and money
Recent developments. Total and nonborrowed reserves of banks
continued to rise in January, but the annual rates of increase--estimated
at 5.3 per cent and 5.9 per cent, respectively--were lower than the ex-
ceptional December rates. The expansion in reserves supported a 10 per
cent growth in total member bank deposits, slightly less than in December.
U.S. Government deposits showed a substantial increase during the month
as the Treasury raised about $3 billion in new cash. Private time and
savings deposits increased less in January than in December. Private
demand deposits reached a peak in early January and have since declined;
their increase in the month as a whole was less than in December.
Prospective developments. During the first two statement weeks
ending in February, according to projections, the System will have to
supply about $1 billion in reserves through open market operations to
offset reserve drains principally from float and currency movements.
In the following weeks the System is likely to be a small net seller
of securities of about half that amount.
Assuming business loan demand remains basically strong, non-
borrowed reserves in February may increase at a higher rate than in
January, though still below December. Banks may demand more reserves
next month partly because excess reserves had been worked down to
unseasonably low levels in January.
CONFIDENTIAL (FR) -5-
Over the next few months, private demand deposits may increase
at an appreciably slower pace than the 6.4 per cent rate of January,
perhaps between 4 and 5 per cent. In February, Government deposits are
expected to rise further as a result of growing tax receipts and this
will tend to restrain private deposit growth in that month.
Time and savings deposit growth, which was relatively slow
in January, could pick up somewhat in February if the very recent
increased availability of CD money to large city banks continues. But
the new Treasury offering of a 4-3/4 year note with a 5 per cent coupon
could make it harder for banks to attract and retain savings deposits.
All in all, no substantial change is likely in the annual rate of in-
crease for time and savings deposits in the months ahead from the 10
per cent December-January average.
The developments described above would imply a growth rate
over coming months in the daily average bank credit proxy somewhat below
the 9 per cent average of last year.
