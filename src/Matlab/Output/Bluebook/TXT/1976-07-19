Recent Developments
(1) M1 declined at a 1.2 per cent annual rate in June. Although
growth is expected to resume in July, expansion over the June-July period
is now projected at only a 2½ per cent annual rate, below the 3½ per cent
lower bound of the Committee's operating range. Growth in M2 slowed to a
ever, expansion in the time and savings deposit component of M2 also slowed
somewhat; passbook savings declined and growth in small-denomination time
deposits slackened, but there was a partially offsetting increase in large
non-negotiable CD's. These shifts apparently were prompted by the higher
interest rates generally available on market instruments and on bank CD's
following the increases of May. However, growth in bank time and savings
deposits (other than CD's) strengthened considerably in early July, and for
the June-July period, M2 is now projected to expand at a 7¾ per cent rate,
close to the mid-point of the Committee's range. Deposit growth slowed
in June at thrift institutions also.

(2) In the week following the June 22 Committee meeting, incoming
data suggested that over the June-July period M1 and M2 would expand at
rates not far from--although slightly below--the mid-points of their respec-
tive ranges. Accordingly, the Desk aimed at reserve availability consistent
with maintaining the then-prevailing Federal funds rate of 5-1/2 per cent.
The projected growth rates in the aggregates were lowered in the two sub-
sequent weeks, however, and the Desk became more accommodative in its reserve
provision, seeking to move the Federal funds rate toward 5-3/8 per cent in
the July 7 statement week and toward 5-1/4 per cent in the July 14 week.
Data becoming available in the current statement week have tended to support
the expectation of a low M1 growth rate, but the projection for M2 has been
raised somewhat. Under the circumstances, the Desk is continuing to aim for
an average funds rate around 5-1/4 per cent.
(3) Nonborrowed reserves appear to be increasing in the June-
July period at about a 4-1/2 per cent annual rate, less than the rate the
staff had thought would be consistent with the mid-points of the short-run
ranges for the monetary aggregates adopted by the FOMC at its last meeting.1/
This shortfall is due entirely to the slower-than-expected growth in demand
deposits, and therefore, in required reserves. The shortfall would have been
even greater had not the average level of excess reserves in the period
been raised substantially above projections by an unusually large buildup
of excess reserves during the July 7 statement week.
(4) Short-term interest rates have fallen 20 to 40 basis points
since the June Committee meeting. Following a period of stability in late
June, most rates began to move down near the end of the month, and they
declined further in early July as market participants responded to the
decline in the Federal funds rate. Business short-term credit demands
expanded somewhat in June for the second successive month, but the rise was
confined to the commercial paper market; businesses resumed their paydown
of bank debt. The Treasury continued to run off bills in its weekly auctions
in June and early July. However, with borrowing needs substantially greater
in the third quarter than in the second quarter, the Treasury has gradually
reduced the volume of bills redeemed weekly and it has announced that it will
roll over all maturing issues in next Monday's bill auction.
(5) The declines in short-term rates in early June were accom-
panied by reductions in bond yields of about 5 to 15 basis points. Bond
markets also were favorably influenced by the data that became available
during the period on prices and economic activity and by the prospect of
a greatly reduced calendar of new corporate and municipal bond issues in
July and August. For home mortgages, interest rates in the primary market
continued to edge higher until early July.

annual rates of change) related monetary and financial flows over various

Prospective developments
(7) Shown below for the Committee's consideration are three
alternative sets of longer-run growth ranges for the monetary aggregates,
together with the current ranges for the QI '76 to QI '77 period adopted
by the Committee in April. The alternatives pertain to the one-year period
from QII '76 to QII '77. More detailed figures, including quarterly average
levels and growth rates based on mid-point paths, are shown in the tables
on pages 5a and 5b. Projected patterns for the Federal funds rate are
shown for the three alternatives in Appendix table II.
Alt. A Alt. B Alt. C Current
M1 5½ to 8 4½ to 7 3½ to 6 4½ to 7
M2  9 to 11½ 7½ to 10 6½ to 9 7½ to 10
M3  9½ to 12½ 8 to 11 7 to 10 9 to 12
Credit Proxy 5½ to 8½ 5 to 8 4½ to 7½ 6 to 9
(8) Of the three alternatives, B encompasses the current range
for M1, which is centered on a 5¾ per cent growth rate. The current 7
to 10 per cent range for M2 appears to be generally consistent with that
M1 range. However, on the basis of recent experience, it appears that the
pattern of gradually rising short-term interest rates anticipated under
B would lead to a slowing of inflows to thrift institutions more consistent
with an 8 to 11 per cent range for M3. In connection with the M3 range,
it might be noted that the Committee did not reduce the upper bound at its
April meeting when it lowered the upper limits for M1 and M2.

(9) Alternatives A and C call for longer-run M1 ranges one
percentage point higher and lower, respectively, than that shown under
alternative B. Alternative C would compensate for the second-quarter
overshoot in M 1 , in that M1 would be expected to reach roughly the same
level in the first quarter of 1977 as that implied by a 5¾ per cent growth
rate measured from the first quarter of 1976. To reach this level, M1
would have to expand at about a 4¾ per cent annual rate over the three
quarters ending with the first quarter of 1977.
(10) Short-run operating ranges corresponding generally to the
longer-run alternatives are summarized below.
Alt. A Alt. B Alt. C
M1  5 to 9 4½ to 8½ 4 to 8
M2  9 to 13 8 to 12 7½ to 11½
Federal funds rate 4¼ to 5¼ 4¾ to 5¾ 5¼ to 6¼
(intermeeting period)
(11) Alternative B assumes a Federal funds rate range over the
next four weeks centered on 5¼ per cent, the Desk's most recent objective;
alternatives A and C assume some easing and some tightening, respectively.
Under all three alternatives, growth in M1 is expected to pick up
appreciably in the July-August period, on the assumption that various
factors which appear to have depressed M1 balances in June--despite rising
nominal GNP--will no longer be operating. These factors include the lagged
adjustment of money balances to desired levels following the April surge,
the unusually heavy use by corporations of demand deposit balances to make
tax payments in June, and an unexpected and probably temporary slowing
in currency growth. Also, a draw-down in the first half of July of the
Treasury's unusually high end-of-June cash balance may add, at least
temporarily, to private demand balances.
(12) Under alternative B, the annual rate of growth of M1 in the
July-August period is expected to be in a 4½ to 8½ range. (On average from
the second to the third quarter, M 1 is expected to grow at only a 4¾ per
cent annual rate for arithmetic reasons--specifically, because the second
quarter average is high relative to the June level.) Given the projection
for nominal GNP, if growth in M1 over the QII '76-QII '77 period is to be
constrained to 5¾ per cent--the mid-point of the alternative B longer-run
growth range--it is likely that short-term interest rates would have to
begin moving up later in the summer. Under this alternative, the funds rate
is expected to reach 7 per cent in early 1977 and to rise marginally further
in the spring.
(13) If the funds rate remains around 5¼ per cent over the next
four weeks, short-term interest rates are unlikely to change significantly.
Inflows of time and savings deposits other than negotiable CD's at banks
can be expected to be higher than in June as a result of the declines in
interest rates since mid-year. Over the July-August period, M2 might
expand at an annual rate in an 8 to 12 per cent range. As the year pro-
gresses, however, rising market rates would probably slow net inflows of
time and savings deposits somewhat. The alternative B projection assumes
an upward adjustment in Regulation Q ceilings in early 1977.
(14) Alternative C contemplates a modest tightening of the money
market over the next few weeks, with the Federal funds rate moving to the
rates undoubtedly would have to rise appreciably further if M1 growth over
the QII '76 to QII '77 period is to be constrained to the 4-3/4 per cent
mid-point of the longer-run range. By the spring of 1977, the funds rate
might be around 8-1/4 per cent. Under these circumstances, inflows of
funds into small-denomination deposits at banks and thrift institutions in
the first half of 1977 would be depressed by the greater relative attrac-
tiveness of rates on market instruments, even though under this alternative
Regulation Q ceilings are assumed to be relaxed in the fourth quarter of 1976.
(15) Alternative A contemplates more rapid growth in the monetary
aggregates over QII '76-QII '77--including a 6-3/4 per cent growth rate for
M1 --and some near-term easing of money market conditions, with the funds
rate range centering on 4-3/4 per cent. With economic expansion continu-
ing, however, it would be expected that interest rates would have to begin
rising in early fall, with the funds rate reaching 5-3/4 per cent by early
interest-bearing deposits would probably accelerate for a time and M2 and
M3 would remain quite strong into early winter--before slowing as rates on
market securities become more attractive.
(16) Over the July-August period, corporate and municipal bond
offerings are expected to recede more than seasonally from their recent
high levels. The Treasury is expected to take advantage of this reduced
forward calendar to continue its debt-lengthening operations. During the
third quarter the Treasury is expected to raise in the neighborhood of
$14 billion of new money, and it appears that about one-half of this amount
will be raised in the forthcoming intermeeting period. In addition, the
Treasury will also have to refund $4.6 billion of publicly held debt matur-
ing on August 15.
(17) Increases in bond yields over the balance of the year are
expected to be relatively small. Business and other credit demands on
banks can be expected to strengthen somewhat over the second half as inven-
tory and fixed capital expenditures increase and long-term borrowing slows.
Under alternative B, and especially under C, banks would be likely to reduce
their acquisitions of Treasury securities and to borrow in CD and Eurodollar
markets. Under alternative A, inflows of other deposits should reduce the
need for banks to rely on such sources of funds over the balance of the

(18) Presented below are four alternative formulations for
the operational paragraph of the directive. The first three are couched
in terms of desired growth in monetary aggregates over the months ahead
and are intended to correspond to the similarly lettered policy alternatives
discussed in the preceding section. The fourth alternative is proposed
