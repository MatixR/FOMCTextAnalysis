1  In some cases, original copies needed to be photocopied before being scanned into electronic 
format.  All scanned images were deskewed (to remove the effects of printer- and scanner-introduced 
tilting) and lightly cleaned (to remove dark spots caused by staple holes, hole punches, and other 
blemishes caused after initial printing). 
 
2 A two-step process was used.  An advanced optical character recognition computer program (OCR) 
first created electronic text from the document image.  Where the OCR results were inconclusive, 
staff checked and corrected the text as necessary.  Please note that the numbers and text in charts and

MONEY MARKET AND RESERVE RELATIONSHIPS
Recent developments
Money market conditions tightened in the first half of November,
despite a shallower level of net borrowed reserves. Net borrowed reserves
averaged about $230 million in the two latest statement weeks, as compared
with $340 million in the previous two weeks. Member bank borrowings edged
up over the past four weeks, but at the same time excess reserves moved to
a substantially higher level.
In the first half of November, Federal funds traded more fre-
quently at 6 per cent, and reached a new high effective rate of 6½ per cent
on one day early in the month. Dealer borrowing costs at New York City
banks rose and generally held within a new high range, including a rate of
to the Treasury bill market, with the 3-month issue moving up some 25 basis
points from its late October low to 5.46 per cent in the most recent weekly
auction. Bond yields also have risen in recent weeks, mainly in reaction
to large actual and prospective additions to the corporate and municipal
calendars and to rumors of a possible offering of FNMA participation
certificates later in the year.
Most recently, there has been some easing in money market
conditions, especially in bill rates. The sharp decline in bill rates
has reflected exceptionally strong bill demand from the public and
reduced dealer holdings of short-term bills.

November 18, 1966.
CONFIDENTIAL (FR) - 2 - November 18, 1966
The taut atmosphere in the central money market that obtained
until the last few days was partly related to a sharp deterioration in
the basic reserve positions of major money market banks, notably those in
New York. Recently major money market banks have again increased their
efforts to tap the Euro-dollar market for funds. In the four weeks ending
November 9, the net inflows of such funds totaled about $750 million,
almost as much as the record July inflow. However,in the succeeding week a
significant reflow, possibly associated with beginning of year-end window
dressing abroad, has occurred.
The reasons for the surge in borrowing abroad in October and early
November are not exactly clear, but it was probably related to the higher
cost of Federal funds recently, and to current and prospective problems of
replacing maturing CD's. The increase in foreign borrowing -- as well as
the recent tightening in money market conditions -- is also related to the
limited supply of reserve funds made available to banks through open market
operations and perhaps to reluctance to borrow from the Federal Reserve.
Final figures for October indicate that nonborrowed reserves declined at
a 7 per cent annual rate and total reserves at a 10 per cent rate in that
month. Such reserves have declined markedly since mid-summer, and as a
result they have now increased at rates of only 0.2 and 1.5 per cent,
respectively, since the beginning of the year. Indications are that the
flow of reserve funds to banks was less restrictive in the first half of
November than in October, with nonborrowed reserves rising considerably
more than seasonally.
CONFIDENTIAL (FR) - 3 - November 18, 1966
The decline in deposits supported by reserves in October was
reflected in rates of decline of almost 6.5 per cent in the money supply
and nearly 2.5 per cent in time deposits. With part of these declines
offset by increases in U.S. Government deposits, total member bank deposits
fell at a 3.5 per cent rate, the third successive month of decline. The
decline in bank credit in October (on an average daily basis) was somewhat
less than indicated by total deposits; borrowing from abroad would provide
a 1 percentage point offset to this decline.
Prospective developments
Money market conditions and marginal reserve levels, as they
have developed so far in November, appear consistent with about a 3 per
cent rate of decline in total member bank deposits for the month on average.
The large borrowing from abroad that developed in late October and continued
into early November would, however, largely offset this decline in terms
of bank credit effects unless year-end window dressing reflows continue.
Money supply in November is projected to increase at less than
a 1 per cent rate, a smaller increase than the 2-3 per cent rate projected
for that month in the previous blue book. This weaker money supply
performance seems mainly attributable to a smaller growth in loans than
was anticipated, including business loans, security loans, and loans to
finance companies. Time deposits at all commercial banks are still
projected to rise slightly for the month, while U.S. Government deposits
are expected to show a somewhat greater decline than anticipated three
weeks ago.
CONFIDENTIAL (FR) - 4 - November 18, 1966
Government deposits are expected to show an even larger decline
in December (seasonally adjusted), despite the $1.2 billion bill strip
financing to be paid on November 25 and a comparable amount of tax bills
assumed to be paid around mid-December. The Government deposit decline
reflects mainly our projections of Federal cash payments, which we expect
to run several hundred million dollars above a year ago throughout the
month. The decline in Government deposits is likely to be associated with
a marked resurgence in money supply growth, unless greater than seasonal
loan repayments extinguish deposits.
With Treasury deposits in tax and loan accounts reaching low
levels before mid-December, it is possible that the Treasury balance at
the Federal Reserve will be drawn to near zero and that the Treasury may
have to borrow directly from the System. Depending on their timing, such
developments could reduce the amount of reserves (currently estimated at
about $1 billion) that would have to be supplied by the System through
open market transactions with dealers between now and the first week of
December, or they could necessitate offsetting open market sales.
These possibilities suggest that some greater than usual
seasonal pressures on bill rates might develop in forthcoming weeks.
Dealer positions in longer term bills are fairly sizable at present,
and they may be augmented in current and prospective bill financings.
On the other hand, the relatively low dealer position in short-term bills
and the possibility of sustained bill demand as a result of CD run-offs
and of enlarged capital market issues may provide some offset. All in all,
CONFIDENTIAL (FR) - 5 - November 18, 1966
the 3-month bill may fluctuate in a 5.25-5.50 per cent range over the
next few weeks if net borrowed reserves remain in the $200-300 million
So long as the bill rate remains near the lower end of this range,
the CD run-off in December might be held down to the order of $600 million
or so and this probably would result in a slight further decline in total
member bank deposits. On the other hand, if the 3-month bill rises
toward the upper part of the 5.25-5.50 range, CD's will come under more
pressure and the run-off in December could approach the September-October
dimension of $1.2 billion per month.
It might well be necessary, however, to move net borrowed
reserves to a shallower level than has prevailed in the past two weeks
in order to keep bill rates from rising much above current levels. Under
such conditions, the Federal funds rate would be likely to drop to a
level averaging closer to 5 per cent, dealer financing costs should
decline further, and dealers would find it more comfortable to finance
their inventories -- not only of bills but also of coupon issues.
These developments would also tend to moderate rate pressures in long-
term markets, as expectations of monetary easing took hold.
It is doubtful that even these money market and net reserve
conditions, however, would result in any appreciable expansion in bank
credit between now and year-end. While the outlook is quite conjectural
at this early date -- given the uncertainties about defense spending and
about prospects for a more restrictive fiscal policy -- it looks at
CONFIDENTIAL (FR) - 6 - November 18, 1966
the moment as if encouragement of a moderate bank credit expansion in
December in, say, the 2-4 per cent annual rate range, would require a 3-
month bill rate moving down close to 5 per cent and a substantially more
comfortable net reserve position for banks, perhaps on the order of zero.
