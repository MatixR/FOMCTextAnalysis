format.  All scanned images were deskewed (to remove the effects of printer- and scanner-introduced 
tilting) and lightly cleaned (to remove dark spots caused by staple holes, hole punches, and other 
blemishes caused after initial printing). 
 
2 A two-step process was used.  An advanced optical character recognition computer program (OCR) 
first created electronic text from the document image.  Where the OCR results were inconclusive, 
staff checked and corrected the text as necessary.  Please note that the numbers and text in charts and

MONEY MARKET AND RESERVE RELATIONSHIPS
Recent Developments
(1) Long-term interest rates, as well as yields on short-term
instruments, continued to climb higher in the latter half of November
and in the first part of December. In early December, upward pressure
on rates was provided by normal seasonal factors, by the increase in the
prime loan rate at major banks to 6-1/2 per cent, by some reversal of
earlier foreign bill purchases, and by an unexpectedly sharp drop in the
Treasury balance at the Federal Reserve (with $92 million borrowing by
the Treasury for one day on December 10) which led to offsetting open
market sales by the System. Expectations of a tightening of monetary
policy, including a possible discount rate increase, also tended to exert
upward pressure on interest rates.
(2) The 3-month Treasury bill rate--which had been around
was most recently quoted around 5.90 per cent. Longer ratec, on both
Government and corporate securities, have risen around 20 basis points.
(3) In contrast to developments in the credit markets generally,
the market for day-to-day money was relatively comfortable throughout
most of the period with the effective Federal funds rate averaging around
and $450 million during the past three statement weeks. Borrowings have

fluctuated much more narrowly, averaging $515 million, little changed
from recent experience.
(4) The relative ease in the Federal funds market reflected
in part the improved basic reserve position of the major New York banks.
Their basic reserve deficiency averaged only around $570 million during
the last three statement weeks, as compared with an average of about
$1.2 billion since August. This sharp drop in the basic deficit of the
major money market banks was partly seasonal, as banks prepared for mid-
December pressures. But it more importantly reflected an apparent shift
in bank reserve management policies. With expectations of higher interest
rates becoming more prevalent, major banks reduced their dependence on
very short-term borrowings, and in some cases sought longer-term CD
funds; at the same time they became more willing lenders in the day-to-day
money market, with dealer financing costs for new money reduced to
around 6 per cent, or a bit above.
(5) Primarily because of the banks' success in attracting CD
funds at the end of November, time deposit growth in that month is
estimated to have been at a 14-1/2 per cent annual rate on average,
And, consequently, expansion of the bank credit proxy in November was
also adjusted upward to 11-1/2 per cent per annum on average. The late-
November strength in time deposit growth and in the bank credit proxy in
part carried over into early December and contributed to an upward
revision in the proxy projection for December to a level just above the
top of the 5-8 per cent range presented in the previous Blue Book.1/
add 1/2 percentage point.
(6) The unanticipated strength of the bank credit proxy led
to activation of the proviso clause in the directive. However, the
sharp rise in Treasury bill rates, under the influence of the factors
further pressure on Federal funds and dealer loan rates, and on member
bank reserve positions. The Desk did undertake sizable operations to
offset day-to-day tendencies toward money market ease, generated by
banks' increased desire to maintain a liquid position. This was mostly
accomplished through matched sale-purchase transactions, the volume of
which totalled almost $3 billion over the past two statement weeks, with
a daily average amount outstanding of $280 million.
(7) The money supply is now estimated to have increased at
an 11-1/2 per cent annual rate on average in November. Business loan
demand was exceptionally strong, and in the latter half of the month a
sharp drop in U.S. Government deposits contributed importantly to growth
in private demand deposits.

Prospective Developments
(9) With mid-December seasonal pressures about to ebb and with
an abatement in the corporate new issue volume over the holiday period,
there should be a tendency for interest rates to stabilize and, indeed,
for bill rates to back off from recent highs, assuming no change in
monetary policy. Treasury bill rates often tend to drift down in the
latter part of December and early January, with declines somewhat more
marked in the absence of net cash financings by the Treasury. (No Treasury
cash financing has been assumed for next month, although an additional
small cash borrowing in the market, probably through bills, might be
required, as an alternative to borrowing from the System around mid-
(10) The constellation of short-term and money market rates
is likely to be brought into greater harmony in the next few weeks
since upward pressure should develop on the Federal funds rate, which
has recently been low relative to bill rates. The upward pressure
would result from the usual seasonal enlargement of major banks' basic
reserve deficiency, and from banks' increased willingness to borrow
Federal funds, rather than sell relatively high-yielding Treasury bills,
in adjusting to expected CD run-offs. Under these circumstances, main-
taining the prevailing complex of money and short-term credit market
conditions would appear to be consistent with a Federal funds rate back
at around 6 per cent, and a Treasury bill rate edging down in a 5.60-
the Federal Reserve discount rate would tend to limit downward interest
rate movements, as dealers become more unwilling to hold securities.
Member bank borrowings averaging in a range of $450-650 million and net
borrowed reserves of about $150-450 million would be consistent with these
credit market conditions.
(11) With bill rates in the range specified above, we would
expect December CD run-off to total $1 to $1-1/4 billion, as compared
with a normal seasonal decline of around $800 million. Such a greater
than seasonal CD attrition in December, and continued contra-seasonal
losses in January, would put the bank credit proxy in December in an
Thus, for the two months together, we would expect a growth rate in the
proxy averaging 6-9 per cent, at an annual rate. (Euro-dollar borrowings
might add slightly to this range on average if unchanged from current
levels; but such borrowings have typically declined seasonally in the
latter half of December and risen in January.)
(12) Given the projected CD attrition, time deposit growth
is projected to be in a 15-18 per cent, annual rate, range in December,
dropping back to 8-11 per cent in January. The latter month will be
particularly affected by the carry-over effect of the CD attrition
expected in the latter half of December as well as by some likely
further CD run-off during the month itself. Moreover, the relatively
high level of market yields is also likely to lead to some slowing in
net inflows of consumer-type time and savings deposits.
(13) Growth in the money supply is likely to be considerably
slower in December--in a 3-6 per cent annual rate range--and may taper
further in January. Demand deposit growth is expected to be moderate,
with interest rates remaining on the high side and assuming a step-down
in demands for business loans.
(14) Policy alternative. If the Committee decides to seek
firmer credit conditions, it might wish to consider a complex including
a Federal funds rate around 6-1/8--6-1/4 per cent, member bank borrowings
in a $550-$750 million range, and net borrowed reserves $250-550 million.
Under such conditions, the 3-month bill rate might move in a 5.75-6.10
per cent band. A rise in bill rates from current levels would tend to
be limited by seasonal demands for bills as well as by efforts of in-
vestors to stay short in a period of developing credit market tightness.
Announcement effects from the use of other monetary policy instruments
at this time might tend to intensify upward interest rate pressures,
although it would appear that the market may have already more than
discounted an increase of 1/4 percentage point in the discount rate
taken by itself.
(15) A move toward restraint initiated promptly after the
December 17 Committee meeting would likely lead to greater CD attrition
in December and in January than assumed in paragraph (11). As long as
the 3-month bill rate remains somewhat above the bottom of the projected
range given in paragraph (14), it is likely that the investment yield
on Treasury bills along the whole maturity spectrum would be at least
at Regulation Q ceiling levels, and in many cases would be above such
levels. In an effort to replace CD's, banks would turn more and more to
the Euro-dollars market. Individual banks would also increase demands
in the Federal funds market and at the discount window
(16) While Euro-dollars and the discount window may enable
banks as a group to postpone, or make less drastic, portfolio adjust-
ments, at some point they will have to cut back on expansion in earning
assets. Initially, security markets, particularly the municipal market,
will probably take the main burden of such adjustments, followed by re-
duced lending in mortgage and other sectors. In this process, the bank
credit proxy is likely to show slower growth. Only a little slowing may
become evident in December, with the principal effects likely to be in
January and thereafter. Growth in the bank credit proxy could be in
a 2 to 5 per cent range, on average, in January, or possibly lower as
banks make sales of securities that had been postponed to the new year
for tax purposes. Euro-dollar borrowings would provide some leeway, but
the likely amount is difficult to gaugesince it will depend in part on
reactions of foreign monetary authorities.
(17) Longer-term interest rates are likely to rise even
further under these conditions, at least over the short-run. The
constraint on bank credit growth may lead to some acceleration of
corporate borrowing in capital markets, as businesses attempt to
hold on to, or build up, liquidity for financing future expenditures
in a period of credit tightness. The strength and duration of any
rise in long-term rates, however, will depend in part on how market
participants evaluate the likely success of monetary moves in stemming
inflation and inflationary psychology, and on the rapidity with which
State and local governments and home builders reduce their demands in view
of the lessened availability of funds from both banks and other financial
