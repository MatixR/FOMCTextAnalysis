MONETARY POLICY ALTERNATIVES
Recent Developments
(1) Over most of the interval since the October FOMC meet-
ing, the Desk sought to maintain existing reserve market pressures.
The allowance for adjustment plus seasonal borrowing initially was
kept at $325 million but over the first two complete maintenance
periods it was reduced in three technical adjustments of $25 million
each to allow for the declining trend of seasonal borrowing.1 The
federal funds rate averaged near the 5-1/4 percent level expected by
the FOMC through the first maintenance period and most of the second,
before drifting off late in that period, reflecting market anticipa-
tion of an imminent policy easing that was reinforced when a need to
drain reserves was deliberately not met on settlement day in the con-
text of an ongoing Committee consultation. In response to signs of
flagging consumer and business confidence and a weaker-than-expected
economic recovery, reviewed at that consultation, the borrowing
allowance was reduced by $25 million on Thursday, the first day of the
current period. Consistent with this change, the expected trading
area for federal funds was lowered to 5 percent, where the federal
funds rate settled late in the week. Also on Thursday, another tech-
nical reduction of $50 million was made in the borrowing allowance,
bringing the current allowance to $175 million.
(2) Over the first three weeks of the intermeeting period,
short-term market interest rates declined somewhat, as market par-
ticipants interpreted incoming data as generally pointing to continued
economic sluggishness. Long-term market rates, by contrast, backed up
considerably over these weeks as data on consumer prices proved disap-
pointing, oil prices firmed, and discussions of possible fiscal stimu-
lus measures prompted renewed concerns about federal deficits and
borrowing. Subsequently, both short- and long-term rates moved down
appreciably in reaction to information suggesting additional economic
weakness, more favorable labor cost and GNP price data, and the
renewed anticipation of further monetary policy easing. Since the
last FOMC meeting, short rates are down 35 to 45 basis points. The
prime rate, however, remained at 8 percent. Rates on Treasury notes
also declined, but at the longest maturity, bond rates were up on
balance by around 10 basis points. Primary-market yields on mortgages
fell to their lowest levels since 1977, spurring mortgage refinanc-
ings. Although some stock price indexes touched record highs during
the intermeeting period, most indexes were up only a little on net.
(3) The dollar's foreign exchange value on a weighted aver-
age basis is down about 1 percent on balance since the last Committee
meeting. The dollar was generally higher over the first half of the
intermeeting period but was weakened significantly by the stream of
negative reports on the U.S. economy and by the anticipated U.S.
policy easing. The yen was especially strong, bolstered by increasing
market focus on Japan's burgeoning external surpluses and possible
implications for Japanese policy. Three-month interest rates in Japan
declined about as much as U.S. rates, while German short-term rates
rose by 15 basis points. Long-term rates in both Germany and Japan
were little changed over the period. -----------------------------

(4) M2 and M3 resumed modest expansion in October, at rates
of 3 and 1 percent, respectively, which were close to their 3 and
economic sluggishness. Long-term market rates, by contrast, backed up
considerably over these weeks as data on consumer prices proved disap-
pointing, oil prices firmed, and discussions of possible fiscal stimu-
lus measures prompted renewed concerns about federal deficits and
borrowing. Subsequently, both short- and long-term rates moved down
appreciably in reaction to information suggesting additional economic
weakness, more favorable labor cost and GNP price data, and the

(4) M2 and M3 resumed modest expansion in October, at rates
of 3 and 1 percent, respectively, which were close to their 3 and
at a time of declining money-market yields. In addition, bank liabili-
ties within M3 expanded more rapidly to fund faster growth of bank
(6) Most of the step-up in bank credit in October reflected a
pickup in securities acquisitions, although the contraction in total
loans also slowed. C&I loans expanded for the second consecutive month,
but at a much reduced rate. A recent survey of bank loan officers pro-
vided little evidence of a further tightening of business loan standards
and instead suggested that such loans continued to be held down by weak
demand. Firms with access to capital markets maintained their reliance
on proceeds of bond and equity issuance, reflecting the reduced financing
costs on such instruments as well as firms' efforts to strengthen balance
sheets. Offerings of tax-exempt bonds also continued at a rapid clip in
October, in part as a number of governmental units resorted to extraordi-
nary measures to finance budgetary shortfalls. The very limited avail-
able data pertaining to household-sector borrowing in October suggest
little buoyancy. Consumer loans at banks, adjusted for securitization,
contracted for the second month in a row, even though no surveyed loan
officers reported less willingness to extend consumer loans and some
reported more. The pickup in mortgage refinancing activity has not
translated into much of a boost to mortgage borrowing, as homeowners
appear to be motivated more by lowering interest costs than by extracting
equity. Underlying the continued light borrowing by nonfederal sectors
has been the slow pace of income growth as well as the tendency of
households and businesses to deleverage balance sheets. Federal
borrowing in October stayed heavy, however, despite a marked slowdown in
deposit insurance outlays. Total domestic nonfinancial sector debt in
October likely edged further above the 4-1/2 percent lower limit of its
monitoring range.

Policy Alternatives
(7) Two alternatives are presented below for consideration
by the Committee. Under alternative B, federal funds would continue
to trade around 5 percent in combination with adjustment plus seasonal
borrowing of $175 million.3  Under alternative A, the federal funds
rate would move down to 4-1/2 percent, achieved either through a 1/2
percentage point cut in the discount rate with the same level of bor-
rowing as under alternative B or through open market operations that
lowered the borrowing level to $125 million. In the latter case, the
decline in the funds rate to 1/2 percentage point below the discount
rate would cause borrowing to fall to frictional levels. A bit more
volatility in the federal funds rate would be implied as the discount
window becomes a little less effective buffer to disturbances in the
reserves market.
(8) Monetary growth rates under the two alternatives are
presented in the table below. (More detailed information is shown in
the table and charts on the following pages.) Under both alternatives
M2 would finish the year at or a shade above, and M3 a touch below,
the lower bounds of their ranges. As discussed in previous bluebooks,
growth in the broader aggregates this year is being unusually de-
pressed by the downsizing of the thrift industry, weak lending by
commercial banks, portfolio shifts by the public into capital market
instruments, and the process of deleveraging by households and busi-
nesses. Slow expansion this year in M2 and M3, combined with the
staff's forecast of 3-1/2 percent annual growth for nominal GNP,
implies increases in their velocities this year, despite the large
declines in short-term market interest rates and related opportunity
costs. M1 evidently has responded to the reduction in its opportunity
costs much more in line with historical patterns, although some of the
strength in M1 this year has come from a continuation of unusually
heavy demands for currency aboard. Narrow money is expected to grow
by at least 7-1/2 percent this year, well in excess of nominal income.

(9) The markets appear to have built in a high probability
of a further easing move in the period just ahead, and thus with the
unchanged funds rate of alternative B, other market interest rates may
tend to firm. The reversal in yields would be modest should incoming
data on the real economy point more decisively to faltering near-term
expansion, as in the staff forecast, engendering the expectation that
the next easing has only been postponed. Any rise in long-term yields
also would be mitigated to the extent that indications of a softening
in the economic outlook were seen as improving prospects for disinfla-
tion. However, quality spreads on bank and corporate debt would widen
marginally if the market's economic outlook turns more downbeat. If
rates do firm a little, the dollar could rise a bit on foreign ex-
change markets.

(10) M2 would be expected to continue to expand at a 3 per-
cent rate in the November and December period under alternative B, the
same as expected at the October FOMC meeting. The negative impact on
M2 of the weaker picture for income and spending growth is likely to
be about offset by the effects on opportunity costs of the most recent
policy easing and by what promises to be a larger than previously
expected slowdown in RTC resolution activity in the fourth quarter.
In October, resolutions fell to a much reduced level that now seems
likely to persist through year-end owing to legislative delays, which
largely removes one restraining influence on retail deposits. Growth
of demand deposits, however, is expected to fall back from October's
atypical surge and show through to a slowing in M1 growth to a 7-1/4
percent pace over November and December.4  In the fourth quarter of
this year, M2 expansion at a 2 percent rate on a quarterly average
basis would imply a rise in its velocity of 1-1/2 percent at an annual
rate, down markedly from the 4-1/2 percent pace of the third quarter.
Under this policy alternative, M2 would be on a trajectory to enter
of 2-1/2 to 6-1/2 percent.
(11) M3 under alternative B is seen as continuing to grow at
a 1 percent annual rate over November and December, which would mean
this aggregate would be entering next year around the bottom of its
tentative 1992 range of 1 to 5 percent. Despite the reduced
projection for RTC activity, growth of M3 over the rest of the year is
likely to be a little slower than expected at the last FOMC meeting.
The weaker outlook for M3 stems from our anticipation that the
substitution of non-M3 liabilities for Yankee CDs at branches and
agencies of foreign banks surfacing in October probably will persist
to some degree. Projected weakness in bank credit continues to damp
the outlook for M3. Growth of C&I loans will be anemic owing to
continued restraint by banks and, more important, to weak demand.
Business outlays for fixed capital and inventories are likely to be
soft, and offerings in bond and equity markets should remain robust,
as those firms that can access these markets seek to strengthen
balance sheets. Lending for commercial properties will remain
depressed by sustained difficulties in this sector. Household mort-
gage growth will be restrained by the modest recovery in housing
activity envisioned in the staff forecast. Consumer credit should
contract further over the remainder of the year, largely reflecting
subdued spending on durables. In the aggregate, borrowing of domestic
nonfederal sectors is expected to remain sluggish through year-end.
In contrast, federal borrowing will stay brisk to finance a burgeoning
deficit. Overall debt of domestic nonfinancial sectors is expected to
register a 5 percent rate of expansion over the September-to-December
period, placing growth for the year about 1/2 percentage point above
the bottom of the FOMC's 4-1/2 to 8-1/2 percent monitoring range for
this aggregate.
(12) The easing contemplated in alternative A exceeds that
now envisioned by the markets and thus money market interest rates
would decline, perhaps by at least 1/4 percentage point. Long-term
rates, too, would come under some downward pressure, although declines
would be muted if earlier market concerns about the stickiness of
inflation reemerge at some point. The prime rate probably would be
lowered 1/2 percentage point, still preserving the recently widened
spread over funding costs. The dollar likely would fall somewhat on
foreign exchange markets.
(13) M2 is projected to strengthen to a 4 percent rate by
December under alternative A and would be entering the new year well
into its tentative range. Enlarged inflows to liquid deposits would
boost both its nontransactions and M1 components, as sluggish deposit
rates contribute to the attractiveness of such accounts. Tending to
limit the pickup in M2, though, would be declines in rates on retail
CDs and money funds in relation to expected returns on capital market
instruments; also, cost pressures might induce more banks to overcome
their hesitancy to lower rates on passbook and NOW accounts, which
could prompt established customers to reconsider investment options
and move account balances to market instruments.
(14) Under alternative A, M3 would expand at a 1-1/4 percent
rate in November and December, on a trajectory to begin the new year
within its tentative range. Buoying M3 would be heightened inflows to
institution-only money market funds, whose holders would respond to
the temporary improvement in their yields relative to those of money
market instruments. In addition, banks' needs for M3 liabilities
would be raised by a little additional lending. Improvement in some
lending margins and firmer asset values would enhance access of many
banks to capital and funding markets and encourage lending to some
previously marginal credits. Nevertheless, the major credit-market
beneficiaries of the easing would continue to be those more highly
rated credits having ready access to the commercial paper and capital
