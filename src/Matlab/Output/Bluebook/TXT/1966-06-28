MONEY MARKET AND RESERVE RELATIONSHIPS
Money markets
Recent developments. Bill rates moved even further out of
touch with other short-term rates during recent weeks. The 3-month bill
declined below the discount rate and was quoted as low as 4.34 per cent
during the past few days, before turning up on Friday. Rates on short-
term Federal Agency issues have also edged down to levels slightly below
their early June peaks, as the market has digested the recent influx of
new issues.
Other short-term rates, however, have remained stable or
advanced slightly further. This week major New York banks have posted
a 5½ per cent rate on 3-month CD's, and there are reports of prime banks
willing to pay that rate on one-month maturities. Federal funds have
traded at 5½ per cent in the last few days and even touched 5-5/8 per
cent, in the backwash of loan demand related to accelerated tax pay-
ments; and dealer loan rates rose further to a new high of 5-7/8 per
cent in New York.
Net borrowed reserves after revision averaged about $325 million
over the two statement weeks ending June 15, somewhat below their May
average, but rose to $417 million in the latest statement week. Member
bank borrowings were relatively low by recent standards in the week
ending June 8--the second half of a country bank settlement period--but
increased to an average of $740 million during the past two statement

June 9. June 24, 1966.
CONFIDENTIAL (FR) - 2 - June 24, 1966
The gathering tightness in the banking system as the period
progressed tended to focus on major banks in New York, whose basic
reserve deficiency (net borrowed reserves plus net Federal funds
purchases) worsened sharply in the latest statement week. This
worsening was larger than normally occurs in the first few days after
the mid-June tax date and was related in part to the continued loan
demand to help corporations make accelerated payments to the Treasury
of withheld individual income and social security taxes.
Prospective developments. Assuming net borrowed reserves
over the next four weeks remain around the $370 million average of the
past two statement weeks, one might expect some shifting of relationships
within the constellation of money market conditions but continued market
tightness over-all. Treasury bill rates may continue low in the period
immediately ahead in view of the extremely short market supply of bills
and of the System's need to supply about $1 billion of reserves over
the July 4 holiday period. Subsequently, bill rates are likely to rise,
and perhaps rapidly. Banks will be reversing window-dressing operations,
investor demand for bills may be reduced as the volume of new capital
market issues tapers off in early summer, and high financing costs will
begin to bite as dealer bill positions rise. A most important factor
in the bill market, however, will be the Treasury's decision with
respect to the size and timing of any tax bill financing.
Once the current tax-related burst of loan demand at banks
passes, there may be some easing in the Federal funds rate. Dealer
loan rates would also tend to decline somewhat, but should remain on
CONFIDENTIAL (FR)
the high side so long as basic loan demands are strong and banks encounter
difficulties finding CD funds.
The relatively light July calendar for corporate and municipal
issues suggests that credit demands will not place much upward pressure
on long-term rates over the next four weeks, although shifting expecta-
tions could lead to some rate rise. Moreover, it is possible that
recent declines in yields on Treasury notes and bonds may be at least
partially reversed in response to investor switching into attractively
priced Agency, municipal, and corporate issues and to possible selling
by financial institutions under liquidity pressure,
The extent of savings outflows from nonbank savings institu-
tions after midyear and the likely responses of the institutions them-
selves and of the regulatory authorities are among market uncertainties
that will be resolved soon. If such savings outflows are sizable and
if the Federal Reserve provides assistance to the institutions involved
one way or another through the discount function, both market expecta-
tions and open market operations might be affected in the short-run.
To the extent that any such Federal Reserve lending is allowed
outside the conventional Regulation A constraints, the System may need
to make substantially offsetting open market sales of securities in
order to guard against an incidental easing of credit conditions, at
least over the short-run, in the process of providing assistance through
the discount window to a particular sector of the market. However,
it is difficult to foresee the net outcome of so complex a situation--
- 3 - June 24, 1966
CONFIDENTIAL (FR) - 4 - June 24, 1966
coming as it would amidst all the already existing uncertainties as to
Vietnam, fiscal policy, and monetary policy actions. One possibility
is that resulting shifts in market expectations could lead to upward
interest rate movements. Such expectations could also be generated by
more widespread announcements of increases in rates paid by nonbank
savings institutions.
In so potentially fluid a situation, compounded by a combina-
tion of changing financial asset preferences and public policies, money
market conditions may need to be given more than the usual degree of
emphasis in the conduct of open market operations. Under the circum-
stances, an effort to achieve somewhat deeper net borrowed reserves
(say to persistently around $450 million), apart from any special
Federal Reserve lending outside ordinary Regulation A constraints,
would have to be undertaken cautiously. Such a net borrowed reserve
level would intensify upward pressure on interest rates. But the
degree of pressure would depend on whether this was interpreted as just
one further step toward an even deeper net borrowed number and on
whether or not the market expected Regulation Q ceilings and the
discount rate to be raised.
Reserve flows, bank credit, and money
Recent developments. On the basis of estimates for the
first three weeks in June, expansion in bank credit on average for
all of the month probably will be atabout a 5 per cent rate, slightly
less than anticipated at the beginning of the month. Credit expansion
CONFIDENTIAL (FR) - 5 - June 24, 1966
was slow in the first half, but picked up sharply on and after the mid-
month tax date. As a result, the bank credit increase measured from
the beginning to the end of June is likely to be about 13 per cent.
Private demand deposits are likely to expand at a 15 per cent
annual rate for June, although the impact of new tax speed-ups makes it
more than usually difficult to estimate both private and Government
demand deposits for the last two weeks of the month. The estimated
rapid expansion in private demand deposits this month is being offset
in part by a larger than anticipated decline in Government demand
deposits, seasonally adjusted. Time and savings deposits in June
appear to be growing at a slower rate than in May.
These June estimates imply expansion rates for the first half
of 1966 as a whole somewhat below those for the year 1965 for bank
credit, time deposits, and nonborrowed reserves. The credit proxy
has increased at an annual rate of 7 per cent thus far this year,
compared with 9 per cent in 1965; nonborrowed reserves have increased
at about 2.5 per cent this year, compared with 4.2 last year; and time
deposits have grown by 9.5 per cent compared to 16 per cent last year.
On the other hand, money supply and total reserves have increased almost
as rapidly as last year--4.7 and 5 per cent respectively.
Prospective developments. The rapid increase of bank credit
over the latter part of June may slow down as July progresses, but the
average increase in July is likely to be relatively large--perhaps in
the order of 9-11 per cent. The large increase in July reflects in part
CONFIDENTIAL (FR) - 6 - June 24, 1966
the delayed impact on the monthly averages of the late June rise.
But also during next month further acceleration of corporate payments
to the Treasury of withheld individual income and social security taxes
may add to basically strong business loan demands. Furthermore, any
substantial borrowing at banks by nonbank financial institutions to
meet concentrated savings withdrawals would serve to enlarge bank credit
totals. The current projection also does not assume a Treasury cash
financing in July but if there is one, it is likely to be more toward
the end of the month and therefore would have only a comparatively
small effect on the average credit expansion.
Several factors make the outlook for time deposit growth
particularly uncertain in the weeks ahead. Perhaps the principal unknown
is how banks will fare after the midyear interest-crediting date when
an outflow of funds from nonbank savings institutions is widely antici-
pated. Recent announced rate increases by nonbank savings institutions
may tend to restrain growth in consumer-type time deposits at banks.
With respect to negotiable CD's, the availability of funds for invest-
ment in them has probably been limited recently by corporate needs to
make accelerated tax payments of one sort or another and by competition
from Federal agency issues. Still, at the current level of market rates--
and with the bulk of the recent agency issues absorbed into the market--
banks may find that they can increase outstanding CD's some in the
period ahead. Over-all, time and savings deposits may rise at a pace
perhaps no more rapid than the 8-10 per cent annual rate of the past
two months and perhaps by less.
CONFIDENTIAL (FR) - 7 - June 24, 1966
On our current projections Government deposits are expected
to decline less than seasonally in July, even assuming no Treasury
cash financing. This may hold down the growth of private demand
deposits (and money supply) over the short-run. Over the longer run,
there is little reason to expect any significantly lower rate of growth
in money than the 4.7 per cent rate of the first half of this year,
assuming no let-up in basic loan demands. This outlook adds up to an
annual rate of expansion for total required reserves, seasonally
adjusted, in the order of 10 per cent during July on average.
