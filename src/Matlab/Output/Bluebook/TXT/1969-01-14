MONEY MARKET AND RESERVE RELATIONSHIPS
Recent Developments
(1) Since the last Committee meeting, most yields in money
and credit markets have moved markedly higher, with short-term rates
generally up 25 to 50 basis points. The yield increases reflected
the interaction of monetary policy moves, seasonal strains in short-
term markets here and abroad, and shifts in market attitudes. The
announcement of the discount rate increase, the accompanying tighter
open market posture, the maintenance of Regulation Q ceilings, and two
successive jumps in the prime loan rate all served to convince market
participants that credit expansion was likely to be curtailed.
(2) Under the circumstances, the 3-month Treasury bill rate
rose sharply to a peak of around 6.29 per cent on December 24. However,
bill market pressures subsequently moderated, and the 3-month bill closed
on January 10 at 6.11 per cent. In the past several days, there has
been sizable demand for bills from, among others, State and local
governments and corporations--including investors who are switching
funds out of CD's. The recent Treasury announcement of a $1-3/4 billion
June tax bill to be auctioned January 14 and paid January 20 through
(3) The effective Federal funds rate fluctuated widely
since the last Committee meeting, reflecting in part money market
churning related to the aftermath of large mid-December tax payments
and to year-end window-dressing activities. In general, the Federal
funds rate was most frequently in a 6-1/4 - 6-5/8 per cent band,
although an effective rate of 6-7/8 per cent, with trading as high
as 7-1/8 per cent, was reported on the Friday preceding the year-end
statement date. New loan rates to dealers reported in New York have
largely followed the pattern of the Federal funds rate and have often
been in a 6-3/4 - 7 per cent range, although even higher rates have
been posted at times when reserve pressures have been particularly
(4) Member bank borrowings averaged about $815 million
during the most recent four statement weeks, compared with $515 million
in the preceding four weeks. The sharp rise in average borrowing over
the past four statement weeks includes the exceptionally high borrowing
levels in the week ending December 25 and particularly in the week
ending January 1. In the latter week borrowing reached a 16 year high
of $1.3 billion, influenced by year-end statement date maneuvering,
large CD run-offs at the end of the month, and a sharp mainly seasonal
drop in Euro-dollar availabilities. But much of the additional borrow-
ing was offset by large accumulations of excess reserves, and average
net borrowed reserves deepened by only around $90 million from the
preceding four week period to around $380 million.
(5) Given existing Regulation Q ceilings, banks have been
unable to avoid substantial attrition of maturing large denomination
CD's and there is also some evidence of diminished net inflows of
consumer-type time and savings deposits. Thus, a pronounced slowing in
bank credit expansion is developing. However, the bank credit proxy in
December still showed an average annual rate of expansion of around
is made for the reductions in the level of the banks' Euro-dollar borrowing.
Growth in the money supply and in time deposits took place at rates of
around 6 and 14-1/2 per cent, respectively, in December on average.
(6) The CD run-off in December as a whole now appears to
have been about $1.5 billion, or about $600 million more than seasonal.
The CD attrition in December and, from early signs, the further attrition
in January have been concentrated at large money market banks. But partial
data covering the interest-crediting period suggest more widespread
slackening in net inflows of consumer-type time and savings deposits.
(7) The following table summarizes the rates of change in
major reserve and deposit aggregates since late 1967. The recent policy
actions will begin to show most of their impact on the magnitudes in
data for January, as indicated in the succeeding paragraphs.

Prospective Developments
(8) The specification of money and short-term market condi-
tions over the coming three weeks is complicated by the combination of
a heightened market sensitivity to indicators construed as reflecting
policy, potentially very large CD run-off at banks, and a fairly sizable
Treasury refunding operation in prospect possibly in combination with
additional cash borrowing. The Treasury's recent announcement of addi-
tional June tax bills still leaves $1-1/2 - $2 billion or so of new
money to be raised before early March. This may be raised in connection
with, or around the time of, the mid-February refunding of $5.4 billion
of publicly-held maturing issues; the refunding will be announced around
the end of January. Finally, market conditions generally will be in-
fluenced, of course, by the forthcoming budgetary estimates in the
Budget Document, and especially the handling of the surtax.
(9) Money market conditions will also be affected by the
extent to which banks attempt to moderate or postpone further loan and
portfolio adjustments by short-term borrowing at the discount window or
in the Federal funds and Euro-dollar markets, and by the extent to which
dealers are willing to take positions in the forthcoming financings.
On balance, it appears likely that money market conditions consistent
with a market appraisal of an unchanged stance for open market operations
might involve a Federal funds rate frequently around 6-3/8 - 6-1/2 per
cent, member bank borrowings in a $550-$800 million range, and net
borrowed reserves of $250 to $600 million.
(10) The 3-month bill rate consistent with these conditions
may be in a 6 to 6-1/4 per cent range, assuming a CD run-off of the
order magnitude specified in paragraph (12) below. The technical
position of the bill market is good, with dealer bill holdings relatively
low, particularly shorter maturities. Thus, there is a possibility
that the 3-month bill rate could drop below 6 per cent for "scarcity"
reasons, especially if there should be sizable liquidity demands,
including demands from investors temporarily out of the stock market
or switching from CD's. However, the supply of new bills being offered
by the Treasury will tend to replenish dealer total holdings of bills
as banks quickly sell off the newly offered tax bills; and the System is
likely to be a net seller to the market in the latter part of January.
(11) Dealer holdings of coupon issues are also down, as
they managed a further net reduction of around $280 million in such
issues maturing in over a year (the great bulk in the 5-10 year area)
during the past month of rising interest rates. Thus, the dealer
market is in a fairly good position to participate in the forthcoming
financings, but the ability and willingness of banks to acquire and
hold U.S. Government securities is quite limited, given current
Regulation Q ceilings. As a result, one might expect some upward
interest rate pressures in the process of distributing securities to
holders largely outside the banking system. However, the prospects of
large net debt repayment in the spring--estimated at around $10-1/2
billion over the four months March through June (mainly maturing tax
bills)--should at least moderate upward interest rate pressures, and
could even lead to some interest rate decline, particularly in the bill
market as time goes on.
(12) Largely because of continued and contra-seasonal CD
attrition likely under present interest rate relationships, expansion
in the bank credit proxy in January may drop into a 0 to 3 per cent,
annual rate, range, given the money and short-term market conditions
and (10)
If Lhe 3-month bill rate were to move close to the lower end of its
projected range--for expectational or other reasons--bank credit would
be more likely to rise at around, or somewhat above, the upper end of
the range projected for it, since banks might be able to moderate CD
attrition. Assuming, however, a bill rate averaging near the middle
of the 6 - 6-1/4 per cent range, the staff has projected a decline in
outstanding CD's of around $1-1/4 to $1-1/2 billion for January. This
would be about the same actual decline as in December, but, because
outstanding CD's normally rise in January (and decline in December),
it would be much more of a decline seasonally adjusted than in the
previous month.
(13) Net inflows of consumer-type time and savings deposits
at banks are likely to be on the weak side in January, as consumers also
take advantage of high market yields. This taken together with the
expected CD attrition is likely to lead to some decline in the average
level of outstanding time and savings deposits in January--perhaps by
a 1 to 4 per cent annual rate.
(14) The money supply, enigmatically, is expected to rise
rather sharply in January, on average, possibly in a 7 - 10 per cent,
annual rate range. A very substantial expansion in money supply
developed at the end of December and in early January, and this acts
to augment the average for the month of January, even though substantial
declines in outstanding cash balances are projected over the remainder
of the month. No obvious explanation is at hand for the very recent
money supply growth, although it is possible that large transfers
around year-end--e.g., corporate payments to pension funds, repatriation
of liquid funds from abroad, and churning associated with switches
from CD's to market securities--may have led to some temporary accumulations
of cash in a period of uncertainty.
(15) There is very little reason at this point to expect
any significantly stronger bank credit performance in February than in
January. The further Treasury financing may enhance credit demands on
banks. But banks' ability to expand resources to accommodate Treasury
and other demands is likely to remain constrained under existing
Regulation Q ceilings. While there is a possibility that short-term
market rates could decline somewhat in the course of February--perhaps
after the financing period--further CD attrition at banks still appears
a likely outcome for the month as a whole. Moreover, private demand
deposits may well decline rather substantially for the month, on
average, as the various new Treasury issues are sold off to the
nonbank public.
(16) The outlook presented in this Blue Book is, in a sense,
sanguine in that a severe crunch on the banking system and credit
markets is not forecast. The basic reason for this is a presumption
that the market will be expecting a slowing in business activity, and
that private demands for credit will be relatively moderate. However,
it is possible that as a substantial CD run-off continues through
January and into February banks may become less and less willing to
hold onto the State and local government issues bought last year and
to continue making real estate loans in size. It is also possible that
savings withdrawals from nonbank institutions could be greater than
industry expectations. Under these circumstances, debt markets could
become severely strained at a time when a large Treasury refunding is
in process. And the odds on such a development would be enhanced if
business developments do not show signs of an economic slowing and
moderation of inflationary pressures.
