Prefatory Note 
 
 
The attached document represents the most complete and accurate version available 
based on original copies culled from the files of the FOMC Secretariat at the Board 
of Governors of the Federal Reserve System.  This electronic document was created 
through a comprehensive digitization process which included identifying the best-
preserved paper copies, scanning those copies,1 and then making the scanned 
versions text-searchable.2   Though a stringent quality assurance process was 
employed, some imperfections may remain. 
 
Please note that some material may have been redacted from this document if that

format.  All scanned images were deskewed (to remove the effects of printer- and scanner-introduced 
tilting) and lightly cleaned (to remove dark spots caused by staple holes, hole punches, and other 
blemishes caused after initial printing). 
 
2 A two-step process was used.  An advanced optical character recognition computer program (OCR) 
first created electronic text from the document image.  Where the OCR results were inconclusive, 
staff checked and corrected the text as necessary.  Please note that the numbers and text in charts and

Recent developments
(1) For April and May combined, growth in reserves available to suppor)
private nonbank deposits (RPD)--at a 7-1/2 per cent annual rate 1/ --appears to be
within the 7--11 per cent range targeted for this period by the Committee, as
shown in the attached Table 1. While revised RPD figures have been published,
the data shown in Table 1 are based on the old series since this was the yard-
stick used by the Committee and the Desk. The old figures are compared with
the new revised RPD series in the Appendix beginning on page 12.
(2) Growth rates of M1 and M2 were both close to the 8 per cent
annual rates desired by the Committee in April. However, expansion in the
adjusted credit proxy--at nearly a 14 per cent annual rate --was substantially
above the rate projected as being consistent with these money supply growth
rates at the last meeting. The unexpected strength in the proxy reflected
greater than anticipated strength in both Government deposits and large CD's.
(3) In May, with Government deposits continuing to increase--instead
of dropping sharply as projected--the unexpectedly large expansion in the proxy
has persisted. Growth in M1, on the other hand, fell substantially short of
expectations in the first two weeks of May, perhaps reflecting post-tax date
clearances of April personal income tax checks, which appear
to have been both unusually heavy and unusually slow this year. Preliminary
data for the week ending May 17 indicate a large resurgence in M1 growth--as
might be expected once the negative effect of delayed tax clearance subsided.
Even assuming that the recent higher level of M1 is confirmed by final data
and then maintained over the rest of the month, M1 growth for all of May may be
no greater than a 4-1/2 per cent annual rate, considerably below the 8-1/2 per
cent rate thought likely at the time of the last Committee meeting. M2 in May,
on the other hand, appears to be running somewhat ahead of expectations, as
growth of time deposits other than large CD's turned stronger than anticipated.
(4) Over the four-statement-week period ending May 17, the Federal
funds rate averaged close to 4-1/4 per cent, about one-eighth of a percentage
point above the average for the preceding four weeks. Most recently, the
average for the week of May 17 was 4.32 per cent. These rates are in the
lower part of the 4--5 per cent range thought at the time of the last meeting
to be consistent with growth in RPD at the mid-point of the targeted range.
One factor that may have kept the funds rate from rising more in the period
was a drop in the overnight Eurodollar rate as compared with earlier weeks,
further widening the distance of the Eurodollar below the funds rate. There
is some evidence that this differential has induced a flow of funds into the
U. S. market, particularly through agencies of foreign banks.
(5) Both short- and long-term interest rates moved down following
the last Committee meeting, largely in reaction to the terms of the Treasury
May refunding and to the changed outlook for Treasury financing. The net
repayment of debt announced for the Treasury's refinancing, the continuing
very high level of the cash balance, and reports by Treasury officials that
second half cash needs would probably be much smaller than previously indicated,
all contributed to a marked downward revision in market judgments about the
likely pressure from Treasury borrowing in the months just ahead. Most
recently, there has been some tendency for rates to rise again, particularly
in the Treasury bill market. Key factors in the recent bill rate rise have
been the uncreep in the average rate on Federal funds and next week's bunching
of the monthly and two weekly bill auctions in a 5-day period. Also, the timing
of certain recent bill sales by the Desk, for System and other official accounts,
was interpreted by market participants as evidence that Federal policy makers
wanted bill rates-to rise. Currently, the 3-month Treasury bill is trading
around 3.80 per cent--somewhat above its level at the time of the last
Committee meeting and well above the 3.42 per cent low reached in early May
just after the Treasury refinancing.

Prospective developments

money market conditions are summarized below for Committee considera-
tion. More detailed monthly and quarterly figures, including data for
total reserves and RPD, are shown on the next two pages.

(8) Of the three alternatives presented, alternative A involves
money market conditions closest to those most recently prevailing. The mid-
point of the Federal funds rate range for A is around 4-1/4--4-1/2 per cent.
Under this alternative, we would expect the 3-month bill rate to be in a
and to move above the upper end in the summer.

(9) The bill rate is likely to be under downward pressure from
market forces over the near-term, as the Treasury is expected to repay almost
$4 billion of publicly-held issues maturing in June. Board staff projections
indicate the Treasury is likely to have to borrow a sizable amount of new
money--perhaps around $8 billion--in July and August, but projections by the
Treasury suggest a considerably smaller cash need. The market at the moment
seems to be assuming a cash need close to our estimates, and anticipation of
such a need could serve to offset downward pressure on the bill rate as June
progresses, as could possible net sales of bills from foreign accounts.
But the principal source of near-term upward pressure on bill rates would be a
tendency for the Federal funds rate to edge up from recent levels. This would
be particularly likely under alternatives B and C, but even could occur under
alternative A. If demands for bank reserves and for money are not as strong
as assumed, however, the funds rate and other short-term rates would, of
course, be correspondingly reduced for any given rate of bank reserve provision.
(10) The demand for money is expected to remain strong largely
because of the substantial 11--11-1/2 per cent annual rate of growth projected
for nominal GNP in the second and third quarters. Both rates of growth are
larger than projected by the staff at the last FOMC meeting. With sizable
transactions demands, efforts to move onto a slower growth path for monetary
aggregates--as in alternatives B and C--are likely to involve additional upward
pressures on short-term interest rates, with such pressures particularly strong
under alternative C. In June and July, the projected sharp drop in the Treasury
balance will tend temporarily to accelerate growth in M1. This reflects pushing
forward by one month the sharp drop in the Treasury balance that had been
anticipated for May but did not develop.
(11) For alternative B, the mid-point of the Federal funds
rate range is just under 5 per cent. If the rate were to move up toward
that area, this would clearly impart upward impetus to other short-term
rates and bring expectations of a possible increase in the 4-1/2 per
cent discount rate increasingly into the thinking of market participants.
We would expect the 3-month bill rate under this alternative to be in a
Under alternative C, the bill rate could move higher more quickly. As
Treasury cash needs over the next three months will be as large as assum-
ed in our projections; this makes the size and timing of upward movements
in interest rates more than usually uncertain.
(12) Inflows to banks of time deposits other than large CD's
are expected to moderate over the months ahead from their rather rapid
May pace. Moderation should be most noticeable after mid-year, though,
when short-term market interest rates are most likely to be rising signif-
icantly. Under alternative A, we would expect the rate of growth in such
deposits in the third quarter to drop to around 9 per cent, somewhat below
the expected second quarter pace, and about half the first quarter rate.
Under alternatives B and C, the rate of growth would likely be substantially
smaller. This would be particularly so under the money market conditions
expected to be consistent with alternative C aggregates. Short-term market
rates in the third quarter under those circumstances are likely to be above
most current ceiling rates on consumer-type time deposits.
(13) A declining trend of net saving inflows to nonbank
institutions would also be expected by the third quarter. While these
institutions have somewhat higher ceiling rates than banks, competitive-
ness of their deposits would, of course, be diminished as the 3-month
bill rate advances. Competitiveness would be severely eroded if the
bill rate moved into a 5-1/2--6 per cent range.
(14) Banks are expected to be relatively aggressive in offer-
ing large negotiable CD's, Strong loan expansion--with business loans
expected to continue rising at around the rate of the past few months--
in conjunction with diminishing net inflow of funds from consumer-type
time deposits are likely to encourage bank demand for CD funds. If
short-term rates rise into the alternative C range, we would expect that
banks would have to rely particularly heavily on large CD's as interest
rate ceilings constrain consumer-type time deposit inflows.
(15) Longer-term interest rates are not likely to be subject
to upward interest rate pressures from the demand side over the next few
months. The volume of corporate bonds coming to market appears to be
abating somewhat further, and mortgage credit demands seem to be topping
out. Market expectations appear to have shifted to an assumption of
relative rate stability over the next few months, but expectations could
change abruptly if money market conditions firm. Expectations might not
change to any significant degree under alternative A but would shift more
markedly if short-term market conditions move into the ranges associated
with B and C.
Proposed directive
(16) Possible language for the operational paragraph of the
directive is given below. The three alternative adjectives qualifying
"growth in monetary aggregates over the months ahead" might be taken to
correspond with the similarly lettered patterns of aggregate growth
rates described in the preceding section.
"To implement this policy, [DEL: while taking account of
capital market developments and the forthcoming Treasury
financing,] the Committee seeks to achieve bank reserve and
(A - MODERATE )
money market conditions that will support (B - somewhat more moderate)
(C - MORE MODERATE )
growth in monetary aggregates over the months ahead."
Deletion of the reference to capital market developments is proposed in
light of the recent and prospective moderation of credit demands in secur-
ities markets. The Committee may wish, however, to consider including the
capital markets reference--particularly under alternative C and possibly
B--in view of the possibility under these alternatives that strong upward
rate pressures could develop in longer-term markets.
Revised RPD Data
On May 18, the RPD series was released to the public; the series
will now appear weekly in two Board statistical releases and monthly in the
Bulletin. Weekly and monthly data are available back through 1960. The
published seasonally adjusted series differs somewhat from the previously
available internal figures as a result of technical adjustments undertaken in
the course of a thorough methodological review.
While, as before, seasonally adjusted RPD is based on seasonally
adjusted deposit aggregates, two technical adjustments were made to the data.
First, required reserve ratios were aggregated from micro data in order to adjust
ratios for the distribution of deposits below and above $5 million at each
bank, reflecting differences in reserve requirements. This changed the level
of the RPD series by about $30 million on average. Second, required reserves
for private demand and total time and savings deposits were calculated directly. 1/
In the old series, required reserves for net interbank and Treasury deposits
had been subtracted from total reserves to calculate RPD. 2/ This different
method of calculation reduced the level of RPD by about $350 million on
As indicated in the first three columns of the table on the next
page, the level of the new series is lower than for the old series.

Some month-to-month annual rates of change do show significant
differences between the two series, particularly in January and February of this
year. During the February-March period the new seasonally adjusted annual rate
of increase is a little above the target range, whereas under the old series it

change in relationship between deposits and reserves and does not in itself
imply any revision in deposit figures.
