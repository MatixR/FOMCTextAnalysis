MONETARY POLICY ALTERNATIVES
Recent Developments
(1) During the period since the November 16 FOMC meeting,
the federal funds rate has averaged very close to the intended level
of 3 percent.1 Most short-term interest rates were little changed
interpreted by market participants as increasing the odds of a tight-
ening of monetary policy, but not necessarily over the very near term.
In longer-term markets, yields are up 10 to 15 basis points on bal-
ance. Rates were pushed up by signs of stronger economic growth and
firming in some commodity prices, though that pressure was offset to
some degree by declines in oil prices. Longer-term rates now stand 40
to 60 basis points above their mid-October lows. Over the inter-
meeting period, most major stock price indexes fell 1 to 2 percent,
but the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose about 1 percent on strong
performances by a few firms to post new highs near the end of the
(2) The dollar's weighted-average foreign exchange value
showed little net change over the intermeeting period. It rose about
interest rates are down from 6 to 7 percentage points at the time of
the last FOMC meeting to 1 to 3 percentage points most recently.
Japanese economy and heightened expectations of further easing by the
Bank of Japan. Stock prices in that country fell about 4 percent, and
short- and long-term interest rates dropped 25 to 40 basis points.
The dollar was about unchanged against the German mark, but declined
somewhat against other European currencies. In Europe, interest rates
generally decreased 10 to 50 basis points, about in line with market
expectations, while stock prices continued to advance, with indexes in
several countries reaching new highs.
(3) Growth of M2 and M3 strengthened appreciably in November
and, at rates of around 4-1/4 percent for both aggregates, was some-
what more rapid than projected by the staff in the last bluebook.
Developments in the capital markets may have contributed to this pick-
up: Flows into longer-term mutual funds, probably responding to the
capital losses associated with the decline in bond prices in late
October and November, slowed appreciably during the weeks of Novem-
ber. Some of the unexpected strength in M2 and M3 was in money
market mutual funds--a likely repository of funds for investors moving
out of longer-term mutual funds. Ml growth in November was at a
growth stayed near October's moderate rate; a considerable decelera-
tion in this component over the past two months appears to be due in
part to slower growth of foreign demands for U.S. currency. Mortgage
refinancing activity likely helped fuel continued rapid expansion of
demand deposits last month.5 The strengthening of M3 owed to a
surge in term Eurodollars as well as to the stepped-up growth in M2.
(4) M2 and M3 in the fourth quarter are projected to be
about 1-1/2 and 1/2 percent, respectively, above their average levels
for the fourth quarter of 1992, leaving them both about 1/2 percentage
point above the lower bounds of their downward-adjusted annual
ranges. Although the growth rate of M2 was roughly the same as in
in velocity in 1993 can be explained by a rise in short-term oppor-
tunity costs, as deposit rates continued to adjust downward in re-
sponse to previous declines in market interest rates. Thus, despite
record growth of bond and stock mutual funds, there are some indica-
tions that the unusual shifts out of M2 may be beginning to abate,
perhaps as portfolios become adjusted to the steep yield curve and
the greater availability of mutual funds, as consumer loan rates come
down, and as households become more comfortable with their financial
positions. Nonetheless, the rise in M2 velocity this year still
was greater than forecast by traditional models, and the level of M2
velocity in the fourth quarter of 1993 is 17 percent above the level
these models expect, given the actual behavior of short-term oppor-
tunity costs.9  The velocity of M3 also is projected to have risen
less sharply in 1993 than last year. Contributing to the slower
increase in V3 has been somewhat stronger credit growth at deposi-
tories, although this effect has been offset somewhat by an even
greater reliance than last year on nondeposit sources of funds.
(5) Nonfederal debt growth appears to be running somewhat
stronger in the third and fourth quarters than previously thought,
and, at a projected average rate of 4-3/4 percent over these two
quarters, is noticeably above the pace of the first half of the year.
The faster growth has been evident mainly in the household sector,
where sounder balance sheets and perhaps less concern about economic
prospects evidently have prompted a greater willingness to borrow.
Consumer installment credit has been particularly robust, expanding at
a 12-3/4 percent pace in October; bank data suggest that consumer
borrowing fell off a bit last month but nevertheless remained well in
excess of income growth. Mortgage borrowing is estimated to have
picked up appreciably in the third quarter and to be continuing apace
in the fourth quarter, reflecting strong housing activity as well as
some equity extraction. In the business sector, however, net borrow-
ing has remained quite modest. Internal funds have been nearly ample
enough to cover the high level of capital outlays, and elevated share
prices have induced many firms to tap equity markets. Gross issuance
of corporate bonds has flagged in recent months, partly owing to the
backup in long rates, while borrowing from shorter-term sources has
remained subdued. The rise in long rates likewise has taken a toll on
bond issuance in the state and local sector. Federal debt, though,
rebounded in November from a decline in October, bringing estimated
total debt growth last month to a 6-1/2 percent rate. Through Novem-
ber, total domestic nonfinancial sector debt is estimated to have
risen at a 5 percent rate from its 1992:Q4 base, leaving this aggre-
gate somewhat above the 4 percent lower bound of its monitoring range.

Policy Alternatives
(6) Three alternatives are presented below for Committee
consideration. Under alternative B, federal funds would continue to
trade around 3 percent in association with adjustment plus seasonal
borrowing at the discount window of $50 million. Under alternative C,
the federal funds rate would move up to 3-1/2 percent and the borrow-
ing allowance to $75 million. In the case of alternative A, the
federal funds rate would decline to 2-1/2 percent and borrowing would
fall, perhaps to $25 million.
(7) Alternative B is consistent with the policy assumptions
underlying the staff economic forecast. In that forecast, short-term
rates are maintained at around current levels through most of 1994.
The spurt in output in the current quarter, related importantly to
production adjustments in the automobile industry, is not sustained.
Output decelerates in the first quarter, and then settles into a
growth pace broadly in line with that of potential over the balance of
the year, held down to an extent by scheduled fiscal retrenchment.
With economic slack persisting, albeit at around the current
diminished level, prices decelerate modestly further. Relative to the
staff forecast, market participants appear to be anticipating a bit
more strength in aggregate demand through next year, and have built
into interest rates substantial odds that policy will begin to tighten
in the first part of the year to keep inflation from increasing.
Nonetheless, market interest rates are unlikely to move down much on
balance under the steady funds rate of alternative B in coming months,
since the market would continue to expect a tightening before long.
The foreign exchange value of the dollar under alternative B should
stay around current levels.

(8) Growth of the broad monetary aggregates, shown in the
table above, is expected to slow a little through March under alterna-
tive B from the faster pace of recent months, but to stay above the
pace of 1993 as a whole. This moderation is entirely accounted for by
identifiable special factors. In particular, the recent falloff in
mortgage refinancing applications portends a marked reduction in
demand deposits associated with this activity. This effect subtracts
around 3 percentage points from the expansion of M1 and 1 percentage
point from M2 over the November-to-March period. (Increases in
refinancing over the summer and early fall added an estimated 1-3/4
and 1/2 percentage points of growth to M1 and M2 from August to
November.) Abstracting from this factor, growth of M2 is projected to
pick up a little in coming months. Shifts from M2 should continue to
moderate a little as balance sheets become better aligned with the
current structure of interest rates. We expect flows into long-term
mutual funds to average below the record pace of most of 1993, react-
ing also to heightened investor perceptions of risk after the backup
in yields and associated capital losses of October and November.

(9) Nonetheless, substantial portfolio shifts are expected
to persist, as the yield curve remains relatively steep, and these
shifts will continue to damp the growth of M2 relative to nominal
income. The velocity of M2 in the first quarter would rise at a
for the current quarter. M2 by March would have expanded at a 2 per-
cent annual rate from its fourth-quarter 1993 base under alternative
B, placing this aggregate well above the lower end of its provisional
growth in the first quarter could be especially volatile and difficult
to interpret. Seasonal factors were distorted by policy-induced
surges in money in early 1991 and 1992. In addition, amounts and
patterns of tax payments, and associated adjustments in money hold-
ings, could be atypical, given the uncertain effects of the new tax
(10) Under alternative B, M3 would advance at a 1 percent
annual rate over the November-to-March period; by March this aggregate
would be 1-1/4 percent above its fourth-quarter 1993 base, well within
its 0 to 4 percent provisional range for 1994. Bank credit should
continue to expand around the 5 percent pace of 1993, and banks are
expected to persist in funding much of the growth with lower cost,
non-M3 sources, in part to avoid deposit insurance premiums. The debt
of the nonfederal sectors will grow at a 4-3/4 percent rate through
March, in line with the stepped-up pace of the second half of 1993.
Household borrowing is expected to continue to be strong, reflecting
more comfortable financial positions and the high level of spending on
housing and durable goods. Overall financing needs of businesses are
expected to grow as advances in capital spending outstrip growth in
internal funds, and as net equity issuance is held down by a major
merger. Total debt of nonfinancial sectors is projected to increase
at a 5-3/4 percent pace from the fourth quarter of 1993 to March, well
above the lower end of its provisional 4 to 8 percent range for next
(11) The rise in the federal funds rate under alternative C,
to 3-1/2 percent, would come sooner than now anticipated by market
participants and built into markets interest rates. Rates at the near
end of the maturity spectrum would rise by almost the full 50 basis
point increase in the funds rate; intermediate- and long-term rates
would go up, but as usual by less. The extraordinary spread of the
prime rate over funding costs and the more aggressive lending posture
of commercial banks suggest that the prime rate might notch up only
be limited because such a tightening at this time might be seen as
better ensuring continuing moderate expansion and disinflation in the
years ahead. Quality spreads would be expected to remain fairly nar-
row as a firming in the policy stance in the context of market expec-
tations of a more solid economic expansion would not be likely to
raise many concerns about credit quality. Higher yields on dollar
assets would put upward pressure on the exchange value of the dollar.
M2 would grow at a 1-3/4 percent annual rate over the November-to-
March period, restrained by higher opportunity costs. M3 would expand
under alternative C at only a 3/4 percent pace over the November-to-
March period.
(12) Alternative C might be preferred if there were concerns
about the inflation outlook. Such concerns could arise from a view
that current-quarter strength in economic activity suggested that the
economy was on an appreciably higher growth track, perhaps because
financial factors damping expansion have faded, allowing the current
accommodative stance of monetary policy to show through more fully
into aggregate demand. In that event, the output gap would be closing
more quickly than in the staff forecast, raising the risks of an
overshooting of activity relative to its potential and hence greater
inflationary pressures over time. A timely firming in policy now
could obviate a more aggressive tightening later to keep inflation
from picking up, involving perhaps even higher real interest rates if
delays permitted inflation expectations to deteriorate.
(13) The easing of policy under alternative A would come as
a surprise to market participants, and short-term interest rates would
fall by about the 50 basis point drop in the federal funds rate.
Intermediate- and long-term rates would decline by less; indeed, the
extent of any decline would be quite limited if the easing were seen
by market participants to be unsustainable. The dollar would weaken
on foreign exchange markets. Under alternative A, M2 would expand at
a 2-1/4 percent pace, close to that evident since midyear, buoyed
partly by less of a slowdown in M1 than under alternatives B and C,
M3 would grow at a 1-1/4 percent pace from November to March.
(14) Alternative A might be favored if the current strength
in the economy were seen as likely to give way to a significant weak-
ening in the pace of expansion next year, considering the greater
fiscal restraint in train and the backup in long-term interest rates
and the dollar since mid-October. Moreover, even if the staff fore-
cast is judged to be the most likely outcome, the lack of much pro-
gress in reducing the unemployment rate may be deemed to be unaccep-
table. Moreover, recent softness in the oil market could suggest
lessened risk to the inflation outlook from an easing, at least in the
near term.
Directive Language
(15) Presented below is draft wording for the operational
paragraph that includes the usual options for Committee consideration.
OPERATIONAL PARAGRAPH
In the implementation of policy for the im-
mediate future, the Committee seeks to DECREASE SOME-
WHAT/maintain/INCREASE SOMEWHAT the existing degree of
pressure on reserve positions. In the context of the
Committee's long-run objectives for price stability and
sustainable economic growth, and giving careful con-
sideration to economic, financial, and monetary develop-
ments, slightly (SOMEWHAT) greater reserve restraint
(WOULD/MIGHT), or slightly (SOMEWHAT) lesser reserve
restraint (WOULD) might be acceptable in the intermeet-
ing period. The contemplated reserve conditions are
expected to be consistent with [DEL: modest] MODERATE growth in
M2 and M3 over COMING MONTHS [DEL: the balance of the year.]
