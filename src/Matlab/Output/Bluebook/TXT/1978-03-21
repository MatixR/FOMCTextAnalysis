Recent developments
(1) M-1 declined at about a 4 per cent annual rate in
February, but growth appears to have resumed in March and, over the
two months, is projected at about a per cent annual rate, slightly
below the lower end of the FOMC's range.1 / Reflecting weakness in
M-1, M-2 growth over the February-March period is projected at
around a 5 per cent annual rate, in the lower half of its range.
Large denomination time deposits included in M-2 have continued to
expand sharply in recent weeks, while flows into small time and
savings deposits have remained quite weak. Deposit growth at thrift
institutions has been relatively slow as well.

(2) The Account Manager aimed for a Federal funds rate
of around 6¾ per cent throughout the intermeeting period, even
though M-1 and M-2 growth weakened relative to their respective
ranges. The FOMC, in a telephone meeting on March 10, decided to
retain the 6¾ per cent funds rate target for the time being in view
of the weakness of the dollar in international exchange markets and
the probability that the economic effects of the prolonged coal
strike and severe weather were temporarily depressing the aggregates.
(3) With Federal funds trading steadily at rates around 6¾
per cent, private short-term interest rates have remained essentially
unchanged since the February FOMC meeting. Treasury bill rates,
however, have edged down a bit further over this period, mainly in
response to continued large foreign central bank acquisitions of
these securities. In addition, the volume of Treasury bill financing
has been somewhat smaller than previously anticipated, reflecting
a short-fall in Federal outlays and lagging disbursements of tax
refunds. Bond yields also have edged lower as the volume of public
bond offerings by corporations and State and local governments has
remained moderate.
(4) Yields in both primary and secondary sectors of the
mortgage market have stayed about unchanged since late February,
following their advance earlier in the first quarter. However, with
deposit inflows still sluggish, S&L's have continued their sizable
borrowings from the Federal Home Loan Banks. As a result, the thrifts
probably have continued to become less accommodative in extending new
loan commitments and appear to be tightening lending terms.

Prospective developments
(6) The table below presents for Committee consideration
three alternative sets of specifications for the monetary aggregates
and the Federal funds rate for the forthcoming intermeeting period.
(More detailed and longer-term data for the aggregates are shown in
the tables on pp. 6 and 7.)
Alt. A Alt. B Alt. C
Ranges for March-April
M-1 5 to 10 4½ to 9½ 4 to 9
M-2 6½ to 10½ 6 to 10 5½ to 9½
Federal funds rate 6 to 6½ 6½ to 7 7 to 7½
(Intermeeting period)
(7) Each of the alternatives is consistent with the growth
ranges for QIV '77 to QIV '78--as indexed by M-1 growth in a 4 to 6½
per cent range--adopted by the Committee at its February meeting and
each requires that interest rates would rise over the balance of
the year in order to constrain growth in the aggregates to the mid-
point of the longer-run ranges. Under alternative B, the Federal
funds rate would be expected to remain unchanged over the inter-
meeting period and then begin rising thereafter, reaching about 8
per cent by fall. The near-term decline in the funds rate contemplated

under alternative A would likely require a greater rise in this
rate over the summer and fall. Under alternative C, restraint would
begin earlier; thus the required upward adjustments in the funds
rate over 1978 would be somewhat less.1/ The levels of interest
rates consistent with each alternative imply continued relatively
slow growth of interest-bearing deposits subject to rate ceilings
at banks and thrift institutions, even though the projections of
deposit aggregates assume a 50 basis point increase in time deposit
ceiling rates in the months ahead.
(8) It is likely that the recent weakness in M-1 growth
will be reversed over the near-term. The abatement of severe
weather conditions is expected to contribute to an acceleration
of economic activity and an associated pick-up in money demand.
Moreover, tax refunds are expected to accelerate in coming weeks,
thus temporarily buoying money balances in March-April. In addition,
the restraining impact on money demand of the relatively sharp increase
in interest rates from the spring to the fall of last year by now
probably has been exhausted, and short-term rate increases since fall
have been relatively small, about 1/4 of a percentage point.
(9) Against this background, M-1 growth is expected to
accelerate in the weeks ahead. Given the Federal funds rate assump-
tion of alternative B--with the rate centered at the 6¾ per cent
level prevailing since early January--M-1 growth over March-April
is likely to be in a 4 to 9 per cent annual rate range.
(10) Growth in M-2 over this period is expected to be in a
been the case since last fall, savings deposits at commercial banks
are projected to remain essentially unchanged. Temporary inflows
from larger than seasonal tax refunds may do little more than offset
deposit weakness caused by the large differential between market
rates and the ceiling rate on passbook savings accounts. With
market yields also above the effective ceiling rates on all maturities
of small denomination time deposits at commercial banks, such deposits
are likely to grow only moderately in the March-April period. However,
loan demands are expected to remain relatively strong; thus banks
are likely to continue aggressively to offer large denomination time
deposits in order to supplement their deposit base. A major portion
of these deposits is included in M-2. Consequently the interest-
bearing component of this aggregate is projected to continue to
expand at an 8 to 9 per cent seasonally adjusted annual rate.
(11) The modest pace of inflows to thrift institutions
can be expected to persist in March-April under alternative B.
Growth of deposits at mutual savings banks and savings and loan
associations, combined, may be around a 6 to 7 per cent annual rate.
Over subsequent months, the assumed increase in deposit rate ceilings
would keep deposit inflows to thrifts from eroding further as market
interest rates rise. Reductions in thrift portfolio
liquidity and increased borrowings from the Federal Home Loan
Banks and from other sources are thus likely to continue in order
to finance takedowns of existing commitments. Moreover, further
reductions in new commitment activity and in spot purchases of
mortgages from mortgage bankers and others can be expected.
(12) If the Federal funds rate remains at the 6¾ per
cent level contemplated under alternative B, short- and intermediate-
term interest rates over the intermeeting period are likely to
remain near their current levels. Some upward rate pressures
might develop as accelerating economic activity bolsters financing
demands of businesses at banks and in the commercial paper market.
In addition, Treasury borrowing in short- and intermediate-term
markets between now and mid-April will be relatively heavy.
Potential upward rate pressures in the short-term sector will tend
to be offset, however, by market anticipation of the substantial
pay-down of Treasury bills following the mid-April tax date.
Moreover, rates on shorter-term Treasury securities could remain
low relative to other market rates, should foreign central banks
continue to acquire large amounts of such securities as a result
of their intervention activities in foreign exchange markets.
(13) Under alternative B, mortgage rates might rise
somewhat further in the intermeeting period as thrifts adjust
lending policies in response to sustained weak deposit inflows.
Bond yields, however, are expected to be essentially unchanged. The
forward calendar for corporate issues remains relatively modest and
institutional demands large. Furthermore, the forward calendar for
tax-exempt offerings continues below the exceptional 1977 level and
interest in such issues by fire and casualty insurance companies,
commercial banks, and individuals are projected to remain sizable.
(14) Alternative C contemplates an increase in the Federal
funds rate to the mid-point of a 7 to 7-1/2 per cent range between now
and mid-April. Growth in M-1 in the March-April period would probably
be in a 4 to 9 per cent and M-2 in a 5-1/2 to 9-1/2 per cent annual
rate range. Although the market is expecting some tightening of policy
later this spring, an increase in the Federal funds rate over the
near-term apparently is not being anticipated by market participants,
given the recent moderation of growth in the monetary aggregates.
The 3-month bill might move into a 6-5/8--6-3/4 per cent area, and
there would be commensurate adjustment in other short-term rates.
Member bank borrowing from the discount window would rise substantially,
producing expectations of an upward adjustment in the discount rate.
Such borrowing has been relatively low recently, and no banks are under
administrative pressure at the window.
(15) The sizable increase in short-term rates likely to
develop under alternative C would probably be accompanied by only
modest upward pressure on bond yields in the intermeeting period.
As previously noted, new bond offerings are expected to be modest
and institutional investment demand strong. By contributing to
slower deposit inflows, however, alternative C would add to near-term
upward pressure on mortgage rates and increase the need for an
adjustment in deposit ceiling rates.
(16) An easing of the Federal funds rate to around 6¼
per cent, as contemplated under alternative A, would be very
surprising to the market in light of the weakness of the dollar
in foreign exchange markets and recent indications of acceleration in
the rise of wholesale and retail prices. In addition, if staff pro-
jections are correct, such an easing action would be taking place
in conjunction with publication of accelerated growth in M-1. Short-
term market rates would decline, with the 3-month Treasury bill rate
possibly falling below 6 per cent. The value of the dollar would
probably decline in international exchange markets. Long-term interest
rates would probably decline little, since market participants would
likely view such an action as temporary. Indeed, as noted earlier,
interest rates would soon need to begin rising in order to restrain
growth in the aggregates to the mid-point of their longer-run ranges,
and by autumn would have to reach levels higher than under alternatives
B and C.
Directive language
(17) Given below are alternatives for the operational
paragraphs of the directive. The first formulation places main
emphasis on near-term rates of growth in monetary aggregates. The
second formulation, like the directive adopted at the last meeting,
places main emphasis on money market conditions; it shows--in strike-
through form--the specifications adopted at the last meeting. As
suggested below, the particular language needed in the opening lines
of the money market formulation would depend on the specific condi-
tions sought; the three alternatives shown--calling, respectively,
for somewhat easier, prevailing, and somewhat firmer money market
conditions--are intended to be associated with the specifications
discussed in the preceding section under alternatives A, B, and C.
"Monetary Aggregates" Formulation
The Committee seeks to encourage near-term rates of growth
in M-1 and M-2 on a path believed to be reasonably consistent
with the longer-run ranges for monetary aggregates cited in the
preceding paragraph. Specifically, at present, it expects the
annual growth rates over the March-April period to be within
ranges of ____ to ____ per cent for M-1 and ____ to
____ per cent for M-2. In the judgment of the Committee such
growth rates are likely to be associated with a weekly-average
Federal funds rate of about ____ per cent. If, giving approx-
imately equal weight to M-1 and M-2, it appears that growth rates
over the 2-month period will deviate significantly from the
midpoints of the indicated ranges, the operational objective
for the Federal funds rate shall be modified in an orderly
fashion within a range of ______ to ______ per cent. In
the conduct of day-to-day operations, account shall be taken
of emerging financial market conditions, including the condi-
tions in foreign exchange markets.
If it appears during the period before the next meeting
that the operating constraints specified above are proving to
be significantly inconsistent, the Manager is promptly to notify
the Chairman who will then decide whether the situation calls
for supplementary instructions from the Committee.
"Money Market" Formulation
At this time, the Committee seeks to maintain about the
prevailing money market conditions (OR TO ACHIEVE SOMEWHAT
EASIER OR SOMEWHAT FIRMER MONEY MARKET CONDITIONS) during the
period immediately ahead, provided that monetary aggregates
appear to be growing at approximately the rates currently
expected, which are believed to be on a path reasonably con-
sistent with the longer-run ranges for monetary aggregates
cited in the preceding paragraph. Specifically, the Committee
seeks to maintain the weekly-average Federal funds rate at
about the current level (OR TO REDUCE OR TO INCREASE THE WEEKLY-
AVERAGE FEDERAL FUNDS RATE SOMEWHAT FROM THE CURRENT LEVEL) ____,
so long as M-1 and M-2 appear to be growing over the [DEL: February-
March] MARCH-APRIL period at annual rates within ranges of [DEL: 1 to 6]
______ TO ______ per cent and [DEL: 4-1/2 to 8-1/2] ______ TO ______
per cent, respectively. If, giving approximately equal weight
to M-1 and M-2, it appears that growth rates over the 2-month
period are approaching or moving beyond the limits of the indicated
ranges, the operational objective for the weekly-average Federal
funds rate shall be modified in an orderly fashion within a range
of [DEL: 6-1/2-to-7] ____ TO ____ per cent. In the conduct of day-
to-day operations, account shall be taken of emerging financial
market conditions, including the conditions in foreign exchange
If it appears during the period before the next meeting that
the operating constraints specified above are proving to be signif-
icantly inconsistent, the Manager is promptly to notify the Chair-
man who will then decide whether the situation calls for supplementary
instructions from the Committee.
