Prefatory Note 
 
 
The attached document represents the most complete and accurate version available

of Governors of the Federal Reserve System.  This electronic document was created 
through a comprehensive digitization process which included identifying the best-
preserved paper copies, scanning those copies,1 and then making the scanned 
versions text-searchable.2   Though a stringent quality assurance process was 
employed, some imperfections may remain. 
 
Please note that some material may have been redacted from this document if that

1  In some cases, original copies needed to be photocopied before being scanned into electronic 
format.  All scanned images were deskewed (to remove the effects of printer- and scanner-introduced 
tilting) and lightly cleaned (to remove dark spots caused by staple holes, hole punches, and other 
blemishes caused after initial printing). 
 
2 A two-step process was used.  An advanced optical character recognition computer program (OCR) 
first created electronic text from the document image.  Where the OCR results were inconclusive, 
staff checked and corrected the text as necessary.  Please note that the numbers and text in charts and 
tables were not reliably recognized by the OCR process and were not checked or corrected by staff.

MONEY MARKET AND RESERVE RELATIONSHIPS
Recent developments
Money market conditions have eased somewhat in recent weeks,
and aggregate bank reserves, bank credit, and the money supply have
shown considerably less strength than earlier anticipated; in fact,
all these variables have declined on average in October. The outflow
of time deposits at banks is not very different from anticipations
with time and savings deposits at all commercial banks declining at
about a 2.5 per cent annual rate in October. This reflects a net run-
off in CD's estimated at between $1.2 to $1.5 billion of the $5.2 billion
of CD's maturing during the month.
Total member bank deposits (the bank credit proxy) declined
at an annual rate of almost 3 per cent on average in October; this
represented a substantial shortfall from earlier projections, with
1/
the shortfall reflecting weaker than expected private demand deposits.
The weakness in bank credit is also attested to by very preliminary
estimates for the change in total commercial bank credit on a last-
Wednesday-of-the-month basis. This series shows only a very minor
$200 million rise (an annual rate of not quite 1 per cent) for October.
obtained through their foreign branches than in recent months.
Allowance for such funds would make the October decline in the
bank credit proxy 2.2 per cent.

Business loan growth in October, when there was again a
sizable speed-up in certain corporate tax payments, was somewhat larger
than in September, but less than the very high rate of expansion of
the first eight months of the year. With the present degree of monetary
restraint and with CD run-offs sizable, banks had to liquidate a sub-
stantial amount of U.S. Government securities, especially in the first
half of October. Despite bank sales and the Treasury's October 11
auction of tax bills, bill rates remained within a relatively narrow
range of fluctuation during the first half of October, when the 3-month
bill averaged 5.40 per cent; bill rates subsequently declined, with
the 3-month bill currently quoted around 5.25 per cent.
While the decline in bill rates was partly the result of dis-
intermediation (with reinvestment of funds from CD run-offs converging
on the short-term bill market), it also appears to have reflected the
development of less intense credit demands in the economy--inasmuch as
the decline in bill rates was also accompanied by some declines in
other short-term rates, a reduction in money supply, and a further
decline in long-term rates. Over the four months since midyear, the
money supply and total reserves have declined at annual rates of more
than 2 per cent and nonborrowed reserves at about 3.5 per cent. During
the first half of this year by contrast all these variables increased at
annual rates of between 3 and 5 per cent.
CONFIDENTIAL (FR)
COF DENTIAL (FR) - 3 - October 28, 1966
With aggregate monetary variables showing less strength than
expected in recent weeks, open market operations did not attempt to
offset fully the comparative ease that was developing in money market
conditions. Net borrowed reserves during the past two statement weeks
averaged $338 million, with member bank borrowings averaging $654 million;
in the previous two statement weeks these indicators had averaged $494
million and $878 million respectively. The volume of Federal funds
trading picked up slightly during the past two statement weeks, while
the average rate at which trading took place declined to around 5½ per
cent. Dealer loan rates in New York eased back a little, although by
relatively less than did such rates outside New York.
Prospective developments
Assuming that money market rates and net borrowed reserves
remain within the range of fluctuation of the past four weeks, staff
projections suggest a further decline in total member bank deposits
(the bank credit proxy) on average in November. The decline is likely
to be in the order of a 2 per cent annual rate. With the deposit mix
continuing to shift in favor of demand deposits, required reserves
are projected to decline by only about 1 per cent. These projections
assume some additional Treasury cash financing toward the end of the
month, and a business loan expansion somewhat less than in October --
mainly because corporate payments of withheld taxes were shifted forward
to October from November.
CONFIDENTIAL (FR)
CONFIDENTIA (FR)
The reduction in total member bank deposits assumes a CD run-
off during November of about $ billion, less than half the pace of the
past two months. The recent decline in short-term bill rates (with the
one-month bill currently quoted at around 4.50 per cent on the offered
side) has led to some reported sales of short bills and reinvestment of
the proceeds in short CD's. Total time and savings deposits for all
member banks may still decline slightly on average in the month of
November, but such deposits at all commercial banks are likely
to rise slightly because of continued deposit gains by nonmember banks.
Money supply and private demand deposits are expected to rise
at roughly a 2-3 per cent annual rate on average from October to November.
Because private demand deposits fell steadily on a weekly basis after
the first week in October, a resumed rise in November would start from a
low point. As a result, the increase projected in such deposits from
the last week of October to the last week in November is more rapid
than the average rise for the month--partly influenced by the expected
declines in the Treasury cash balance during most of the month ahead.
The Government security market in November will be importantly
influenced by the market's accommodation of the Treasury's November
refunding. The initial reaction to the Treasury's offering--a 15-month,
favorable, and prices were marked up especially in the intermediate-
and long-term area. In the capital markets as a whole, the current

moderation in the corporate and municipal calendars is contributing to
a firm atmosphere, which is likely to persist unless a sizable build-up
in the calendar is induced.
Short-term markets are moving into the season when upward
yield pressures generally intensify, and bill rates are likely to be
influenced by a Treasury cash financing in the bill area that may be
announced later in November. It appears likely that the 3-month bill
rate will rise as November progresses, while generally remaining within
a 5.20-5.50 per cent range. The propensity of investors to arbitrage
between short bills and CD's would also tend to maintain a floor under
bill rates. The Federal funds rate may also come under upward seasonal
pressure in the weeks ahead and edge up from the recent average of 5-1/4
per cent.
Given the demand assumptions underlying the above projections,
a movement toward a consistently shallower net borrowed reserve figure
than obtained during the past four weeks--say, in the order of $200
million--to encourage aggregate reserve and bank credit expansion would
likely be accompanied by lower bill rates (with the 3-month bill possibly
in a 4.90-5.30 per cent range) and increased market expectations for
declining longer term rates.
