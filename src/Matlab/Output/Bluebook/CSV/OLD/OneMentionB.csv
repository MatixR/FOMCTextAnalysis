1969-10-28,"(15) If the Committee should decide to move toward somewhat
less firm money market conditions, it might wish to consider directive
language along the following lines (alternative B):
""To implement this policy, System open market operations
until the next meeting of the Committee shall be conducted with a view
to achieving slightly less firm conditions in money and short-term credit
markets; provided, however, that operations shall be modified if bank
credit appears to be deviating significantly from current projections..
(16) The slightly less firm money market conditions to
be sought might involve a Federal funds rate averaging around 8-1/4 to
less, and net borrowed reserves fluctuating around $800 million."
1969-11-25,"(6) For the second paragraph of the current economic policy
directive, the Committee might wish to continue the language currently
in force which reads as follows (alternative A):
""To implement this policy, System open market operations until
the next meeting of the Committee shall be conducted with a view to main-
taining the prevailing firm conditions in money and short-term credit
markets; provided, however, that operations shall be modified if bank
credit appears to be deviating significantly from current projections."".
(13) If the Committee should decide to move toward slightly
less firm money market conditions, it might wish to consider the following
second paragraph for the directive (alternative B):
""To implement this policy, System open market operations until
the next meeting of the Committee shall be conducted with a view to
achieving slightly less firm conditions in money and short-term credit
markets; provided, however, that operations shall be modified if bank
credit appears to be deviating significantly from current projections."""
1969-12-16,"(16) If the Committee should decide to move toward slightly
less firm money market conditions, it might wish to consider the follow-
ing second paragraph for the directive (Alternative B):
'To implement this policy, System open market
operations until the next meeting of the Committee
shall be conducted with a view to [DEL: maintaining-the
prevailing-ACHIEVING SLIGHTLY LESS firm conditions
in THE money and-short-term-credit markets;] provided,
however, that operations shall be modified if bank
credit appears to be deviating significantly from
current projections or if UNUSUAL LIQUIDITY pressures
SHOULD DEVELOP [DEL: aruse in connection with-possible
bank regulatory changes.]"
1970-01-15,"(14) Policy alternative B."
1970-02-10,"(8) If the Committee wishes to maintain an unchanged stance
with respect to its views as to monetary aggregates and money market
conditions, it may wish to consider the following second paragraph for
the directive (alternative A):
To implement this policy, while taking account of the
CURRENT forthcoming Treasury refunding, possible bank regula-
tory change, and the Committee's desire to see a modest
growth in money and bank credit, System open market opera-
tions until the next meeting of the Committee shall be con-
ducted with a view to maintaining firm conditions in the
money market; provided, however, that operations shall be
modified if money and bank credit appear to be deviating
significantly from current projections..
(15) Should the Committee wish to move toward somewhat
easier conditions in the money market, concomitant with somewhat
stronger growth in the banking and deposit aggregates, it might con-
sider the following second paragraph for the directive (alternative B):
To implement this policy, while taking account of the
CURRENT forthcoming Treasury refunding, possible bank
regulatory changes and the Committee's desire to see
MODERATE a-modest growth in money and bank credit, System
open market operations until the next meeting of the
Committee shall be conducted with a view to maintaining
firm MOVING TOWARD SOMEWHAT EASIER conditions in the
money market; provided, however, that operations shall be
modified if money and bank credit appear to be deviating
significantly from current projections..
(17) Under such conditions, banks might be in a position to regain
a substantial amount of CD's, Instead of an attrition running at about
the $100-$300 million per month rate likely under alternative A (depending
on the degree of firmness achieved under the specifications of that
alternative), we would expect banks at least to maintain outstanding CD's
at around the current $10 billion level."
1970-09-15,"Alternative B.
(14) Should the Committee desire to seek a 6 per cent growth
rate for the money supply over the fourth quarter and a significant easing
in credit market conditions, it may wish to consider the following
language for the second paragraph of the directive (alternative B):
To implement this policy, the Committee seeks to promote
some FURTHER easing of conditions in credit markets and somewhat
greater growth in money over the months ahead than occurred in
the first half of the year, while taking account of possible
liquidity problems and allowing bank credit growth to reflect
BANK EFFORTS TO REBUILD LIQUIDITY AND any continued shift of
credit flows from market to banking channels."
1971-09-21,"(15) Alternative B."
1972-05-23,"This reflects pushing
forward by one month the sharp drop in the Treasury balance that had been
anticipated for May but did not develop..
(11) For alternative B, the mid-point of the Federal funds
rate range is just under 5 per cent."
1978-05-16,"Receptions for these
offerings could be quite good, however, since dealers have distri-
buted the bulk of their awards of the Treasury refunding issues
and have reestablished a short position in coupon issues..
(13) Alternative B calls for an increase in the Federal
funds rate to the mid-point of a 7½ to 8¼ per cent range between
now and mid-June."
1983-03-28,"(14) Alternative B contemplates a federal funds rate fluctuating
around the current 8-1/2 percent discount rate, assuming adjustment (includ-
ing seasonal) borrowing at the discount window of around $200 million."
1996-08-20,"(8) Nonetheless, the Committee may well feel that it can
afford to wait, as in alternative B, for additional data to accumulate
to allow a more confident judgment concerning whether an underlying
process of rising inflation seems to be taking hold."
1998-02-03,"The staff forecast is built on an unchanged federal funds rate, and if the Committee agrees
that this is both a reasonable and desirable outcome under those conditions, retaining the
current stance of policy under alternative B would be appropriate."
1999-06-29,"(22) The Committee might nonetheless favor the unchanged federal funds rate of
alternative B if it did not view the prospects for a rise in inflation as having increased since
the last meeting, when it saw the risks as tilted, but not enough to tighten."
2000-06-27,"(18) If the Committee is not sure that inflation pressures will intensify going
forward, then it might want to consider leaving the stance of monetary policy unchanged at
this meeting, as under alternative B. Economic growth in the second quarter appears to
have slowed to a rate roughly consistent with its potential even though the full effects of the
earlier rise in interest rates and flattening of equity prices have not yet worked their way
through the pipeline."
2001-01-30,"Under these
circumstances, the effects of surprising the markets with a smaller easing could be
especially adverse..
(18) The Committee may choose the unchanged federal funds rate of
alternative B if it is dissatisfied with recent rates of core inflation and wants to
establish a downward trajectory for inflation, as in the price stability scenario in the
second section of this bluebook."
