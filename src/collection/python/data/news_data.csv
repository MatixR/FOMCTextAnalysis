"19901218","C.D.&#x27;s and Bank Funds Fall","Business","Yields on bank certificates of deposit and money market accounts posted their ninth consecutuve decline in the week ended yesterday. The decline is expected to accelerate this week because the Federal Reserve cut its discount rate to banks, effective today. The Fed&#x27;s move should put downward pressure on all interest rates, starting with the short-term rates and gradually expanding to longer-term debt instruments."
"19901218","Cut in Discount Rate Lifts Prices","Business","Although widely anticipated, the Federal Reserve Board&#x27;s decision to cut its discount rate by half a percentage point, to 6 1/2 percent, was enthusiastically received in the credit markets yesterday. Treasury note and bond prices posted strong gains, and interest rates fell. For the past few weeks analysts had been saying that the Fed would have to lower the discount rate, if only because the overnight Federal funds rate, the market rate the Fed most directly controls, was being moved steadily down toward 7 percent. Generally the funds rate trades at a higher level than the discount rate."

The Commerce Department attributed much of the 24 percent jump in the trade deficit to higher foreign oil prices stemming from the Persian Gulf crisis. But there was also a big rise in car imports."

Grennan, head of stock index futures trading for Shearson Lehman Brothers. &quot;Then profit taking came in, because the news didn&#x27;t exactly come as a big surprise. If we hadn&#x27;t talked about it so much, the market would have gone up 100 points.&quot;"
"19901218","Consumer Prices Up by Modest 0.3%","Business","Consumer prices rose a modest three-tenths of 1 percent in November, less than half the torrid oil-driven pace set during the three months immediately after Iraq&#x27;s invasion of Kuwait, Labor Department figures showed today. The slowdown reflected both moderation in energy prices, which benefited from diplomatic efforts to solve the crisis instead of threats of force, and a general weakness in the economy. That weakness has tended to put downward pressure on the prices of some items while preventing higher prices for energy. When food and energy are excluded, the Consumer Price Index rose by the same three-tenths of 1 percent as when these volatile items are included. The rise in so-called core inflation has now been three-tenths of 1 percent for three straight months. Strange Behavior for Housing While the November increase was about as expected, many analysts had braced for an unpleasant surprise since the largest element of the price index, housing, has been behaving strangely of late and because last week&#x27;s report on prices at the producer level was worse than expected."

A new bull is born, they proclaim. Of course, so does Joseph Granville, the flamboyant forecaster who in September was warning of a 1929-style crash and depression."
"19910206","Yields Drop For 4th Week","Business","Yields of money market funds monitored by IBC/Donoghue&#x27;s Money Market Fund Report fell in the week ended yesterday. It was the fourth consecutive week of decline. The effects of last week&#x27;s surprise cut in the discount rate by the Federal Reserve will not be felt immediately, but rather over the next few weeks, said analysts at Donoghue&#x27;s. Yields, which had already been slowly moving down, will soon decline more sharply for a short time, they added."
"19910206","Opposition Is Expected To Bank Plan","Business","Leading Democrats as well as some Administration allies in Congress predicted today that many elements of the Treasury Department&#x27;s proposed overhaul of the nation&#x27;s banking system would not be enacted.

In an interview in his office, Mr. Brady gave an upbeat appraisal of economic prospects, but he suggested that the Federal Reserve could prolong the recession if it became &quot;preoccupied with inflation&quot; and kept interest rates too high."
"19910326","Treasury Issues Narrowly Mixed","Business","Prices of Treasury securities were narrowly mixed in light trading yesterday, a session highlighted by an auction of $11.5 billion of new two-year notes. Bids at the auction produced an average yield of 7.15 percent, up substantially from the 6.87 percent average rate at the last two-year note sale on Feb. 20."
"19910514","Wells Fargo And Buffett","Business","Wells Fargo &amp; Company said today that the investor Warren E. Buffett had filed for permission to increase his company&#x27;s stake in the San Francisco bank, now at 9.7 percent, to as much as 22 percent. In Federal Reserve Board application, Mr. Buffett said his company, Berkshire Hathaway Inc. of Omaha, might make future stock purchases."
"19910703","End of Slump Forecast For Industrial World","Business","The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development predicted today that the industrial world&#x27;s economic slowdown would end in the second half of this year, led by a recovery in the United States. The O.E.C.D., a group of 24 industrial nations that promotes economic growth, added that the rebound would be modest and would not be strong enough to reduce unemployment in most of the industrial world."
"19910820","Brady Raises Possibility Of More Bid Violations","Business","Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady suggested yesterday that other Wall Street dealers in Treasury securities, in addition to Salomon Brothers, might have violated the Government&#x27;s rule against buying more than 35 percent of the bills, notes or bonds offered at each Treasury auction. &quot;I certainly hope there have not been other violations of the 35 percent rule, but I don&#x27;t know,&quot; Mr. Brady said in an interview. He said the Salomon scandal had prompted an inquiry into the practices of other dealers to determine whether &quot;any were involved in similar incidents.&quot;"
"19910820","Salomon Is Losing Big Client","Business","The investigation of Salomon Brothers Inc. widened yesterday, and the shaken firm began to see the first significant loss of client business in the wake of the Treasuries markets scandal that has enveloped it since last week. The giant California Public Employees&#x27; Retirement System, known as Calpers, announced yesterday that it would suspend doing business with Salomon&#x27;s Government trading desk, even as another large pension fund said it would keep its business at Salomon while the Government&#x27;s investigation of the firm continued."
"19910820","Short-Term Rates Drop Further","Business","Interest rates on short-term issues moved lower again yesterday and bond prices rose as the continuing crisis in the Soviet Union gave investors ample excuse to redirect funds into high-quality, safe securities. In addition to the Soviet crisis, traders said prices had also risen in anticipation that the Federal Reserve Board is about to lower short-term interest rates again soon and the idea that the economy may be falling back into recession."
"19910820","Market Place; Coup Seen Aiding Stocks in U.S.","Business","WITH stock prices down on news of the Soviet coup, many American stock market strategists are arguing that the coup, and the resulting economic and financial impacts, made American stocks a much better buy. &quot;My experience is that these political events do turn out to be pretty transitory&quot; in terms of market impact, Greg Smith, the chief strategist at Prudential Securities, said yesterday. But he added that the turmoil in the Soviet Union was likely to make investing in Europe less attractive, while improving the relative standing of markets in this hemisphere."
"19911001","Japan&#x27;s Central Bank Loosens Credit Squeeze","Business","Japan&#x27;s central bank took an important step today to stimulate the nation&#x27;s sagging economy by changing a rule that will release more than $15 billion of cash into the banking system. The move could also give a modest lift to other countries, particularly the recession-bound United States, by making it easier for them to cut interest rates. The move by the Bank of Japan ended a two-year-old policy of squeezing bank lending to stamp out inflation."
"19911001","Leading Indicators Unchanged in August","Business","The Government&#x27;s main economic forecasting index was flat in August after six straight increases dating back to the period immediately after the Persian Gulf war, the Commerce Department reported today. The unchanged reading for the index of leading indicators, combined with a small decline in a companion index that gauges current business activity, was seen by many analysts as dimming prospects for the economy as the Federal Reserve&#x27;s policy-setting body met behind closed doors to set monetary policy for the next five weeks."
"19911001","Market Place; Mixed News On Dividends","Business","LAST month, for the first time in nearly two years, more companies increased dividends than had done so a year earlier. That fact, in figures released yesterday by the Standard &amp; Poor&#x27;s Corporation, was part of a somewhat contradictory report that shows that while there are signs of a revival in the fortunes of corporate America, there are also indications of increasing financial distress."
"19911105","Bank Funds and C.D.&#x27;s Fall","Business","Yields on deposit accounts fell sharply again this week in anticipation of further easing of interest rates by the Federal Reserve, according to The Bank Rate Monitor, a trade publication that covers interest rates. &quot;Deposit yields on savings accounts will be directly affected by whether the banks lower their prime rate by one-half point or by one-quarter point of 1 percent if the Federal Reserve cuts its discount rate a half-point,&quot; said Robert K. Heady, publisher of The Bank Rate Monitor. &quot;If the banks do not match the Federal Reserve reduction, in essence they would be pocketing the difference at the consumer-borrower&#x27;s expense.&quot;"
"19911105","Economic Scene; Capital Crunch: Capitol Quandary","Business","IS the credit crunch real? Are banks denying creditworthy businesses the loans they need to invest the economy out of the recession? The idea certainly appeals to the White House, which is in hot pursuit of a villain or three to explain why the stalled recovery is not the President&#x27;s fault. But many economists remain skeptical. The fall in the volume of bank loans, they point out, could be explained equally well by a recession-induced decline in the demand for credit."
"19911105","3-Year Note Auction Goes Badly","Business","The first Treasury debt sale under new auction guidelines imposed in the wake of the Salomon Brothers bidding scandal went extremely poorly yesterday, as the Government struggled to sell $14 billion worth of new three-year notes. Traders and analysts cited a number of reasons for the poor auction. But all agreed that it would cost the Treasury -- and the taxpayer -- well over $120 million in higher interest over the life of the securities sold yesterday."
"19911105","Banking Bill Is Delayed In the Senate","Business","A day after the House of Representatives overwhelmingly rejected comprehensive banking legislation, the leadership of the Senate was unable to muster the votes even to begin debate on a similar measure. Senators said that the House action had tainted the issue. Heavy lobbying by Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady, Vice President Dan Quayle and the head of the Banking Committee at separate Democratic and Republican luncheons on Capitol Hill was not enough to produce the 60 votes needed to take up the Senate Banking Committee&#x27;s version of broad bank overhaul."
"19911105","The Mixed Blessing of Empty Bins","Business","A quiet yet radical change in American agricultural policy has largely eliminated the mountainous food stockpiles of the mid-1980&#x27;s. But the new policies, of reducing price supports and subsidizing exports, have devastated the grain storage industry and angered other grain-exporting countries. By encouraging farmers to grow less food and send more of what they do produce overseas, the Federal Government has mostly quit the expensive business of storing huge supplies of grain. Poor harvests in the last two years also contributed to clearing out stockpiles. Reserves are now so low that the Agriculture Department may soon start giving cash subsidies to exporters instead of free grain and dairy products."
"19911217","Fed Appoints Chief Of Currency Markets","Business","William J. McDonough, a former vice chairman of the First Chicago Corporation, was named yesterday to direct the Federal Reserve&#x27;s intervention operations in world currency markets. The job puts him at one of the key pivots in the $600-billion-a-day foreign exchange market."
"19911217","Economic Scene; North American Currency Links?","Business","SHOULD the United States, Mexico and Canada, follow Europe&#x27;s lead and move toward a North American currency area as well as a freer regional trade zone? The question is not on any official agendas. But the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas and the Mexican central bank are quietly studying coordination to dampen swings in the peso-dollar rate. Some hard-pressed Canadian exporters are urging the Canadians to peg the Canadian dollar to the United States dollar. And the former Federal Reserve chairman, Paul A. Volcker, recently predicted that &quot;in five years, you will find a fixed exchange rate among the peso, the U.S. dollar and the Canadian dollar.&quot;"
"19911217","Dow Rally Ends With A 16.77 Fall","Business","Stocks took modest losses in heavy trading yesterday, with some traders seeing disappointment at the Federal Reserve&#x27;s failure to move quickly to lower interest rates. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 16.77 points to close at 2,902.28. After opening higher, then surrendering those gains, stocks moved lower in choppy trading, as investors waited to see if the Fed, after its Open Market Committee meeting, would make another rate cut."
"19911217","Prices of Treasury Securities Rise","Business","Prices of Treasury securities moved higher yesterday despite a signal from the Federal Reserve Board that it had not yet decided to reduce short-term interest rates. Credit market participants said they were surprised when the Fed chose to drain reserves from the banking system when the overnight Federal funds rate was trading at 4 3/8 percent, just under the 4 1/2 percent level that is widely seen as the Fed&#x27;s target."
"19911217","Bank C.D. Yields Off Again","Business","Yields on certificates of deposit and bank money market accounts continued to decline through the week that ends today, according to The Bank Rate Monitor, a publication based in North Palm Beach, Fla., that reports on interest rates. &quot;Because of more weak economic signals, such as a fall in housing starts, and with no inflation in the wind, look for the Federal Reserve to lower the disccount rate momentarily,&quot; Robert K. Heady, publisher of The Monitor, said yesterday. &quot;That should trigger another decline in the banks&#x27; prime rate, especially since their cost of funds has fallen.&quot;"
"19920205","Yields on Tax-Exempt Money Funds Jump","Business","The seven-day yields of tax-exempt funds tended to rise quite sharply for the week ended Monday, while the taxable money funds showed declines for the seven days ended Tuesday, according to IBC/Donoghue&#x27;s Money Fund Report. Referring to the tax-exempts, Walter Frank, an economist for the organization, said, &quot;Once more after a lull, a bigger supply of municipal issues is coming into the market, and that has helped drive up the seven-day yields because demand by the funds has been steady.&quot;"
"19920205","Bush Aides See Gains Later in &#x27;92","Business","President Bush&#x27;s economic advisers said today that the nation&#x27;s sagging economy would probably rebound in a few months, and they rebutted arguments that living standards have dropped under the Reagan and Bush Administrations. In the President&#x27;s Annual Economic Report, the White House said the nation&#x27;s economy would grow by a sluggish 1.6 percent this year if Congress did not pass the President&#x27;s package of tax cuts and other measures meant to stimulate growth. If Congress enacted the program, the report said, growth would climb to 2.2 percent."
"19920205","Dow Down 15 As Smaller Stocks Gain","Business","Stock prices were mixed yesterday in heavy trading as blue chips lost ground at the end while secondary stocks made solid advances. The Dow Jones industrial average, after rising earlier in the day, ended by losing 15.21 points, to 3,257.60, dragged down mainly by a sharp fall at Eastman Kodak. But some other market gauges again broke their recently set records."
"19920331","Quarterly Loss at HomeFed","Business","The HomeFed Corporation said today that it had lost $35.6 million in the fourth quarter of 1991 and that it had not met a deadline set by Federal regulators to strengthen its financial condition. HomeFed, the parent of HomeFed Bank, a savings and loan institution based in San Diego, said it would ask the Office of Thrift Supervision for more time to raise new capital. The Federal regulatory agency had set today as the deadline for the company to raise additional capital, which is the buffer a financial institution keeps against losses."

"19920331","Bank Fund, C.D. Yields Still Mixed","Business","Yields on bank money market accounts and short-term certificates of deposit continued to show a mixed pattern for the week ended today, according to The Bank Rate Monitor. &quot;Doubt is forming as to whether we have seen the end of a three-year downslide in interest rates,&quot; Robert K. Heady, publisher of The Monitor, said yesterday. &quot;On the one hand, there have been upticks in the leading economic indicators as well as in consumer confidence. On the other, economists are urging the Federal Reserve to ease rates further."

Terms were not disclosed."
"19920519","Energy Bill Moves Through House","Business","After weeks of deadlock among several House committee chairmen, a complex energy bill is beginning to emerge that would give tax breaks for developing renewable fuels and limit offshore oil drilling. Lawmakers could take up the measure as early as Wednesday. No fewer than nine committees have contributed nearly 200 versions and amendments, including expansion of the assets of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve and a requirement that utilities help pay the cleanup costs for uranium enrichment plants."
"19920519","Yields Down Moderately On Bank Funds and C.D.&#x27;s","Business","Yields on bank money market accounts and certificates of deposit fell moderately in the week ended today, The Bank Rate Monitor said in its most recent survey. The decline for the last week was sharper outside the New York area, where the yields on both money market accounts and six-month certificates of deposit dropped four basis points. There are 100 basis points in a percentage point. In the New York area, the average commercial bank and savings banks rates were off one basis point."
"19920519","17% Drop In Starts Of Housing","Business","In what was largely seen as a slowing in the wake of unsustainably rapid increases, builders broke ground on new homes at a rate of just 1,115,000 last month, 17 percent below the March pace, the Commerce Department reported today. It was the biggest decline in eight years and embraced all regions of the country. In addition, permits issued for future construction fell 3.3 percent."
"19920519","Treasury Securities Up Sharply","Business","The weakest monthly set of housing data in eight years pushed prices of Treasury securities up sharply yesterday, and long-term interest rates fell to their lowest levels since early February. The housing data showed that starts fell by 17 percent last month, and that permits to build new houses fell for the second straight month. The figures were far weaker than Wall Street economists had expected, and heightened expectations among credit market participants that the Federal Reserve Board would move soon to lower short-term interest rates."
"19920701","Purchasers See Signs of Slow Growth","Business","Economic growth among manufacturers slowed somewhat in June, according to a survey of the nation&#x27;s purchasing managers. Economists contend that the survey indicates that the rebound from recession will be gradual and drawn out. The National Association of Purchasing Management said that its index of economic activity had fallen to 52.8 percent in June, from 56.3 percent in May. The decline was largely a result of slower growth in production and new orders. A reading below 50 percent indicates that the economy is contracting, the group says, while a reading above 50 is a sign of expansion."

Morgenthau. The banker, Sheik Khalid bin Mahfouz, is chief operating officer of the National Commercial Bank, the largest bank in Saudi Arabia, which has a branch in New York. Mr. bin Mahfouz is also believed to be a principal banker for the Saudi ruling family."

Otherwise, it hasn&#x27;t been much of a year so far. In the second quarter of 1992, an unlamented period that saw more stocks go down than up in price, while Wall Street kept looking for signs of economic recovery, the bank stocks starred."
"19920701","Prices of Treasuries Rise Again","Business","Additional signs of economic weakness helped push prices of Treasury securities up again yesterday and heightened anticipation among credit market participants about the release of June employment data today. Prices fell early in the session after the Market News Service reported that representatives of the American Bankers Association&#x27;s economic advisory committee met with a group from the Federal Reserve Board last week and found Fed governors reluctant to ease monetary policy. The group included the Fed chairman, Alan Greenspan."

Clifford and Robert A. Altman until the Manhattan District Attorney&#x27;s office completed its bank fraud case against them. But at a hearing today, United States District Judge Joyce Hens Green did not accept the Justice Department&#x27;s proposal to sort out the trial dates for Mr. Clifford and Mr. Altman. Judge Green has set a trial on the Federal case in Washington for Oct. 26, although a judge in New York has scheduled the trial on the state charges to begin on Oct. 22."
"19920818","Economic Watch; 3 Wishes: Ways for Bush to Prime Economy","Business","With unemployment seemingly stuck near 8 percent and consumers guarding their paychecks as if each would be the last, is George Bush fated to play out the election campaign as Herbert Hoover to Bill Clinton&#x27;s rendition of F.D.R.? The White House has taken pains to scotch rumors that he would announce some dramatic initiative for jump-starting the economy. And some economists hope they mean what they say, arguing that the present course is the best course for a stable, noninflationary economy."
"19920818","Why Haven&#x27;t More Banks Failed?","Business","Earlier this year, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation warned that 200 banks with combined assets of more than $80 billion would fail this year. After seven months, however, only 70 banks with $20.9 billion of assets have failed, far below the rate the F.D.I.C. forecast. But even as banking experts debate how much the slowdown stems from election-year politics and how much from the palliative effects of the lower interest rates that make even the weakest banks more profitable, the F.D.I.C. is warning that tougher new regulations that will take effect on Dec. 19 will result in a flurry of bank closings."
"19920818","Banks Finally Give Chrysler A Crucial $6.8 Billion Loan","Business","The Chrysler Corporation removed a big uncertainty from its balance sheet late Monday night when the last of 152 banks agreed to terms for a new $6.8 billion loan agreement with Chrysler&#x27;s finance subsidiary. The new loan replaces an agreement of the same size that was to expire in March. The new loan will be more expensive for Chrysler, and a large chunk of it must be repaid rather quickly, but the agreement will assure Chrysler&#x27;s dealers of a source of money to finance their vehicle inventories and a way for retail customers to finance purchases of new cars and trucks."
"19920818","Treasuries Regain Some Ground","Business","The bond market rose modestly yesterday, wiping out most of Monday&#x27;s losses on the 30-year bond and moving higher in other maturities. But traders and analysts are still worried about some sudden surprise from the Republican National Convention and expect the market to be volatile for the rest of the week. The day&#x27;s economic data continued to paint a picture of an economy growing slowly, which is one of the main reasons prices of notes and bonds have advanced recently."
"19921006","Bonds Off As the Fed Fails to Act","Business","Frustrated in their hopes that the Federal Reserve would cut interest rates yesterday, money managers dumped many of the bonds they had piled up in the last week. Some had counted on selling their hoards to investors fleeing the stock market, but a calm day there created no appetite for bonds. The sharp selloff reflected some traders&#x27; beliefs that Fed policy makers, who met yesterday, might not lower their rates as soon, or as much, as had been expected."
"19921006","Presidential Candidates Ignore Banking Problem","Business","Six weeks after the November elections, a new banking law will go into effect that will force the President to confront what will certainly be one of the most unpleasant challenges of his Administration: the plight of the nation&#x27;s banks. The insurance fund that protects deposits is already $5.5 billion in the red and is supposed to stand behind $3 trillion worth of deposits. It will be called upon to protect thousands of depositors at hundreds of institutions expected to collapse next year. Yet the Presidential contenders have barely mentioned the issue."
"19921006","Bank Yields Are Off Again","Business","Yields on bank money market accounts and certificates of deposit eroded a bit more this week, according to new rates to take effect today. The slide is a continuation of a downward trend in yields that began with the last interest rate cut by the Federal Reserve in July. Analysts at The Bank Rate Monitor, a Florida publication that tracks interest rates, said the week&#x27;s decline in yields was slightly steeper than in the previous week, and that last Friday&#x27;s employment report, which underlined the weakness in the recovery, might have set the stage for another cut in rates."
"19921006","World Stock Prices Stabilize; Dow Off 0.81","Business","The world&#x27;s major stock markets stabilized yesterday following Monday&#x27;s sharp gyrations. Prices on European exchanges recovered some but not all the big losses of a day earlier, inspired in part by the impressive recovery on the New York Stock Exchange Monday afternoon. Analysts said a renewed hope that the Bundesbank might cut interest rates also helped shore up prices."

Next month it will go on the bidding block as part of an auction of properties, with an appraised value of $750 million, reclaimed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.

The 67,000-square-foot retail condominium occupies the blockfronts of East Eighth Street, Broadway and University Place, with the East Ninth Street side of the block mostly residential. It is one of 270 properties taken over from failed banks across the nation that the F.D.I.C. will auction on Dec. 1 and 2. They range from apartments and shopping centers to hotels and industrial buildings. Of them, 24 are in Connecticut, 13 in New Jersey and 5 in New York. The only one in Manhattan is the East Eighth Street retail blockfront, which the F.D.I.C inherited when it seized the Goldome Savings Bank of Buffalo, which held a mortgage on the property from VMS Realty Inc. of Chicago."

William B. Harrison Jr., the vice chairman of Chemical, said he hoped the company would be among the top four underwriters of junk bonds within three years. He justified the goal by saying that since its merger a year and a half ago with Manufacturers Hanover Trust, Chemical has been the largest lender to big corporations. This year Chemical has arranged 75 large loans totaling $33 billion, half again as much as the second-ranked bank, J. P. Morgan &amp; Company, according to Loan Pricing Corporation, a New York consulting firm."
"19930518","Treasury Bond Yield Above 7%","Business","Interest rates surged yesterday, with the yield on the 30-year Treasury bond jumping above 7 percent. As a result, many investors may switch their focus to how much higher interest rates might go rather than how much lower. While 7 percent itself is not an important number economically, it can be seen as the psychological threshold between a market rally and a selloff, especially given the new concerns about inflation, worries about the fate of President Clinton&#x27;s economic program and guessing over whether the Federal Reserve will now move to raise short-term interest rates to combat renewed inflation."
"19930518","Interest-Rate Concerns Push Dow Lower by 5.54 Points","Business","Chilled by the uncertainty of future interest rates, stock market investors returned yesterday to the trading range that has characterized the market for the last several weeks.

But despite the lowest mortgage rates in nearly two decades, nobody is counting on another 1980&#x27;s-style housing boom."
"19930707","Treasury Yields Stay Near Lows","Business","Interest rates were little changed yesterday as traders and investors marked time while yields on Treasury notes and bonds remained near their lowest levels in 20 years or more. With yields so low, many investors are wary about new purchases of long-term Treasury issues. But with short-term interest rates barely above 3 percent, they are not willing to ignore the long-term market completely."
"19930817","Short-Term Issues Still Alluring","Business","Despite the persistent rally in the long end of the Treasury market, there are signs in the corporate bond market that many money managers still prefer the safety of shorter maturities. Stephen Clark, senior corporate market analyst at Technical Data, notes that the spreads between the yields on shorter-term corporate bonds and comparable Treasury securities have narrowed recently, which is a sign of strong demand for corporates. At the same time, he said, the yield spread on longer-term corporate debt has held constant in the new-issue market and, in some cases, has widened when issues begin trading in the secondary market."

The Federal Reserve increased the rate for overnight loans between banks by a quarter of a percentage point, to 3.25 percent. This reversal in monetary policy will scarcely affect the interest rates that Americans pay on home mortgages or car loans, economists and business executives said, nor is it likely to have any immediate effect on the health of the economy.

One reason may be that the Fed sees inflationary pressures that normal mortals do not. But another reason is that the monetary authorities needed to send a calming message to investors, who had pushed long-term interest rates up to almost 7 percent."
"19940322","Dow Slips by 2.30 as Rates Are Pushed Up","Business","&quot;Fed Tuesday&quot; arrived on time, to the great relief of Wall Street professionals. At last, the Federal Reserve did what the stock market had been apparently demanding for weeks: nudge up interest rates to choke an inflation that does not yet exist. In a relatively quiet day, traders bid up shares following the Fed action, news of which ran on news services shortly before 2:30 P.M. But the major indexes closed mixed, in part because of high-speed computer-guided trading that sold shares in the final seconds of the session to take advantage of rising prices."
"19940517","Dollar Trims Early Losses After Rate Increase by Fed","Business","The dollar was steady against most leading currencies yesterday, paring early losses after the Federal Reserve raised interest rates for the fourth time this year to head off the inflation that often accompanies economic growth. Many traders bought dollars after the Fed pushed up short-term rates by half a percentage point, raising its discount rate to 3.5 percent and lifting the Federal funds rate to 4.25 percent. Higher interest rates usually make dollar-denominated assets more attractive to investors."
"19940517","Stocks Rise in Support Of Fed&#x27;s Move on Rates","Business","In a paradoxical show of exuberance, stock traders bid up share prices on the leading indexes yesterday after the Federal Reserve raised short-term interest rates, a move that would seemingly hurt stocks by making borrowing more expensive. But in this market, traders fear inflation more than they do high interest rates, said Dudley A. Eppel, managing director of listed equity trading for Donaldson, Lufkin &amp; Jenrette. &quot;What used to be bad is now good,&quot; he said. &quot;We look forward to high interest rates.&quot;"
"19940517","Fed&#x27;s Move Heartens Markets","Business","Financial markets surged in reaction to the Federal Reserve Board&#x27;s decision to raise two key short-term interest rates yesterday. Equally important, analysts said the Fed&#x27;s move was likely to help stabilize market conditions into the summer, thereby ending a period of chaotic volatility that has persisted since early February."
"19940706","Fed Fails To Move On Rates","Business","The Federal Reserve ended a two-day strategy session on monetary policy today without announcing an increase in short-term interest rates or explaining its apparent inaction. Analysts took this to mean that the central bank, which had raised rates four times since early February, was satisfied with early signs that the economy is slowing enough to minimize the risk of resurgent inflation."
"19940706","Treasuries Slip as Fed Fails to Act","Business","Prices of Treasury securities slipped yesterday after the Federal Reserve took no action on interest rates, raising concern among some traders and investors that the Fed was not being aggressive enough in fighting inflation. The Fed&#x27;s policy-making body, the Federal Open Market Committee, said in a statement that its two-day meeting ended at 12:35 P.M. &quot;and there will be no further announcement.&quot;"
"19940706","Dollar Recovers as Traders Await Rate Action by Fed","Business","The dollar recovered yesterday from an early selloff that had sent it to a 14-month low against the German mark, as traders waited to see whether the Federal Reserve would make any move to push up interest rates. The Fed&#x27;s Federal Open Market Committee ended a two-day meeting without announcing any action on its monetary policy, providing an indication that it had apparently decided to make no immediate move to raise interest rates to support the dollar."
"19940706","Dow Rises 22.02 as Most Other Indexes Fall","Business","Stocks were mixed yesterday for the second consecutive session, with the main blue-chip indicator up and the broader market indexes down, but off the lows for the day. Mindful of the bond market and weakness of the dollar, many investors were still unsure about the possibility of another increase in interest rates by the Federal Reserve, and moved to the sidelines to await the release tomorrow of employment data for June."
"19940816","Rate Move Buoys Price Of Bonds","Business","Prices of Treasury securities rose sharply yesterday, after the Federal Reserve announced its fifth interest rate increase of the year. The price of the 30-year bond climbed 120/32 , to 10118/32 , for a yield of 7.37 percent, down from 7.50 percent on Monday. The yield was the lowest in nearly two weeks. Before the Fed began raising interest rates, starting with an increase in the funds rate on Feb. 4, the yield was 6.35 percent."
"19940816","Dow Up 24.28 Amid Rate Rise Confusion","Business","The financial markets, which have lobbied both for and against another interest-rate increase by the Federal Reserve Board, got what some traders wanted yesterday: a sharp boost in both the Federal funds rate and the discount rate by half a percentage point. But after the Fed&#x27;s move, the fifth such increase this year, other traders&#x27; heads turned continually in the space of half an hour yesterday. Both stock and bond trends reversed field before turning up decisively by day&#x27;s end in active trading."
"19940816","Airwave Entrepreneurs Still Feeling Their Way","Business","As the owner of the Continental Windshield Repair Company in Baton Rouge, La., Marilyn U. Moore would hardly seem qualified to become a communications entrepreneur. But that didn&#x27;t stop her from bidding a hefty $600,000 recently for a handful of licenses to provide interactive television service over the airwaves. &quot;I believe that interactive television is the wave of the future,&quot; said Ms. Moore, who along with hundreds of other people packed into a Washington hotel ballroom three weeks ago and took an entrepreneurial leap of faith that if the Government was holding an auction then there must be something valuable for sale."
"19940927","Treasury Issues Retreat As Rates Don&#x27;t Change","Business","Prices of Treasury long-term securities fell yesterday after the Federal Reserve left interest rates unchanged. The 30-year bond fell 18/32 , to a price of 962/32 , for a yield of 7.84 percent, up from 7.79 percent on Monday and the highest since June 23, 1992. The rates on shorter-term Treasury bills fell, however, as investors sold long-term notes and bonds into less volatile three-month and six-month bills."
"19940927","Dollar, Following Bonds, Falls on Fed Rate Inaction","Business","The dollar fell against most leading currencies yesterday after a decline in American bond prices. Bond prices fell after the Fed&#x27;s policy-making committee, the Federal Open Market Committee, ended its meeting yesterday without announcing any change in short-term interest rates. Currency traders often watch the performance of the bond market to gauge foreign investors&#x27; appetite for American assets, and the dollars needed to buy them."
"19940927","No Fed Rate Rise, and No Big Market Moves","Business","The Federal Reserve&#x27;s top interest rate policy committee adjourned after a four-hour meeting today without announcing any change in short-term interest rates. But the consensus of economists was that the committee probably gave Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, considerable leeway to raise rates again before the committee next meets on Nov. 15, particularly if Government economic data issued in the next six weeks show signs that inflation is rising"
"19940927","Gold Tops $400 an Ounce As Inflationary Fears Rise","Business","Gold prices settled above $400 an ounce yesterday for the first time in more than a year as concerns over inflation heightened when the Federal Reserve left interest rates unchanged. Traders fear consumer prices could go up, and the value of assets like stocks and bonds could erode."
"19940927","Stocks Are Up Slightly, With the Dow Advancing 13.80","Business","Many stock traders correctly guessed yesterday that the Federal Reserve would not raise interest rates. Traders therefore bid up stock prices, but not by much. The bond market dropped a little and so did the dollar. Gold promptly jumped, possibly, some analysts said, on fears the Fed was weakening its inflation-fighting resolve. But it did not break above the important, $400-an-ounce barrier."
"19941115","The Fed&#x27;s Moves: How Consumer Rates React","Business","Six times this year, the Federal Reserve has increased short-term interest rates, trying to brake the economy, including a 0.75-percent jump yesterday. Some rates that consumers earn or pay have reacted sharply and promptly; others have shrugged off the Fed&#x27;s moves. Articles, pages A1 and D6."
"19941115","Long-Bond Yield Dips After Fed&#x27;s Tightening","Business","The long end of the Treasury market rallied yesterday after the Federal Reserve announced its sixth and largest interest rate increase of the year, easing traders&#x27; fears of inflation. By late in the day, the 30-year bond was up 8/32 , to a price of 9327/32 , for a yield of 8.05 percent, down from 8.07 percent on Monday. Despite the rise in the long end of the Treasury market, prices in shorter maturities were mixed."
"19941115","Fed Move Sends Stocks on Roller Coaster","Business","Stock traders had clamored for strong inflation-fighting medicine but swooned when they got it yesterday. The Dow Jones industrial average initially plummeted almost 50 points after the Federal Reserve raised short-term interest rates by a surprisingly large three-quarters of a percentage point. Barely an hour later, Wall Street was confronted by the consequences of getting what it wished for. Large money-center banks like Citicorp and Wells Fargo raised their prime, or minimum, lending rate by three-quarters of a point, too. By then, however, the market had turned and ended the day mixed but essentially unchanged, despite heavy trading."
"19941115","U.S. Industry Had a Surge In October","Business","American factories, mines and utilities stepped up their operating rate to nearly 85 percent of industrial capacity in October -- a level that had not been reached since 1980 during the Carter Administration. A strong increase in output, pushing against industry&#x27;s ability to turn out additional products without raising prices, contributed to the Federal Reserve&#x27;s decision today to raise short-term interest rates yet again in an attempt to restrain the robust economy."
"19941115","Lumber and Copper Prices Soar While Coffee Plunges","Business","Lumber rose to its highest price in two months yesterday on the Chicago Board of Trade as demand from home builders stays strong even as interest rates go up. On other commodities markets, copper rose while coffee plunged. The Commodity Research Bureau index of 21 commodities rose 0.48 point, to 233.74."
"19941115","Bumper Crops Pose Political Problem for Farmers","Business","The nation&#x27;s farmers have been reaping their most bountiful harvest ever in many important crops, benefiting shoppers for groceries from meat to cooking oil but costing taxpayers an estimated $3 billion to $4 billion in additional farm subsidies. Production of corn, the nation&#x27;s biggest crop, is expected to reach 10.01 billion bushels, nearly 5.6 percent higher than 1992&#x27;s record crop and almost 60 percent more than last year when the Midwest flooded and the Southeast baked, according to Department of Agriculture estimates released last Wednesday. Production also soared to new records for rice and soybeans, which are widely used in animal feed, cooking oil and food ingredients. Wheat crops, while short of records, were larger than average."
"19941220","The Fed Forgoes a Seventh Rate Increase","Business","The Federal Reserve&#x27;s top officials met for nearly four hours today but adjourned without announcing any change in interest rates. Most economists and traders still expect the Fed to raise rates again, possibly at its next meeting on Jan. 31 and Feb. 1, or perhaps before then."
"19941220","Bills Gain On Inaction By the Fed","Business","Prices of Treasury bills and notes rose yesterday as the Federal Reserve&#x27;s policy-making committee adjourned its meeting without altering interest-rate policy. But the price of the 30-year bond slipped 2/32 of a percentage point, to 96 2/32 , for a yield of 7.84 percent, unchanged from Monday."
"19941220","Stocks Mostly Lower in Heavy Trading","Business","The stock market closed mixed but generally lower in heavy trading yesterday after the Federal Reserve took no action on interest rates, a move that, at least in the short run, should have helped lift stock prices. But several weeks ago, the market had begun to anticipate the Fed&#x27;s possible reluctance to raise rates and therefore lifted prices in advance of a deferred action, some analysts said."
"19941220","Trade Gap Widened In October","Business","The American economy pulled in a record amount of imported goods in October as the nation&#x27;s trade deficit with Japan soared to a new peak of $6.7 billion, the Commerce Department reported today. Over all, the gap between what this country buys abroad and what it sells abroad widened to $10.14 billion for the month, an increase from the September total that was revised sharply downward. Initially the department had estimated a September deficit of $10.13 billion."
"19950201","Stocks End Day Mixed as Fed Raises Rates","Business","In another hectic session, the stock market closed mixed but essentially unchanged yesterday, as the Federal Reserve raised interest rates again. Bonds and the dollar gave back some of their gains from Tuesday. Banks like Citicorp moved immediately to lift the prime interest rate to 9 percent from 8 1/2 percent."
"19950201","Prices Drop After Fed&#x27;s Rate Move","Business","Prices of Treasury securities dropped yesterday, following the awaited move by the Federal Reserve to raise short-term interest rates by half of a percentage point. The bond market for weeks had been expecting the central bank&#x27;s seventh rate increase in the last year, traders said. But yesterday&#x27;s selloff was not necessarily a sign of displeasure, but rather the act of investors who had bought securities on the bet that the Fed would raise rates, and now were selling to take profits."
"19950201","Dollar Drops Despite Rise In Interest Rates by the Fed","Business","The dollar fell against most leading currencies yesterday after the Federal Reserve raised interest rates by half a percentage point, a move many currency dealers had expected. &quot;It was a case of &#x27;Buy the rumor, sell the news,&#x27; and the selling was completed quickly,&quot; said Jerry Egan, managing director of foreign exchange at the MTB Bank in New York."
"19950201","Umbrella Credit Union Seized by Regulators","Business","The Capital Corporate Federal Credit Union, the latest victim of a bad bet in derivatives, has been seized by Federal credit union regulators. The move by the National Credit Union Administration late Monday to take over the day-to-day operations of Cap Corp, as it is known, came after Cap Corp, based in Latham, Md., incurred $100 million in losses on its huge portfolio of collateralized mortgage obligations. Cap Corp is one of the nation&#x27;s largest umbrella credit organizations, covering more than one million individual members. The takeover is the first since the N.C.U.A. was established in 1970."
"19950201","Ford&#x27;s Profits Conclude Banner Year for Big Three","Business","By announcing today that it had posted a record profit of $ 5.3 billion for last year, the Ford Motor Company made it official. The Big Three auto makers made more money in 1994 -- almost $ 14 billion -- than ever before. And Ford&#x27;s earnings report illustrated how they did it, even though the market for vehicles constituted about a million fewer sales than at its peak in 1986: emphasizing sales of more profitable mini-vans and sport utility vehicles like the Explorer, loading record amounts of overtime on their workers to increase productivity, and cutting other costs throughout the company."
"19950201","Confusion Reigns in Auto Sales","Business","One might think it a pretty straightforward act, toting up car and light-truck sales. But many of the world&#x27;s auto makers tried to tally their January sales today, and the result was chaos that made it impossible to determine for sure if the market is headed up, down or sideways."
"19950328","The Fed Meets, and Doesn&#x27;t Raise Rates","Business","The Federal Reserve&#x27;s interest-rate-setting committee met here today without changing short-term rates, the latest sign the central bankers think that the United States economy is settling down to steady growth with low inflation. The policy group, the Federal Open Market Committee, issued a characteristically brief statement at the end of the meeting, which was the first since the panel raised rates by half a percentage point on Feb. 1."
"19950328","Dollar Is Pushed Down Sharply As Fed Declines to Raise Rates","Business","The dollar fell sharply against the German mark and the Japanese yen yesterday as the Federal Reserve left interest rate unchanged. The dollar fell throughout the day amid expectations that the Fed would not raise short-term interest rates. When the Fed announced yesterday afternoon that it was not taking any action, the dollar stayed at its depressed levels."
"19950328","Consumer Optimism Hurts Treasury Prices","Business","Prices of Treasury securities tumbled yesterday, hurt by a report showing consumer confidence was higher than expected. The selloff gave back more than half of the gains of a two-day bond rally. Prices fell after the Conference Board said consumer confidence in March rose to 101 from a revised 99.4 in February. The report revived concerns that recent signs of an economic slowdown might be fleeting."
"19950328","Stocks End Day Mixed, Deflated Somewhat by Bond Prices","Business","The stock market closed mixed yesterday, with the Dow Jones industrial average falling, the Standard &amp; Poor&#x27;s 500 index edging again into record territory and the Nasdaq composite index, which is rich in technology stocks, surging to another high. The negative factors included the dollar again falling near post-World War II lows against the mark and the yen, and bond prices dropping and long-term interest rates rising. Moreover, some analysts say stock prices may be too high and thus headed for a fall."
"19950523","Fed Policy Makers Decide To Leave Rates Unchanged","Business","Faced with slowing growth in the American economy and a strengthening dollar, the Federal Reserve left short-term interest rates unchanged at a meeting today. The Fed&#x27;s interest rate policy group, the Federal Open Market Committee, signaled its decision with a brief statement. &quot;The F.O.M.C. meeting ended at 12:15 P.M.; there is no further announcement,&quot; said Joseph R. Coyne, the Fed&#x27;s chief spokesman."
"19950523","Bond Rally Sends Rates Downward","Business","Bonds rallied yesterday, sending interest rates to their lowest levels in nearly a week on speculation that the Fed would cut short-term interest rates soon. The policy-making Federal Open Market Committee met without changing the Fed&#x27;s monetary policy. After the meeting, the Fed&#x27;s spokesman simply said, &quot;There is no further announcement.&quot;"
"19950523","Founder of Askin Capital Agrees To Settlement of S.E.C. Charges","Business","David J. Askin, whose investment firm collapsed after bond prices plummeted last year, yesterday settled Securities and Exchange Commission charges that he had misled investors. Mr. Askin agreed to be barred from the securities industry for two years and to pay $50,000, which will be placed in escrow to compensate former clients of Askin Capital Management, the firm he founded in January 1993."
"19950523","Stock Prices Rise Strongly For a 2d Day","Business","Wall Street rushed back to stocks for a second consecutive session yesterday, nearly wiping out last week&#x27;s losses, after the Federal Reserve signaled a continuation of its steady interest-rate policy and traders speculated that there would be a rate cut later this year. As measured by the Standard &amp; Poor&#x27;s index of 500 stocks and the Nasdaq composite index, stocks raced to record levels. Traders bought back many of the stocks they had bid down last week, and much of the market has now returned to its price level of last Wednesday. The market fell 81.96 points on Thursday alone, when there was a rush of sell orders brought on by the quarterly expiration of options on Friday."
"19950706","This Time, the Fed Trails the Market","Business","The bankers who set loan and deposit rates and the investors who buy and sell Treasury bonds apparently concluded months ago that the risk of an overheated economy was fading and higher interest rates were no longer needed to protect them against inflation. The Federal Reserve waited until yesterday to ratify that thinking with its first cut in the Federal funds rate after a yearlong series of increases. Many rates that directly affect consumers had already fallen in anticipation of the move, and analysts say long-term rates are not likely to fall further soon, though short-term rates may drop. Articles, pages A1 and D4."
"19950706","Interest Rate Cut By Fed Pushes Treasury Prices Up","Business","Treasury prices surged yesterday after the Federal Reserve cut short-term interest rates by a quarter of percentage point. The move matched the expectations of many in the market, which had already priced in a cut of that size. But many trader and analysts are still uncertain about how far the Fed&#x27;s new course will take interest rates."
"19950706","Dollar Remains Little Changed After Interest Rate Cut by Fed","Business","The dollar was little changed against most major currencies yesterday after the Federal Reserve trimmed interest rates for the first time in almost three years. Lower rates often weigh on the dollar by making United States deposits less attractive, but because the Fed&#x27;s quarter-point cut had been anticipated by many investors, the reaction of the dollar was muted."
"19950706","Reduction&#x27;s Biggest Impact: Fanning Hopes of More Cuts","Business","The Federal Reserve&#x27;s move yesterday to reduce the Federal funds rate, which banks charge each other for overnight loans, is likely to have only a minor impact on consumers, at least in the near future. Indeed, the Fed&#x27;s decision to drop short-term interest rates merely mirrored what has already happened in financial markets. Long-term mortgage rates have already fallen almost one and a half percentage points, to 7.63 percent, since the beginning of the year, and yields on Treasury bonds have also dropped steadily."
"19950706","Japan, France and Canada Join the Assault on Interest Rates","Business","The Japanese central bank announced today that it would push interest rates lower in an effort to shore up the nation&#x27;s faltering economy. The Bank of Japan said it would let the overnight call rate, the rate for overnight loans between banks, fall below the discount rate. But the central bank said it had no plans to lower the discount rate, which is already at a record low of 1 percent."
"19950706","Stocks Soar; Dow Up 48.77 After the Fed Lowers Rate","Business","When the Federal Reserve dropped the other shoe yesterday, the stock market reacted with a surge of energy. Within minutes after the Fed&#x27;s Open Market Committee announced at 2:15 P.M. that it was lowering its target for the Federal funds rate by one-quarter of a percentage point to 5.75 percent, buyers poured into the market, sending the key averages into record territory."
"19950822","Fed Leaving Rates Alone, As Expected","Business","With the economy apparently recovering from a stumble in the spring, the Federal Reserve&#x27;s top policy committee chose today to leave short-term rates unchanged. The decision to do nothing had been widely expected, given a recent string of strong economic indicators that suggested little need for the Fed to stimulate the economy right now. But the decision was nonetheless important as an indication that the central bank planned to move slowly on lowering rates even in the face of an equally striking set of indicators showing inflation was under control."
"19950822","Dollar Climbs Against Mark; Bundesbank Rate Cuts Are Seen","Business","The dollar rose against the German mark yesterday on signs that the Bundesbank might soon reduce interest rates. The decision by the Federal Reserve to leave American interest rates unchanged had little discernible impact on the dollar."
"19950822","In a Session Lacking Focus, the Dow Rises 5.64 Points","Business","Wall Street endured a typically dull late-August session yesterday, showing little response to the Federal Reserve Board&#x27;s decision not to act on interest rates. Trading volume was sluggish and there were relatively small changes on the plus side in the major market averages."
"19950822","Treasury Prices Fall as Fed Leaves Rates Unchanged","Business","Prices of Treasury securities slipped yesterday, as the Federal Reserve left short-term interest rates unchanged at its monetary policy meeting and the Treasury sold two-year notes in a successful auction. The 30-year bond slipped 8/32 of a percentage point, to a price of 99 28/32; its yield, which moves in the opposite direction from its price, was 6.89 percent, compared with 6.87 percent on Monday."
"19950926","Fed Passes Again on Cutting Short-Term Rates","Business","The Federal Reserve today left short-term interest rates unchanged, apparently believing that the economy was showing adequate growth again after a swoon in the spring. This was the second straight meeting at which the Federal Open Market Committee, the central bank&#x27;s main policy arm, passed up a chance to cut rates further since it reversed course in early July and lowered them for the first time since 1992."
"19950926","Treasury Prices End Mixed As Fed Holds Line on Rates","Business","Prices of Treasury securities were mixed yesterday, after the Federal Reserve&#x27;s Open Market Committee left interest rates unchanged at its policy meeting. Bonds were initially higher in early trading after the Conference Board reported its consumer confidence reading had fallen in September to 97.4, below the average trade forecast of 100. In August it was 102.4. Analysts said the report suggested signs of waning consumer optimism that could restrain growth. People buy things when they feel confident; when they do not, manufacturing slows and inventories rise."
"19951115","Fed Maintains Rates, Though More Signs of Sluggishness Emerge","Business","Despite mounting evidence of some economic slowing, the Federal Reserve decided today against lowering interest rates, which would have made borrowing less costly at the start of the holiday shopping season. Analysts generally attributed the decision to the Federal Government&#x27;s stalemated budget negotiations and to the absence of compelling evidence that the economy needs to be spurred, though it is less robust than during the summer."
"19951115","Treasuries Little Changed As the Fed Lets Rates Stand","Business","Treasury prices were little changed yesterday as the Federal Reserve left interest rates unchanged. While the outcome of the Fed&#x27;s policy-committee meeting was expected, it did hold down prices by turning the market&#x27;s attention back to the impasse on the Federal budget and debt limit, as well as to the next Federal Open Market Committee policy meeting."
"19951115","Dow Climbs Past 4,900 for First Time With a 50.94 Surge","Business","The Dow Jones industrial average soared past 4,900 for the first time yesterday, and the broader-based Standard &amp; Poor&#x27;s 500-stock index also set a record. Benign news on inflation put traders in a buying mood, even though the Federal Reserve took no action on cutting interest rates at yesterday&#x27;s meeting of its Federal Open Market Committee and the debt squabble in Washington was unresolved. In addition, four rounds of computer-guided &quot;buy&quot; orders in advance of tomorrow&#x27;s double-witching options expiration helped push the stock market upward late in the day."
"19951219","A Rate Cut, and a Fistful of Reasons","Business","For the second time this year, the Federal Reserve&#x27;s top policy makers met in the face of substantial market pressure for lower rates and decided to cut -- by the smallest amount possible. The decision is another example of the way the Fed can use its powers over interest rates not only to change the cost of money, but also to send a reassuring signal to investors and politicians alike."
"19951219","Fed Rate Cut Spurs Prices Of Treasuries","Business","Prices of Treasury securities rebounded sharply yesterday as the Federal Reserve lowered short-term interest rates. The price of the 30-year bond rose 1 10/32, to 110 15/32; its yield, which moves in the opposite direction of its price, dropped to 6.11 percent, down from 6.20 percent on Monday. The benchmark issue lost a point and a half on Monday on fears the cut would not occur while Federal budget talks were stalemated. Before rising, bonds faltered in early trading on follow-through selling generated by Monday&#x27;s steep drop."
"19951219","Market Place;Fleet buys NatWest cheap, in a deal that&#x27;s widely applauded.","Business","EVEN bankers sometimes can live well shopping at the bargain basement. Fleet Financial Group confirmed yesterday that it had agreed to buy NatWest Bank, the New York and New Jersey operation of National Westminster Bank P.L.C. of Britain, for $3.26 billion. That price represents 1.05 times the book value of NatWest and 12.3 times its earnings. It is far less than the multiples in other bank deals this year, especially the sky-high premiums paid in New Jersey by First Union, which bought the First Fidelity Bancorporation for $5.6 billion, and the PNC Bank Corporation, which bought the Midlantic Corporation for $3 billion."
"19951219","Stocks, Bonds Surge After Fed&#x27;s Action","Business","For financial markets, it was almost as if Monday never happened. Following one of the bigger one-day selloffs in recent years, stock and bond prices both snapped back smartly yesterday after the Federal Reserve lowered a key short-term borrowing rate by a quarter of a percentage point."
"19960131","White House Wish: Healthy Economy in Election","Business","The Federal Reserve&#x27;s move today to nudge along a sputtering economic expansion highlights the one question that looms over almost every political strategy meeting at the White House these days: What are the chances that President Clinton will run into the kind of economic downturn that killed off George Bush&#x27;s candidacy four years ago? The Fed&#x27;s answer, reading between the lines of its analysis of the economy, is that a pre-election downturn is possible but increasingly unlikely. The Federal Reserve policy makers who approved a modest cut in short-term interest rates seem to be taking the view that resonates through conversations with chief executives and investment bankers. Things are slowing down a bit, the nation&#x27;s business leaders contend, but nothing like the recession of 1991 and 1992."
"19960131","It&#x27;s No Rally, But Bonds Do Move Higher","Business","Prices of Treasury securities moved moderately higher yesterday but fell short of the strong rally some traders expected after a cut in short-term rates by the Federal Reserve Board. The reduction was the third by the Fed in eight months as it has attempted to reignite the economy; the last cut came on Dec. 19."
"19960131","This Model Was Too Rough;Why Economic Forecasting Became a Sideshow","Business","Want to know what I.B.M.&#x27;s in-house economist thinks is in store for the American economy in 1996? You&#x27;re out of luck: the giant computer maker, which counted more than two dozen economists on its payroll in the early 1970&#x27;s, no longer employs a single professional to estimate key numbers like interest rates, capital spending and inflation. And the International Business Machines Corporation has lots of company. Dozens of other big corporations have either slashed or eliminated their forecasting staffs and signed up with commercial services to do their crystal gazing for them. &quot;It&#x27;s more economical,&quot; said Bruce Bunch, a spokesman for the General Electric Company, a conglomerate with $60 billion in annual sales -- and no in-house economist."
"19960131","Economic Scene;Changing the tax system has an allure. But will the fixes work?","Business","TAX reform is the Republican flavor of the month. The Kemp Commission, recruited by Newt Gingrich to give his party a tonier image on economic issues, is calling for an end to the income tax as we know it. Steve Forbes&#x27;s tireless pitch for the flat tax has helped him to break away from the pack chasing Bob Dole for the Republican Presidential nomination. And why not? A makeover of taxes that promises, in the words of the Kemp Commission, to double the rate of economic growth, sure beats abortion or affirmative action as a party-unifying, good-news issue."
"19960131","Fed&#x27;s Decision to Lower Rates Advances Dow to 5,395.30","Business","The stock market continued to demonstrate its strength yesterday after the Federal Reserve lowered interest rates by a quarter of a percentage point -- its third reduction since last July. Stocks generally sold off in the morning, but turned upward once the Fed made its widely expected announcement around 2:15 P.M. The Dow Jones industrial average even spurted past the 5,400 level, just two days after reaching the 5,300 mark, before easing off to close at still another high of 5,395.30, up 14.09 points."
"19960326","Greenspan Calls the Fed &#x27;Extraordinarily Well Run&#x27;","Business","Responding to a Congressional report that was critical of the Federal Reserve&#x27;s management of its finances, Alan Greenspan today defended his record as chairman of the central bank at a Senate hearing on his nomination to a third term, calling the Federal Reserve &quot;an extraordinarily well-run organization.&quot; On a day in which the Federal Reserve&#x27;s monetary policy committee decided to leave interest rates unchanged, Mr. Greenspan also gave a relatively upbeat though brief assessment of the economy, saying it was operating at a &quot;reasonably good clip&quot; with unemployment &quot;lower than it&#x27;s been at any time in the recent past.&quot;"
"19960326","Treasury Securities Hold Steady","Business","Prices of Treasury securities were little changed in thin trading yesterday, as the Federal Reserve held its monetary policy meeting without changing short-term interest rates. The Fed&#x27;s decision had little impact on the bond market, as it had long been expected, especially after a surprisingly strong employment report earlier this month crushed any remaining hopes that rates would be lowered yesterday. Indeed, some market participants expect the central bank will refrain from lowering rates at its next policy-making meeting, on May 21, unless it has evidence that the economy is as weak as it appeared at the beginning of the year."
"19960326","Oil and Technology Stocks Lead Modest Rise in Market","Business","The stock market rose broadly yesterday, helped by a recovery in technology issues and a surge in oil shares. The gains came on a day when Federal Reserve policy makers left short-term interest rates unchanged, as expected."
"19960521","Bonds Mixed As Fed Keeps Policy Steady","Business","Treasury prices were mixed in light trading yesterday as Federal Reserve policy makers left interest rates unchanged, as expected. Bond prices rose in early trading after a weekly report on retail sales showed weakness, but the price gains faded after another retail survey late in the day showed a sharp rise in sales."
"19960521","Toys &#x27;R&#x27; Us Is Expecting Antitrust Case by U.S.","Business","Toys &quot;R&quot; Us, the country&#x27;s largest toy retailer, said yesterday that it expected that the Federal Trade Commission would bring antitrust charges against it today, and that the company would vigorously contest any action challenging its buying practices. &quot;We expect the litigation will be filed tomorrow,&quot; a company spokesman, Lawrence A. Rand, said. The commission&#x27;s staff has recommended that the charges be filed, he said."
"19960521","German Banker&#x27;s Remark Lifts The Dollar to a 16-Month High","Business","The dollar rose to a 16-month high against the mark yesterday after a German central bank official suggested that a weaker mark could help the nation&#x27;s sagging economy. A higher dollar &quot;would have benefits,&quot; said Olaf Sievert, a member of the Bundesbank&#x27;s interest rate-setting council. He said he had &quot;no fear&quot; that German inflation would accelerate if the dollar rose &quot;a couple of pfennigs.&quot; A pfennig is a hundredth of a mark."
"19960703","Fed Leaves Rates Unchanged, and Focus Turns to August","Business","The Federal Reserve left interest rates unchanged at the conclusion of a two-day meeting today, but analysts said the central bank might well push rates up later this summer unless there are pronounced signs that the economy is slowing. As usual, the Fed&#x27;s policy-making committee offered no explanation for its decision not to raise the short-term rates it controls. Economists said the Fed appeared to be betting that the surprisingly strong growth of the last quarter -- most estimates are that the economy expanded at a 4 percent annual rate in the second three months of the year -- would slow considerably in coming months, easing any inflationary pressures that might be building."
"19960703","Treasury Prices End Up Slightly","Business","Treasury prices ended slightly higher yesterday on relief that Federal Reserve policy makers had left interest rates unchanged. While the decision by the Fed was expected, recent strong economic reports had raised doubts among some market participants. Investors have now turned their attention to tomorrow&#x27;s June employment data, which are expected to help determine the Fed&#x27;s next move on interest rates."
"19960820","Fed Leaves Interest Rates Unchanged","Business","Federal Reserve policy makers met yesterday and, as had been widely expected, left the central bank&#x27;s short-term interest rate target unchanged at 5.25 percent. Many investors, traders and analysts, though, still believe that the Fed will raise short-term interest rates sometime later this year, most likely after the Presidential election."
"19960820","Officials Across Europe Watch Bundesbank Talks","Business","The meeting Thursday of Germany&#x27;s Bundesbank central council is being watched by politicians, government officials and bankers across Europe with the hope that a rate cut could spur the Continent&#x27;s economies. Meetings of the Bundesbank council are always closely watched by financial markets, but this time the stakes are sharply higher, officials said today."
"19960924","Heating Oil Hits 5-Year High As Europe Draws U.S. Supply","Business","Heating oil surged to a five-year high as soaring prices in Europe drew supplies away from the United States at a time when stockpiles are lean and refiners are running close to full capacity. On other markets, crude oil, gold and copper rose."
"19960924","Prices Climb On Relief Fed Does Not Act","Business","Treasury prices moved higher yesterday on relief that Federal Reserve policy makers left interest rates unchanged. Expectations among market participants had been divided on what the Fed would do, with many anticipating a rate increase of about a quarter-point, while others expected the Fed would take no action. When the Fed made its announcement at 2:15 P.M. yesterday, prices, which had been rising, surged further."
"19961113","Interest Rates Not Changed By Fed Panel","Business","The Federal Reserve voted to keep interest rates unchanged today, as the Government&#x27;s report on producer prices provided the latest evidence that inflation remained quiescent despite a surge last month in food and energy costs. With both the Fed and financial markets scrutinizing data for signs that inflation may be infecting the economy, the Labor Department&#x27;s Producer Price Index showed that prices at the producer level actually fell by three-tenths of 1 percent last month when food and energy, which are notoriously volatile, were excluded. The decline in the so-called core component, while driven in part by technical factors, was the steepest in two years."
"19961113","Government Bond Prices Hold Steady","Business","Government bond prices were little changed yesterday, despite relief that the Federal Open Market Committee left interest rates unchanged. The benchmark 30-year bond was off 3/32, to a price of 100 23/32, for a yield of 6.45 percent. The yield, which moves in the opposite direction of the price, was up from 6.44 percent on Tuesday. Prices of some securities with shorter maturities rose slightly."
"19961113","Stocks Set Another Record on Very Strong Earnings Reports","Business","Stocks rose yesterday after the Federal Reserve left benchmark lending rates unchanged and investors looked to corporate earnings for their cues. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 8.20, to 6,274.24, its sixth consecutive record close."
"19961217","The Fed Holds Rates Steady; Housing Gains","Business","The Federal Reserve voted today to leave interest rates unchanged, concluding that inflation remained dormant despite sporadic surges in economic activity. The Fed&#x27;s decision had been widely anticipated among economists and in the financial markets. The Fed has not raised or lowered rates since January, and analysts said monetary policy was likely to remain unchanged well into 1997 because the economy had shown few signs of deviating from its course of moderate growth with low inflation, even though unemployment is low and other economic indicators occasionally send warning signals."
"19961217","Bonds Falter On Strong Housing Data","Business","Prices of Government securities dropped yesterday following a housing report that was stronger than expected, but the bonds partly erased some early losses and managed to end above the day&#x27;s lows. The Commerce Department reported that new housing starts in November rose 9.2 percent, to an annual rate of 1.514 million units -- a far larger gain than the gain of one-tenth of 1 percent economists had expected, and a stark reminder to market participants that the economy could still rebound strongly and increase inflationary pressures."
"19970205","Fed&#x27;s Policy-Making Panel Leaves Rates Unchanged","Business","The Federal Reserve voted today to leave interest rates unchanged, betting that a recent surge in economic growth will moderate and leave wage and price inflation under control. The decision continues a yearlong pattern in which the Fed has kept monetary policy on hold as the economy has accelerated, slowed and then accelerated again. The Fed&#x27;s last move was on Jan. 31, 1996, when it reduced its Federal funds target rate, its overnight loan rate for banks, to 5.25 percent from 5.5 percent, and its discount rate for loans to financial institutions to 5 percent from 5.25 percent."
"19970205","Bond Prices Drop Ahead Of Jobs Data","Business","The prices of Treasury securities declined yesterday for the first time this week as investor concern deepened that tomorrow&#x27;s employment report might come in stronger than expected and revive fears of higher inflation. Yesterday&#x27;s decision by the Federal Reserve to leave interest rates unchanged suggested that the central bank was not overly concerned that the current pace of economic growth was strong enough to increase inflation, which erodes the value of bonds. Still, traders were reluctant to buy securities before seeing the monthly employment report, which is widely viewed as the most important gauge of economic strength and of the outlook for inflation."
"19970205","Stocks Plunge; Nasdaq Index Is Down 25.31","Business","The stock market plunged sharply in afternoon trading yesterday, led by steep declines in the prices of leading technology stocks. The afternoon selling, which pulled the Dow Jones industrial average down as much as 122 points from Tuesday&#x27;s close, could reflect a growing worry about the earnings outlook for 1997 and a general skittishness among portfolio managers who worry that investors continue to be bullish at a time when the market is getting too expensive."
"19970325","Greenspan&#x27;s Limited Faith in the Nation&#x27;s Productivity","Business","For weeks, Alan Greenspan has been saying that the nation&#x27;s productivity is greater than the statistics acknowledge. American workers, the Federal Reserve chairman suggested, were managing to produce ever greater amounts of goods and services, thus avoiding the shortages and inflation that so often come with a strong expansion. Just last Thursday, Mr. Greenspan told Congress that Fed policy makers would have to decide whether the expansion &#x27;&#x27;will continue to be met by solid productivity growth.&#x27;&#x27; Mr. Greenspan had given plenty of hints that he and his fellow policy makers would raise interest rates. But he had also spoken optimistically about productivity, and that had left open the possibility that he just might let a strong economy run. Rather than raise rates to discourage spending and cut back economic growth, the Fed would count instead on rising productivity to keep the economy safely supplied and free of inflation. Yesterday&#x27;s decision dashed that hope. Mr. Greenspan, who dominates policy-making at the Fed, announced, in effect, that his faith in productivity had its limits."
"19970325","Bond Prices Drop as Fed Raises Rate","Business","Treasury prices turned lower yesterday after the Federal Reserve fulfilled investors&#x27; expectations and raised short-term interest rates. The central bank&#x27;s monetary policy arm, the Federal Open Market Committee, raised its target on the Federal funds rate to 5.50 percent, from 5.25 percent. The rate, the interest rate banks charge each other for overnight loans, has not been adjusted since January 1996, when the Fed cut it a quarter-point amid concern that the economy was headed for a recession. The committee did not, however, adjust the discount rate, which is the rate the Fed charges its member banks for overnight loans."
"19970325","Stock Prices Move Down On Rate Rise","Business","Stock prices slumped yesterday after Federal Reserve policy makers moved to raise short-term interest rates in an attempt to moderate a fast-moving economy. The Dow Jones industrial average -- which had gained more than 100 points on Monday -- surged minutes after the Fed announced that it would raise short-term interest rates one-quarter of a percentage point, but then stocks slid along with bond prices."
"19970325","COMMERZBANK TO BUY MONTGOMERY SUBSIDIARY","Business","Montgomery Securities Inc. said yesterday that it had agreed to sell its money management subsidiary to Commerzbank A.G., Germany&#x27;s third-biggest bank, for an estimated $250 million. The acquisition gives Commerzbank access to one of America&#x27;s fastest-growing mutual fund companies. About half the assets of Montgomery Asset Management, or $4 billion, are spread among 19 mutual funds. Montgomery Securities, based in San Francisco, said that it would use the proceeds from the sale to finance growth in its investment banking and brokerage businesses. The transaction still needs approval from the Federal Reserve."
"19970325","Consumer Confidence Index Shows a March Dip","Business","Americans&#x27; confidence in the economy slipped this month, and their expectations for coming months dimmed as well, but both gauges remained close to the high levels registered recently. The Conference Board said yesterday that its index of consumer confidence fell to 118.5 in March from a revised 118.9 in February, which was the highest reading in eight years. The February level was originally reported as 118.4. Economists surveyed by Bloomberg News had expected a March reading of 117.7."
"19970520","A Slowdown In the Works Whatever The Fed Does","Business","Whatever the Federal Reserve does over the next few months, the American economy appears to be heading, on its own, into a period of slower economic growth. &#x27;&#x27;Weaker is not bad,&#x27;&#x27; said Robert D. Reischauer, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution. &#x27;&#x27;We are still talking about positive economic growth.&#x27;&#x27;"
"19970520","Fed Inaction Sends Dollar Down but Spurs Stock Rally","Business","The Federal Reserve&#x27;s decision yesterday not to raise short-term interest rates knocked the dollar sharply lower and provided only a little relief for the bond market. But the Fed&#x27;s inaction spurred the stock market, which continues to show an exuberance that may again worry Fed officials. The dollar tumbled against the Japanese yen and the mark after the central bank announced at 2:15 P.M. that it would leave its target for the Federal funds rate at 5.50 percent."
"19970520","Fed Meeting Gives Bonds A Modest Lift","Business","Treasury prices rose modestly yesterday after the Federal Reserve decided to keep interest rates unchanged. While investors were relieved by the decision, they quickly started to mull the possibility of future moves by the central bank."
"19970702","Gold Price Sinks as the Fed Stands Pat on Interest Rates","Business","Gold fell to its lowest price on the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange in more than four years yesterday after Federal Reserve policy makers left United States interest rates unchanged. In other markets, rice and cocoa fell."
"19970702","Fed Leaves Interest Rates Unchanged","Business","After considering evidence that growth is slowing from its torrid pace early in the year, the Federal Reserve decided today to leave interest rates unchanged, betting that the economy could continue to enjoy low unemployment without inflation. The decision had been widely expected among economists and investors, who argued that there was no justification for raising rates when the economy was cooling and there were no signs of substantial price increases."
"19970702","Treasury Securities Rise in Price","Business","Prices of Treasury securities moved higher yesterday, as the Federal Reserve opted to keep monetary policy unchanged and more economic data pointed to a slowing economy, with low inflation. The 30-year bond rose 13/32, to a price of 98 31/32, and the yield, which moves in the opposite direction, fell to 6.71 percent, from 6.74 percent on Tuesday."
"19970702","G.M. June Sales Off 13.3% Amid Industrywide Decline","Business","The General Motors Corporation said today that its sales fell 13.3 percent last month, leaving the auto industry as a whole on track to end the second quarter with a whimper, following a stellar first quarter. The weak G.M. sales reflect lackluster demand for new cars and trucks industrywide, Wall Street analysts said. Sales of the company&#x27;s pickup trucks, mini-vans and sport utility vehicles fell 7.7 percent, while car sales plummeted 16.7 percent in June, compared with a year earlier."
"19970819","Little Change In Bonds as Fed Stays Put","Business","Prices of Treasury securities closed mixed yesterday, with a token gain, after the Federal Reserve&#x27;s monetary policy committee decided to keep interest rates unchanged. The benchmark 30-year bond rose 4/32 to a price of 98 9/32 for a yield to maturity of 6.51 percent, down from 6.52 percent on Monday."
"19970819","Dollar Rises Again vs. Mark On Bundesbank Rate Decision","Business","The dollar rose against the German mark yesterday for a second consecutive day after the Bundesbank, the German central bank, left an interest rate unchanged. The dollar also benefited from a strong recovery in United States stocks. Against the Japanese yen, the dollar advanced slightly as a Japanese economic official distanced himself from previous comments that record-low interest rates there were poised to rise later this year."
"19970819","Stocks Rise, Continuing A Rebound","Business","Stocks continued to recover from their recent slide yesterday as the Dow Jones industrial average climbed more than 100 points for the second consecutive session and most major market indexes posted gains of 1.5 percent or more. Technology issues were among the big winners. Stocks like Microsoft and Intel had hefty gains, though they remain below their recent highs. Shares of large multinational consumer-product companies like Gillette and Procter &amp; Gamble, which had been battered in previous sessions, also finished higher."
"19970930","Betting Inflation Stays Dormant, Fed Leaves Interest Rates Alone","Business","The Federal Reserve voted today to keep interest rates unchanged, again showing its willingness to tolerate strong growth as long as the economy displays no clear signs of incipient inflation. With prices of both consumer and producer goods rising at barely perceptible rates, the Fed&#x27;s decision not to change monetary policy had been widely expected by economists and in the financial markets."
"19970930","Bonds End Quarter on Some Profit Taking","Business","The prices of Treasury securities finished generally lower yesterday, though they closed out the third quarter far higher than where they were at the end of the second quarter. Yesterday&#x27;s decision by the Federal Reserve to leave interest rates unchanged, which had been expected, had little effect. But bonds briefly rose after the release of weaker-than-expected economic data. Those gains were eroded later in the day by profit taking ahead of today&#x27;s report from corporate purchasing managers and Friday&#x27;s release of September employment data."
"19971112","The Fed Holds Rates Steady As It Weighs Global Risks","Business","Torn between fear of incipient inflation at home and concern about unsettling financial markets around the world, the Federal Reserve voted today to leave interest rates unchanged and ride out the storm for a while longer. The decision had been widely expected by economists and investors, who saw little chance that the central bank would risk upsetting the global markets by raising rates, even though there is mounting evidence that inflationary pressures are building in the American economy."
"19971112","Market Place; With turmoil abroad, some wanted the Fed to ease credit.","Business","WHEN the expected happens, markets are not supposed to react. And certainly not with the violence seen yesterday afternoon after the disclosure by the Federal Reserve that it would not change short-term interest rates. That lack of action had been forecast by virtually every Fed watcher. And yet, within minutes of the announcement, bond prices leaped and stock prices sagged."
"19971112","A Run on Coffee Stockpiles Sends Prices to 4-Week High","Business","Coffee rose to a four-week high yesterday as strong demand and delays in shipping newly harvested beans from Latin America sent United States exchange stockpiles to an 11-month low. Stockpiles of coffee in warehouses monitored daily by the Coffee, Sugar and Cocoa Exchange plunged 36 percent Monday to the lowest level since December 1996. The supply drain comes after heavy rain at Mexican coffee plantations because of Hurricane Rick. That delayed shipments from Mexico, the largest exporter of beans to the United States, just as roasters stocked up on raw coffee to process before peak winter demand."
"19971112","Treasury Prices Move Up As Stocks Take a Tumble","Business","For the most part, Treasury securities again danced the dance with stocks yesterday, gaining as stock prices retreated in response to further erosion in the Asian markets. Although traders were watching Federal Reserve policy makers closely yesterday, the decision to keep short-term interest rates unchanged for the fifth time this year was what most bond market participants were expecting. Short-term rates have not changed since March 25, when the Federal Open Market Committee increased the Federal funds target rate, which is the rate that banks charge one another for overnight loans, to 5.50 percent from 5.25 percent."
"19971112","Dollar Advances Against Yen On Economic Doubt in Japan","Business","The dollar surged against the yen as Japanese stocks tumbled on concern that Tokyo would not soon remedy the country&#x27;s economic ills. &#x27;&#x27;What&#x27;s brought the dollar here is fundamental concern about the Japanese economic situation and the realization that the only thing left to do is let the currency weaken,&#x27;&#x27; said Seth Garrett, global head of spot currency trading at Credit Suisse First Boston. &#x27;&#x27;The yen&#x27;s move has been steady but unrelenting.&#x27;&#x27;"

"19971216","Fed, Seeing Few Signs of Inflation, Leaves Interest Rates Unchanged","Business","The Federal Reserve voted today to leave interest rates unchanged, acting after the latest Government reports on the economy showed inflation remains benign despite vigorous economic growth. The central bank&#x27;s decision, widely anticipated by economists and investors, continued a pattern that suggests the Fed has set aside its usually predominant concern about an inflationary spiral set off by strong growth and low unemployment."
"19971216","Treasury Prices End Higher in Light Trading","Business","Treasury prices ended higher in thin trading yesterday, getting a lift in the afternoon after the Federal Reserve left interest rates unchanged in its final policy meeting of the year. While the Fed&#x27;s decision was expected, it was still a bit of a psychological lift as it meant that rates were likely to remain unchanged until policy makers meet again in February."
"19971216","Technology Stocks Recover From Selloff","Business","Stocks rose yesterday for a second consecutive session as some technology shares recovered from a recent slide. Calmer Asian markets and consumer price data showing that inflation remains tame also bolstered stocks.

"19971216","Business Travel; An experiment by United Airlines to further limit carry-on baggage is well received by passengers.","Business","TWO weeks ago, UAL&#x27;s United Airlines began a one-bag carry-on policy experiment for passengers in Des Moines who buy the lowest-fare tickets, and other carriers also tightened their carry-on policies. Since then, airlines say, there appears to be both more rigorous enforcement of the policies and wider compliance with them. But the true test, they add, will be determined when planes are no longer routinely jammed with passengers, and carriers and passengers alike relax their guard. While the Federal Aviation Administration has already said it does not favor regulation, business travelers are chiming in with suggestions for improvement. A recent survey of members by the National Business Travel Association found that 63 percent of respondents want carry-on luggage restrictions applied to all passengers regardless of ticket class or air fare. A survey by Yesawich, Pepperdine &amp; Brown/Yankelovich Partners did not address the number of carry-on bags, but found that 65 percent of business travelers want more space for the baggage they do carry on."
"19980204","Once More, The Fed Holds Rates Steady","Business","The Federal Reserve voted today to leave interest rates unchanged, apparently concluding that the economy would slow enough to repress inflation without endangering the seven-year-old expansion.

"19980204","Fed Decision to Stand Pat Sends Treasury Prices Up","Business","Bond prices ended higher yesterday after the Federal Reserve&#x27;s policy-making committee voted to leave interest rates unchanged, although the gains were slight because most market participants had anticipated such a decision. The price of the 30-year Treasury bond rose 3/32, to 103 25/32. The yield, which moves in the opposite direction, dropped to 5.85 percent, from 5.86 percent on Tuesday."
"19980204","Blue-Chip Issues in Retreat; Dow Off 30.64, to 8,129.71","Business","After more than a week of nearly uninterrupted gains, the stock market ended mixed yesterday, with blue-chip issues retreating somewhat as investors turned their attention elsewhere. While interest faded in some of the larger multinational stocks like J. P.

"19980331","New Reports Show Little Reason Not to Be Optimistic on Economy","Business","Consumer confidence fell in March, but only slightly from a level that was the highest in 29 years, a business research group reported today. The group, the Conference Board, said its consumer confidence index fell to 134.3 points in March from 137.4 in February. Meanwhile, the National Association of Purchasing Management reported that its monthly index of manufacturing activity in the Chicago region, seen as a bellwether for the economy, unexpectedly rose to 59.5 points in March from 57.8 in February."
"19980331","Prices Up on Signs of Sound Economy and Scant Price Pressure","Business","The prices of Treasury securities turned higher yesterday after a regional manufacturing report showed that the economy was remaining strong but without the price pressures that normally accompany such strength. The Federal Reserve&#x27;s policy-setting Federal Open Market Committee held its second monetary policy meeting of the year, and, as expected, concluded the meeting with no action on interest rates, and consequently little impact on the market."
"19980331","House Leaves Finance Law Of 30&#x27;s Intact","Business","Caught between a welter of powerful political forces, the House failed today in its latest effort to update the Depression-era law that governs the financial services industry. Under intense pressure from banks, which had mounted an all-out lobbying blitz, the Republican leadership withdrew the proposed bill from the House floor late today when it became clear it would not pass its first procedural hurdle."
"19980519","Fed Lets Rates Stand, Fearing Harm to Asia","Business","The Federal Reserve declined once again today to increase short-term interest rates, apparently determining that the threat of inflation remained remote and that the latest phase of the worsening Asian economic crisis might be exacerbated by any rate rise now in the United States. Several weeks ago, there were hints that the Federal Reserve might be leaning toward increasing interest rates sometime soon. But a number of recent indicators, including continued low inflation and the announcement this morning of a modest decline in the starts of new housing, have lessened immediate fears of an overheating of the economy, market analysts said."
"19980519","Treasuries Dip on Fed Inaction","Business","Treasury prices ended slightly lower yesterday after the Federal Reserve, as expected, left interest rates unchanged. The price of the 30-year Treasury bond fell 5/32, to 102 22/32. The bond&#x27;s yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, edged up to 5.93 percent, from 5.92 percent on Monday. There was little reaction to the Fed&#x27;s announcement at 2:15 P.M."
"19980519","Dow Regains Some Ground After Three-Session Decline","Business","Stocks closed slightly higher yesterday, rebounding from three days of declines as Federal Reserve policy makers left short-term interest rates unchanged.

"19980701","Fed Keeps Interest Rates Steady Amid Signs of Cooling","Business","With signs of a slowing economy and increasing evidence that the Asian economic crisis is beginning to hurt some industries in the United States, the Federal Reserve today decided not to raise interest rates. Following a two-day private meeting, the Fed said that it was keeping the benchmark Federal funds rate -- the borrowing cost on overnight loans between banks -- steady at 5.5 percent, just where it has been since March 1997."

"19980701","30-Year Treasury Unchanged As Fed Holds Line on Rates","Business","The price of the 30-year Treasury bond was unchanged yesterday, after, as expected, the Federal Reserve policy-making committee decided not to adjust interest rates. The 30-year bond closed at a price of 107 6/32, leaving the bond&#x27;s yield at 5.62 percent. Donald Fine, chief market analyst at Chase Asset Management, attributed the Fed&#x27;s decision to a slowdown in the economy, subdued inflation, the budget surplus and the malaise in Asia. Treasury securities opened weaker yesterday after the dollar fell in currency trading. A strong dollar makes dollar-denominated investments like Treasury securities more attractive to foreign investors, who also benefit from the currency translation. But then a report on manufacturing suggested the economy was slowing. &#x27;&#x27;Indeed, economic data released today clearly indicated a slowing of economic momentum, as exemplified by the sharp decline in the National Association of Purchasing Management index, a fallback in construction spending, and the flattening in the index of leading indicators,&#x27;&#x27; Mr. Fine said. The June manufacturing index fell to 49.6 from 51.4 in May, the first time in two years that the level has dropped below 50, a sign of contraction in the industrial sector. Mr. Fine added that some of the declines in the index were for production, employment and inventories, and while some of the sluggishness may be a result of the strike against the General Motors Corporation, he said, the crisis in Asia was playing a much greater role. Construction spending tumbled 1.5 percent in May to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $633.5 billion as private and public sectors registered declines. And the Conference Board&#x27;s index of leading indicators was unchanged in May for the second consecutive month, which could be signaling slower growth in the third quarter as well as the second quarter. The Government will report today on the number of jobs added to the economy last month and on the unemployment rate, both of which are capable of moving the market. Estimates of jobs created range from an increase of 125,000 jobs to an increase of 250,000, placing the consensus at about 190,000 new jobs. Mr. Fine said the average for the number of jobs added to the economy in the last two months has been plus 300,000. &#x27;&#x27;So even if it comes in at the high end of expectations, it is still below the recent average,&#x27;&#x27; he said."
"19980701","Rosy Economy Is Blemished as Factories Slow","Business","The nation&#x27;s manufacturers have slowed production to the lowest rate of growth since 1995, the clearest sign so far that the Asian crisis is hurting the American economy. The slowdown has become increasingly evident with each new economic statistic in recent weeks. Yesterday, the National Association of Purchasing Management reported that manufacturing activity weakened in June for a majority of the companies that it surveys each month. It was the first time in 22 months that a majority had reported weakening instead of strengthening in their businesses."
"19980818","Prices Close Down Slightly For Treasuries","Business","Prices of Treasury securities ended slightly lower yesterday. A smaller-than-expected trade deficit in June suggested to some investors that economic growth might be quickening, raising the prospect of a pickup in inflation."
"19980818","Fed Leaves Rates Steady As New Data Pose Few Risks","Business","Today&#x27;s good news about the United States economy was the refreshing absence of bad news: the Federal Reserve did not raise interest rates at this morning&#x27;s monetary policy meeting. Inflation did not rise much in July. And the trade deficit did not widen further in June, as economists had expected. Despite the lowest unemployment rate in a generation, consumer prices edged up just two-tenths of 1 percent in July, the Commerce Department reported. Prices are up just 1.7 percent from a year ago, an extraordinary performance for the seventh year of an economic expansion. And despite the robust dollar and deepening recession in Asia, the United States trade deficit fell by more than $1 billion in June, to $14.2 billion. In dollars, that is still close to a record high, but as a share of the economy -- a more meaningful yardstick -- the trade deficit is still just two-thirds of its 1980&#x27;s peak. Exports fell, but at a far slower rate than in recent months. Imports fell as well, as businesses bought less equipment from abroad and oil prices dropped another notch."
"19980929","THE MARKETS: Market Place; Investors View Rate Cut By the Fed as Too Timid","Business","The Federal Reserve cut interest rates yesterday. Almost nobody cheered. To stock investors, the rate cut -- of a quarter-point in a key short-term rate -- was too timid. They pushed the Dow Jones industrial average down 28.32 points."
"19980929","Most Borrowers in U.S. Can Expect to Benefit","Business","The Federal Reserve&#x27;s decision yesterday to lower interest rates for the first time since January 1996 should translate into lower borrowing rates on many consumer loans and keep mortgage rates for home purchases and refinancings below 7 percent at least through the end of the year, economists said. The reduction of a quarter of a percentage point, to 5.25 percent, in the target for the Federal funds rate was smaller than had been widely anticipated. But the impact is enough to keep 30-year fixed-rate mortgages below 7 percent in 1998 and possibly through 1999, said Robert Barr, a senior economist at Fannie Mae, the Congressionally chartered private company that helps finance mortgages."
"19980929","Fed&#x27;s Rate Cut Has Little Impact as Dow Falls by 28.32","Business","The first interest rate cut since January 1996 failed to impress stock investors yesterday, and the major market indexes were narrowly mixed at the end of a fairly active session. Investors in the bond market had a somewhat stronger reaction and drove up prices, particularly in the long end of the market, pushing the yield on the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond down to another 30-year low, 5.09 percent. (Bond prices and their yields move in opposite directions.)"
"19981117","THE MARKETS: Market Place -- Fed Thinks Globally, Acts Locally, to Tepid Wall St. Response; Stock and Bond Investors Brace for an End to Cuts","Business","The Federal Reserve Board bowed to investors&#x27; expectations with its rate cuts yesterday. But for its trouble, it earned only half-hearted applause from stock and bond traders. There&#x27;s a good reason for that muted reaction. Ever since investors fled risky markets this summer for the safe haven of United States Treasuries, the bond market has been leading the Fed on interest-rate policy, trading at levels that predicted even further drops in key rates. But yesterday, both stock and bond investors seemed to respond to signals in the Fed&#x27;s comments that this, its third cut since Sept. 29, could be the last for the year."
"19981117","Shares Rally, Then Sputter, After the Fed Trims Rates","Business","Widely anticipated cuts in interest rates by the Federal Reserve Board did not invigorate the stock market yesterday. Prices, which have rallied sharply the last six weeks, closed mixed in moderate trading. Stocks moved lower early in the session, then jumped abruptly in midafternoon after the Fed announced its third cut in the overnight Federal funds rate and second reduction in its discount rate in the last seven weeks. But sellers emerged in the last hour of trading, particularly in big, blue-chip issues."

"19981222","To Allay Fears, Bank of Japan Defends Its Financial Stability","Business","Fending off weeks of criticism that the Japanese central bank&#x27;s financial strength is eroding, the bank&#x27;s governor said today that it had one of the world&#x27;s safest pools of assets, second only to that of the United States Federal Reserve. The remarks by Masaru Hayami, the governor of the Bank of Japan, were an effort to bolster Japan&#x27;s international image in the financial world and allay fears of investors at home and abroad."
"19981222","Leaving Rates Alone, Fed Shifts to Neutral as Sense of Crises Eases","Business","The Federal Reserve voted today to hold interest rates steady, judging that three rate reductions in the fall had given the economy a big enough kick to keep it growing at a healthy pace into the new year. The central bank&#x27;s decision to shift monetary policy into neutral is the latest sign that the sense of crisis felt by economic policy makers in the United States and worldwide over the summer is easing."
"19981222","THE MARKETS: Market Place; S.E.C. Charges Grace and 6 Former Executives With Fraud","Business","Federal securities regulators accused W. R. Grace &amp; Company and six of its former executives of fraud yesterday, saying that the company had deceived shareholders over five years by falsely reporting earnings. The move was part of a larger plan by the Securities and Exchange Commission to crack down on the growing number of companies, including some of the nation&#x27;s largest, that break accounting rules so they can manipulate earnings and meet Wall Street&#x27;s expectations."
"19981222","Dow and S.&amp; P.

With Christmas and New Year fast approaching, analysts were reluctant to attribute much significance to the recent swings in financial markets."
"19990203","Fed Decides To Maintain Interest Rates","Business","Trapped between conflicting pressures at home and abroad, the Federal Reserve voted today to leave interest rates unchanged, keeping its hands off an economy that is either gratifyingly robust or too strong for its own good. The decision, almost universally expected by economists and investors, caused barely a ripple on Wall Street. But it highlighted the dilemma facing the central bank just months after it cut rates three times to insure that financial turmoil in much of the rest of the world would not derail the long American expansion."
"19990203","Indicators End Higher, Led by Strong Technology Issues","Business","Paced by renewed vigor in technology companies, stock prices marched higher yesterday as Federal Reserve policy makers left interest rates unchanged. While the Fed&#x27;s decision was widely expected, analysts said the meeting created some early nervousness and then touched off some late-session profit taking."
"19990330","Fed Maintains Steady Stance In Rate Policy","Business","The Federal Reserve&#x27;s top officials left interest rates unchanged today, and passed up an opportunity to signal any concern about inflation. The meeting of the Fed&#x27;s governors and regional bank presidents, all members of the policy-setting Open Market Committee, came at a time when inflation has been remarkably tame despite the robust economy. And there is unlikely to be much upward pressure on prices as long as labor costs do not accelerate significantly and Europe and Asia remain in the economic doldrums."
"19990330","Rising Concern Over Profits Sends Dow Below 10,000","Business","The Dow Jones industrial average retreated from its one-day perch above 10,000 yesterday on renewed concerns about corporate earnings, as other major market measures also slipped. The worries about first-quarter earnings were set off when Coca-Cola told securities analysts after the closing bell on Monday that it expected worldwide sales to show a slight decline in the first quarter. It cited weakness in each of its international divisions."
"19990518","Text of Statement by Fed","Business","Following is the text of a statement released by the Federal Reserve yesterday after the Federal Open Market Committee said it had left interest rates unchanged but had adopted a stance to raise borrowing costs in the future: While the F.O.M.C. did not take action today to alter the stance of monetary policy, the committee was concerned about the potential for a buildup of inflationary imbalances that could undermine the favorable performance of the economy and therefore adopted a directive that is tilted toward the possibility of a firming in the stance of monetary policy."
"19990518","THE MARKETS: CURRENCIES","Business","DOLLAR IS LOWER. The dollar eased against leading currencies after the Federal Reserve declined to raise rates but said it would now lean toward an increase. In New York, the euro rose to $1.0680, from $1.0665 on Monday."

"19990518","Prices End Day Down a Bit But Well Above Their Lows","Business","Stock prices closed slightly lower yesterday but well above their lows of the session, as traders and investors reacted with relative equanimity to the decision by the Federal Reserve Board to adopt a more hawkish stance on interest rates. Given the continued strength in the domestic economy and signs that inflation may be on the rise, the announcement that the Federal Open Market Committee had adopted a tightening bias toward monetary policy did not shock financial markets."

"19990630","Stock and Bond Markets Both Like What They Hear From the Fed","Business","The stock and bond markets both rallied yesterday after investors got a surprise they liked from the Federal Reserve Board. The central bank signaled that a quarter percentage point increase in its short-term interest rate target could be enough to keep inflation in check. The Dow Jones industrial average jumped 210 points within 13 minutes after the Fed&#x27;s announcement at 2:15 P.M. and finished the day at 10,970.80, up 155.45 points, or 1.44 percent."
"19990630","Banks Raise Prime Rates","Business","The Bank of America Corporation, the biggest United States bank; the No. 2 Chase Manhattan Corporation; the Bank One Corporation, and Keycorp raised their prime rates to 8 percent from 7.75 percent yesterday after the Federal Reserve increased interest rates for the first time since March 1997. Other banks are expected to do the same. The Fed raised the target overnight-bank lending rate by a quarter point, to 5 percent. to slow inflation by damping economic growth."
"19990630","Late-Season Spurt Helps Shares in Quarter","Business","Statistically, the spring quarter was another banner period for stocks, as the main gauges all climbed between 5 and 12 percent, shattering records along the way.

"19990630","THE MARKETS: Market Place; As Rates Rose, Underwriting Dipped in the Second Quarter","Business","Wall Street&#x27;s core business -- the underwriting of stocks and bonds -- slowed slightly in the second quarter as market interest rates rose. Securities firms and banks issued $553.1 billion of bonds and stocks, according to Thomson Financial Securities Data, a drop of nearly 11 percent from $620 billion in the second quarter of 1998. It was also down 9 percent from the first quarter of this year.

But the reaction was subdued in the stock and bond markets because many had anticipated the Fed&#x27;s announcement. &#x27;&#x27;The markets are seeing this as a &#x27;we&#x27;re done for now&#x27; kind of signal,&#x27;&#x27; said Richard Berner, chief United States economist at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter.

"19991005","Fed Leaves Rates Steady, For This Time","Business","The Federal Reserve voted today to leave interest rates unchanged, but warned that it was still concerned about the potential for inflation and might raise rates soon if the economy did not cool off. Economists and investors had expected the central bank&#x27;s decision not to change the short-term rates it controls. But the Fed&#x27;s warning about its possible next move -- in the form of a formal tilt toward a tighter monetary policy -- nonetheless jolted Wall Street and suggested that financial markets would remain jittery in coming weeks in anticipation of new data about the momentum of the economy."

Voicing concerns that the economy is too darn hot and employment is way too tight, the Fed yesterday raised short-term interest rates by a quarter of a percentage point.

But it appears that the medicine is much weaker than he thought just a year ago, and that much higher doses will be needed to have the desired effect. Last June, when the Federal Reserve&#x27;s Open Market Committee raised interest rates for the first of what has now become six times, the committee&#x27;s minutes reflected a general expectation of &#x27;&#x27;appreciable moderation in the trend&#x27;&#x27; of economic growth in the months ahead."

But the central bank warned that it could start raising rates again as soon as its next meeting, on Aug. 22. Analysts said the Fed would probably tighten policy in August unless economic indicators in coming weeks provided assurance that the red-hot pace of economic growth earlier this year had given way to a more sustainable path that reduces the threat of an inflationary spiral in wages and prices."

"20000822","Financial Issues Jump, but Others Are Mostly Lackluster","Business","Stock prices were mixed yesterday after the Federal Reserve left short-term interest rates unchanged. The Fed&#x27;s decision to keep the federal funds rate on overnight loans between banks at 6.5 percent had been widely expected. Still, stocks of financial services companies, which stand to benefit if interest rates stabilize or start to fall, were the standout performers. &#x27;&#x27;This is what the market wanted to see,&#x27;&#x27; said Jonathan Olesky, head of block trading at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter. &#x27;&#x27;The view is that we are now in a friendlier rate environment.&#x27;&#x27; Indeed, after reading the central bank&#x27;s so-called policy directive, analysts said that the Fed was not likely to prove threatening to stock investors, at least for the next few months. &#x27;&#x27;Given what we know today, the consensus view is that the Fed has finished raising interest rates for the year,&#x27;&#x27; said Edward Yardeni, chief global economist and investment strategist at Deutsche Bank Securities.

But selling set in after the news was reported. &#x27;&#x27;We had the potential for a pullback no matter what the Fed did because the market has had a good month,&#x27;&#x27; said William Meehan, chief market analyst at Cantor Fitzgerald. &#x27;&#x27;It is too early to say the Fed is done for the year, but unless we get really bad inflation numbers, I suspect the Fed will be on hold until after the election.&#x27;&#x27; Financial service stocks, especially banks, did well.

Cisco Systems fell 69 cents, to $64.81, however. Qualcomm shed $2.38, to $56.63, and Dell Computer dropped $1.31, to $37.44. AMR, the parent of American Airlines, gained $1.19, to $33.81, after Goldman, Sachs lifted its third-quarter profit estimate. But forest products companies fell after Morgan Stanley Dean Witter lowered profit estimates for this year and for 2001. International Paper fell 44 cents, to $32.31. Weyerhaeuser dropped $1.31, to $46.88, and Temple Inland fell $1.25, to $43.69. Medtronic had a bad day, falling $3.13, to $49.69, after the world&#x27;s largest pacemaker manufacturer reported quarterly sales that fell short of expectations.

Treasuries did not get a lasting bounce because &#x27;&#x27;the Fed hasn&#x27;t uncovered its next move,&#x27;&#x27; said William Fitzgerald of Nuveen Investments in Chicago. Still, investors may buy on the notion that the Fed is near the end of its cycle of rate increases, even if it is not finished, he said. &#x27;&#x27;Many investors believe the Fed usually raises rates one time too many,&#x27;&#x27; he said. The 10-year note rose 1/32, to 99 27/32. Its yield, which moves in the opposite direction, fell to 5.77 percent from 5.78 percent. The 30-year bond slipped 2/32, to 107 22/32. Its yield was unchanged at 5.71 percent."

The Fed&#x27;s policy-setting Federal Open Market Committee did not allude to the uncertainty over the outcome of the presidential election or to the recent uncertainty in the stock market, but instead projected a business-as-usual tone in a statement that stressed the gradual cooling of the economy.

"20010320","Market Place; Stock Investors Fighting the Fed In Second Round","Business","For the second time in two years, Wall Street is ignoring its own advice. One of the stock market&#x27;s oldest maxims is that investors should buy stocks aggressively when the Federal Reserve is lowering short-term interest rates and be much more careful when rates are rising. The logic is simple: falling interest rates put more money in consumers&#x27; pockets and lower corporate borrowing costs, helping corporate profits. Rising rates force consumers and companies to spend more money on interest payments, hurting the economy and corporate earnings."

"20010627","THE MARKETS: Market Place; No Fed Magic for Poor Corporate Earnings","Business","When the Federal Reserve cut interest rates six months ago, investors stampeded into stocks, certain that lower rates would mean higher share prices.
