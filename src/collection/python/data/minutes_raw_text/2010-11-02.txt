The meeting opened with a short discussion regarding 
communicating with the public about monetary policy 
deliberations and decisions.  Meeting participants sup-
ported a review of the Committee’s communication 
guidelines with the aim of ensuring that the public is 
well informed about monetary policy issues while pre-
serving the necessary confidentiality of policy discus-
sions until their scheduled release.  Governor Yellen 
agreed to chair a subcommittee to conduct such a re-
view. 

Developments in Financial Markets and the Fed-
eral Reserve’s Balance Sheet 
The Manager of the System Open Market Account 
(SOMA) reported on developments in domestic and 
foreign financial markets since the Committee met on 
September 21, 2010.  He also reported on System open 
market operations, including the continuing reinvest-
ment into longer-term Treasury securities of principal 
payments received on the SOMA’s holdings of agency 
debt and agency-guaranteed mortgage-backed securities 
(MBS).  The Open Market Desk at the Federal Reserve 
Bank of New York purchased a total of about $65 bil-
lion of Treasury securities since the Committee de-
cided, on August 10, to begin reinvesting such principal 
payments.  Purchases were concentrated in nominal 
Treasury securities with maturities of 2 to 10 years, 
though some shorter-term and some longer-term secu-
rities were purchased along with some Treasury infla-
tion-protected securities (TIPS).  Over the intermeeting 
period, the Desk also conducted a number of small-
value tri-party reverse repurchase operations with the 
primary dealers and with money market mutual funds 

that have been accepted as counterparties for such op-
erations; these transactions, which the Desk conducted 
to ensure continuing operational and systems readiness, 
used Treasury securities, agency debt, and agency-
guaranteed MBS as collateral.  In addition, the Federal 
Reserve conducted another small-value auction of term 
deposits to ensure the continued operational readiness 
of the term deposit facility and to increase the familiari-
ty of eligible depository institutions with the auction 
procedures.  There were no open market operations in 
foreign currencies for the System’s account over the 
intermeeting period.  By unanimous vote, the Commit-
tee ratified the Desk’s transactions over the intermeet-
ing period. 

The Manager described the tentative plans the Desk 
had prepared for implementing a possible Committee 
decision to expand further the System’s holdings of 
longer-term Treasury securities.  Purchases would con-
tinue to be concentrated in nominal Treasury securities 
with remaining maturities between 2 and 10 years, with 
some purchases of shorter- and longer-term securities 
and of TIPS; with this maturity distribution, newly pur-
chased securities would be expected to have an average 
duration of 5 to 6 years, essentially the same as the av-
erage duration of the System’s existing holdings of 
Treasury securities.  The Desk planned to publish addi-
tional information about its transactions to increase the 
transparency of, and encourage wider participation in, 
future purchase operations.  The Desk judged that if it 
continued reinvesting principal payments from the 
Federal Reserve System’s holdings of agency debt and 
agency MBS in longer-term Treasury securities, then it 
could purchase additional longer-term Treasury securi-
ties at a pace of about $75 billion per month while 
avoiding disruptions in market functioning.  The Man-
ager indicated that implementing a sizable increase in 
the System’s holdings of Treasury securities most effec-
tively likely would entail a temporary relaxation of the 
35 percent per-issue limit on SOMA holdings under 
which the Desk had been operating; whether, and to 
what extent, the System’s holdings of some issues 
would exceed 35 percent would depend on the specific 
securities that dealers choose to offer at future auc-
tions.  Finally, the Manager summarized the implica-
tions for the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet and in-
come statement of alternative decisions that the Com-
mittee might make about the size and maturity distribu-
tion of the SOMA’s securities holdings.  Participants 
discussed the Desk’s tentative operational plans; they 
also discussed the potential effects of an expansion of 
the System’s holdings of longer-term securities on fi-

nancial markets and institutions and on the economy, 
and the channels through which those effects could 
occur. 

Staff Review of the Economic Situation 
The information reviewed at the November 2–3 meet-
ing indicated that the economic recovery proceeded at 
a modest rate in recent months, with only a gradual 
improvement in labor market conditions, and was ac-
companied by a continued low rate of inflation.  Con-
sumer spending, business investment in equipment and 
software, and exports posted further gains in the third 
quarter, and nonfarm inventory investment stepped up.  
But construction activity in both the residential and 
nonresidential sectors remained depressed, and a signif-
icant portion of the rise in domestic demand was again 
met by imports.  U.S. industrial production slowed no-
ticeably in August and September, hiring at private 
businesses remained modest, and the unemployment 
rate stayed elevated.   Headline consumer price infla-
tion was subdued in recent months, despite a rise in 
energy prices, as core consumer price inflation trended 
lower. 

Private businesses continued to increase their demand 
for labor only modestly.  In September, private non-
farm payroll employment remained on a gradual up-
trend, and the average workweek of all private-sector 
employees was unchanged for a third month.  In addi-
tion, the number of individuals working part time for 
economic reasons moved back up for a second month, 
and the available measures of job openings and hiring 
were still low.  The unemployment rate remained at   
9.6 percent in September, leaving the average rate for 
the third quarter only slightly below its average over the 
first half of the year.  Long-duration unemployment 
continued to recede somewhat but was still very high.  
Indicators of layoffs remained elevated, although initial 
claims for unemployment insurance drifted down a 
little during October.  The labor force participation rate 
in September was unchanged at a level lower than earli-
er in the year. 

After rising rapidly from mid-2009 to mid-2010, indus-
trial production decelerated in August   and edged 
down in September.  In the manufacturing sector, out-
put gains across a wide range of industries were smaller 
in recent months, and capacity utilization leveled off at 
a rate still well below its longer-run average.  Produc-
tion of motor vehicles picked up during the third quar-
ter as automakers replenished dealers’ stocks, but mo-
tor vehicle assemblies were scheduled to drop back in 
coming months.  More broadly, October surveys of 

new orders received by manufacturers suggested that 
demand for factory goods had continued to increase. 

Real personal consumption expenditures (PCE) rose at 
a moderate rate in the third quarter.  Rising equity pric-
es likely resulted in some further improvement in net 
worth over the same period.  However, real disposable 
personal income, which rose strongly in the first half of 
the year, increased only slightly in the third quarter.  As 
a result, the personal saving rate dropped back some-
what in the third quarter, although it remained near the 
high levels that have prevailed since late 2008.  Bank 
lending standards were still relatively tight, and house-
hold borrowing remained low.  Surveys taken in Sep-
tember and October indicated that consumers were 
slightly more pessimistic about the economic outlook 
than earlier in the year. 

Activity in the housing market remained exceptionally 
weak.  Although sales of new and existing homes 
turned up in August and September, the still-low level 
of demand suggested that the payback for the earlier 
boost to sales from the homebuyer tax credit had not 
yet faded.  Moreover, despite further declines in mort-
gage interest rates in recent months, other factors con-
tinued to restrain housing demand, including consumer 
pessimism about the outlook for jobs and income, the 
depressed rate of household formation, and tight un-
derwriting standards for mortgages.  In addition, the 
moratoriums recently announced by some banks on the 
sale of properties they had seized in foreclosures were 
likely to damp home sales further in the near term.  
Starts of new single-family houses rose somewhat in 
August and September, but the pace of construction 
was still noticeably below the already-depressed level of 
the preceding year.  New homebuilding appeared to be 
weighed down by the backlog of unsold existing homes 
and tight lending conditions for acquisition, develop-
ment, and construction loans. 

After a very strong increase in the first half of the year, 
business investment in equipment and software posted 
a smaller, but still solid, gain in the third quarter.  No-
minal shipments of nondefense capital goods from 
domestic manufacturers remained on a moderate up-
trend through September.  But rising demand for 
equipment and software during the third quarter was 
also satisfied in part by a further rise in imports of capi-
tal goods.  Near-term indicators of business spending 
on equipment and software were generally positive.  
New orders for nondefense capital goods, excluding 
aircraft, continued to outpace shipments through Sep-
tember.  Credit conditions improved further in the

third quarter, particularly for larger firms with access to 
the capital markets.  Financing flows to smaller firms, 
which are more dependent on banks, were more sub-
dued. 

Real nonfarm inventory investment was estimated to 
have picked up during the third quarter.  Rebuilding of 
dealers’ stocks of motor vehicles accounted for part of 
the step-up, but some of it likely reflected another large 
increase in imports.  In August, inventory-to-sales ra-
tios for most industries remained well below their pre-
vious peaks.  Surveys of purchasing managers in Sep-
tember and October indicated that most did not per-
ceive their customers’ inventories to be too high.  
Business investment in nonresidential structures was 
about flat in the third quarter as another strong increase 
in spending for drilling and mining structures offset 
further declines in outlays on commercial and industrial 
buildings. 

Consumer price inflation remained low in recent 
months.  The total PCE price index increased slightly 
in September as consumer energy prices moved up no-
ticeably for a third month. The core PCE price index 
was unchanged in September, and the 12-month in-
crease in this index continued to trend down.  At earlier 
stages of processing, the rise in producer prices for in-
termediate materials remained moderate in September, 
but prices of globally traded industrial and agricultural 
commodities accelerated considerably in October, re-
flecting in part the lower foreign exchange value of the 
dollar as well as concerns about supply for certain 
commodities.  In September and October, survey 
measures of households’ short- and long-term expecta-
tions for inflation remained in the ranges that have 
prevailed since the spring of 2009. 

Labor compensation rose at a moderate rate in the 
third quarter.  Private-sector wage increases, as meas-
ured by both average hourly earnings of all employees 
and the employment cost index (ECI), remained sub-
dued.  However, according to the ECI, employer bene-
fit costs accelerated this year after posting a very small 
increase in 2009. 

The U.S. international trade deficit widened in August, 
after narrowing in July, as a modest increase in nominal 
exports was more than offset by a strong increase in 
imports.  Following widespread declines in July, most 
major categories of imports rebounded in August, with 
imports of consumer goods and capital goods exhibit-
ing particular strength.  Imports of petroleum products 
also increased substantially, reflecting both higher vol-
umes and higher prices.  The increase in exports was 

concentrated in agricultural goods, partly boosted by 
rising prices, and in services; most other major catego-
ries either declined or were flat. 

Recent indicators of foreign economic activity sug-
gested that growth abroad had slowed appreciably after 
midyear.  Following an unsustainably high rate of ex-
pansion in the second quarter, growth of real gross 
domestic product (GDP) in the emerging market econ-
omies appeared to have slowed markedly, notwith-
standing an apparent acceleration in economic activity 
in China.  Real GDP growth apparently moderated in 
the advanced foreign economies as well.  In the euro 
area, industrial production rose sharply in August, but 
purchasing managers indexes moved down in recent 
months.  The German economy continued to perform 
strongly, while recent data showed weakness in the pe-
ripheral euro-area countries.  A reacceleration of food 
and energy prices helped push up inflation abroad, al-
beit generally to still-moderate levels, in the third quar-
ter. 

Staff Review of the Financial Situation 
The decision by the Federal Open Market Committee 
(FOMC) at its September meeting to maintain the 0 to 
¼ percent target range for the federal funds rate was 
widely anticipated.  However, yields declined as market 
participants reportedly interpreted the language of the 
accompanying statement to imply higher odds of addi-
tional asset purchases and a longer period of excep-
tionally low short-term interest rates.  Investors took 
particular note of the statement’s indication that infla-
tion was below the levels consistent with the FOMC’s 
dual mandate for maximum employment and price sta-
bility.  In the weeks following the FOMC meeting, 
Federal Reserve communications, along with economic 
data releases that continued to point to a tepid eco-
nomic outlook, appeared to reinforce market expecta-
tions that additional policy accommodation would be 
forthcoming in the near term. 

Yields on nominal Treasury coupon securities and 
those on TIPS declined, on net, over the intermeeting 
period, largely in response to Federal Reserve commu-
nications and somewhat weaker-than-expected eco-
nomic data releases.  Five-year inflation compensation 
increased over the intermeeting period, and forward 
inflation compensation 5 to 10 years ahead also rose.  
Anecdotal reports pointed to the increased likelihood 
of additional asset purchases by the Federal Reserve 
and to FOMC communications noting that the Com-
mittee viewed underlying inflation as somewhat below 
the levels judged to be most consistent with the Com-

Page 4 Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________



mittee’s dual mandate as factors contributing to lower 
yields and to the increase in inflation compensation 
over the period.  Yields on investment- and specula-
tive-grade corporate bonds declined somewhat more 
than those on comparable-maturity Treasury securities, 
leaving risk spreads slightly lower.  In the secondary 
market for syndicated leveraged loans, prices of loans 
continued to move up and bid-asked spreads narrowed 
a bit further.  

Conditions in short-term funding markets were gener-
ally stable over the intermeeting period.  In dollar fund-
ing markets, spreads of term London interbank offered 
rates (or Libor) over those on overnight index swaps 
edged up but remained at levels similar to those ob-
served prior to the emergence of euro-area concerns 
earlier this year.  Spreads on unsecured financial com-
mercial paper and on asset-backed commercial paper 
remained low.  Rates on repurchase agreements (repos) 
involving various types of collateral were little changed 
on net.  Bid-asked spreads in most repo transactions 
generally declined while changes in haircuts on differ-
ent types of repo collateral were mixed. 

Broad U.S. stock price indexes rose, on balance, over 
the intermeeting period, reflecting investor expecta-
tions of further monetary policy accommodation and 
better-than-expected third-quarter earnings news; op-
tion-implied volatility on the S&P 500 index was little 
changed.  The spread between the staff’s estimate of 
the expected real return on equities over the next       
10 years and an estimate of the expected real return on 
a 10-year Treasury note—a rough measure of the equi-
ty risk premium—narrowed a bit but remained at an 
elevated level.  Bank stocks generally underperformed 
the broader market amid concerns about the handling 
of mortgage foreclosure documents and possible lack 
of compliance with securitization agreements. 

Net debt financing by U.S. nonfinancial corporations 
was very strong in September, with sizable gross corpo-
rate bond issuance across the credit spectrum and a 
substantial increase in commercial paper outstanding, 
but data for October pointed to a moderation in these 
flows.  Issuance of syndicated leveraged loans in the 
third quarter remained near the average pace recorded 
in the first half of the year.  Measures of the credit 
quality of nonfinancial corporations remained solid.  
The pace of gross public equity issuance from seasoned 
and initial public offerings by nonfinancial firms re-
mained moderate in September and appeared to slow in 
October. 

Commercial real estate markets remained strained.  
Commercial mortgage debt in the third quarter was 
estimated to have declined at a rate similar to the drop 
in the second quarter, and the delinquency rate for se-
curitized commercial mortgages continued to climb in 
September.  However, some signals offered modest 
encouragement.  In particular, vacancy rates for com-
mercial buildings stabilized in the third quarter, and the 
pipeline of new commercial mortgage-backed securities 
picked up a bit from very low levels. 

Residential mortgage refinancing activity moved up in 
late September and early October, from an already high 
level, as the average interest rate on fixed-rate mortgag-
es fell further over the intermeeting period.  In con-
trast, the level of applications for mortgages to pur-
chase homes remained anemic.  Total consumer credit 
contracted in August at a pace roughly in line with the 
declines posted earlier in the year.  Issuance of con-
sumer asset-backed securities was solid in September.  
Consumer credit quality generally continued to im-
prove, though delinquency rates remained elevated. 

Bank credit edged up in September and October, as 
brisk growth in banks’ holdings of securities more than 
offset a further decline in total loans.  Commercial and 
industrial (C&I) loans turned down in September after 
having increased slightly over the two previous months.  
A moderate net fraction of banks reported, in their res-
ponses to the October Senior Loan Officer Opinion 
Survey on Bank Lending Practices, that they had eased 
standards on C&I loans and narrowed spreads of C&I 
loan rates over their cost of funds; demand for such 
loans reportedly declined, on net, over the preceding 
three months.  Commercial real estate loans, home eq-
uity loans, and consumer loans contracted.  However, 
closed-end residential mortgage loans on banks’ books 
increased modestly for the second month in a row. 

Over September and October, M2 expanded at an av-
erage annual rate that was noticeably above its pace 
earlier in the year.  The growth rate of liquid deposits 
moved up, while small time deposits and retail money 
market mutual funds continued to contract.  The com-
positional shift likely reflected the relatively attractive 
yields on liquid deposits.  Currency growth streng-
thened, with indicators suggesting strong demand from 
abroad. 

The dollar declined about 3 percent against a broad 
array of other currencies during the intermeeting pe-
riod, depreciating even more against the euro and the 
yen.  In addition, Chinese authorities allowed the ren-
minbi to appreciate slightly against the dollar.  Market

commentary highlighted the possibility that major cen-
tral banks would further ease monetary policy, and the 
Bank of Japan expanded its asset purchase program 
and reduced its policy target rate to a range of 0 to     
10 basis points.  Benchmark 10-year sovereign yields 
generally declined in the major advanced foreign econ-
omies, but the overnight rate in the euro area increased 
as the European Central Bank continued to allow the 
amount of liquidity provided to the banking system to 
decline.  Spreads relative to German bunds on the 10-
year sovereign bonds of most peripheral euro-area 
countries either declined or were little changed over the 
period, but Irish sovereign spreads moved higher on 
concerns over the fiscal burdens associated with losses 
in the Irish banking sector.  Major equity indexes in the 
euro area and in the United Kingdom increased mod-
erately, whereas the Nikkei index declined. 

Several emerging market central banks tightened mone-
tary policy, including the People’s Bank of China.  
Against the backdrop of interest rate declines in many 
of the advanced economies, as well as heavy capital 
flows toward emerging market countries, many emerg-
ing market currencies strengthened, reportedly prompt-
ing further official intervention in foreign exchange 
markets. 

Staff Economic Outlook 
Because the recent data on production and spending 
were broadly in line with the staff’s expectations, the 
forecast for economic activity that was prepared for the 
November FOMC meeting showed little change to the 
staff’s near-term outlook relative to the forecast pre-
pared for the September FOMC meeting.  However, 
the staff revised up its forecast for economic activity in 
2011 and 2012.  In light of asset market developments 
over the intermeeting period, which in large part ap-
peared to reflect heightened expectations among inves-
tors that the Federal Reserve would undertake addi-
tional purchases of longer-term securities, the Novem-
ber forecast was conditioned on lower long-term inter-
est rates, higher stock prices, and a lower foreign ex-
change value of the dollar than was the staff’s previous 
forecast.  These factors were expected to provide addi-
tional support to the recovery in economic activity.  
Accordingly, the unemployment rate was anticipated to 
recede somewhat more than in the previous forecast, 
although the margin of slack at the end of 2011 was 
still expected to be substantial. 

The staff’s forecast continued to show subdued rates of 
headline and core inflation during 2011 and 2012.  
However, the downward pressure on inflation from 

slack in resource utilization was expected to be slightly 
less than previously projected, and prices of imported 
goods were anticipated to rise somewhat faster.  As in 
previous forecasts, further disinflation was expected to 
be checked by the ongoing stability of inflation expec-
tations. 

Participants’ Views on Current Conditions and the 
Economic Outlook 
In conjunction with this FOMC meeting, all meeting 
participants—the six members of the Board of Gover-
nors and the heads of the 12 Federal Reserve Banks—
provided projections of output growth, the unemploy-
ment rate, and inflation for each year from 2010 
through 2013 and over the longer run.  Longer-run 
projections represent each participant’s assessment of 
the rate to which each variable would be expected to 
converge, over time, under appropriate monetary policy 
and in the absence of further shocks.  Participants’ 
forecasts are described in the Summary of Economic 
Projections, which is attached as an addendum to these 
minutes. 

In their discussion of the economic situation and out-
look, meeting participants generally agreed that the in-
coming data indicated that output and employment 
were continuing to increase, but only slowly.  Progress 
toward the Committee’s dual objectives of maximum 
employment and price stability was described as disap-
pointingly slow.  Participants variously noted a number 
of factors that were restraining growth, including low 
levels of household and business confidence, concerns 
about the durability of the economic recovery, continu-
ing uncertainty about the future tax and regulatory en-
vironment, still-weak financial conditions of some 
households and small businesses, the depressed hous-
ing market, and waning fiscal stimulus.  Although par-
ticipants considered it quite unlikely that the economy 
would slide back into recession, some noted that con-
tinued slow growth and high levels of resource slack 
could leave the economic expansion vulnerable to neg-
ative shocks.  In the absence of such shocks, and as-
suming appropriate monetary policy, participants’ eco-
nomic projections generally showed growth picking up 
to a moderate pace and the unemployment rate declin-
ing somewhat next year.  Participants generally ex-
pected growth to strengthen further and unemploy-
ment to decline somewhat more rapidly in 2012 and 
2013. 

Indicators of spending by households and businesses 
remained mixed.  Consumer spending was expanding 
gradually.  Participants noted that households were 

Page 6 Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________



continuing their efforts to repair their balance sheets, a 
process that was restraining growth in consumer 
spending.  Sluggish employment growth and elevated 
uncertainty about job prospects also continued to 
weigh on household spending.  With respect to busi-
ness spending, contacts generally reported that they 
were investing to reduce costs but were refraining from 
adding workers or expanding capacity in the United 
States.  Energy producers were an exception.  Partici-
pants observed that firms had generated rising profits, 
but that business contacts indicated those gains largely 
reflected cost-cutting rather than top-line growth in 
revenues.  A number of businesses continued to report 
that they were holding back on hiring and capital 
spending because of uncertainty about future taxes, 
health-care costs, and regulations.  But concerns about 
actual and anticipated demand also were important fac-
tors limiting investment and hiring.  Firms continued to 
report strong foreign demand for their products, par-
ticularly from Asia. 

Participants noted that the housing sector, including 
residential construction and home sales, remained de-
pressed.  Foreclosures were adding to the elevated 
supply of available homes and putting downward pres-
sure on home prices and housing construction.  Some 
participants saw disputes over mortgage and foreclo-
sure documents as likely to delay the eventual recovery 
in housing markets.  Commercial real estate markets 
also were weak, and the availability of credit for com-
mercial real estate transactions remained limited, but 
low interest rates were helping stabilize prices. 

Participants agreed that progress in reducing unem-
ployment was disappointing; indeed, several noted that 
the recent rate of output growth, if continued, would 
more likely be associated with an increase than a de-
crease in the unemployment rate.  Participants again 
discussed the extent to which employment was being 
held down, and the unemployment rate boosted, by 
structural factors such as mismatches between the skills 
of the workers who had lost their jobs and the skills 
needed in the sectors of the economy with vacancies, 
the inability of the unemployed to relocate because 
their homes were worth less than the principal they 
owed on their mortgages, and the effects of extended 
unemployment benefits on the duration of unemployed 
workers’ search for a new job.  Participants agreed that 
such factors were contributing to continued high un-
employment but differed in their assessments of the 
magnitude of such effects.  Many participants saw evi-
dence that the current unemployment rate was well 
above levels that could be explained by structural fac-

tors alone, noting, for example, reports from business 
contacts indicating that weak growth in demand for 
their firms’ products remained a key reason why they 
were reluctant to add employees, and job vacancy rates 
that were low relative to historical experience.  A num-
ber of participants noted that continued high unem-
ployment, particularly with large numbers of workers 
suffering very long spells of unemployment, would lead 
to an erosion of workers’ skills that would have adverse 
consequences for those workers and for the economy’s 
potential level of output in the longer term. 

Participants saw financial conditions as having become 
more supportive of growth over the course of the in-
termeeting period; most, though not all, of the change 
appeared to reflect investors’ increasing anticipation of 
a further easing of monetary policy.  Most longer-term 
nominal interest rates declined, real interest rates fell 
even more, credit spreads tightened, and equity prices 
rose, in part reflecting better-than-expected corporate 
earnings reports.  Inflation compensation rose noticea-
bly, returning to a level more typical of recent years.  
Participants noted that credit remained readily availa-
ble—in debt markets and from banks—for larger cor-
porations, and there were some signs that credit condi-
tions had begun to improve for smaller firms that ob-
tain credit primarily from banks.  Banking institutions 
reported signs of improving credit quality.  Improve-
ments in household financial conditions were contri-
buting to better performance of consumer loans.  
However, banks continued to report elevated losses on 
commercial real estate loans, especially construction 
and land development loans.  Participants noted the 
risk of losses at financial institutions stemming from 
investors putting mortgages back to sellers if the quality 
of the loans was misrepresented when the mortgages 
were sold into securitization vehicles. 

Measures of price inflation had generally trended lower 
since the start of the recession; the same was true of 
nominal wage growth.  Most participants indicated that 
underlying inflation was somewhat low relative to levels 
that they judged to be consistent with the Committee’s 
statutory mandate to foster maximum employment and 
price stability.  While underlying inflation remained 
subdued, meeting participants generally saw only small 
odds of deflation, given the stability of longer-term 
inflation expectations and the anticipated recovery in 
economic activity.  They generally did not expect ap-
preciably higher inflation, either.  While prices of some 
commodities and imported goods had risen recently, 
business contacts reported that they currently had little 
pricing power and that they would continue to seek

productivity gains to offset higher input costs.  Small 
wage increases, coupled with productivity gains, meant 
that unit labor costs were lower than a year earlier.  
Many participants pointed to substantial slack in re-
source utilization, along with well-anchored inflation 
expectations, as likely to contribute to subdued infla-
tion for some time.  A few participants expected that 
continuing resource slack would lead to some further 
disinflation in coming years.  However, a few others 
thought that the exceptionally accommodative stance 
of monetary policy, coupled with rising prices of energy 
and other commodities as well as rising prices of other 
imports, made it more likely that inflation would in-
crease, within a year or two, to levels they judged con-
sistent with the Committee’s dual mandate. 

Participants generally agreed that the most likely eco-
nomic outcome would be a gradual pickup in growth 
with slow progress toward maximum employment.  
They also generally expected that inflation would re-
main, for some time, below levels the Committee con-
siders most consistent, over the longer run, with maxi-
mum employment and price stability.  However, partic-
ipants held a range of views about the risks to that out-
look.  Most saw the risks to growth as broadly bal-
anced, but many saw the risks as tilted to the downside.  
Similarly, a majority saw the risks to inflation as bal-
anced; some, however, saw downside risks predominat-
ing while a couple saw inflation risks as tilted to the 
upside.  Participants also differed in their assessments 
of the likely benefits and costs associated with a pro-
gram of purchasing additional longer-term securities in 
an effort to provide additional monetary stimulus, 
though most saw the benefits as exceeding the costs in 
current circumstances.  Most participants judged that a 
program of purchasing additional longer-term securities 
would put downward pressure on longer-term interest 
rates and boost asset prices; some observed that it 
could also lead to a reduction in the foreign exchange 
value of the dollar.  Most expected these changes in 
financial conditions to help promote a somewhat 
stronger recovery in output and employment while also 
helping return inflation, over time, to levels consistent 
with the Committee’s mandate.  In addition, several 
participants argued that the stimulus provided by addi-
tional securities purchases would help protect against 
further disinflation and the small probability that the 
U.S. economy could fall into persistent deflation—an 
outcome that they thought would be very costly.  Some 
participants, however, anticipated that additional pur-
chases of longer-term securities would have only a lim-
ited effect on the pace of the recovery; they judged that 

the economy’s slow growth largely reflected the effects 
of factors that were not likely to respond to additional 
monetary policy stimulus and thought that additional 
action would be warranted only if the outlook wor-
sened and the odds of deflation increased materially.  
Some participants noted concerns that additional ex-
pansion of the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet could 
put unwanted downward pressure on the dollar’s value 
in foreign exchange markets.  Several participants saw a 
risk that a further increase in the size of the Federal 
Reserve’s asset portfolio, with an accompanying in-
crease in the supply of excess reserves and in the 
monetary base, could cause an undesirably large in-
crease in inflation.  However, it was noted that the 
Committee had in place tools that would enable it to 
remove policy accommodation quickly if necessary to 
avoid an undesirable increase in inflation. 

Committee Policy Action 
Though the economic recovery was continuing, mem-
bers considered progress toward meeting the Commit-
tee’s dual mandate of maximum employment and price 
stability as having been disappointingly slow.  More-
over, members generally thought that progress was 
likely to remain slow.  Accordingly, most members 
judged it appropriate to take action to promote a 
stronger pace of economic recovery and to help ensure 
that inflation, over time, is at levels consistent with the 
Committee’s mandate.  In their discussion of monetary 
policy for the period immediately ahead, nearly all 
Committee members agreed to keep the federal funds 
rate at its effective lower bound by maintaining the tar-
get range for that rate at 0 to ¼ percent and to expand 
the Federal Reserve’s holdings of longer-term securi-
ties.  To increase its securities holdings, the Committee 
decided to continue its existing policy of reinvesting 
principal payments from its securities holdings into 
longer-term Treasury securities and intended to pur-
chase a further $600 billion of longer-term Treasury 
securities at a pace of about $75 billion per month 
through the second quarter of 2011.   One member 
dissented from this action, judging that the risks of ad-
ditional securities purchases outweighed the benefits.  
Members agreed that the Committee will regularly re-
view the pace of its securities purchases and the overall 
size of the asset-purchase program in light of incoming 
information and will adjust the program as needed to 
best foster its goals of maximum employment and price 
stability. 

With respect to the statement to be released following 
the meeting, members agreed that it was appropriate to 
adjust the statement to make it clear that the unem-

Page 8 Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________



ployment rate was elevated, and that measures of un-
derlying inflation were somewhat low, relative to levels 
that the Committee judged to be consistent, over the 
longer run, with its dual mandate.  Nearly all members 
agreed that the statement should reiterate the expecta-
tion that economic conditions were likely to warrant 
exceptionally low levels of the federal funds rate for an 
extended period.  Members agreed that the statement 
should note that the Committee will employ its policy 
tools as necessary to support the economic recovery 
and to help ensure that inflation, over time, is at levels 
consistent with its mandate. 

At the conclusion of the discussion, the Committee 
voted to authorize and direct the Federal Reserve Bank 
of New York, until it was instructed otherwise, to ex-
ecute transactions in the System Account in accordance 
with the following domestic policy directive: 

“The Federal Open Market Committee seeks 
monetary and financial conditions that will 
foster price stability and promote sustainable 
growth in output.  To further its long-run 
objectives, the Committee seeks conditions 
in reserve markets consistent with federal 
funds trading in a range from 0 to ¼ percent.  
The Committee directs the Desk to execute 
purchases of longer-term Treasury securities 
by the end of June 2011 in order to increase 
the total face value of domestic securities 
held in the System Open Market Account to 
approximately $2.6 trillion.  The Committee 
also directs the Desk to reinvest principal 
payments from agency debt and agency 
mortgage-backed securities in longer-term 
Treasury securities.  The System Open Mar-
ket Account Manager and the Secretary will 
keep the Committee informed of ongoing 
developments regarding the System’s balance 
sheet that could affect the attainment over 
time of the Committee’s objectives of maxi-
mum employment and price stability.” 

The vote encompassed approval of the statement be-
low to be released at 2:15 p.m.: 

“Information received since the Federal 
Open Market Committee met in September 
confirms that the pace of recovery in output 
and employment continues to be slow.  
Household spending is increasing gradually, 
but remains constrained by high unemploy-
ment, modest income growth, lower housing 
wealth, and tight credit.  Business spending 

on equipment and software is rising, though 
less rapidly than earlier in the year, while in-
vestment in nonresidential structures contin-
ues to be weak.  Employers remain reluctant 
to add to payrolls.  Housing starts continue 
to be depressed.  Longer-term inflation ex-
pectations have remained stable, but meas-
ures of underlying inflation have trended 
lower in recent quarters.  

Consistent with its statutory mandate, the 
Committee seeks to foster maximum em-
ployment and price stability.  Currently, the 
unemployment rate is elevated, and measures 
of underlying inflation are somewhat low, 
relative to levels that the Committee judges 
to be consistent, over the longer run, with its 
dual mandate.  Although the Committee an-
ticipates a gradual return to higher levels of 
resource utilization in a context of price sta-
bility, progress toward its objectives has been 
disappointingly slow.  

To promote a stronger pace of economic re-
covery and to help ensure that inflation, over 
time, is at levels consistent with its mandate, 
the Committee decided today to expand its 
holdings of securities.  The Committee will 
maintain its existing policy of reinvesting 
principal payments from its securities hold-
ings.  In addition, the Committee intends to 
purchase a further $600 billion of longer-
term Treasury securities by the end of the 
second quarter of 2011, a pace of about    
$75 billion per month.  The Committee will 
regularly review the pace of its securities pur-
chases and the overall size of the asset-
purchase program in light of incoming in-
formation and will adjust the program as 
needed to best foster maximum employment 
and price stability.  

The Committee will maintain the target 
range for the federal funds rate at 0 to         
¼ percent and continues to anticipate that 
economic conditions, including low rates of 
resource utilization, subdued inflation trends, 
and stable inflation expectations, are likely to 
warrant exceptionally low levels for the fed-
eral funds rate for an extended period.  

The Committee will continue to monitor the 
economic outlook and financial develop-
ments and will employ its policy tools as ne-

cessary to support the economic recovery 
and to help ensure that inflation, over time, 
is at levels consistent with its mandate.” 

Voting for this action:  Ben Bernanke, William C. 
Dudley, James Bullard, Elizabeth Duke, Sandra Pianal-
to, Sarah Bloom Raskin, Eric Rosengren, Daniel K. 
Tarullo, Kevin Warsh, and Janet L. Yellen. 

Voting against this action:  Thomas M. Hoenig. 

Mr. Hoenig dissented because he judged that additional 
accommodation would do little to accelerate the econ-
omy’s continuing, gradual recovery.  In his assessment, 
the risks of additional purchases of Treasury securities 
outweighed the benefits.  Mr. Hoenig believed that ad-
ditional purchases would risk a further misallocation of 
resources and future financial imbalances that could 
destabilize the economy.  He also saw a potential for 
additional purchases to undermine the Federal Re-
serve’s independence and cause long-term inflation 
expectations to rise.  Mr. Hoenig also believed it was 
not appropriate to indicate that economic and financial 
conditions were “likely to warrant exceptionally low 
levels of the federal funds rate for an extended period” 
or to reinvest principal payments from agency debt and 
mortgage-backed securities in long-term Treasury se-
curities.  In his assessment, this continued high level of 
monetary policy accommodation could put at risk the 
achievement of the Committee’s long-run policy objec-
tives. 

It was agreed that the next meeting of the Committee 
would be held on Tuesday, December 14, 2010.  The 
meeting adjourned at 1:15 p.m. on November 3, 2010. 

Notation Vote 
By notation vote completed on October 8, 2010, the 
Committee unanimously approved the minutes of the 
FOMC meeting held on September 21, 2010. 

Videoconference Meeting of October 15 
The Committee met by videoconference on October 
15 to discuss issues associated with its monetary policy 
framework, including alternative ways to express and 
communicate the Committee’s objectives, possibilities 
for supplementing the Committee’s communication 
about its policy decisions, the merits of smaller and 
more frequent adjustments in the Federal Reserve’s 
intended securities holdings versus larger and less fre-
quent adjustments, and the potential costs and benefits 
of targeting a term interest rate.  The agenda did not 
contemplate any policy decisions and none were taken. 

Participants agreed that greater public understanding of 
the Committee’s interpretation of its statutory objec-
tives could contribute to better macroeconomic out-
comes.  Participants expressed a range of views about 
the potential costs and benefits of quantifying the 
Committee’s interpretation of its statutory mandate to 
promote price stability by adopting a numerical infla-
tion objective or a target path for the price level.  In the 
end, participants noted that the longer-run projections 
contained in the Summary of Economic Projections, 
which is released once per quarter in conjunction with 
the minutes of four of the Committee’s meetings, con-
vey considerable information about participants’ as-
sessments of their statutory objectives.  Participants 
discussed whether it might be useful for the Chairman 
to hold occasional press briefings to provide more de-
tailed information to the public regarding the Commit-
tee’s assessment of the outlook and its policy deci-
sionmaking than is included in Committee’s short post-
meeting statements. 

In their discussion of the relative merits of smaller and 
more frequent adjustments versus larger and less fre-
quent adjustments in the Federal Reserve’s intended 
securities holdings, participants generally agreed that 
large adjustments had been appropriate when economic 
activity was declining sharply in response to the finan-
cial crisis.  In current circumstances, however, most 
saw advantages to a more incremental approach that 
would involve smaller changes in the Committee’s 
holdings of securities calibrated to incoming data. 

Finally, participants discussed the potential benefits and 
costs of setting a target for a term interest rate.  Some 
noted that targeting the yield on a term security could 
be an effective way to reduce longer-term interest rates 
and thus provide additional stimulus to the economy.  
But participants also noted potentially large risks, in-
cluding the risk that the Federal Reserve might find 
itself buying undesirably large amounts of the relevant 
security in order to keep its yield close to the target 
level.

Summary of Economic Projections
 

In conjunction with the November 2–3, 2010, FOMC 
meeting, the members of the Board of Governors and 
the presidents of the Federal Reserve Banks, all of 
whom participate in the deliberations of the FOMC, 
submitted projections for output growth, unemploy-
ment, and inflation for the years 2010 to 2013 and over 
the longer run.  The projections were based on infor-
mation available through the end of the meeting and on 
each participant’s assumptions about factors likely to 
affect economic outcomes, including his or her assess-
ment of appropriate monetary policy.  “Appropriate 
monetary policy” is defined as the future path of policy 
that each participant deems most likely to foster out-
comes for economic activity and inflation that best sa-
tisfy his or her interpretation of the Federal Reserve’s 
dual objectives of maximum employment and stable 
prices.  Longer-run projections represent each partici-
pant’s assessment of the rate to which each variable 
would be expected to converge over time under appro-
priate monetary policy and in the absence of further 
shocks. 

As depicted in figure 1, FOMC participants’ projections 
of economic activity over the next several years indi-
cated that they expected the economic recovery to con-
tinue, with unemployment declining slowly and infla-
tion remaining subdued.  As indicated in table 1, rela-
tive to their previous projections in June, participants 
saw weaker real activity this year and expected a some-
what more gradual economic recovery over the next 
several years.  Most participants expected the unem-

ployment rate would slowly decline over the forecast 
horizon, while the rate of inflation would edge up but 
stay subdued.  Participants generally indicated that the 
pace of expansion in real gross domestic product 
(GDP) would rise over the projection period to one 
that was somewhat above their assessment of the 
economy’s longer-run rate of growth.  They judged that 
the pickup in economic activity would be spurred in 
part by accommodative monetary policy and a gradual 
easing in credit conditions that would help buoy spend-
ing by consumers and businesses.  Stronger spending, 
in turn, would lead to improved confidence in the 
economy, a pickup in hiring, and a further improve-
ment in credit conditions—forces that would continue 
to support spending.  But participants thought that 
several factors would likely continue to restrain eco-
nomic growth for a while, including a high degree of 
caution exhibited by consumers and businesses, persis-
tent weakness in the residential and commercial real 
estate sectors of the economy, and still-tight credit 
conditions.  Somewhat more than half of the partici-
pants judged that, in the absence of any additional 
shocks to the economy, the economy would converge 
fully to its longer-run rates of output growth, unem-
ployment, and inflation within about five or six years; 
the rest indicated that it could take longer for unem-
ployment to fall back to its longer-run rate or for infla-
tion to rise back to the level they deemed desirable in 
the longer run.  Participants continued to attach an un-
usually high degree of uncertainty to their projections

tures (PCE) and the price index for PCE excluding food and energy.  Projections for the unemployment rate are for the average civilian unemployment rate in the 
fourth quarter of the year indicated.  Each participant’s projections are based on his or her assessment of appropriate monetary policy.  Longer-run projections 
represent each participant’s assessment of the rate to which each variable would be expected to converge under appropriate monetary policy and in the absence of 
further shocks to the economy.  The June projections were made in conjunction with the meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee on June 22–23, 2010.

relative to longer-run norms.  While many participants 
judged the risks surrounding their projections of each 
variable to be broadly balanced, a similar number indi-
cated that the combination of downside risks to growth 
and upside risks to unemployment predominated. 

The Outlook 
The central tendency of participants’ projections of real 
GDP growth in 2010 was a narrow band from 2.4 to 
2.5 percent, down from 3.0 to 3.5 percent in June.  Par-
ticipants stated that incoming economic data had 
weighed heavily on their forecasts for growth this year.  
The Bureau of Economic Analysis published its com-
prehensive annual revisions and advance estimate of 
second-quarter GDP after participants submitted their 
June projections, and these data showed that the ex-
pansion in real GDP in the first half of the year had 
been slower than the participants had expected.  The 
most recent data on output growth in the third quarter 
indicated that the economy had continued to expand 
modestly.  Participants noted that consumer spending 
appeared restrained by lower household wealth, rela-
tively tight credit conditions in some markets, and 
households’ ongoing desire to repair their balance 
sheets.  In addition, participants generally viewed the 
incoming data on housing, manufacturing, trade, and 
labor market activity as weaker than they had expected 
at the time of the June meeting.  Participants also noted 
that the support to growth from earlier fiscal stimulus 
and inventory investment had waned. 

Participants continued to expect a modest pickup in the 
pace of the recovery over the next couple of years.  The 
central tendency of their projections for output growth 
in 2011 was 3.0 to 3.6 percent, followed by central ten-
dencies of 3.6 to 4.5 percent in 2012 and 3.5 to 4.6 per-
cent in 2013.  Participants noted that factors such as 
previously deferred spending on consumer durables 
and business equipment and software, stabilization in 
residential investment, accommodative conditions in 
financial markets, and some easing in credit conditions 
would likely provide impetus to economic growth 
going forward.  However, participants cited several 
forces that were likely to weigh on the pace of the eco-
nomic expansion over the next few years, including the 
ongoing poor performance of the commercial real es-
tate sector, the uneven pace of the recovery in housing 
markets, the potential effects of the home mortgage 
documentation problems that had recently surfaced, 
the restraint in government spending resulting from the 
strained fiscal conditions of many states and municipal-
ities, and credit conditions at banks that were likely to 
ease fairly slowly.  Participants anticipated that, in the 

absence of further shocks, the economy would con-
verge over time to a longer-run rate of real GDP 
growth of 2.5 to 2.8 percent, unchanged from June. 

Participants expected that conditions in labor markets 
would improve gradually beginning next year.  The cen-
tral tendency of their projections of the average unem-
ployment rate in the fourth quarter of this year was   
9.5 to 9.7 percent.  Uncertainty on the part of employ-
ers about the sustainability of the recovery was general-
ly anticipated to ebb over the forecast period, and par-
ticipants expected that hiring would gradually pick up 
and unemployment would decline slowly.  The central 
tendency of their unemployment rate projections for 
the end of the forecast period in 2013 was 6.9 to       
7.4 percent.  On the whole, the projections suggest a 
more gradual decline in unemployment over the next 
few years than had been expected in June, consistent 
with the participants’ assessments of somewhat weaker 
growth prospects.  Participants noted that the more 
gradual recovery was reflected in improvements in the 
labor market to date that had been slower to materialize 
than previously anticipated.  Some participants attri-
buted a portion of the upward revision in their projec-
tions of unemployment over the next two years to 
longer-lived structural adjustments in labor markets, 
and they raised their estimates of the unemployment 
rate that would prevail in the longer run accordingly.  
As a result, participants’ longer-run projections of un-
employment exhibited a central tendency of 5.0 to     
6.0 percent, substantially wider than the central tenden-
cy of 5.0 to 5.3 percent reported in June. 

Participants’ inflation projections edged up since June 
but continued to indicate that inflation was expected to 
remain subdued over the next several years.  Partici-
pants noted that the high degree of slack in resource 
markets would help keep inflation relatively low over 
the forecast horizon.  At the same time, appropriate 
monetary policy, combined with well-anchored infla-
tion expectations, was seen as likely to result in a mod-
est level of inflation, avoiding either an undesirable in-
crease or a further decrease in inflation.  The central 
tendency of participants’ projections for personal con-
sumption expenditures (PCE) inflation was 1.2 to      
1.4 percent in 2010, 1.1 to 1.7 percent in 2011, 1.1 to 
1.8 percent in 2012, and 1.2 to 2.0 percent in 2013.  
Increases in energy and other commodity prices were 
expected to boost headline PCE inflation over the 
forecast period, with core inflation likely to run at a 
somewhat lower pace.  Most participants’ projections 
of inflation over the next several years did not exceed 
the rate of longer-run inflation that they individually

considered most consistent with the Federal Reserve’s 
dual mandate for maximum employment and stable 
prices.  Participants’ projections of this mandate-
consistent rate of inflation exhibited a central tendency 
of 1.6 to 2.0 percent, little changed from June. 

Uncertainty and Risks 
As they did in June, most participants attached a higher 
degree of uncertainty to their projections of output 
growth and unemployment over the forecast horizon 
than is historically typical.1  While a majority of partici-
pants judged the risks to output growth as broadly bal-
anced, many participants viewed the risks to their fore-
cast of output growth as weighted to the downside, the 
risks to their forecast of unemployment as tilted to the 
upside, or both.  Some of these participants noted that 
it would be more difficult than usual to address future 
negative shocks to the real economy, should they mate-
rialize, because the Federal Reserve had already moved 
nominal short-term interest rates close to zero, and 
because they saw the likelihood of further fiscal stimu-
lus as being quite limited.  In addition, some of these 
participants noted that the anticipated recovery of the 
housing market might take longer than expected. 

Regarding inflation, a few participants judged that the 
uncertainty surrounding their projections was broadly 
similar to historical norms, but most continued to at-
tach an unusually high degree of uncertainty to these 
projections.  Most participants continued to assess the 
risks to their inflation forecasts as broadly balanced, 
although some judged that downside risks predomi-
nated and a couple judged that upside risks predomi-
nated. Participants citing downside risks noted con-
cerns about the degree to which lingering resource 
slack in the economy was putting downward pressure 
on inflation, or about the possible effects that an ex-
tended period of low readings on actual inflation might 
have in reducing inflation expectations.  Those who 
indicated upside risks to inflation generally pointed to 
concerns relating to the unusual size of the Federal Re-
serve’s balance sheet, which, if left in place for too 
long, might eventually begin to erode the stability of 
longer-term inflation expectations. 

                                                 
1 Table 2 provides estimates of forecast uncertainty for the 
change in real GDP, the unemployment rate, and total con-
sumer price inflation over the period from 1989 to 2009.  At 
the end of this summary, the box “Forecast Uncertainty” 
discusses the sources and interpretation of uncertainty in 
economic forecasts and explains the approach used to assess 
the uncertainty and risks attending participants’ projections. 

Diversity of Views 
Information about the diversity of participants’ views 
regarding the likely outcomes for real GDP growth and 
the unemployment rate over the next few years is pro-
vided in figures 2.A and 2.B, respectively.  The disper-
sion in these projections reflects differences in partici-
pants’ assessments of many factors, including the cur-
rent degree of underlying momentum in economic ac-
tivity, the amount of restraint on economic activity like-
ly to result from low readings on consumer and busi-
ness sentiment and relatively tight credit conditions, 
how quickly and to what degree particularly hard-hit 
sectors of the economy will recover, the degree of sup-
port for economic activity from conditions in financial 
markets, and the form and degree of appropriate future 
monetary policy and its effects on economic activity.  
With much of the data for 2010 now in hand, the dis-
persion of participants’ projections of output growth 
this year narrowed quite a bit relative to June.  While 
the distributions of participants’ projections of real 
GDP growth in 2011 and 2012 shifted lower since 
June, the degree of dispersion displayed in these projec-
tions was little changed.  The dispersion associated with 
participants’ longer-run projections of output growth 
also changed little from June.  Regarding unemploy-
ment, the distributions of participants’ projections of 
this variable for 2010 through 2012 generally shifted up 
somewhat, and the distribution of their forecasts for 
2012 widened noticeably, relative to June.  The distri-
bution of their estimates of the longer-run rate of un-
employment showed modest changes since June, and,

NOTE:  Error ranges shown are measured as plus or minus the 

root mean squared error of projections for 1990 through 2009 that 
were released in the fall by various private and government forecas-
ters.  As described in the box “Forecast Uncertainty,” under certain 
assumptions, there is about a 70 percent probability that actual out-
comes for real GDP, unemployment, and consumer prices will be in 
ranges implied by the average size of projection errors made in the 
past.  Further information is in David Reifschneider and Peter Tulip 
(2007), “Gauging the Uncertainty of the Economic Outlook from 
Historical Forecasting Errors,” Finance and Economics Discussion 
Series 2007-60 (Washington: Board of Governors of the Federal 
Reserve System, November).

as noted previously, the central tendency of these pro-
jections widened. 

Figures 2.C and 2.D provide corresponding informa-
tion about the diversity of participants’ outlooks for 
inflation.  The distributions of participants’ projections 
for overall and core PCE inflation in 2010 narrowed 
somewhat and moved a bit higher compared with the 
patterns these projections displayed in June.  Most of 
the distributions of the participants’ inflation projec-
tions for 2011 and 2012 also became somewhat more 
concentrated relative to June.  Participants’ forecasts of 
overall inflation over the longer run remained in a rela-
tively narrow band.  In general, participants’ projections 

of inflation over the next few years exhibit dispersion 
because of differences in their judgments regarding the 
determinants of inflation, including their estimates of 
the degree of resource slack and their assessments of 
the extent to which such slack influences inflation out-
comes and expectations.  By contrast, the relatively 
concentrated distribution of participants’ longer-run 
inflation projections shows the substantial similarity in 
the participants’ assessments of the approximate level 
of inflation that is most consistent with the Federal 
Reserve’s dual objectives of maximum employment and 
stable prices.

Forecast Uncertainty 

  

 

The economic projections provided by 
the members of the Board of Governors and 
the presidents of the Federal Reserve Banks 
inform discussions of monetary policy among 
policymakers and can aid public understand-
ing of the basis for policy actions.  Considera-
ble uncertainty attends these projections, 
however.  The economic and statistical models 
and relationships used to help produce eco-
nomic forecasts are necessarily imperfect de-
scriptions of the real world.  And the future 
path of the economy can be affected by myr-
iad unforeseen developments and events.  
Thus, in setting the stance of monetary policy, 
participants consider not only what appears to 
be the most likely economic outcome as em-
bodied in their projections, but also the range 
of alternative possibilities, the likelihood of 
their occurring, and the potential costs to the 
economy should they occur. 

Table 2 summarizes the average historical 
accuracy of a range of forecasts, including 
those reported in past Monetary Policy Reports 
and those prepared by Federal Reserve Board 
staff in advance of meetings of the Federal 
Open Market Committee.  The projection 
error ranges shown in the table illustrate the 
considerable uncertainty associated with eco-
nomic forecasts.  For example, suppose a par-
ticipant projects that real gross domestic 
product (GDP) and total consumer prices will 
rise steadily at annual rates of, respectively,     
3 percent and 2 percent.  If the uncertainty 
attending those projections is similar to that 
experienced  in the  past and  the risks  around 

the projections are broadly balanced, the num-
bers reported in table 2 would imply a proba-
bility of about 70 percent that actual GDP 
would expand within a range of 2.4 to 3.6 per-
cent in the current year, 1.6 to 4.4 percent in 
the second year, and 1.2 to 4.8 percent in the 
third and fourth years.  The corresponding    
70 percent confidence intervals for overall in-
flation would be 1.5 to 2.5 percent in the cur-
rent year, 1.0 to 3.0 percent in the second year, 
and 0.9 to 3.1 percent in the third and fourth 
years. 

Because current conditions may differ 
from those that prevailed, on average, over his-
tory, participants provide judgments as to 
whether the uncertainty attached to their pro-
jections of each variable is greater than, smaller 
than, or broadly similar to typical levels of 
forecast uncertainty in the past as shown in 
table 2.  Participants also provide judgments as 
to whether the risks to their projections are 
weighted to the upside, are weighted to the 
downside, or are broadly balanced.  That is, 
participants judge whether each variable is 
more likely to be above or below their projec-
tions of the most likely outcome.  These judg-
ments about the uncertainty and the risks at-
tending each participant’s projections are dis-
tinct from the diversity of participants’ views 
about the most likely outcomes.  Forecast un-
certainty is concerned with the risks associated 
with a particular projection rather than with 
divergences across a number of different pro-
jections.
