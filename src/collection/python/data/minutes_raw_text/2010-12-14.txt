Developments in Financial Markets and the Fed-
eral Reserve’s Balance Sheet 
The manager of the System Open Market Account 
(SOMA) reported on developments in domestic and 
foreign financial markets since the Federal Open Mar-
ket Committee (FOMC) met on November 2–3, 2010.  
He also reported on System open market operations, 
including the continuing reinvestment into longer-term 
Treasury securities of principal payments received on 
the SOMA’s holdings of agency debt and agency-
guaranteed mortgage-backed securities (MBS) as well as 
the ongoing purchases of additional Treasury securities 
authorized at the November 2–3 FOMC meeting.  
Since the last meeting, the Open Market Desk at the 
Federal Reserve Bank of New York purchased a total 
of about $105 billion of Treasury securities, reflecting 
about $30 billion of purchases with the proceeds of 
principal payments and about $75 billion as part of the 
authorized expansion of the Federal Reserve’s securi-
ties holdings.  Purchases were concentrated in nominal 
Treasury securities with maturities of 2 to 10 years, 
though some longer-term securities were purchased 
along with some Treasury inflation-protected securities 
(TIPS).  The Manager also discussed the Desk’s inten-
tion to place additional limits on its purchases  of indi-
vidual securities, as the Federal Reserve’s holdings of 
such securities increased beyond 35 percent of the total 
outstanding; these limits were intended to help ensure 
that Federal Reserve purchases do not impair the li-
quidity in Treasury markets.  In addition, the Manager 
updated the Committee on the SOMA’s holdings of 
foreign-currency instruments.  There were no open 
market operations in foreign currencies for the Sys-
tem’s account over the intermeeting period.  By unan-
imous vote, the Committee ratified the Desk’s transac-
tions over the intermeeting period. 

In light of ongoing strains in some foreign financial 
markets, the Committee considered a proposal to ex-
tend its dollar liquidity swap arrangements with foreign 
central banks past January 31, 2011.  After discussing 
possible alternative periods for such an extension, the 
Committee unanimously approved the following reso-
lution: 

The Federal Open Market Committee directs 
the Federal Reserve Bank of New York to 
extend the existing temporary reciprocal cur-
rency arrangements (“swap arrangements”) 
for the System Open Market Account with 
the Bank of Canada, the Bank of England, 
the Bank of Japan, the European Central 
Bank, and the Swiss National Bank.  The 
swap arrangements shall now terminate on 
August 1, 2011, unless further extended by 
the Committee. 

Staff Review of the Economic Situation 
The information reviewed at the December 14 meeting 
indicated that economic activity was increasing at a 
moderate rate, but that the unemployment rate re-
mained elevated.  The pace of consumer spending 
picked up in October and November, exports rose ra-
pidly in October, and the recovery in business spending 
on equipment and software (E&S) appeared to be con-
tinuing.  In contrast, residential and nonresidential con-
struction activity was still depressed.  Manufacturing 
production registered a solid gain in October.  Non-
farm businesses continued to add workers in October 
and November, and the average workweek moved up.  
Longer-run inflation expectations were stable, but core 
inflation continued to trend lower. 

Labor demand rose further in recent months, but un-
employment stayed at a high level.  The average in-
crease in private nonfarm payroll employment in Octo-
ber and November was close to the pace over the pre-
ceding six months, while the average workweek for all 
employees edged higher.  The bulk of the private-sector 
job gains continued to be in the services industries; 
employment in manufacturing, construction, and retail 
trade declined, on average, in October and November.  
Employment at state and local governments rose 
slightly over the two-month period.  A number of indi-
cators of job openings and hiring plans improved in 
October and November, and initial claims for unem-
ployment insurance trended steadily lower through 
November and early December.  However, the unem-
ployment rate, which remained at 9.6 percent during 
the preceding three months, increased to 9.8 percent in

November, while the labor force participation rate and 
the employment-population ratio remained depressed.   

Industrial production in the manufacturing sector in-
creased at a solid pace in October, with advances wide-
spread across industries; total industrial production was 
unchanged due to an offsetting weather-related drop in 
the output of utilities.  The manufacturing capacity util-
ization rate continued to move up in October, although 
it remained significantly below its 1972–2009 average.  
Most indicators of near-term industrial activity, such as 
the new orders diffusion indexes in the national and 
regional manufacturing surveys, were at levels consis-
tent with moderate gains in industrial production in the 
near term.  Motor vehicle assemblies, which rose in 
October, fell back in November but were scheduled to 
move up again in coming months. 

The pace of consumer spending picked up in recent 
months from the modest rate that prevailed earlier in 
the year.  Nominal retail sales, excluding purchases at 
motor vehicles and parts outlets, posted a strong gain 
in November, and revised estimates showed larger in-
creases in September and October than previously re-
ported.  In addition, sales of new light motor vehicles 
stepped up in October and remained at that higher lev-
el in November.  A number of factors supporting con-
sumer spending also improved.  Revised data on per-
sonal income indicated that it was stronger last spring 
and summer than previously reported.  Household net 
worth rose further in the third quarter, as an increase in 
equity values more than offset the effect of a drop in 
house prices.  Consumer sentiment turned more posi-
tive in November and early December, retracing most 
of the decline that occurred during the summer.  How-
ever, while consumer credit outstanding showed signs 
of stabilizing after two years of runoffs, credit terms 
were still noticeably less favorable than in the past, and 
demand for credit appeared to remain weak.   

Activity in the housing market was still quite depressed.  
In October, starts of new single-family homes re-
mained at the very low level that had prevailed since 
August.  Moreover, the level of permit issuance, which 
is typically a near-term indicator of new homebuilding, 
continued to run below starts.  The persistence of a 
large excess supply of existing homes on the market 
and tight credit conditions for construction appeared to 
constitute a significant restraint on new homebuilding.  
Demand for housing also remained very weak:  Sales of 
new homes in October were at the lowest level in the 
48-year history of the series.  Purchases of existing 
homes edged lower in October; in part, the still-low 

level of sales likely reflected the payback from the earli-
er surge in sales associated with the homebuyer tax cre-
dit and also the moratoriums on sales of bank-owned 
properties.  Measures of house prices declined recently, 
and households’ concerns that home values might con-
tinue to fall, their pessimism about the outlook for em-
ployment and income, and the tight standards faced by 
many mortgage borrowers appeared to be weighing on 
demand.  

Real business investment in equipment and software 
appeared to be increasing, although the pace of spend-
ing seemed to have moderated from the rapid rate of 
the first half of the year.  The rise in E&S spending 
during the third quarter, while somewhat slower than 
earlier in the year, remained solid and broad based, but 
the available data for the fourth quarter were mixed.  
Nominal orders and shipments of nondefense capital 
goods excluding aircraft declined in October, and busi-
ness purchases of new vehicles in October and No-
vember were down a bit from their third-quarter level.  
In contrast, sales of software still appeared to be on a 
solid uptrend, and deliveries of completed aircraft 
picked up in November.  Surveys of purchasing man-
agers reported plans to step up capital spending in 
2011; however, reports from small businesses on their 
planned expenditures remained downbeat.  Business 
outlays on nonresidential structures appeared to be de-
clining further, with a drop in spending on building 
construction offset only slightly by increased invest-
ment in drilling and mining structures.  Overall bor-
rowing by nonfinancial corporations was robust again 
in November, indicators of credit quality continued to 
improve, and small businesses noted some easing in 
credit availability.  However, financing conditions for 
commercial real estate remained tight.   

Real inventory investment rose sharply in the third 
quarter, but book-value data for October suggested 
that the pace of accumulation was slowing.  Although 
inventory-sales ratios rose during the third quarter, sur-
vey data implied that few businesses perceived invento-
ry stocks as being too high. 

Consumer price inflation trended lower in October.  
The 12-month change in the total personal consump-
tion expenditures (PCE) price index reached its lowest 
level of the past year; the 12-month change in the PCE 
price index for core goods and services also moved 
down.  In October, core PCE prices were unchanged 
for a second month, as goods prices declined and pric-
es of non-energy services posted a small increase.  The 
broad-based deceleration in underlying inflation was

also apparent in other measures, such as the trimmed-
mean PCE price index and a diffusion index of PCE 
price changes.  Despite the rise in agricultural commod-
ity prices, the increase in retail food prices was modest.  
In contrast, consumer energy prices continued to rise 
rapidly in October, and spot prices of imported crude 
oil moved higher, on net, during November and early 
December.  The rise in prices of nonfuel industrial 
commodities moderated over the intermeeting period 
as spot prices of metals declined, but the producer 
price index for domestically manufactured intermediate 
goods accelerated in October and November.  In No-
vember and early December, survey measures of 
households’ short- and long-term inflation expectations 
remained in the ranges that have prevailed since the 
spring of 2009.   

Available measures of labor compensation showed that 
labor cost pressures were still restrained.  The 12-
month change in average hourly earnings for all em-
ployees remained low in November.  In the third quar-
ter, the modest rise in hourly compensation in the non-
farm business sector was matched by a similar increase 
in productivity. 

The U.S. international trade deficit narrowed consider-
ably in October, shrinking to its lowest level since the 
beginning of the year, as exports surged and imports 
edged down.  The strength in exports was relatively 
broad based.  Exports of industrial supplies and agri-
cultural goods registered the largest increases, although 
rising prices accounted for some of those gains.  Ex-
ports of machinery and automotive products also rose 
strongly.  The decrease in imports was concentrated in 
petroleum products, reflecting lower volumes, and in 
computers.  In contrast, imports of consumer goods 
posted a noticeable increase. 

Recent data releases confirmed that, in the aggregate, 
the rise in foreign real gross domestic product (GDP) 
slowed sharply in the third quarter from the very rapid 
pace earlier in the year.  The slowdown was most pro-
nounced in the emerging market economies (EMEs), 
where economic activity was restrained by the abate-
ment of inventory rebuilding and the associated waning 
of the rebound in global trade, the unwinding of fiscal 
stimulus measures, and a continued tightening of mon-
etary policies in several countries.  More recent indica-
tors for the EMEs, including purchasing managers in-
dexes (PMIs), pointed to a rebound in economic activi-
ty in the fourth quarter.  The advanced foreign econo-
mies (AFEs) also saw a slower rise in real economic 
activity in the third quarter than occurred earlier in the 

year.  In the euro area, economic performance contin-
ued to diverge across countries.  The increase in Ger-
man economic activity in the third quarter was nearly 
twice the euro-area average rate, and recent indicators, 
including PMIs and consumer and business sentiment, 
showed further solid performance.  In contrast, Span-
ish economic activity stagnated in the third quarter, 
Greek GDP extended its decline, and more-recent in-
dicators point to continued weakness in peripheral Eu-
ropean economies.  Headline inflation rates generally 
picked up in the foreign economies, driven largely by 
food and energy prices; measures of inflation excluding 
food and energy prices were relatively steady.   

Staff Review of the Financial Situation 
The decision by the FOMC at its November meeting to 
maintain the 0 to ¼ percent target range for the federal 
funds rate was widely anticipated.  The decision to ex-
pand its holdings of longer-term securities by $600 bil-
lion by the end of the second quarter of 2011 was also 
roughly in line with market expectations, although 
market participants appeared to expect the purchase 
program would be increased over time.  In the weeks 
following the November meeting, yields on nominal 
Treasury securities increased significantly, as investors 
reportedly revised down their estimates of the ultimate 
size of the FOMC’s new asset-purchase  program.  In-
coming economic data that were viewed, on balance, as 
favorable to the outlook and news of a tentative 
agreement between the Administration and some 
members of the Congress regarding a package of fiscal 
measures also reportedly contributed to the backup in 
yields.  Market participants pointed to abrupt changes 
in investor positions, the effects of the approaching 
year-end on market liquidity, and hedging flows asso-
ciated with investors’ holdings of MBS as factors that 
may have amplified the rise in yields.  Futures quotes 
suggested that the path for the federal funds rate ex-
pected by market participants rose over the intermeet-
ing period.   

The increase in yields on nominal Treasury coupon 
securities was accompanied by increases in yields on 
TIPS.  TIPS-based inflation compensation moved up at 
the 5-year horizon amid rising energy prices, but for-
ward inflation compensation 5 to 10 years ahead was 
about unchanged.  Yields on investment-grade corpo-
rate bonds rose about in line with those on compara-
ble-maturity Treasury securities, leaving risk spreads 
about unchanged; spreads on speculative-grade corpo-
rate bonds moved down somewhat.  Secondary-market 
prices for leveraged loans rose slightly over the inter-

meeting period, while bid-asked spreads in that market 
continued to drift down. 

Some signs of modest stress emerged in certain short-
term funding markets over the intermeeting period as 
investors focused increasingly on the evolving situation 
in Europe.  The spread of the three-month London 
interbank offered rate (or Libor) forward rate agree-
ment over the three-month forward overnight index 
swap (OIS) rate moved a bit higher, on balance, per-
haps pointing to heightened concerns about future 
funding conditions.  In the commercial paper market, 
spreads increased on paper issued by financial institu-
tions with parents in peripheral European countries, 
and the amount outstanding of such paper declined.  
Spreads on asset-backed commercial paper were 
somewhat volatile over the intermeeting period.  None-
theless, spreads on nonfinancial commercial paper re-
mained at low levels, as did the spreads of dollar Libor 
over OIS rates at one- and three-month maturities. 

Broad U.S. equity price indexes increased moderately, 
on net, over the intermeeting period, in part reflecting 
incoming economic data that were read by investors as 
suggesting that the recovery could be gaining traction, 
at least outside the housing sector.  Stock prices for 
domestic commercial banks were volatile but outper-
formed broad indexes on balance.  Option-implied vol-
atility on the S&P 500 index fell modestly, and the 
spread between the staff’s estimate of the expected real 
return on equity for S&P 500 firms and the real 10-year 
Treasury yield—a rough measure of the equity risk 
premium—narrowed a bit, although it remained ele-
vated relative to longer-run norms.   

In the December 2010 Senior Credit Officer Opinion 
Survey on Dealer Financing Terms, dealers reported an 
easing of credit terms over the preceding three months 
with respect to securities financing transactions and 
across a range of counterparties.  Dealers also noted 
that demand for funding of all types of securities in-
creased over the same reference period. 

Net debt financing by U.S. nonfinancial corporations 
continued to be robust in November.  Gross issuance 
of corporate bonds was very heavy, particularly for 
speculative-grade firms.  Investor demand for syndi-
cated leveraged loans also appeared to have remained 
high.  Nonfinancial commercial paper outstanding de-
clined noticeably during October and November, in 
part because some firms reportedly shifted to bond 
financing.  Gross public equity issuance by nonfinancial 
firms through seasoned and initial public offerings was 
particularly strong in November.  Measures of the cre-

dit quality of nonfinancial corporations continued to 
improve.   

Conditions in the commercial real estate market re-
mained tight.  Commercial mortgage debt was esti-
mated to have declined in the third quarter, and the 
delinquency rates for securitized commercial mortgages 
and those for existing properties at commercial banks 
increased further.  However, some modest signs of 
improvement continued to surface.  Prices of commer-
cial real estate changed little, on balance, over Septem-
ber and October, holding in the relatively narrow range 
that had prevailed since the spring when the steep de-
cline in these prices ended.  Issuance of commercial 
mortgage-backed securities increased in November but 
was still far below pre-crisis levels. 

Residential mortgage rates rose considerably over the 
intermeeting period, though not by as much as rates on 
longer-term Treasury securities.  The spread between 
mortgage rates and MBS yields dropped back, reversing 
the widening of the spread that occurred over the pre-
ceding several months.  Refinancing activity declined in 
response to the higher mortgage rates.  Outstanding 
residential mortgage debt was estimated to have con-
tracted in the third quarter at about the average rate of 
decline seen over the preceding year.  Delinquency 
rates on prime and subprime mortgages ticked down 
but remained extremely elevated. 

In contrast, the consumer credit market exhibited con-
tinued signs of stabilization.  Although consumer credit 
contracted in the third quarter, the decline was the 
smallest since late 2008, and consumer credit edged 
higher in October.  The pace of issuance of consumer 
asset-backed securities in November was slightly above 
the average for the year to date, and the delinquency 
rate on consumer loans at banks declined further in the 
third quarter.  

Commercial bank credit was about flat, on average, 
during October and November.  Banks continued to 
increase their holdings of securities, while core loans—
the sum of commercial and industrial (C&I), real estate, 
and consumer loans—decreased moderately.  The de-
clines were attributable to a drop in consumer loans as 
well as to continued runoffs in commercial real estate 
and home equity loans.  In contrast, C&I loans edged 
up, ending a nearly two-year string of monthly declines.  
In addition, the Survey of Terms of Business Lending 
conducted in the first week of November showed that 
interest rates on C&I loans were generally little changed 
while spreads remained extremely wide.

According to the latest Call Report data, bank profita-
bility was little changed in the third quarter, remaining 
positive but well below pre-crisis levels.  As in the 
second quarter, banks’ net incomes were supported by 
declines in loan loss provisioning, while revenues de-
clined.  Banks continued to boost regulatory capital 
ratios, likely, at least in part, in anticipation of the need 
to eventually meet stricter Basel III standards. 

M2 expanded at a moderate rate in November.  Inter-
est rates available on all M2 assets remained very low, 
and households continued to shift their holdings of M2 
assets toward liquid deposits, which continued to rise 
rapidly, and away from small time deposits and retail 
money market mutual funds.  Currency increased 
strongly, with indicators suggesting robust demand 
from abroad.   

The foreign exchange value of the dollar, which depre-
ciated immediately following the FOMC’s November 
announcement of further asset purchases, subsequently 
appreciated amid intensifying concerns about stresses 
in the euro area and some apparent reassessment by 
investors of the monetary policy outlook in the United 
States.  On net, the dollar ended the intermeeting pe-
riod up against most currencies, with particularly large 
gains against the euro.  The announcement of the Eu-
ropean Union (EU)–International Monetary Fund 
(IMF) financial aid package for Ireland on November 
28 did little to reverse the depreciation of the euro, as 
investors reportedly became increasingly concerned 
about other euro-area economies and the adequacy of 
resources available to support them should they come 
under stress.  Spreads of sovereign yields in some peri-
pheral euro-area countries over those on German 
bunds rose to new highs, although they fell back near 
the end of the intermeeting period amid reports that 
the European Central Bank (ECB) had increased its 
purchases of Irish and Portuguese sovereign debt.  
Banks in the euro-area periphery continued to rely 
heavily on funding from the ECB, and some signs of 
increased dollar funding pressures emerged.  Implied 
short-term interest rates for the coming year shifted 
down in the euro area, as market participants apparent-
ly scaled back the pace at which they expected the ECB 
to normalize policy, but rose in some other AFEs.  
Ten-year sovereign yields increased significantly 
throughout the AFEs, although by less than yields in 
the United States.  Headline stock price indexes in the 
AFEs generally ended the period higher, whereas bank 
stocks in Europe declined. 

The People’s Bank of China raised the required reserve 
ratio for banks a cumulative 150 basis points over the 
intermeeting period, and other central banks in emerg-
ing Asia increased policy rates.  China’s Shanghai 
Composite Index fell in the wake of Chinese policy 
actions, while other emerging market stock indexes 
were mixed over the period.  In Latin America, Brazil’s 
central bank also raised reserve requirements late in the 
period.  The dollar appreciated slightly, on average, 
against the emerging market currencies, although it 
edged down against the Chinese renminbi.  

Staff Economic Outlook 
With the recent data on production and spending 
stronger, on balance, than the staff anticipated at the 
time of the November FOMC meeting, the staff re-
vised up its projected increase in real GDP in the near 
term.  However, the staff’s outlook for real economic 
activity over the medium term was little changed, on 
net, relative to the projection prepared for the Novem-
ber meeting.  The staff forecast incorporated the as-
sumption that new fiscal actions, some of which had 
not been anticipated in its previous forecast, were likely 
to boost the level of real GDP in 2011 and 2012.  But, 
compared with the November forecast, a number of 
other conditioning assumptions were less favorable:  
House prices and housing activity were likely to be 
lower, while interest rates, oil prices, and the foreign 
exchange value of the dollar were projected to be high-
er, on average, than previously assumed.  As a result, 
although the staff projection showed a higher level of 
real GDP, the average pace of growth over 2011 and 
2012 was little changed from the November forecast, 
and the unemployment rate was still projected to de-
cline slowly.  

The underlying rate of consumer price inflation in re-
cent months was lower than the staff expected at the 
time of the November meeting, and the staff forecast 
anticipated that core PCE prices would rise a bit more 
slowly in 2011 and 2012 than previously projected.  As 
in earlier forecasts, the persistent wide margin of eco-
nomic slack in the projection was expected to sustain 
downward pressure on inflation, but the ongoing stabil-
ity in inflation expectations was anticipated to stem 
further disinflation.  The staff anticipated that relatively 
rapid increases in energy prices would raise total con-
sumer price inflation above the core rate in the near 
term, but that this upward pressure would dissipate by 
2012.

Participants’ Views on Current Conditions and the 
Economic Outlook 
In their discussion of the economic situation and out-
look, meeting participants saw the information received 
during the intermeeting period as pointing to some 
improvement in the near-term outlook, and they ex-
pected that economic growth, which had been mod-
erate, would pick up somewhat going forward.  Indica-
tors of production and household spending had streng-
thened, and the tone of the labor market was a little 
better on balance.  The new fiscal package was general-
ly expected to support the pace of recovery next year.  
However, a number of factors were seen as likely to 
continue restraining growth, including the depressed 
housing market, employers’ continued reluctance to 
add to payrolls, and ongoing efforts by some house-
holds and businesses to delever.  Moreover, the recov-
ery remained subject to some downside risks, such as 
the possibility of a more extended period of weak activ-
ity and lower prices in the housing sector and potential 
financial and economic spillovers if the banking and 
sovereign debt problems in Europe were to worsen.  In 
light of recent readings on consumer inflation, partici-
pants noted that underlying inflation had continued 
trending downward, but several saw the risk of defla-
tion as having receded somewhat. 

In the household sector, incoming data on retail sales 
were somewhat stronger than expected, and there were 
some reasonably upbeat reports from business contacts 
regarding holiday spending.  Consumer confidence ap-
peared to be improving.  Financial obligations and debt 
service costs had been declining as a share of house-
hold income, and that process was seen as providing 
greater latitude for a pickup in discretionary purchases.  
Nonetheless, there were indications that retail spending 
by middle- and lower-income households had risen less 
than spending by high-income households, suggestive 
of ongoing financial pressures on those of more mod-
est means.  Furthermore, the housing sector, including 
residential construction and home sales, continued to 
be depressed.  Some participants noted that the ele-
vated supply of available homes and the overhang of 
foreclosed homes were contributing to a further decline 
in house prices.  The lower house prices, in turn, were 
seen as reducing household wealth and thus restraining 
growth in consumer spending. 

A number of participants noted that their business con-
tacts had become more optimistic about the outlook 
for sales and production.  Nonetheless, many contacts 
remained cautious about hiring and investment, with 
some reportedly concerned about the potential effects 

of government policies.  The manufacturing, agricul-
ture, and energy sectors showed particular signs of 
strength, and the high-tech sector appeared to be im-
proving.  However, nonresidential construction re-
mained very weak, apart from drilling and mining.  It 
was noted that credit conditions had eased further, al-
though nonfinancial corporations continued to hold 
very high levels of cash. 

Conditions in the labor market appeared to be improv-
ing on balance.  That improvement was reflected in a 
range of recent indicators, including a declining number 
of new jobless claims, an increase in job openings, and 
an uptick in the average workweek.  Nonetheless, par-
ticipants noted that the pace of hiring was still sluggish; 
indeed, the unemployment rate had edged higher in 
November, and the employment-population ratio re-
mained very low. 

Interest rates at intermediate and longer maturities rose 
substantially over the intermeeting period, while credit 
spreads were roughly unchanged and equity prices rose 
moderately.  Participants pointed to a number of fac-
tors that appeared to have contributed to the significant 
backup in yields, including an apparent downward reas-
sessment by investors of the likely ultimate size of the 
Federal Reserve’s asset-purchase program, economic 
data that were seen as suggesting an improved econom-
ic outlook, and the announcement of a package of fis-
cal measures that was expected to bolster economic 
growth and increase the deficit over coming quarters.  
It was noted that the backup in rates may have been 
amplified by year-end positioning, as well as by some 
reported mortgage-related hedging flows.  A number of 
participants indicated that, because the backup in rates 
appeared to importantly reflect changes in investors’ 
expectations about the size of Federal Reserve asset 
purchases, the backup was consistent with purchases 
helping to keep longer-term yields lower than would 
otherwise be the case.  Several meeting participants 
mentioned the communications challenges faced in 
conducting effective policy, including the need to clear-
ly convey the Committee’s views while appropriately 
airing individual perspectives.     

Measures of underlying inflation continued to trend 
downward over the intermeeting period, with the slow-
down in price increases evident across categories of 
goods and services and across different inflation meas-
ures.  Although the prices of some commodities and 
imported goods had risen appreciably, several partici-
pants noted that businesses seemed to have little ability 
to pass these increases on to their customers, given the

significant slack in the economy.  Also, the high level of 
unemployment was limiting gains in wages and thereby 
contributing to the low level of inflation.  TIPS-based 
measures of inflation compensation had risen modestly 
over the intermeeting period, while surveys of house-
holds and professional forecasters continued to suggest 
that longer-term inflation expectations remained stable. 

Regarding their overall outlook for economic activity, 
participants generally agreed that, even with the posi-
tive news received over the intermeeting period, the 
most likely outcome was a gradual pickup in growth 
with slow progress toward maximum employment.  
However, they held a range of views about the risks to 
that outlook.  A few mentioned the possibility that 
growth could pick up more rapidly than expected, par-
ticularly in light of the very accommodative stance of 
monetary policy currently in place.  It was noted that 
such an acceleration would likely be accompanied by 
significantly more rapid growth in bank lending and in 
the monetary aggregates, suggesting that such indica-
tors might prove to be useful sources of information.  
Others pointed to downside risks to growth.  One 
common concern was that the housing sector could 
weaken further in light of the considerable supply of 
houses either on the market or likely to come to mar-
ket.  Another concern was the ongoing deterioration in 
the fiscal position of U.S. states and localities, which 
could lead to sharp cuts in spending and increases in 
taxes.  In addition, participants expressed concerns 
about a possible worsening of the banking and financial 
strains in Europe, which could spill over to U.S. finan-
cial markets and institutions, and so to the broader U.S. 
economy.  They observed that market stresses in Eu-
rope intensified during the intermeeting period, requir-
ing an assistance package for Ireland from the EU and 
the IMF, and that after that package was announced, 
market attention appeared to shift to other European 
countries.  Participants noted, however, that the Euro-
pean authorities were taking steps to stabilize condi-
tions in the euro area.   

Regarding the outlook for inflation, participants gener-
ally anticipated that inflation would remain for some 
time below levels judged to be most consistent, over 
the longer run, with maximum employment and price 
stability.  In particular, most participants expected that 
underlying measures of inflation would bottom out 
around current levels and then move gradually higher 
as the recovery progresses.  A few participants pointed 
to the risk that the ongoing expansion of the Federal 
Reserve’s balance sheet and the sustained low level of 
short-term interest rates could trigger undesirable in-

creases in inflation expectations and so in actual infla-
tion.  To minimize such risks, it was noted that the 
Committee should continue its planning for the even-
tual exit from the current exceptionally accommodative 
stance of policy.  Other participants noted that, with 
substantial resource slack persisting, underlying infla-
tion might fall further below the levels that the Com-
mittee sees as consistent with its mandate.  Nonethe-
less, several participants saw the risk of deflation as 
having receded somewhat over recent months.   

Committee Policy Action  
Members noted that, while incoming information over 
the intermeeting period had increased their confidence 
in the economic recovery, progress toward the Com-
mittee’s dual objectives of maximum employment and 
price stability was disappointingly slow.  In addition, 
members generally expected that progress was likely to 
remain modest, with unemployment and inflation de-
viating from the Committee’s objectives for some time.  
Accordingly, in their discussion of monetary policy for 
the period immediately ahead, nearly all Committee 
members agreed to continue expanding the Federal 
Reserve’s holdings of longer-term securities as an-
nounced in November in order to promote a stronger 
pace of economic recovery and to help ensure that in-
flation, over time, is at levels consistent with the Com-
mittee’s mandate.   The Committee decided to maintain 
its existing policy of reinvesting principal payments 
from its securities holdings into longer-term Treasury 
securities.  In addition, the Committee agreed to con-
tinue buying longer-term Treasury securities with the 
intention of purchasing $600 billion of such securities 
by the end of the second quarter of 2011, a pace of 
about $75 billion per month.  While the economic out-
look was seen as improving, members generally felt 
that the change in the outlook was not sufficient to 
warrant any adjustments to the asset-purchase program, 
and some noted that more time was needed to accumu-
late information on the economy before considering 
any adjustment.  Members emphasized that the pace 
and overall size of the purchase program would be con-
tingent on economic and financial developments; how-
ever, some indicated that they had a fairly high thre-
shold for making changes to the program.  The Com-
mittee also decided to maintain the target range for the 
federal funds rate at 0 to ¼ percent and to reiterate its 
expectation that economic conditions are likely to war-
rant exceptionally low levels for the federal funds rate 
for an extended period.  One member dissented from 
the Committee’s policy decision, judging that, in light 
of the improving economy, a continued high level of

monetary accommodation would increase the risks of 
future economic and financial imbalances.  Members 
agreed that the Committee should continue to regularly 
review the pace of its securities purchases and the 
overall size of the program in light of incoming infor-
mation—including information on the economic out-
look, the efficacy of the program, and any unintended 
consequences that might arise—and make adjustments 
as needed to best foster maximum employment and 
price stability. With respect to the statement to be re-
leased following the meeting, members agreed that only 
small changes were necessary to reflect the modest im-
provement in the near-term economic outlook. 

At the conclusion of the discussion, the Committee 
voted to authorize and direct the Federal Reserve Bank 
of New York, until it was instructed otherwise, to ex-
ecute transactions in the System Account in accordance 
with the following domestic policy directive: 

“The Federal Open Market Committee seeks 
monetary and financial conditions that will 
foster price stability and promote sustainable 
growth in output.  To further its long-run 
objectives, the Committee seeks conditions 
in reserve markets consistent with federal 
funds trading in a range from 0 to ¼ percent.  
The Committee directs the Desk to execute 
purchases of longer-term Treasury securities 
in order to increase the total face value of 
domestic securities held in the System Open 
Market Account to approximately $2.6 tril-
lion by the end of June 2011.  The Commit-
tee also directs the Desk to reinvest principal 
payments from agency debt and agency 
mortgage-backed securities in longer-term 
Treasury securities.  The System Open Mar-
ket Account Manager and the Secretary will 
keep the Committee informed of ongoing 
developments regarding the System’s balance 
sheet that could affect the attainment over 
time of the Committee’s objectives of maxi-
mum employment and price stability.” 

The vote encompassed approval of the statement be-
low to be released at 2:15 p.m.: 

“Information received since the Federal 
Open Market Committee met in November 
confirms that the economic recovery is con-
tinuing, though at a rate that has been insuf-
ficient to bring down unemployment.  
Household spending is increasing at a mod-
erate pace, but remains constrained by high 

unemployment, modest income growth, low-
er housing wealth, and tight credit.  Business 
spending on equipment and software is ris-
ing, though less rapidly than earlier in the 
year, while investment in nonresidential 
structures continues to be weak.  Employers 
remain reluctant to add to payrolls.  The 
housing sector continues to be depressed.  
Longer-term inflation expectations have re-
mained stable, but measures of underlying 
inflation have continued to trend downward.  

Consistent with its statutory mandate, the 
Committee seeks to foster maximum em-
ployment and price stability.  Currently, the 
unemployment rate is elevated, and measures 
of underlying inflation are somewhat low, 
relative to levels that the Committee judges 
to be consistent, over the longer run, with its 
dual mandate.  Although the Committee an-
ticipates a gradual return to higher levels of 
resource utilization in a context of price sta-
bility, progress toward its objectives has been 
disappointingly slow.  

To promote a stronger pace of economic re-
covery and to help ensure that inflation, over 
time, is at levels consistent with its mandate, 
the Committee decided today to continue 
expanding its holdings of securities as an-
nounced in November.  The Committee will 
maintain its existing policy of reinvesting 
principal payments from its securities hold-
ings.  In addition, the Committee intends to 
purchase $600 billion of longer-term Treas-
ury securities by the end of the second quar-
ter of 2011, a pace of about $75 billion per 
month.  The Committee will regularly review 
the pace of its securities purchases and the 
overall size of the asset-purchase program in 
light of incoming information and will adjust 
the program as needed to best foster maxi-
mum employment and price stability.  

The Committee will maintain the target 
range for the federal funds rate at 0 to         
¼ percent and continues to anticipate that 
economic conditions, including low rates of 
resource utilization, subdued inflation trends, 
and stable inflation expectations, are likely to 
warrant exceptionally low levels for the fed-
eral funds rate for an extended period.

The Committee will continue to monitor the 
economic outlook and financial develop-
ments and will employ its policy tools as ne-
cessary to support the economic recovery 
and to help ensure that inflation, over time, 
is at levels consistent with its mandate.” 

Voting for this action:  Ben Bernanke, William C. 
Dudley, James Bullard, Elizabeth Duke, Sandra Pianal-
to, Sarah Bloom Raskin, Eric Rosengren, Daniel K. 
Tarullo, Kevin Warsh, and Janet L. Yellen. 

Voting against this action:  Thomas M. Hoenig. 

Mr. Hoenig dissented because he judged that economic 
conditions were improving, and that the current highly 
accommodative stance of monetary policy was incon-
sistent with the Committee’s long-run mandate.  Mr. 
Hoenig noted that the economic recovery was shifting 
from transitory to more sustainable sources of growth 
and was picking up momentum.  In his assessment, 
maintaining highly accommodative monetary policy in 
the current economic environment would increase the 
risk of future imbalances and, over time, cause an in-
crease in longer-term inflation expectations.  Mr. Hoen-
ig also was concerned that the eventual orderly reduc-

tion of policy accommodation would become more 
difficult the longer the first step in that process was 
delayed.  In Mr. Hoenig’s view, the Committee should 
begin preparing markets for a reduction in policy ac-
commodation.  Accordingly, he thought the press 
statement should indicate that sufficient monetary stim-
ulus was in place to support the recovery.  

It was agreed that the next meeting of the Committee 
would be held on Tuesday–Wednesday, January 25–26, 
2011.  The meeting adjourned at 12:55 p.m. on De-
cember 14, 2010. 

Notation Vote 
By notation vote completed on November 22, 2010, 
the Committee unanimously approved the minutes of 
the FOMC meeting held on November 2–3, 2010.
