Developments in Financial Markets and the Fed-
eral Reserve’s Balance Sheet 
The Manager of the System Open Market Account 
(SOMA) reported on developments in domestic and 
foreign financial markets during the period since the 
Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) met on No-
vember 1–2, 2011.  He also reported on System open 
market operations, including the ongoing reinvestment 
into agency-guaranteed mortgage-backed securities 
(MBS) of principal payments received on SOMA hold-
ings of agency debt and agency-guaranteed MBS as well 
as the operations related to the maturity extension pro-
gram authorized at the September 20–21 FOMC meet-
ing.  By unanimous vote, the Committee ratified the 
Desk’s domestic transactions over the intermeeting 
period.  There were no intervention operations in for-
eign currencies for the System’s account over the in-
termeeting period. 

Staff Review of the Economic Situation 
The information reviewed at the December 13 meeting 
indicated that U.S. economic activity expanded mod-
erately despite some apparent slowing in the growth of 
foreign economies and strains in global financial mar-
kets.  Conditions in the labor market seemed to have 
improved somewhat, while overall consumer price in-
flation continued to be more modest than earlier in the 
year and measures of long-run inflation expectations 
remained stable. 

The unemployment rate dropped to 8.6 percent in No-
vember, and private nonfarm employment continued to 
increase moderately during the past two months.  Nev-
ertheless, employment at state and local governments 
declined further, and both long-duration unemploy-
ment and the share of workers employed part time for 
economic reasons remained elevated.  Initial claims for 
unemployment insurance moved down, on net, since 
early November but were still at a level consistent with 
only modest employment gains, and indicators of job 
openings and businesses’ hiring plans were little 
changed. 

Industrial production rose in October, reflecting in part 
a rebound in motor vehicle production from the effects 
of supply chain disruptions earlier in the year.  Factory 
output outside of the motor vehicle sector also contin-
ued to rise, and the rate of manufacturing capacity utili-
zation moved up.  However, motor vehicle assemblies 
were scheduled to only edge higher, on balance, in the 
coming months, and broader indicators of manufactur-
ing activity, such as the diffusion indexes of new orders 
from the national and regional manufacturing surveys, 
were at levels that suggested only modest increases in 
production in the near term. 

Revised estimates indicated that households’ real dis-
posable income declined in the second and third quar-
ters, and the net wealth of households decreased in the 
third quarter.  Nonetheless, overall real personal con-
sumption expenditures (PCE) rose modestly in Octo-
ber following significant gains in the previous month, 
as spending for consumer goods continued to increase 
at a strong pace while outlays for consumer services 
were roughly flat.  In November, nominal retail sales, 
excluding purchases at motor vehicle and parts outlets, 
expanded further, and sales of light motor vehicles 
stepped up.  But consumer sentiment was still at a sub-
dued level in early December despite some improve-
ment in recent months. 

Activity in the housing market continued to be de-
pressed by the substantial inventory of foreclosed and 
distressed properties and by weak demand that reflect-
ed tight credit conditions for mortgage loans and un-
certainty about future home prices.  Starts and permits 
for new single-family homes in October stayed around 
the low levels that prevailed since the middle of last 
year.  Sales of new and existing homes remained slow 
in recent months, and home prices moved down fur-
ther. 

Real business spending on equipment and software 
seemed to be decelerating.  Nominal orders and ship-

Page 2 Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________



ments of nondefense capital goods excluding aircraft 
edged down in October, and the slowing accumulation 
of unfilled orders suggested that increases in outlays for 
business equipment would be muted in subsequent 
months.  Also, survey measures of business conditions 
and sentiment remained at relatively downbeat levels in 
November.  Real business spending for nonresidential 
construction moved up in October but was still at a 
low level, reflecting high vacancy rates and restricted 
credit conditions for construction loans.  Inventories in 
most industries looked to be reasonably well aligned 
with sales, although motor vehicle stocks continued to 
be lean. 

In the government sector, real federal defense purchas-
es appeared to have stepped down in October and No-
vember from their level in the third quarter.  At the 
state and local level, real purchases seemed to be de-
creasing at a slower pace in recent months than earlier 
in the year. 

The U.S. international trade deficit narrowed in Octo-
ber, as imports decreased more than exports.  Declines 
in imports of petroleum products (reflecting lower 
prices and lesser volumes), non-oil industrial supplies, 
and automotive products more than offset increases in 
capital goods, consumer goods, and food.  Reductions 
in exports of industrial supplies and consumer goods, 
led by a few particularly volatile components, out-
weighed the gains in capital goods. 

Inflation continued to decrease relative to earlier in the 
year.  Indeed, the PCE price index edged down in Oc-
tober.  Consumer prices for energy decreased, and sur-
vey data indicated that gasoline prices declined further 
in November.  Increases in consumer food prices in 
October were substantially slower than the average 
pace in the preceding months of this year.  Consumer 
prices excluding food and energy also continued to rise 
at a more modest pace in October than earlier in the 
year.  Near-term inflation expectations from the Thom-
son Reuters/University of Michigan Surveys of Con-
sumers declined in early December, and longer-term 
inflation expectations remained stable. 

Measures of labor compensation indicated that nominal 
wage gains continued to be subdued.  Compensation 
per hour in the nonfarm business sector increased 
moderately over the year ending in the third quarter, 
while the 12-month change in average hourly earnings 
for all employees remained low in October and No-
vember.  Unit labor costs edged up over the past four 
quarters. 

Foreign economic growth, especially in the euro area, 
appeared to weaken in recent months.  Real gross do-
mestic product (GDP) in the euro area barely edged up 
in the third quarter.  Moreover, industrial production in 
the region fell sharply in September, and indicators of 
manufacturing activity in October and November 
pointed to lower output.  Measures of business and 
consumer confidence in the euro area continued to 
decline in recent months.  In other advanced foreign 
economies, real GDP in Japan rebounded in the third 
quarter from the effects of the earthquake in March, 
and real GDP recovered in Canada as oil production 
picked up after several months of shutdowns; however, 
available indicators of manufacturing activity in both of 
these economies pointed to declines during the fourth 
quarter.  Among emerging market economies, real 
GDP in Brazil was flat in the third quarter, while ex-
ports from China slowed in recent months, although 
Chinese domestic demand appeared to remain strong. 

Staff Review of the Financial Situation 
The risks associated with the fiscal and financial diffi-
culties in Europe remained the focus of attention in 
financial markets over the intermeeting period and con-
tributed to heightened volatility in a wide range of asset 
markets.  Investor concerns about developments in 
Europe intensified early in the period but subsequently 
eased a bit amid signs that European authorities were 
moving toward agreement on a comprehensive frame-
work to address fiscal and financial vulnerabilities and 
after the Federal Reserve and five other major central 
banks announced enhanced currency swap arrange-
ments, including lower charges on existing dollar liquid-
ity swap lines.  Nevertheless, investors appeared to re-
main cautious. 

Yields on nominal Treasury securities were little 
changed following the release of the November FOMC 
statement.  Over the following weeks, movements in 
yields were reportedly driven by shifts in investors’ as-
sessments of the European situation and by U.S. eco-
nomic data that were somewhat stronger than they ex-
pected.  Both short-term nominal Treasury yields and 
the expected path of the federal funds rate implied by 
money market futures quotes were essentially un-
changed, on balance, over the intermeeting period, 
while longer-dated Treasury yields ended the period 
slightly higher.  Yields on current-coupon agency MBS 
also ended the period about unchanged.  Indicators of 
inflation expectations derived from nominal and infla-
tion-protected Treasury securities posted mixed 
changes, on net, over the period and remained at the 
low end of their recent ranges. 

Minutes of the Meeting of December 13, 2011 Page 3_____________________________________________________________________________________________



Early in the intermeeting period, conditions in short-
term wholesale funding markets appeared to deteriorate 
somewhat.  Following the six major central banks’ cur-
rency swap announcement, some measures of short-
term funding costs moderated, but they remained ele-
vated.  In dollar funding markets, the spread of the 
three-month London interbank offered rate (Libor) 
over the overnight index swap (OIS) rate of the same 
maturity widened noticeably during the intermeeting 
period.  Some European financial institutions reported-
ly faced significant pressures in unsecured dollar fund-
ing markets.  By contrast, in secured funding markets, 
spreads on asset-backed commercial paper were rela-
tively steady for U.S. and most European-based issuers, 
and rates on repurchase agreements across various 
types of collateral were stable. 

In the December 2011 Senior Credit Officer Opinion 
Survey on Dealer Financing Terms, dealers reported a 
moderate tightening of credit terms over the preceding 
three months on securities financing transactions and 
over-the-counter derivatives markets trades, particularly 
for financial counterparties.  Dealers also noted that 
demand for funding all types of securities decreased 
over the same reference period. 

Credit default swap (CDS) spreads and equity prices of 
large U.S. banking organizations remained volatile over 
the intermeeting period.  While the S&P 500 index 
ended the period slightly higher, on net, equity prices 
for most major U.S. banking firms were lower and their 
CDS spreads widened.  CDS spreads for European 
banks remained elevated as these institutions faced in-
creasingly strained conditions in short-term funding 
markets.  In the wake of the bankruptcy of MF Global, 
market participants also expressed renewed concerns 
about securities dealers that rely heavily on short-term 
wholesale funding markets, particularly those institu-
tions not affiliated with commercial banking institu-
tions. 

Yields on investment-grade and speculative-grade cor-
porate bonds rose, on balance, over the period, and 
their spreads over yields on comparable-maturity Treas-
ury securities were somewhat wider.  The debt of non-
financial firms increased in November, with corporate 
bond issuance particularly robust, as some firms re-
portedly were eager to issue bonds before year-end.  
Nonfinancial commercial paper outstanding and com-
mercial and industrial loans continued to expand at a 
moderate pace.  In the leveraged loan market, the ex-
tension of loans stepped up somewhat in November 

but remained sluggish relative to its average pace earlier 
in the year. 

Financing conditions for commercial real estate ap-
peared to remain strained over the intermeeting period.  
Issuance of commercial mortgage-backed securities 
(CMBS) was light amid deteriorating liquidity condi-
tions in the CMBS market.  Prices of most types of 
commercial properties continued to be depressed, 
while both vacancy rates and delinquency rates for 
commercial properties stayed close to their recent 
highs. 

Interest rates on residential mortgages were little 
changed, on net, over the intermeeting period and re-
mained at historically low levels.  But low mortgage 
rates appeared to have only modest effects on the rate 
of mortgage refinancing, likely because of tight under-
writing standards and low levels of home equity.  Indi-
cators of home prices and the credit quality of older 
mortgage loans remained weak.  The rate of newly de-
linquent prime mortgages—the pace at which mortgag-
es transition from “current” to delinquent—seemed to 
have slowed,  but overall delinquency rates on residen-
tial mortgages remained elevated.  Market reaction to 
the announcements by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac 
on November 15 regarding the expansion of the Home 
Affordable Refinance Program was limited. 

Consumer credit rose slightly in the third quarter.  The 
aggregate volume of credit card solicitations in recent 
months remained at levels comparable to those before 
the financial crisis in 2008, though the volume sent to 
low-income households was still well below the levels 
at that time.  Meanwhile, consumer credit quality im-
proved further in recent months, with delinquency 
rates on credit card loans declining nearly to historical 
lows and delinquency rates on nonrevolving credit at 
commercial banks retreating to pre-crisis levels.  Is-
suance of consumer credit asset-backed securities in-
creased substantially in November. 

M2 expanded at a solid pace in November, likely re-
flecting increased demand for safe and liquid assets, 
given concerns over European financial developments.  
In part, offshore deposits, which are no longer ex-
cluded from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corpora-
tion assessment base, appeared to be shifting to on-
shore offices.  In contrast, the monetary base declined 
in November.  Although currency increased at a robust 
pace, reserve balances declined by more, reflecting a 
temporary decrease in the size of the SOMA as a result 
of lags in the settlement of MBS reinvestment transac-
tions.

Over most of November, yields on many euro-area 
sovereign bonds—including those of Italy, Spain, Bel-
gium, and France—along with yields on debt issued by 
the European Financial Stability Facility, rose sharply 
relative to the yield on German government bonds.  
But these spreads subsequently narrowed in anticipa-
tion of the European Union (EU) summit meeting on 
December 9 and in reaction to the swap announcement 
by the Federal Reserve and the other central banks on 
November 30.  Near the end of the period, sovereign 
spreads widened again amid market participants’ appar-
ent concerns that the actions announced at the EU 
summit would prove to be less effective than they pre-
viously had anticipated.  Spreads of yields on most pe-
ripheral euro-area countries’ debt over yields on Ger-
man debt ended the period higher on net.  German 
sovereign yields increased as well. 

Implied basis spreads from the foreign exchange swap 
market rose substantially over November, but reversed 
a portion of that increase immediately following the 
central banks’ swap announcement.  Against the back-
ground of higher dollar funding costs in the market and 
the reduction in the charge on dollar liquidity swaps, 
demand at the tender by the European Central Bank 
(ECB) of three-month dollar liquidity in December 
jumped to more than $50 billion from less than      
$500 million at the November auction.  Euro funding 
pressures also moved higher over the period, with euro 
Libor–OIS spreads continuing to rise.  In addition, ma-
turities for repurchase agreements involving sovereign 
bonds of euro-area countries other than Germany re-
portedly shortened.  Several European banks an-
nounced large declines in third-quarter profits, in part 
reflecting write-downs of their holdings of Greek sov-
ereign debt.  Equity prices in both advanced and 
emerging market economies fluctuated widely, with 
advanced country equities little changed, on net, and 
emerging market equities ending the period lower.  The 
foreign exchange value of the dollar appreciated, on 
balance, over the intermeeting period. 

With inflationary pressures waning and the downside 
risks to the global economic outlook increasing, some 
central banks eased policy.  China’s central bank cut its 
reserve requirements by 50 basis points, and the central 
bank of Brazil lowered its policy rate by the same 
amount.  The ECB reduced its minimum bid rate by  
25 basis points at both its November and December 
meetings, relaxed its collateral and reserve require-
ments, and stated that it would begin to offer three-
year funds at fixed rates.  As a precautionary measure, 
the Bank of England announced a new liquidity facility 

that will auction term sterling funds against a wide 
range of collateral. 

Staff Economic Outlook 
In the economic forecast prepared for the December 
FOMC meeting, the staff’s projection for the increase 
in real GDP in the near term was little changed, as the 
recent data on spending, production, and the labor 
market were, on balance, in line with the staff’s expec-
tations at the time of the previous forecast.  However, 
the medium-term projection for real GDP growth in 
the December forecast was lower than the one pre-
sented in November, primarily reflecting revisions to 
the staff’s view regarding developments in Europe and 
their implications for the U.S. economy.  Nonetheless, 
the staff continued to project that the pace of econom-
ic activity would pick up gradually in 2012 and 2013, 
supported by accommodative monetary policy, further 
increases in credit availability, and improvements in 
consumer and business sentiment.  Over the forecast 
period, the gains in real GDP were anticipated to be 
sufficient to reduce the slack in product and labor mar-
kets only slowly, and the unemployment rate was ex-
pected to remain elevated at the end of 2013. 

The staff’s projection for inflation was little changed 
from the forecast prepared for the November FOMC 
meeting.  The upward pressure on consumer prices 
from the increases in commodity and import prices 
earlier in the year was expected to continue to subside 
in the current quarter.  With long-run inflation expecta-
tions stable and substantial slack in labor and product 
markets anticipated to persist over the forecast period, 
the staff continued to project that inflation would be 
subdued in 2012 and 2013. 

Participants’ Views on Current Conditions and the 
Economic Outlook 
In their discussion of the economic situation and out-
look, meeting participants agreed that the information 
received since their previous meeting indicated that 
economic activity was expanding at a moderate rate, 
notwithstanding some apparent slowing in global eco-
nomic growth.  Consumer spending continued to ad-
vance, but business fixed investment appeared to be 
decelerating, and home sales and construction re-
mained at very low levels.  Labor market conditions 
improved some in recent months, but the unemploy-
ment rate remained elevated despite a noticeable drop 
in November.  Inflation moderated from the rates ear-
lier in the year, and longer-term inflation expectations 
remained stable. 

Minutes of the Meeting of December 13, 2011 Page 5_____________________________________________________________________________________________



Regarding the economic outlook, participants contin-
ued to anticipate that economic activity would expand 
at a moderate rate in the coming quarters and that, 
consequently, the unemployment rate would decline 
only gradually.  The factors that participants cited as 
likely to restrain the pace of the economic expansion 
included an expectation that financial markets would 
remain unsettled until the fiscal and banking issues in 
the euro area were more fully addressed.  Other factors 
that were expected to weigh on the pace of economic 
activity were the slowdown of economic activity 
abroad, fiscal tightening in the United States, high lev-
els of uncertainty among households and businesses, 
the weak housing market, and household deleveraging.  
In assessing the economic outlook, participants judged 
that strains in global financial markets continued to 
pose significant downside risks.  With the rate of in-
crease in economic activity anticipated to remain mod-
erate, most participants expected that inflation would 
settle over coming quarters at or below levels consis-
tent with their estimates of its longer-run mandate-
consistent rate. 

In discussing the household sector, meeting partici-
pants generally commented that consumer spending in 
recent months had been stronger than expected, and 
several reported cautious optimism among some of 
their business contacts about prospects for the holiday 
shopping season.  A few participants thought that the 
recent strength in motor vehicle sales and other con-
sumer spending could reflect pent-up demand from 
households for goods and services, and so thought that 
it might persist for a time.  However, others noted that 
real disposable personal income had weakened and that 
households remained pessimistic about their income 
prospects and uncertain about the economic outlook.  
As a result, a number of those participants suggested 
that the recent stronger pace of consumer spending 
might not be sustained.  Moreover, some participants 
mentioned that households were likely still adjusting to 
the loss of wealth over the past few years, which would 
weigh on consumer spending going forward.  Partici-
pants generally saw few signs of recovery in the hous-
ing market, with house prices continuing to decline in 
most areas and the overhang of foreclosed and dis-
tressed properties still substantial.  Several participants 
observed that the ongoing weakness in the housing 
market came despite low borrowing rates and govern-
ment initiatives to resolve problems in the foreclosure 
process.  However, one participant noted that some 
homebuilders were reporting that land prices were edg-
ing up and that financing was available from nontradi-

tional sources, suggesting that conditions in the hous-
ing market could be improving.  

Reports from business contacts indicated that, in addi-
tion to the rise in consumer spending, activity in the 
manufacturing, energy, and agriculture sectors contin-
ued to advance in recent months.  Nonetheless, busi-
nesses generally reported that they remained cautious 
regarding capital spending and hiring because of a high 
level of uncertainty about the economic outlook and 
the political environment.  In particular, some contacts 
raised concerns about the uncertain fiscal outlook in 
the United States or the possible drag on sales and pro-
duction from an economic slowdown abroad, while 
others cited uncertainty about the cost implications of 
potential changes in regulatory policies.  Several partic-
ipants noted that their contacts had ready access to 
credit at attractive rates.  However, some participants 
continued to view credit as tight, particularly in mort-
gage markets or among small businesses in their Dis-
tricts that were facing difficulties meeting collateral re-
quirements and obtaining bank loans. 

A number of recent indicators showed some improve-
ment in labor market conditions:  Payroll employment 
had posted moderate gains for five months, new claims 
for unemployment insurance had drifted lower, and the 
unemployment rate had turned down.  One participant 
noted that the series of upward revisions to the initial 
estimates of payroll employment in recent months was 
an encouraging sign of sustained hiring, although sev-
eral participants remarked that they saw the labor mar-
ket as still improving only slowly.  Others indicated that 
because part of the recent decline in the jobless rate 
was associated with a reduction in labor force participa-
tion, the drop in the unemployment rate likely over-
stated the overall improvement in the labor market.  
Moreover, unemployment, particularly longer-term 
unemployment, remained high, and the number of in-
voluntary part-time workers was still elevated.  Some 
participants again expressed concern that the persis-
tence of high levels of long-duration unemployment 
and the underutilization of the workforce could even-
tually lead to a loss of skills and an erosion of potential 
output.  Another participant suggested that the unem-
ployment rate was a more useful indicator of cyclical 
labor market developments than the level of employ-
ment relative to the size of the population, which was 
more likely to be influenced by structural changes in 
labor demand and supply.  Participants expressed a 
range of views on the current extent of slack in the la-
bor market.  It was noted that because of factors in-
cluding ongoing changes in the composition of availa-

Page 6 Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________



ble jobs and workers’ skills, some part of the increase in 
unemployment since the beginning of the recession had 
been structural rather than cyclical.  Others pointed out 
that the very modest increases in labor compensation 
of late suggested that underutilization of labor was still 
significant. 

Meeting participants observed that financial markets 
remained volatile over the intermeeting period in large 
part because of developments in Europe.  Participants 
noted the recent moves by the European authorities to 
strengthen their commitment to fiscal discipline and to 
provide greater resources to backstop sovereign debt 
issuance.  But many anticipated that further efforts to 
implement and perhaps to augment these policies 
would be necessary to fully resolve the area’s fiscal and 
financial problems and commented that financial mar-
kets would remain focused on the situation in Europe 
as it evolves.  It was noted that the changes to the cen-
tral bank currency swap lines announced in late No-
vember helped to ease dollar funding conditions facing 
European institutions, but such conditions were still 
strained.  However, participants generally saw little evi-
dence of significant new constraints on credit availabili-
ty for domestic borrowers.  The balance sheets of most 
U.S. banks appeared to have improved somewhat, and 
domestic banks reported increases in commercial lend-
ing, even as some European lenders were pulling back.  
Several participants commented on strains affecting 
some community banks, which reportedly had led to 
tighter credit conditions for their small business clients. 

Participants observed that inflation had moderated in 
recent months as the effects of the earlier run-up in 
commodity prices subsided.  Retail prices of gasoline 
had declined, and prices of non-oil imported goods had 
softened.  In addition, labor compensation had risen 
only slowly, and productivity continued to rise.  Some 
business contacts suggested that pricing pressures had 
diminished.  Longer-run inflation expectations were 
still well anchored.  Most participants anticipated that 
inflation would continue to moderate.  Although some 
energy prices had recently increased, many participants 
judged that the favorable trends in commodity prices 
might persist in the near term, particularly in light of 
softer global activity, and one noted that expanded 
crop production, if realized, would hold down agricul-
tural prices.  More broadly, many participants judged 
that the moderate expansion in economic activity that 
they were projecting and the associated gradual reduc-
tion in the current wide margins of slack in labor and 
product markets would be consistent with subdued 
inflation going forward.  Indeed, some expressed the 

concern that, with the persistence of considerable re-
source slack, inflation might run below mandate-
consistent levels for some time.  However, a couple of 
participants noted that the rate of inflation over the 
past year had not fallen as much as would be expected 
if the gap in resource utilization were large, suggesting 
that the level of potential output was lower than some 
current estimates.  Some participants were concerned 
that inflation could rise as the recovery continued, and 
some business contacts had reported that producers 
expected to see an increase in pricing power over time.  
A few participants argued that maintaining a highly 
accommodative stance of monetary policy over the 
medium run would erode the stability of inflation ex-
pectations. 

Committee Policy Action 
Members viewed the information on U.S. economic 
activity received over the intermeeting period as sug-
gesting that the economy was expanding moderately.  
While overall labor market conditions had improved 
some in recent months, the unemployment rate re-
mained elevated relative to levels that the Committee 
anticipated would prevail in the longer run.  Inflation 
had moderated, and longer-term inflation expectations 
remained stable.  However, available indicators pointed 
to some slowing in the pace of economic growth in 
Europe and in some emerging market economies.  
Members continued to expect a moderate pace of eco-
nomic growth over coming quarters, with the unem-
ployment rate declining only gradually toward levels 
consistent with the Committee’s dual mandate.  Strains 
in global financial markets continued to pose significant 
downside risks to economic activity.  Members also 
anticipated that inflation would settle, over coming 
quarters, at levels at or below those consistent with the 
dual mandate. 

In their discussion of monetary policy for the period 
ahead, Committee members generally agreed that their 
overall assessments of the economic outlook had not 
changed greatly since their previous meeting.  As a re-
sult, almost all members agreed to maintain the existing 
stance of monetary policy at this meeting.  In particular, 
they agreed to continue the program of extending the 
average maturity of the Federal Reserve’s holdings of 
securities as announced in September, to retain the ex-
isting policies regarding the reinvestment of principal 
payments from Federal Reserve holdings of securities, 
and to keep the target range for the federal funds rate 
at 0 to ¼  percent.  With regard to the forward guid-
ance to be included in the statement to be released fol-
lowing the meeting, several members noted that the

reference to mid-2013 might need to be adjusted be-
fore long.  A number of members noted their dissatis-
faction with the Committee’s current approach for 
communicating its views regarding the appropriate path 
for monetary policy, and looked forward to considering 
possible enhancements to the Committee’s communi-
cations.  For now, however, the Committee agreed to 
reiterate its anticipation that economic conditions—
including low rates of resource utilization and a sub-
dued outlook for inflation over the medium run—are 
likely to warrant exceptionally low levels for the federal 
funds rate at least through mid-2013.  A number of 
members indicated that current and prospective eco-
nomic conditions could well warrant additional policy 
accommodation, but they believed that any additional 
actions would be more effective if accompanied by en-
hanced communication about the Committee’s longer-
run economic goals and policy framework.  A few oth-
ers continued to judge that maintaining the current de-
gree of policy accommodation beyond the near term 
would likely be inappropriate given their outlook for 
economic activity and inflation, or questioned the effi-
cacy of additional monetary policy actions in light of 
the nonmonetary headwinds restraining the recovery.  
For this meeting, almost all members were willing to 
support maintaining the existing policy stance while 
emphasizing the importance of carefully monitoring 
economic developments given the uncertainties and 
risks attending the outlook.  One member preferred to 
undertake additional accommodation at this meeting 
and dissented from the policy decision. 

With respect to the statement, members agreed that 
only relatively small modifications were needed to re-
flect the modest changes to economic conditions seen 
in the recent data and to note that the Committee 
would continue to implement its policy steps from re-
cent meetings. 

At the conclusion of the discussion, the Committee 
voted to authorize and direct the Federal Reserve Bank 
of New York, until it was instructed otherwise, to ex-
ecute transactions in the System Account in accordance 
with the following domestic policy directive: 

“The Federal Open Market Committee seeks 
monetary and financial conditions that will 
foster price stability and promote sustainable 
growth in output.  To further its long-run 
objectives, the Committee seeks conditions 
in reserve markets consistent with federal 
funds trading in a range from 0 to ¼ percent.  
The Committee directs the Desk to continue 

the maturity extension program it began in 
September to purchase, by the end of June 
2012, Treasury securities with remaining ma-
turities of approximately 6 years to 30 years 
with a total face value of $400 billion, and to 
sell Treasury securities with remaining matur-
ities of 3 years or less with a total face value 
of $400 billion.  The Committee also directs 
the Desk to maintain its existing policies of 
rolling over maturing Treasury securities into 
new issues and of reinvesting principal pay-
ments on all agency debt and agency mort-
gage-backed securities in the System Open 
Market Account in agency mortgage-backed 
securities in order to maintain the total face 
value of domestic securities at approximately 
$2.6 trillion.  The Committee directs the 
Desk to engage in dollar roll transactions as 
necessary to facilitate settlement of the Fed-
eral Reserve’s agency MBS transactions.  The 
System Open Market Account Manager and 
the Secretary will keep the Committee in-
formed of ongoing developments regarding 
the System’s balance sheet that could affect 
the attainment over time of the Committee’s 
objectives of maximum employment and 
price stability.” 

The vote encompassed approval of the statement be-
low to be released at 2:15 p.m.: 

“Information received since the Federal 
Open Market Committee met in November 
suggests that the economy has been expand-
ing moderately, notwithstanding some ap-
parent slowing in global growth.  While indi-
cators point to some improvement in overall 
labor market conditions, the unemployment 
rate remains elevated.  Household spending 
has continued to advance, but business fixed 
investment appears to be increasing less rap-
idly and the housing sector remains de-
pressed.  Inflation has moderated since earli-
er in the year, and longer-term inflation ex-
pectations have remained stable. 

Consistent with its statutory mandate, the 
Committee seeks to foster maximum em-
ployment and price stability.  The Committee 
continues to expect a moderate pace of eco-
nomic growth over coming quarters and 
consequently anticipates that the unemploy-
ment rate will decline only gradually toward

levels that the Committee judges to be con-
sistent with its dual mandate.  Strains in 
global financial markets continue to pose 
significant downside risks to the economic 
outlook.  The Committee also anticipates 
that inflation will settle, over coming quar-
ters, at levels at or below those consistent 
with the Committee’s dual mandate.  How-
ever, the Committee will continue to pay 
close attention to the evolution of inflation 
and inflation expectations. 

To support a stronger economic recovery 
and to help ensure that inflation, over time, 
is at levels consistent with the dual mandate, 
the Committee decided today to continue its 
program to extend the average maturity of its 
holdings of securities as announced in Sep-
tember.  The Committee is maintaining its 
existing policies of reinvesting principal 
payments from its holdings of agency debt 
and agency mortgage-backed securities in 
agency mortgage-backed securities and of 
rolling over maturing Treasury securities at 
auction.  The Committee will regularly re-
view the size and composition of its securi-
ties holdings and is prepared to adjust those 
holdings as appropriate. 

The Committee also decided to keep the tar-
get range for the federal funds rate at 0 to   
¼ percent and currently anticipates that eco-
nomic conditions—including low rates of re-
source utilization and a subdued outlook for 
inflation over the medium run—are likely to 
warrant exceptionally low levels for the fed-
eral funds rate at least through mid-2013.   

The Committee will continue to assess the 
economic outlook in light of incoming in-
formation and is prepared to employ its tools 
to promote a stronger economic recovery in 
a context of price stability.” 

Voting for this action:  Ben Bernanke, William C. 
Dudley, Elizabeth Duke, Richard W. Fisher, Narayana 
Kocherlakota, Charles I. Plosser, Sarah Bloom Raskin, 
Daniel K. Tarullo, and Janet L. Yellen. 

Voting against this action:  Charles L. Evans. 

Mr. Evans dissented because he continued to view ad-
ditional policy accommodation as appropriate in cir-
cumstances where his outlook was for growth to be too 
slow to make sufficient progress in reducing the unem-

ployment rate and for inflation to drop below levels 
consistent with the Committee’s dual mandate.  He 
continued to support the use of more-explicit forward 
guidance about the economic conditions under which 
the federal funds rate could be maintained in its current 
range, and he suggested that the Committee also con-
sider additional asset purchases. 

Monetary Policy Communications 
After the Committee’s vote, participants turned to a 
further consideration of ways in which the Committee 
might enhance the clarity and transparency of its public 
communications.  The subcommittee on communica-
tions recommended an approach for incorporating in-
formation about participants’ projections of appropri-
ate future monetary policy into the Summary of Eco-
nomic Projections (SEP), which the FOMC releases 
four times each year.  In the SEP, participants’ projec-
tions for economic growth, unemployment, and infla-
tion are conditioned on their individual assessments of 
the path of monetary policy that is most likely to be 
consistent with the Federal Reserve’s statutory mandate 
to promote maximum employment and price stability, 
but information about those assessments has not been 
included in the SEP. 

A staff briefing described the details of the subcommit-
tee’s recommended approach and compared it with 
those taken by several other central banks.  Most par-
ticipants agreed that adding their projections of the 
target federal funds rate to the economic projections 
already provided in the SEP would help the public bet-
ter understand the Committee’s monetary policy deci-
sions and the ways in which those decisions depend on 
members’ assessments of economic and financial con-
ditions.  One participant suggested that the economic 
projections would be more understandable if they were 
based on a common interest rate path.  Another sug-
gested that it would be preferable to publish a consen-
sus policy projection of the entire Committee.  Some 
participants expressed concern that publishing informa-
tion about participants’ individual policy projections 
could confuse the public; for example, they saw an ap-
preciable risk that the public could mistakenly interpret 
participants’ projections of the target federal funds rate 
as signaling the Committee’s intention to follow a spe-
cific policy path rather than as indicating members’ 
conditional projections for the federal funds rate given 
their expectations regarding future economic develop-
ments.  Most participants viewed these concerns as 
manageable; several noted that participants would have 
opportunities to explain their projections and policy 
views in speeches and other forms of communication.

Nonetheless, some participants did not see providing 
policy projections as a useful step at this time. 

At the conclusion of their discussion, participants de-
cided to incorporate information about their projec-
tions of appropriate monetary policy into the SEP be-
ginning in January.  Specifically, the SEP will include 
information about participants’ projections of the ap-
propriate level of the target federal funds rate in the 
fourth quarter of the current year and the next few ca-
lendar years, and over the longer run; the SEP also will 
report participants’ current projections of the likely 
timing of the first increase in the target rate given their 
projections of future economic conditions.  An accom-
panying narrative will describe the key factors underly-
ing those assessments as well as qualitative information 
regarding participants’ expectations for the Federal Re-
serve’s balance sheet.  A number of participants sug-
gested further enhancements to the SEP; the Chairman 
asked the subcommittee to explore such enhancements 
over coming months. 

Following up on the Committee’s discussion of policy 
frameworks at its November meeting, the subcommit-
tee on communications presented a draft statement of 
the Committee’s longer-run goals and policy strategy.  
Participants generally agreed that issuing such a state-
ment could be helpful in enhancing the transparency 
and accountability of monetary policy and in facilitating 
well-informed decisionmaking by households and busi-
nesses, and thus in enhancing the Committee’s ability 
to promote the goals specified in its statutory mandate 
in the face of significant economic disturbances.  How-
ever, a couple of participants expressed the concern 
that a statement that was sufficiently nuanced to cap-
ture the diversity of views on the Committee might not, 
in fact, enhance public understanding of the Commit-
tee’s actions and intentions.  Participants commented 
on the draft statement, and the Chairman encouraged 
the subcommittee to make adjustments to the draft and 
to present a revised version for the Committee’s fur-
ther consideration in January. 

It was agreed that the next meeting of the Committee 
would be held on Tuesday–Wednesday, January 24–25, 
2012.  The meeting adjourned at 4:00 p.m. on Decem-
ber 13, 2011. 

Videoconference Meeting of November 28 
On November 28, 2011, the Committee met by video-
conference to discuss a proposal to amend and aug-
ment the Federal Reserve’s temporary liquidity swap 
arrangements with foreign central banks in light of 
strains in global financial markets.  The proposal in-

cluded a six-month extension of the sunset date and a 
50 basis point reduction in the pricing on the existing 
liquidity swap arrangements with the Bank of Canada, 
the Bank of England, the Bank of Japan, the ECB, and 
the Swiss National Bank, as well as the establishment, 
as a contingency measure, of swap arrangements that 
would allow the Federal Reserve to provide liquidity in 
the currencies of the foreign central banks should the 
need arise.  The proposal was aimed at helping to ease 
strains in financial markets and thereby to mitigate the 
effects of such strains on the supply of credit to U.S. 
households and businesses, in support of the economic 
recovery. 

The staff provided briefings on financial and economic 
developments in Europe.  In recent weeks, financial 
markets appeared to have become increasingly con-
cerned that a timely resolution of the European sov-
ereign debt situation might not occur despite the meas-
ures that authorities there announced in October; pres-
sures on European sovereign debt markets had in-
creased, and conditions in European funding markets 
had deteriorated appreciably.  The greater financial 
stress appeared likely to damp economic activity in the 
euro area and could pose a risk to the economic recov-
ery in the United States. 

Meeting participants discussed a range of considera-
tions surrounding the proposed changes to the swap 
arrangements.  Most participants agreed that such 
changes would represent an important demonstration 
of the commitment of the Federal Reserve and the 
other central banks to work together to support the 
global financial system.  Some participants indicated 
that, although they did not anticipate that usage would 
necessarily be heavy, they felt that lower pricing on the 
existing swap lines could reduce the possible stigma 
associated with the use of the lines by financial institu-
tions borrowing dollars from the foreign central banks, 
and so would contribute to improved functioning in 
dollar funding markets in Europe and elsewhere.  A 
few noted that the risks associated with the swap lines 
were low because the Federal Reserve’s counterparties 
would be the foreign central banks themselves, and the 
foreign central banks would be responsible for the 
loans to banks in their jurisdictions.  However, some 
participants commented that the proposed changes to 
the swap lines would not by themselves address the 
need for additional policy action by European authori-
ties.  Several participants questioned whether the 
changes to the swap lines were necessary at this time 
and worried that such changes could be seen as sug-
gesting greater concern about financial strains than was 

Page 10 Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________



warranted.  It was also noted that the proposed reduc-
tion in pricing of the existing swap arrangements could 
put the cost of dollar borrowing from foreign central 
banks below the Federal Reserve’s primary credit rate 
and that non-U.S. banks might be perceived to have an 
advantage in meeting their short-term funding needs as 
a result.  However, U.S. banks did not face difficulties 
obtaining liquidity in short-term funding markets, and 
some participants felt that a cut in the primary credit 
rate at the present time might incorrectly be seen as 
suggesting concern about U.S. financial conditions. 

At the conclusion of the discussion, all but one mem-
ber agreed to support the changes to the existing swap 
line arrangements and the establishment of the new 
foreign currency swap agreements and approved the 
following resolution: 

“The Federal Open Market Committee di-
rects the Federal Reserve Bank of New York 
to extend the existing temporary reciprocal 
currency arrangements (“swap arrange-
ments”) for the System Open Market Ac-
count with the Bank of Canada, the Bank of 
England, the Bank of Japan, the European 
Central Bank, and the Swiss National Bank 
through February 1, 2013. 

In addition, the Federal Open Market Com-
mittee authorizes the Federal Reserve Bank 
of New York to enter into additional swap 
arrangements for the System Open Market 
Account with the Bank of Canada, Bank of 
England, the Bank of Japan, the European 
Central Bank, and the Swiss National Bank 
to support the provision by the Federal Re-
serve of liquidity in Canadian dollars, British 
pounds, Japanese yen, euros, and Swiss 
francs.  The swap arrangements for provi-
sion of liquidity in each of those currencies 
shall be subject to the same size limits, if any, 
currently in force for the swap arrangements 
for provision of liquidity in U.S. dollars to 
that foreign central bank.  These arrange-
ments shall terminate on February 1, 2013.  
Requests for drawings on the foreign curren-
cy swap lines and distribution of the 

proceeds to U.S. financial institutions shall 
be initiated by the appropriate Reserve Bank 
and approved by the Chairman in consulta-
tion with the Foreign Currency Subcommit-
tee.  The Foreign Currency Subcommittee 
will consult with the Federal Open Market 
Committee prior to the initial drawing on the 
foreign currency swap lines if possible under 
the circumstances then prevailing. 

The Chairman shall establish the rates on the 
swap arrangements by mutual agreement 
with the foreign central banks and in consul-
tation with the Foreign Currency Subcom-
mittee.  He shall keep the Federal Open 
Market Committee informed, and the rates 
shall be consistent with principles discussed 
with and guidance provided by the Commit-
tee.” 

Voting for this action:  Ben Bernanke, William C. 
Dudley, Elizabeth Duke, Charles L. Evans, Richard W. 
Fisher, Narayana Kocherlakota, Sarah Bloom Raskin, 
Daniel K. Tarullo, and Janet L. Yellen. 

Voting against this action:  Jeffrey M. Lacker.  Mr. 
Lacker voted as alternate member for Mr. Plosser at 
this meeting.  Mr. Lacker dissented because of his op-
position to arrangements that support Federal Reserve 
lending in foreign currencies, which he viewed as 
amounting to fiscal policy.  He also opposed lowering 
the interest rate on swap arrangements to below the 
primary credit rate. 

Notation Vote 
By notation vote completed on November 21, 2011, 
the Committee unanimously approved the minutes of 
the FOMC meeting held on November 1–2, 2011.
