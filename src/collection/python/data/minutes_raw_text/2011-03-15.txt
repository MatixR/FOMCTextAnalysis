In the agenda for this meeting, it was reported that ad-
vices of the election of John C. Williams as an alternate 
member of the Federal Open Market Committee had 
been received by the Secretariat, and that he had ex-
ecuted his oath of office. 

Developments in Financial Markets and the Fed-
eral Reserve’s Balance Sheet 
The Manager of the System Open Market Account 
(SOMA) reported on developments in domestic and 
foreign financial markets during the period since the 
Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) met on Jan-
uary 25–26, 2011.  He also reported on System open 
market operations, including the ongoing reinvestment 
into longer-term Treasury securities of principal pay-
ments received on the SOMA’s holdings of agency 
debt and agency-guaranteed mortgage-backed securities 
(MBS) that the Committee authorized in August 2010, 
as well as the purchase of additional longer-term Treas-
ury securities to increase the face value of such securi-
ties held in the SOMA that the FOMC first authorized 
in November 2010.  Since November, purchases by the 
Open Market Desk of the Federal Reserve Bank of 
New York had increased the SOMA’s holdings by $310 
billion.  The Manager reported that achieving an in-
crease of $600 billion in SOMA holdings by the end of 
June 2011 would require continuing to purchase addi-
tional securities at an unchanged pace of about $80 
billion per month.  There were no open market opera-
tions in foreign currencies for the System’s account 
over the intermeeting period.  By unanimous vote, the 
Committee ratified the Desk’s transactions over the 
intermeeting period. 

The Manager also discussed the possible benefits of 
gradually reducing the pace of the Federal Reserve’s 
purchases of Treasury securities when the current asset 
purchase program nears completion.  As its earlier pro-
gram of agency MBS purchases drew to a close, the 
Federal Reserve tapered its purchases during the first 
quarter of 2010 in order to avoid disruptions in the 
market for those securities.  However, the Manager 
indicated that the greater depth and liquidity of the 
Treasury securities market suggested that it would not 
be necessary to taper purchases in this market.  The 
Manager noted that market participants appeared to 
have reached the same conclusion, as they generally did 
not seem to expect the Federal Reserve to taper its 
purchases of Treasury securities.  In light of the Man-
ager’s report, almost all meeting participants indicated 
that they saw no need to taper the pace of the Commit-
tee’s purchases of Treasury securities when its current 
program of asset purchases approaches its end. 

Staff Review of the Economic Situation 
The information reviewed at the March 15 meeting 
indicated that the economic recovery continued to pro-
ceed at a moderate pace, with a further gradual im-
provement in labor market conditions.  Sizable increas-
es in prices of crude oil and other commodities pushed 
up headline inflation, but measures of underlying infla-
tion were subdued and longer-run inflation expecta-
tions remained stable. 

The labor market continued to show signs of firming.  
Private nonfarm payroll employment rose noticeably in 
February after a small increase in January, with the 
swing in hiring likely magnified by widespread snow-
storms, which may have held down the employment 
figure for January.  Initial claims for unemployment 
insurance trended lower through early March, and sur-
veys of hiring plans had improved this year.  The un-
employment rate dropped markedly in January after a 
similar decrease in the preceding month, then ticked 
down to 8.9 percent in February; the labor force partic-
ipation rate was roughly flat in January and February.  
The share of workers employed part time for economic 
reasons declined further over the past two months, but 
long-duration unemployment was still elevated. 

Total industrial production was little changed in Janu-
ary after a strong rise in December.  Manufacturing 
output posted a relatively subdued gain in January, like-
ly held down somewhat by the extensive snowfalls dur-
ing that month; in addition, a scheduled step-up in as-
semblies of motor vehicles reportedly was restrained in 
part by some temporary bottlenecks in the supply 
chain.  As a result, the rate of capacity utilization in 
manufacturing was essentially unchanged in January, 
and it remained well below its 1972–2010 average.  In 
February, indicators of near-term industrial production, 
such as the new orders diffusion indexes in the national 
and regional manufacturing surveys, were at levels con-
sistent with solid increases in factory output in the 
coming months.  Moreover, motor vehicle assemblies 
picked up in February and were scheduled to rise fur-
ther through the second quarter of this year. 

Consumer spending appeared to have increased at a 
modest pace in early 2011 after rising briskly in the 
fourth quarter of 2010.  In January, total real personal 
consumption expenditures (real PCE) were essentially 
flat.  In February, nominal retail sales, excluding pur-
chases of motor vehicles and parts, rose moderately; 
sales of light motor vehicles posted a robust gain.  
Consumer spending was supported by a solid increase 
in real disposable income in January, reflecting in part 

Page 2 Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________



the temporary cut in payroll taxes.  Household net 
worth rose in the fourth quarter, as the increase in equi-
ty values during that period more than offset the fur-
ther fall in house prices.  However, consumer senti-
ment dropped back in early March, retracing its in-
crease over the preceding four months. 

Activity in the housing market continued to be de-
pressed, held down by the large inventory of foreclosed 
or distressed properties on the market and by weak 
demand.  In January, starts and permits for new single-
family homes remained near the low levels that had 
prevailed since the middle of 2010.  New home sales 
moved down in January; existing home sales stepped 
up somewhat but still were quite low by historical  
standards.  Measures of house prices softened again in 
December and January. 

Real business investment in equipment and software 
(E&S) appeared to rise further in recent months.  No-
minal shipments of nondefense capital goods excluding 
aircraft increased, on net, in December and January, 
and the expanding backlog of unfilled orders pointed to 
further gains in shipments in subsequent months.  In 
addition, readings on business conditions and senti-
ment remained consistent with solid near-term ad-
vances in outlays for E&S.  Credit conditions contin-
ued to improve for many firms, though they reportedly 
were still tight for small businesses.  In contrast to the 
apparent increase in E&S outlays, nonresidential con-
struction expenditures dropped further in December 
and January, constrained by high vacancy rates, low 
prices for commercial real estate, and persistently tight 
borrowing conditions for construction loans for com-
mercial properties. 

Real nonfarm inventory investment appeared to have 
picked up in early 2011 after slowing markedly in the 
fourth quarter.  In the motor vehicles sector, invento-
ries rose slightly, on net, in January and February after 
having been drawn down in the fourth quarter.  Out-
side of motor vehicles, the rise in the book value of 
business inventories was somewhat larger in January 
than the average monthly increase in the fourth quarter, 
while inventory-to-sales ratios for most industries cov-
ered by these data were similar to their pre-recession 
norms.  Survey data also suggested that inventory posi-
tions were generally in a comfortable range. 

In the government sector, the available information 
suggested that real defense spending in January and 
February was below its average level in the fourth quar-
ter.  At the state and local level, ongoing fiscal pres-
sures were reflected in further job cuts in January and 

February.  Construction outlays by these governments 
fell again in January. 

The U.S. international trade deficit widened in Decem-
ber and again in January, with rapid gains in both ex-
ports and imports.  The largest increases in exports 
were in capital goods, industrial supplies, and automo-
tive products.  Nominal imports of petroleum products 
rose sharply, reflecting both higher prices and greater 
volumes; imports in other major categories rose solidly 
on net. 

Overall consumer prices in the United States rose 
somewhat faster in December and January than in ear-
lier months, as consumer energy prices posted further 
sizable increases and consumer food prices responded 
to the recent upturn in farm commodity prices.  The 
price index for PCE excluding food and energy (the 
core PCE price index) rose slightly in January, boosted 
by an uptick in prices of core goods after four months 
of declines; the 12-month change in this core price in-
dex stayed near the very low levels seen in late 2010.  
Recent surveys showed further hefty increases in retail 
gasoline prices in February and early March, and prices 
of nonfuel industrial commodities also rose sharply on 
net.  According to the Thomson Reuters/University of 
Michigan Surveys of Consumers, households’ near-
term inflation expectations increased substantially in 
early March, likely because of the run-up in gasoline 
prices; longer-term inflation expectations moved up 
somewhat in the early March survey but were still  
within the range that prevailed over the preceding few 
years. 

Labor cost pressures remained muted in the fourth 
quarter, as hourly compensation continued to be re-
strained by the wide margin of slack in the labor market 
and as productivity rose further.  Average hourly earn-
ings posted a modest increase, on net, in January and 
February. 

Growth in real activity in the advanced foreign econo-
mies appeared to pick up after a lackluster performance 
in the fourth quarter.  In the euro area, monthly indica-
tors of activity, such as retail sales and purchasing man-
agers indexes, were generally positive in January and 
February.  But the divergence in economic perfor-
mance across euro-area countries remained large, as 
economic activity appeared to have expanded strongly 
in Germany but to have contracted in Greece and Por-
tugal.  Prior to the earthquake and tsunami in mid-
March, economic activity in Japan had shown signs of 
firming.  The upbeat tenor of the incoming data for the 
emerging market economies suggested that the eco-

nomic expansion in these countries continued to out-
pace that in the advanced economies.  Foreign con-
sumer price inflation, which stepped up noticeably in 
the fourth quarter, remained elevated in early 2011, 
largely because of higher food and energy prices. 

Staff Review of the Financial Situation 
The decisions by the FOMC at its January meeting to 
continue its asset purchase program and to maintain 
the 0 to ¼ percent target range for the federal funds 
rate were largely in line with market expectations, as 
was the accompanying statement; they elicited only a 
modest market reaction.  Over the weeks following the 
FOMC meeting, nominal Treasury yields and the ex-
pected path of the federal funds rate in coming quarters 
moved higher, as market participants apparently read 
the incoming economic data as, on balance, somewhat 
better than expected.  After mid-February, however, 
Treasury yields and policy expectations retraced their 
earlier rise amid concerns about the possible economic 
fallout from events in the Middle East and North Afri-
ca (MENA) region.  In the days leading up to the 
March FOMC meeting, the tragic developments in Ja-
pan spurred a further decline in Treasury yields.  On 
net, expectations for the federal funds rate, along with 
yields on nominal Treasury securities, were little 
changed over the intermeeting period. 

Measures of inflation compensation over the next 5 
years rose, on net, over the intermeeting period, with 
most of the increase concentrated at the front end of 
the curve, likely reflecting the jump in oil prices.  In 
contrast, measures of forward inflation compensation 5 
to 10 years ahead were little changed, suggesting that 
longer-term inflation expectations remained stable. 

Over the intermeeting period, yields on investment- 
and speculative-grade corporate bonds edged down 
relative to those on comparable-maturity Treasury se-
curities.  The secondary-market prices of syndicated 
loans continued to move up.  Strains in the municipal 
bond market eased as concerns about the budgetary 
problems of state and local governments seemed to 
diminish somewhat.  Conditions in short-term funding 
markets were little changed. 

Broad U.S. stock price indexes were about unchanged, 
on net, over the intermeeting period.  Option-implied 
volatility on the S&P 500 index rose sharply in mid-
February in response to events in the MENA region 
and remained somewhat elevated thereafter.  The 
staff’s estimate of the spread between the expected real 
equity return for S&P 500 firms and the real 10-year 
Treasury yield—a measure of the equity risk pre-

mium—narrowed a bit more over the intermeeting 
period but continued to be quite elevated relative to 
longer-term norms. 

In the March 2011 Senior Credit Officer Opinion Sur-
vey on Dealer Financing Terms, dealers reported a fur-
ther easing, over the previous three months, in the 
price and nonprice terms they offered to different types 
of counterparties for all of the categories of transac-
tions covered in the survey.  Dealers noted that the 
demand for funding had increased for a broad range of 
securities over the same period.  In response to special 
questions, dealers reported some increase in the use of 
leverage over the prior six months by traditionally un-
levered investors—in particular, asset managers, insur-
ance companies, and pension funds.  In addition, deal-
ers reported an increase in leverage over the past six 
months by hedge funds that pursue a variety of invest-
ment strategies.  More broadly, while the availability 
and use of dealer-intermediated leverage had increased 
since its post-crisis nadir in mid-2009, a review of in-
formation from a variety of sources suggested that lev-
erage generally remained well below the levels reached 
prior to the recent financial crisis. 

Net debt financing by nonfinancial corporations was 
solid in January and February, although it did not 
match the sizable amount seen in the fourth quarter.  
Net issuance of investment- and speculative-grade 
bonds was robust in the first two months of this year.  
Commercial and industrial (C&I) loans outstanding 
also increased, on balance, while the amount of nonfi-
nancial commercial paper outstanding was little 
changed.  Gross public equity issuance by nonfinancial 
firms was relatively subdued in January and February.  
Measures of the credit quality of nonfinancial firms 
continued to improve. 

Financing conditions for commercial real estate gener-
ally remained tight.  So far this year, issuance of com-
mercial mortgage-backed securities (CMBS) appeared 
to have maintained its modest fourth-quarter pace.  
Data on delinquency rates for commercial real estate 
loans were mixed. 

Rates on conforming fixed-rate residential mortgages, 
and their spreads relative to the 10-year Treasury yield, 
were about unchanged over the intermeeting period.  
With mortgage rates remaining above the low levels 
seen last fall, refinancing activity was tepid.  Outstand-
ing residential mortgage debt was estimated to have 
contracted again in the fourth quarter.  Rates of serious 
delinquency for subprime and prime mortgages were 
little changed in December and January.

Consumer credit markets showed further signs of im-
provement.  Total consumer credit expanded mod-
erately in January.  As was the case in the fourth quar-
ter, nonrevolving credit expanded while revolving cre-
dit ran off.  Delinquency rates on credit card loans in 
securitized pools and on auto loans at finance compa-
nies continued to decline through January, nearly re-
turning to their longer-run averages.  The issuance of 
consumer asset-backed securities, which had weakened 
around the turn of the year, posted a moderate gain in 
February. 

Bank credit declined, on average, in January and Febru-
ary as a result of a contraction in core loans—the sum 
of C&I, real estate, and consumer loans; holdings of 
securities were about flat on net.  The Survey of Terms 
of Business Lending conducted in the first week of 
February showed that spreads of interest rates on C&I 
loans over comparable-maturity Eurodollar and swap 
rates decreased somewhat but remained elevated. 

M2 increased at a moderate rate, on average, over Janu-
ary and February.  Liquid deposits, the largest compo-
nent of M2, expanded somewhat less rapidly than in 
the fourth quarter of 2010.  Nonetheless, as has been 
the case for some time, the composition of M2 shifted 
toward liquid deposits, likely reflecting their higher 
yields relative to other M2 components.  Currency con-
tinued to advance at a relatively fast rate in January and 
February, likely boosted by a strong expansion in for-
eign holdings of U.S. bank notes. 

In financial markets abroad, equity prices in the ad-
vanced economies rose early in the intermeeting period, 
but they turned down in mid-February as oil prices in-
creased and then fell sharply in mid-March in the af-
termath of the earthquake and tsunami in Japan.  On 
net over the intermeeting period, stock prices were 
down in most of the advanced economies, with Japan’s 
index having fallen most significantly.  Emerging mar-
ket equity price indexes, which had been underper-
forming in previous months, generally ended the period 
lower as well, and emerging market equity funds expe-
rienced outflows.  Movements in 10-year sovereign 
bond yields in Europe and Canada mirrored those in 
equity prices, climbing early in the intermeeting period 
but falling later. 

In part because of downgrades by credit rating agen-
cies, yields on the 10-year sovereign bonds of Greece, 
Ireland, and Portugal rose sharply, relative to those on 
German bonds, through early March.  These spreads 
subsequently declined somewhat in response to a gen-
eral agreement among euro-area leaders to expand the 

capacity of the area’s backstop funding facility, to ex-
tend the maturity of the facility’s loans to Greece, and 
to lower the interest rates on those loans. 

The European Central Bank (ECB) left its benchmark 
policy rate unchanged at its March meeting, but the 
emphasis on upside risks to inflation at the postmeeting 
press conference led market participants to infer that 
the ECB might well tighten policy at its meeting in 
April.  In the United Kingdom, market-based readings 
on expected policy rates indicated that investors antic-
ipated some tightening of policy before the end of this 
year.  In addition, authorities in several emerging mar-
ket economies took steps to tighten policy.  The broad 
nominal index of the U.S. dollar declined about 
1 percent, on balance, over the intermeeting period. 

Staff Economic Outlook 
The pace of economic activity appeared to have been a 
little slower around the turn of the year than the staff 
had anticipated at the time of the January FOMC meet-
ing, and the near-term forecast for growth of real gross 
domestic product (GDP) was revised down modestly.  
However, the outlook for economic activity over the 
medium term was broadly similar to the projection 
prepared for the January FOMC meeting.  Changes to 
the conditioning assumptions underlying the staff pro-
jection were mostly small and offsetting:  Crude oil 
prices had risen sharply and federal fiscal policy seemed 
likely to be marginally more restrictive than the staff 
had judged in January, but these negative factors were 
counterbalanced by higher household net worth and a 
slightly lower foreign exchange value of the dollar.  As 
a result, as in the January forecast, real GDP was ex-
pected to rise at a moderate pace over 2011 and 2012, 
supported by accommodative monetary policy, increas-
ing credit availability, and greater household and busi-
ness confidence.  Reflecting the recent labor market 
data, the projection for the unemployment rate was 
lower throughout the forecast period than in the staff’s 
January forecast, but the jobless rate was still expected 
to decline slowly and to remain elevated at the end of 
2012. 

The staff revised up its projection for consumer price 
inflation in the near term, largely because of the recent 
increases in the prices of energy and food.  However, in 
light of the projected persistence of slack in labor and 
product markets and the anticipated stability in long-
term inflation expectations, the increase in inflation was 
expected to be mostly transitory if oil and other com-
modity prices did not rise significantly further.  As a 
result, the forecast for consumer price inflation over

the medium run was little changed relative to that pre-
pared for the January meeting. 

Participants’ Views on Current Conditions and the 
Economic Outlook 
In discussing intermeeting developments and their im-
plications for the economic outlook, participants 
agreed that the information received since their pre-
vious meeting was broadly consistent with their expec-
tations and suggested that the economic recovery was 
on a firmer footing.  Looking through weather-related 
distortions in various indicators, measures of consumer 
spending, business investment, and employment 
showed continued expansion.  Housing, however, re-
mained depressed.  Meeting participants took note of 
the significant decline in the unemployment rate over 
the past few months but observed that other indicators 
pointed to a more gradual improvement in overall labor 
market conditions.  They continued to expect that eco-
nomic growth would strengthen over coming quarters 
while remaining moderate.  Participants noted that re-
cent increases in the prices of oil and other commodi-
ties were putting upward pressure on headline inflation, 
but that measures of underlying inflation remained 
subdued.  They anticipated that the effects on inflation 
of the recent run-up in commodity prices would prove 
transitory, in part because they saw longer-term infla-
tion expectations remaining stable.  Moreover, a num-
ber of participants expected that slack in resource utili-
zation would continue to restrain increases in labor 
costs and prices.  Nonetheless, participants observed 
that rapidly rising commodity prices posed upside risks 
to the stability of longer-term inflation expectations, 
and thus to the outlook for inflation, even as they 
posed downside risks to the outlook for growth in con-
sumer spending and business investment.  In addition, 
participants noted that unfolding events in the Middle 
East and North Africa, along with the recent earth-
quake, tsunami, and subsequent developments in Japan, 
had further increased uncertainty about the economic 
outlook. 

Participants’ judgment that the recovery was gaining 
traction reflected both the incoming economic indica-
tors and information received from business contacts.  
Spending by households, which had picked up noticea-
bly in the fourth quarter, rose further during the early 
part of 2011, with auto sales showing particular 
strength.  Although some participants noted that 
growth in consumer spending so far this year had not 
been as vigorous as they had anticipated, they attri-
buted the shortfall in part to unusually bad weather.  
While participants expected that household spending 

would continue to expand, the pace of expansion was 
uncertain.  On the one hand, labor market conditions 
were improving, though gradually, and the temporary 
cut in payroll taxes was contributing to rising after-tax 
incomes.  Some easing of credit conditions for house-
holds, particularly for auto loans, also appeared to be 
supporting growth in consumer spending.  On the oth-
er hand, declining house prices remained a drag on 
household wealth and thus on consumer spending.  In 
addition, sizable recent increases in oil and gasoline 
prices had reduced real incomes and weighed on con-
sumer confidence.  Business contacts in a variety of 
industries had expressed concern that consumers might 
pull back if gasoline prices rose significantly further and 
persisted at those elevated levels. 

A further increase in business activity also indicated 
that the economic recovery remained on track.  Indus-
trial production posted solid gains, supported in part by 
continuing growth in U.S. exports.  Business contacts 
in a number of regions reported they were more confi-
dent about the recovery; a growing number of contacts 
indicated they were planning for an expansion in hiring 
and production to meet an anticipated rise in sales.  
Manufacturing firms were particularly upbeat.  Some 
contacts reported they were increasing capital budgets 
to undertake investment that had been postponed dur-
ing the recession and early stages of the recovery; in 
some cases, firms were  planning to expand capacity.  
Consistent with the anecdotal evidence, indicators of 
current and planned business investment in equipment 
and software continued to rise and surveys showed a 
further improvement in business sentiment.  In addi-
tion, although residential construction remained weak, 
investment in energy extraction was growing and 
spending on commercial construction projects ap-
peared to be bottoming out. 

Meeting participants judged that overall conditions in 
labor markets had continued to improve gradually.  The 
unemployment rate had decreased significantly in re-
cent months; other labor market indicators, including 
measures of job growth and hours worked, showed 
more-modest improvements.  Several participants 
noted that the drop in unemployment was attributable 
more to people withdrawing from the labor force and 
to fewer layoffs than to increased hiring.  Even so, par-
ticipants agreed that gains in employment seemed to be 
on a gradually rising trajectory, although the recent data 
had been somewhat erratic and distorted by worse-
than-usual weather in many parts of the country.  In 
addition, surveys of employers showed that an increas-
ing number of firms were planning to hire.  Participants 

Page 6 Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________



noted regional differences in the speed of improvement 
in labor markets; scattered reports indicated that firms 
in some regions were having difficulty hiring some 
types of highly skilled workers.  Participants generally 
judged that there was still substantial slack in the labor 
market, though estimates of the degree of slack were 
admittedly imprecise and depended in part on judg-
ments about a number of factors, including the extent 
to which labor force participation would increase as the 
recovery progresses and employment expands. 

Credit conditions remained uneven.  Bankers again re-
ported improving credit quality and generally weak loan 
demand.  Large firms that have access to financial mar-
kets continued to find credit, including bank loans, 
available on relatively attractive terms; however, credit 
conditions reportedly remained tight for smaller, bank-
dependent firms.  Participants noted evidence that the 
availability of student loans and of consumer loans—
particularly auto loans—was increasing.  Indeed, bank 
and nonbank lenders reported that terms and condi-
tions for auto loans had returned to historical norms.  
In contrast, terms for commercial and residential real 
estate loans remained tight and the volume of outstand-
ing loans continued to decline, though there was some 
issuance of CMBS backed by loans on high-quality 
properties in selected large metropolitan areas.  A few 
participants expressed concern that the easing of credit 
conditions in some sectors was becoming or might be-
come excessive as investors took on more risk in order 
to obtain higher yields. 

Participants observed that headline inflation was being 
boosted by higher prices for energy and other com-
modities, and that prices of other imported goods also 
had risen by a substantial, though smaller, amount.  A 
number of business contacts indicated that they were 
passing on at least a portion of these higher costs to 
their customers or that they planned to try to do so 
later this year; however, contacts were uncertain about 
the extent to which they could raise prices, given cur-
rent market conditions and the cautious attitudes to-
ward spending still held by households and businesses.  
Other participants noted that commodity and energy 
costs accounted for a relatively small share of produc-
tion costs for most firms and that labor costs ac-
counted for the bulk of such costs; moreover, they ob-
served that unit labor costs generally had declined in 
recent years as productivity growth outpaced wage 
gains.  Several participants noted that even large com-
modity price increases have had only limited effects on 
underlying inflation in recent decades. 

In contrast to headline inflation, core inflation and oth-
er measures of underlying inflation remained subdued, 
though they appeared to have bottomed out.  A num-
ber of participants noted that, with significant slack in 
resource utilization and with longer-term inflation ex-
pectations stable, underlying inflation likely would re-
main subdued for some time.  However, the impor-
tance of resource slack as a factor influencing inflation 
was debated.  Some participants pointed to research 
indicating that measures of slack were useful in predict-
ing inflation.  Others argued that, historically, such 
measures were only modestly helpful in explaining large 
movements in inflation; one noted the 2003–04 epi-
sode in which core inflation rose rapidly over a few 
quarters even though there appeared to be substantial 
resource slack. 

Participants expected that the boost to headline infla-
tion from recent increases in energy and other com-
modity prices would be transitory and that underlying 
inflation trends would be little affected as long as 
commodity prices did not continue to rise rapidly and 
longer-term inflation expectations remained stable.  
However, a significant increase in longer-term inflation 
expectations could contribute to excessive wage and 
price inflation, which would be costly to eradicate.   
Accordingly, participants considered it important to 
pay close attention to the evolution not only of head-
line and core inflation but also of inflation expecta-
tions.  In this regard, participants observed that meas-
ures of longer-term inflation compensation derived 
from financial instruments had remained stable of late, 
suggesting that longer-term inflation expectations had 
not changed appreciably, although measures of one-
year inflation compensation had risen notably.  Survey-
based measures of inflation expectations also indicated 
that longer-term expected inflation had risen much less 
than near-term inflation expectations.  A few partici-
pants noted that the adoption by the Committee of an 
explicit numerical inflation objective could help keep 
longer-term inflation expectations well anchored. 

Participants generally judged the risks to their forecasts 
of growth in economic activity to be roughly balanced.  
They continued to see some downside risks from the 
banking and fiscal strains in the European periphery, 
the continuing fiscal adjustments by U.S. state and local 
governments, and the ongoing weakness in the housing 
market.  Several also noted the possibility of larger-
than-anticipated near-term cuts in federal government 
spending.  Moreover, the economic implications of the 
tragedy in Japan—for example, with respect to global 
supply chains—were not yet clear.  On the upside, the

improvement in labor market conditions in recent 
months raised the possibility that household spend-
ing—and subsequently business investment—might 
expand more rapidly than anticipated; if so, the recov-
ery could be stronger than currently projected.  Partici-
pants judged that the potential for more-widespread 
disruptions in oil production, and thus for a larger 
jump in energy prices, posed both downside risks to 
growth and upside risks to inflation.  Several of them 
indicated, in light of recent developments, that the risks 
to their forecasts of inflation had shifted somewhat to 
the upside.  Finally, a few participants noted that if the 
large size of the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet were to 
lead the public to doubt the Committee’s ability to 
withdraw monetary accommodation when appropriate, 
the result could be upward pressure on inflation expec-
tations and so on actual inflation.  To mitigate such 
risks, participants agreed that the Committee would 
continue its planning for the eventual exit from the 
current, exceptionally accommodative stance of mone-
tary policy.  In light of uncertainty about the economic 
outlook, it was seen as prudent to consider possible exit 
strategies for a range of potential economic outcomes.  
A few participants indicated that economic conditions 
might warrant a move toward less-accommodative 
monetary policy this year; a few others noted that ex-
ceptional policy accommodation could be appropriate 
beyond 2011. 

Committee Policy Action 
In their discussion of monetary policy for the period 
ahead, Committee members agreed that no changes to 
the Committee’s asset purchase program or to its target 
range for the federal funds rate were warranted at this 
meeting.  The information received over the intermeet-
ing period indicated that the economic recovery was on 
a firmer footing and that overall conditions in the labor 
market were gradually improving.  Although the unem-
ployment rate had declined in recent months, it re-
mained elevated relative to levels that the Committee 
judged to be consistent, over the longer run, with its 
statutory mandate to foster maximum employment and 
price stability.  Similarly, measures of underlying infla-
tion continued to be somewhat low relative to levels 
seen as consistent with the dual mandate over the long-
er run.  With longer-term inflation expectations remain-
ing stable and measures of underlying inflation sub-
dued, members anticipated that recent increases in the 
prices of energy and other commodities would result in 
only a transitory increase in headline inflation.  Given 
this economic outlook, the Committee agreed to con-
tinue to expand its holdings of longer-term Treasury 

securities as announced in November in order to pro-
mote a stronger pace of economic recovery and to help 
ensure that inflation, over time, is at levels consistent 
with the Committee’s mandate.  Specifically, the Com-
mittee maintained its existing policy of reinvesting 
principal payments from its securities holdings and 
reaffirmed its intention to purchase $600 billion of 
longer-term Treasury securities by the end of the 
second quarter of 2011.  A few members remained un-
certain about the benefits of the asset purchase pro-
gram but judged that making changes to the program at 
this time was not appropriate.  The Committee contin-
ued to anticipate that economic conditions, including 
low rates of resource utilization, subdued inflation 
trends, and stable inflation expectations, were likely to 
warrant exceptionally low levels for the federal funds 
rate for an extended period. 

Members emphasized that the Committee would con-
tinue to regularly review the pace of its securities pur-
chases and the overall size of the asset purchase pro-
gram in light of incoming information—including in-
formation on the outlook for economic activity, devel-
opments in financial markets, and the efficacy of the 
purchase program and any unintended consequences 
that might arise—and would adjust the program as 
needed to best foster maximum employment and price 
stability.  A few members noted that evidence of a 
stronger recovery, or of higher inflation or rising infla-
tion expectations, could make it appropriate to reduce 
the pace or overall size of the purchase program.  Sev-
eral others indicated that they did not anticipate making 
adjustments to the program before its intended com-
pletion. 

With respect to the statement to be released following 
the meeting, members decided to note the further im-
provement in economic activity and in labor markets.  
The Committee also decided to summarize its current 
thinking about inflation pressures and to emphasize 
that it will closely monitor the evolution of overall in-
flation and inflation expectations. 

At the conclusion of the discussion, the Committee 
voted to authorize and direct the Federal Reserve Bank 
of New York, until it was instructed otherwise, to ex-
ecute transactions in the System Open Market Account 
in accordance with the following domestic policy direc-
tive: 

“The Federal Open Market Committee seeks 
monetary and financial conditions that will 
foster price stability and promote sustainable 
growth in output.  To further its long-run 

Page 8 Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________



objectives, the Committee seeks conditions 
in reserve markets consistent with federal 
funds trading in a range from 0 to ¼ per-
cent.  The Committee directs the Desk to 
execute purchases of longer-term Treasury 
securities in order to increase the total face 
value of domestic securities held in the Sys-
tem Open Market Account to approximately 
$2.6 trillion by the end of June 2011.  The 
Committee also directs the Desk to reinvest 
principal payments from agency debt and 
agency mortgage-backed securities in longer-
term Treasury securities.  The System Open 
Market Account Manager and the Secretary 
will keep the Committee informed of ongo-
ing developments regarding the System’s 
balance sheet that could affect the attain-
ment over time of the Committee’s objec-
tives of maximum employment and price 
stability.” 

The vote encompassed approval of the statement be-
low to be released at 2:15 p.m.: 

“Information received since the Federal 
Open Market Committee met in January 
suggests that the economic recovery is on a 
firmer footing, and overall conditions in the 
labor market appear to be improving gradu-
ally.  Household spending and business in-
vestment in equipment and software contin-
ue to expand.  However, investment in non-
residential structures is still weak, and the 
housing sector continues to be depressed.  
Commodity prices have risen significantly 
since the summer, and concerns about global 
supplies of crude oil have contributed to a 
sharp run-up in oil prices in recent weeks.  
Nonetheless, longer-term inflation expecta-
tions have remained stable, and measures of 
underlying inflation have been subdued. 

Consistent with its statutory mandate, the 
Committee seeks to foster maximum em-
ployment and price stability.  Currently, the 
unemployment rate remains elevated, and 
measures of underlying inflation continue to 
be somewhat low, relative to levels that the 
Committee judges to be consistent, over the 
longer run, with its dual mandate.  The re-
cent increases in the prices of energy and 
other commodities are currently putting up-
ward pressure on inflation.  The Committee 

expects these effects to be transitory, but it 
will pay close attention to the evolution of 
inflation and inflation expectations.  The 
Committee continues to anticipate a gradual 
return to higher levels of resource utilization 
in a context of price stability. 

To promote a stronger pace of economic re-
covery and to help ensure that inflation, over 
time, is at levels consistent with its mandate, 
the Committee decided today to continue 
expanding its holdings of securities as an-
nounced in November.  In particular, the 
Committee is maintaining its existing policy 
of reinvesting principal payments from its 
securities holdings and intends to purchase 
$600 billion of longer-term Treasury securi-
ties by the end of the second quarter of 
2011.  The Committee will regularly review 
the pace of its securities purchases and the 
overall size of the asset-purchase program in 
light of incoming information and will adjust 
the program as needed to best foster maxi-
mum employment and price stability. 

The Committee will maintain the target 
range for the federal funds rate at 0 to        
¼ percent and continues to anticipate that 
economic conditions, including low rates of 
resource utilization, subdued inflation trends, 
and stable inflation expectations, are likely to 
warrant exceptionally low levels for the fed-
eral funds rate for an extended period. 

The Committee will continue to monitor the 
economic outlook and financial develop-
ments and will employ its policy tools as ne-
cessary to support the economic recovery 
and to help ensure that inflation, over time, 
is at levels consistent with its mandate.” 

Voting for this action:  Ben Bernanke, William C. 
Dudley, Elizabeth Duke, Charles L. Evans, Richard W. 
Fisher, Narayana Kocherlakota, Charles I. Plosser,  
Sarah Bloom Raskin, Daniel K. Tarullo, and Janet L. 
Yellen. 

Voting against this action:  None. 

The Committee then discussed a recommendation, 
from its subcommittee on communications, that the 
Chairman conduct regular press conferences.  Partici-
pants generally saw such press conferences as a poten-
tially useful way to enhance transparency and strength-
en the Committee’s policy communications.  They dis-

Minutes of the Meeting of March 15, 2011 Page 9_____________________________________________________________________________________________



cussed various implications of, and alternative ar-
rangements for, such press conferences.  They generally 
endorsed holding press conferences after the four 
FOMC meetings each year for which participants pro-
vide numerical projections of several key economic 
variables, conditional on appropriate monetary policy.  
While those projections already are made public in the 
minutes of the relevant FOMC meetings, press confe-
rences could be helpful in explaining how the Commit-
tee’s monetary policy strategy is informed by partici-
pants’ projections of the rates of output growth, unem-
ployment, and inflation likely to prevail during each of 
the next few years, and by their assessments of the val-
ues of those variables that will prove most consistent, 
over the longer run, with the Committee’s mandate to 
promote both maximum employment and stable prices.  
The outcome of the discussion was a decision that the 
Chairman would begin holding press conferences effec-
tive with the April 26–27, 2011, meeting. 

It was agreed that the next meeting of the Committee 
would be held on Tuesday–Wednesday, April 26–27, 
2011.  The meeting adjourned at 2:35 p.m. on March 
15, 2011. 

Notation Vote 
By notation vote completed on February 15, 2011, the 
Committee unanimously approved the minutes of the 
FOMC meeting held on January 25–26, 2011.
