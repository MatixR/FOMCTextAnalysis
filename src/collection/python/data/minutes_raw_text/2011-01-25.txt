rectors of the Federal Reserve Bank of New 
York. 

 
By unanimous vote, the Committee adopted its Pro-
gram for Security of FOMC Information with amend-
ments to the section on ongoing responsibility for 
maintaining confidentiality and with a number of tech-
nical updates. 
 
By unanimous vote, the Authorization for Domestic 
Open Market Operations was reaffirmed in the form 
shown below.  The Guidelines for the Conduct of Sys-
tem Open Market Operations in Federal-Agency Issues 
remained suspended. 
 
AUTHORIZATION FOR DOMESTIC OPEN 
MARKET OPERATIONS 
(Reaffirmed January 25, 2011) 
 
1. The Federal Open Market Committee authorizes 
and directs the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, to 
the extent necessary to carry out the most recent do-
mestic policy directive adopted at a meeting of the 
Committee: 

A. To buy or sell U.S. government securities, in-
cluding securities of the Federal Financing Bank, and 
securities that are direct obligations of, or fully guar-
anteed as to principal and interest by, any agency of 
the United States in the open market, from or to se-
curities dealers and foreign and international ac-
counts maintained at the Federal Reserve Bank of 
New York, on a cash, regular, or deferred delivery 
basis, for the System Open Market Account at mar-
ket prices, and, for such Account, to exchange matur-
ing U.S. government and federal agency securities 

with the Treasury or the individual agencies or to al-
low them to mature without replacement; and 
B. To buy or sell in the open market U.S. govern-
ment securities, and securities that are direct obliga-
tions of, or fully guaranteed as to principal and inter-
est by, any agency of the United States, for the Sys-
tem Open Market Account under agreements to re-
sell or repurchase such securities or obligations (in-
cluding such transactions as are commonly referred 
to as repo and reverse repo transactions) in 65 busi-
ness days or less, at rates that, unless otherwise ex-
pressly authorized by the Committee, shall be deter-
mined by competitive bidding, after applying reason-
able limitations on the volume of agreements with 
individual counterparties. 

2. In order to ensure the effective conduct of open 
market operations, the Federal Open Market Commit-
tee authorizes the Federal Reserve Bank of New York 
to use agents in agency MBS-related transactions. 
3. In order to ensure the effective conduct of open 
market operations, the Federal Open Market Commit-
tee authorizes the Federal Reserve Bank of New York 
to lend on an overnight basis U.S. government securi-
ties and securities that are direct obligations of any 
agency of the United States, held in the System Open 
Market Account, to dealers at rates that shall be deter-
mined by competitive bidding.  The Federal Reserve 
Bank of New York shall set a minimum lending fee 
consistent with the objectives of the program and apply 
reasonable limitations on the total amount of a specific 
issue that may be auctioned and on the amount of se-
curities that each dealer may borrow.  The Federal Re-
serve Bank of New York may reject bids that could 
facilitate a dealer’s ability to control a single issue as 
determined solely by the Federal Reserve Bank of New 
York. 
4. In order to ensure the effective conduct of open 
market operations, while assisting in the provision of 
short-term investments for foreign and international 
accounts maintained at the Federal Reserve Bank of 
New York and accounts maintained at the Federal Re-
serve Bank of New York as fiscal agent of the United 
States pursuant to section 15 of the Federal Reserve 
Act, the Federal Open Market Committee authorizes 
and directs the Federal Reserve Bank of New York:  

A. For the System Open Market Account, to sell 
U.S. government securities, and securities that are di-
rect obligations of, or fully guaranteed as to principal 
and interest by, any agency of the United States, to 
such accounts on the bases set forth in paragraph 1.A 
under agreements providing for the resale by such 
accounts of those securities in 65 business days or 

Minutes of the Meeting of January 25-26, 2011 Page 3_____________________________________________________________________________________________



less on terms comparable to those available on such 
transactions in the market; and  
B. For the New York Bank account, when appro-
priate, to undertake with dealers, subject to the con-
ditions imposed on purchases and sales of securities 
in paragraph l.B, repurchase agreements in U.S. gov-
ernment securities, and securities that are direct obli-
gations of, or fully guaranteed as to principal and in-
terest by, any agency of the United States, and to ar-
range corresponding sale and repurchase agreements 
between its own account and such foreign, interna-
tional, and fiscal agency accounts maintained at the 
Bank. 

Transactions undertaken with such accounts under the 
provisions of this paragraph may provide for a service 
fee when appropriate. 
5. In the execution of the Committee’s decision re-
garding policy during any intermeeting period, the 
Committee authorizes and directs the Federal Reserve 
Bank of New York, upon the instruction of the Chair-
man of the Committee, to adjust somewhat in excep-
tional circumstances the degree of pressure on reserve 
positions and hence the intended federal funds rate and 
to take actions that result in material changes in the 
composition and size of the assets in the System Open 
Market Account other than those anticipated by the 
Committee at its most recent meeting.  Any such ad-
justment shall be made in the context of the Commit-
tee’s discussion and decision at its most recent meeting 
and the Committee’s long-run objectives for price sta-
bility and sustainable economic growth, and shall be 
based on economic, financial, and monetary develop-
ments during the intermeeting period.  Consistent with 
Committee practice, the Chairman, if feasible, will con-
sult with the Committee before making any adjustment. 
 
By unanimous vote, the Authorization for Foreign Cur-
rency Operations, the Foreign Currency Directive, and 
the Procedural Instructions with Respect to Foreign 
Currency Operations were reaffirmed in the form 
shown below.  The vote to reaffirm these documents 
included approval of the System’s warehousing agree-
ment with the U.S. Treasury.   
 
AUTHORIZATION FOR FOREIGN CURRENCY 
OPERATIONS 
(Reaffirmed January 25, 2011) 
 
1. The Federal Open Market Committee authorizes 
and directs the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, for 
the System Open Market Account, to the extent neces-
sary to carry out the Committee’s foreign currency di-

rective and express authorizations by the Committee 
pursuant thereto, and in conformity with such proce-
dural instructions as the Committee may issue from 
time to time: 

A. To purchase and sell the following foreign cur-
rencies in the form of cable transfers through spot or 
forward transactions on the open market at home 
and abroad, including transactions with the U.S. 
Treasury, with the U.S. Exchange Stabilization Fund 
established by section 10 of the Gold Reserve Act of 
1934, with foreign monetary authorities, with the 
Bank for International Settlements, and with other 
international financial institutions: 

 
Australian dollars 
Brazilian reais 
Canadian dollars 
Danish kroner 
euro 
Japanese yen 
Korean won 
Mexican pesos 
New Zealand dollars 
Norwegian kroner 
Pounds sterling 
Singapore dollars 
Swedish kronor 
Swiss francs 

 
B. To hold balances of, and to have outstanding 
forward contracts to receive or to deliver, the foreign 
currencies listed in paragraph A above. 
C. To draw foreign currencies and to permit for-
eign banks to draw dollars under the reciprocal cur-
rency arrangements listed in paragraph 2 below, pro-
vided that drawings by either party to any such ar-
rangement shall be fully liquidated within 12 months 
after any amount outstanding at that time was first 
drawn, unless the Committee, because of exceptional 
circumstances, specifically authorizes a delay. 
D. To maintain an overall open position in all for-
eign currencies not exceeding $25.0 billion. For this 
purpose, the overall open position in all foreign cur-
rencies is defined as the sum (disregarding signs) of 
net positions in individual currencies, excluding 
changes in dollar value due to foreign exchange rate 
movements and interest accruals.  The net position in 
a single foreign currency is defined as holdings of 
balances in that currency, plus outstanding contracts 
for future receipt, minus outstanding contracts for 
future delivery of that currency, i.e., as the sum of 
these elements with due regard to sign.

2. The Federal Open Market Committee directs the 
Federal Reserve Bank of New York to maintain recip-
rocal currency arrangements (“swap” arrangements) for 
the System Open Market Account for periods up to a 
maximum of 12 months with the following foreign 
banks, which are among those designated by the Board 
of Governors of the Federal Reserve System under 
section 214.5 of Regulation N, Relations with Foreign 
Banks and Bankers, and with the approval of the 
Committee to renew such arrangements on maturity: 
 
Foreign bank Amount of arrangement 

(millions of dollars equivalent) 
 
Bank of Canada  2,000 
Bank of Mexico  3,000 
 
Any changes in the terms of existing swap arrange-
ments, and the proposed terms of any new arrange-
ments that may be authorized, shall be referred for re-
view and approval to the Committee. 
3. All transactions in foreign currencies undertaken 
under paragraph 1.A above shall, unless otherwise ex-
pressly authorized by the Committee, be at prevailing 
market rates.  For the purpose of providing an invest-
ment return on System holdings of foreign currencies 
or for the purpose of adjusting interest rates paid or 
received in connection with swap drawings, transac-
tions with foreign central banks may be undertaken at 
nonmarket exchange rates. 
4. It shall be the normal practice to arrange with for-
eign central banks for the coordination of foreign cur-
rency transactions.  In making operating arrangements 
with foreign central banks on System holdings of for-
eign currencies, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York 
shall not commit itself to maintain any specific balance, 
unless authorized by the Federal Open Market Com-
mittee.  Any agreements or understandings concerning 
the administration of the accounts maintained by the 
Federal Reserve Bank of New York with the foreign 
banks designated by the Board of Governors under 
section 214.5 of Regulation N shall be referred for re-
view and approval to the Committee. 
5. Foreign currency holdings shall be invested to 
ensure that adequate liquidity is maintained to meet 
anticipated needs and so that each currency portfolio 
shall generally have an average duration of no more 
than 18 months (calculated as Macaulay duration).  
Such investments may include buying or selling out-
right obligations of, or fully guaranteed as to principal 
and interest by, a foreign government or agency the-
reof; buying such securities under agreements for re-

purchase of such securities; selling such securities under 
agreements for the resale of such securities; and hold-
ing various time and other deposit accounts at foreign 
institutions.  In addition, when appropriate in connec-
tion with arrangements to provide investment facilities 
for foreign currency holdings, U.S. government securi-
ties may be purchased from foreign central banks under 
agreements for repurchase of such securities within 30 
calendar days. 
6. All operations undertaken pursuant to the preced-
ing paragraphs shall be reported promptly to the For-
eign Currency Subcommittee and the Committee.  The 
Foreign Currency Subcommittee consists of the 
Chairman and Vice Chairman of the Committee, the 
Vice Chairman of the Board of Governors, and such 
other member of the Board as the Chairman may de-
signate (or in the absence of members of the Board 
serving on the Subcommittee, other Board members 
designated by the Chairman as alternates, and in the 
absence of the Vice Chairman of the Committee, the 
Vice Chairman’s alternate).  Meetings of the Subcom-
mittee shall be called at the request of any member, or 
at the request of the Manager, System Open Market 
Account (“Manager”), for the purposes of reviewing 
recent or contemplated operations and of consulting 
with the Manager on other matters relating to the Man-
ager’s responsibilities.  At the request of any member 
of the Subcommittee, questions arising from such re-
views and consultations shall be referred for determina-
tion to the Federal Open Market Committee. 
7. The Chairman is authorized: 

A. With the approval of the Committee, to enter 
into any needed agreement or understanding with the 
Secretary of the Treasury about the division of re-
sponsibility for foreign currency operations between 
the System and the Treasury; 
B. To keep the Secretary of the Treasury fully ad-
vised concerning System foreign currency operations, 
and to consult with the Secretary on policy matters 
relating to foreign currency operations; 
C. From time to time, to transmit appropriate re-
ports and information to the National Advisory 
Council on International Monetary and Financial 
Policies. 

8. Staff officers of the Committee are authorized to 
transmit pertinent information on System foreign cur-
rency operations to appropriate officials of the Treas-
ury Department. 
9. All Federal Reserve Banks shall participate in the 
foreign currency operations for System Account in ac-
cordance with paragraph 3G(1) of the Board of Gov-
ernors’ Statement of Procedure with Respect to For-

Minutes of the Meeting of January 25-26, 2011 Page 5_____________________________________________________________________________________________

PROCEDURAL INSTRUCTIONS WITH RESPECT 
TO FOREIGN CURRENCY OPERATIONS 
(Reaffirmed January 25, 2011) 
 
In conducting operations pursuant to the authorization 
and direction of the Federal Open Market Committee 
as set forth in the Authorization for Foreign Currency 
Operations and the Foreign Currency Directive, the 
Federal Reserve Bank of New York, through the Man-
ager, System Open Market Account (“Manager”), shall 
be guided by the following procedural understandings 

with respect to consultations and clearances with the 
Committee, the Foreign Currency Subcommittee, and 
the Chairman of the Committee, unless otherwise di-
rected by the Committee.  All operations undertaken 
pursuant to such clearances shall be reported promptly 
to the Committee. 
1. The Manager shall clear with the Subcommittee 
(or with the Chairman, if the Chairman believes that 
consultation with the Subcommittee is not feasible in 
the time available): 

A. Any operation that would result in a change in 
the System’s overall open position in foreign curren-
cies exceeding $300 million on any day or $600 mil-
lion since the most recent regular meeting of the 
Committee. 
B. Any operation that would result in a change on 
any day in the System’s net position in a single for-
eign currency exceeding $150 million, or $300 million 
when the operation is associated with repayment of 
swap drawings. 
C. Any operation that might generate a substantial 
volume of trading in a particular currency by the Sys-
tem, even though the change in the System’s net po-
sition in that currency might be less than the limits 
specified in 1.B. 
D. Any swap drawing proposed by a foreign bank 
not exceeding the larger of (i) $200 million or         
(ii) 15 percent of the size of the swap arrangement. 

2. The Manager shall clear with the Committee (or 
with the Subcommittee, if the Subcommittee believes 
that consultation with the full Committee is not feasible 
in the time available, or with the Chairman, if the 
Chairman believes that consultation with the Subcom-
mittee is not feasible in the time available): 

A. Any operation that would result in a change in 
the System’s overall open position in foreign curren-
cies exceeding $1.5 billion since the most recent regu-
lar meeting of the Committee. 
B. Any swap drawing proposed by a foreign bank 
exceeding the larger of (i) $200 million or (ii) 15 per-
cent of the size of the swap arrangement. 

3. The Manager shall also consult with the Sub-
committee or the Chairman about proposed swap 
drawings by the System and about any operations that 
are not of a routine character. 
 
Developments in Financial Markets and the Fed-
eral Reserve’s Balance Sheet 
The Manager of the System Open Market Account 
(SOMA) reported on developments in domestic and 
foreign financial markets during the period since the 
Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) met on De-

Page 6 Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________



cember 14, 2010.  He also reported on System open 
market operations, including the continuing reinvest-
ment into longer-term Treasury securities of principal 
payments received on the SOMA’s holdings of agency 
debt and agency-guaranteed mortgage-backed securities 
(MBS) as well as the ongoing purchases of additional 
Treasury securities authorized at the November 2–3, 
2010, FOMC meeting.  Since the first purchase sche-
dule was released after the November FOMC meeting, 
the Open Market Desk at the Federal Reserve Bank of 
New York purchased a total of $236 billion of Treasury 
securities.  These purchases included $69 billion asso-
ciated with the reinvestment of principal payments on 
agency debt and MBS and $167 billion associated with 
the expansion of the Federal Reserve’s securities hold-
ings.  The maturity distribution of the Desk’s purchases 
resulted in an average duration of about 5½ years for 
the securities obtained.  The Manager reported that 
given the purchases completed thus far, achieving a 
$600 billion expansion of the SOMA portfolio by the 
end of June 2011 would require purchasing the addi-
tional securities at a pace of about $80 billion per 
month.  In addition, the Manager provided projections 
of the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet and income un-
der alternative assumptions.  There were no open mar-
ket operations in foreign currencies for the System’s 
account over the intermeeting period.  By unanimous 
vote, the Committee ratified the Desk’s transactions 
over the intermeeting period. 

Structural Unemployment 
A staff presentation on structural unemployment sum-
marized a broad range of economic research on the 
topic conducted across the Federal Reserve System.  
Among the factors cited that could affect the level of 
structural unemployment were demographics, changes 
in the intensity of job search and worker screening, 
differences in the geographic locations of potential 
workers and vacant jobs, and mismatches in character-
istics between potential workers and available jobs.  
Most of the research reviewed suggested that structural 
unemployment had likely risen in recent years, but by 
less than actual unemployment had increased.   

In discussing the staff presentation, meeting partici-
pants mentioned various factors that were seen as in-
fluencing the path of the unemployment rate.  Several 
participants noted that estimates of the contributions 
of the individual factors depended importantly on the 
approach taken by researchers, including the models 
used and the assumptions made.  Participants noted 
that many of the factors that contributed to the recent 
apparent rise in structural unemployment were likely to 

recede over time.  Some participants stressed that cer-
tain determinants of the unemployment rate, such as 
mismatches in the labor market and firms’ hiring prac-
tices, were both difficult to measure in real time and 
not directly affected by monetary policy.  Others em-
phasized that in the current situation, monetary policy 
could still play an important role in reducing unem-
ployment.  

Staff Review of the Economic Situation 
The information reviewed at the January 25–26 meet-
ing indicated that the economic recovery was firming, 
though the expansion had not yet been sufficient to 
bring about a significant improvement in labor market 
conditions.  Consumer spending rose strongly late last 
year, and the ongoing expansion in business outlays for 
equipment and software appeared to have been sus-
tained in recent months.  However, construction activi-
ty in both the residential and nonresidential sectors 
remained weak.  Industrial production increased solidly 
in November and December.  Modest gains in em-
ployment continued, and the unemployment rate re-
mained elevated.  Despite further increases in com-
modity prices, measures of underlying inflation re-
mained subdued and longer-run inflation expectations 
were stable.  

The labor market situation continued to improve grad-
ually.  Private nonfarm payroll employment increased 
in December at a pace roughly the same as its average 
for 2010 as a whole, and the average workweek for all 
employees was unchanged.  Services industries contin-
ued to add most of the new jobs in the private sector.  
Initial claims for unemployment insurance trended 
lower in December and early January, and some indica-
tors of job openings and firms’ hiring plans improved.  
The unemployment rate decreased to 9.4 percent in 
December, but this decline in part reflected a further 
drop in the labor force participation rate.  Long-
duration unemployment remained elevated, and the 
employment-to-population ratio was still at a very low 
level at the end of the year.   

Total industrial production posted solid increases in 
November and December, in part because colder 
weather boosted the output of utilities.  Although mo-
tor vehicle assemblies dropped back in those months, 
production in the manufacturing sector outside of mo-
tor vehicles posted solid gains that were fairly wide-
spread across industries; as a result, capacity utilization 
in manufacturing increased further, although it re-
mained below its long-run average.  Most indicators of 
near-term industrial activity, such as the new orders 

Minutes of the Meeting of January 25-26, 2011 Page 7_____________________________________________________________________________________________



diffusion indexes in the national and regional manufac-
turing surveys, were at levels consistent with further 
increases in industrial production in the near term; in 
addition, motor vehicle production was scheduled to 
move up again in early 2011.   

Growth in consumer spending appeared to have picked 
up in the fourth quarter from the more modest pace 
seen earlier in the year.  Nominal retail sales, excluding 
purchases of motor vehicles and parts, rose again in 
December, following substantial increases in the pre-
vious four months.  In addition, sales of new light mo-
tor vehicles climbed further in December after stepping 
up to a higher level during the preceding two months.  
The available data suggested that consumer spending 
was supported by gains in personal income in the 
fourth quarter of 2010.  Moreover, household net 
worth appeared to have risen in the fourth quarter, as 
the large increase in equity prices more than offset fur-
ther declines in house values.  Consumer credit started 
to increase again in October and November after hav-
ing generally declined since the fall of 2008.  However, 
consumer sentiment only edged up, on net, in Decem-
ber and early January, and it was still at a relatively sub-
dued level.    

Activity in the housing market remained weak in an 
environment characterized by soft demand, a large in-
ventory of foreclosed or distressed properties on the 
market, and tight credit conditions for construction 
loans and mortgages.  Starts and permits for new     
single-family homes in November and December were 
still near the very low levels recorded since midyear.  
Sales of new homes rose in December but remained 
historically low.  Sales of existing homes increased in 
November and December from the more depressed 
levels seen during the summer and early autumn, but 
these sales stayed relatively weak as well.  Moreover, 
measures of house prices declined further in recent 
months, and survey responses indicated that house-
holds remained concerned that home values might con-
tinue to fall.  

Real business investment in equipment and software 
appeared to have increased further in the fourth quar-
ter, although likely at a more moderate rate than in the 
first three quarters of 2010.  After declining in October, 
nominal orders and shipments of nondefense capital 
goods excluding aircraft rose in November, and the 
level of new orders remained above the level of ship-
ments, indicating that the backlog of unfilled orders 
was still rising.  Available indicators suggested that 
business purchases of software stayed on a solid up-

trend, and outlays for computing and communications 
equipment appeared to have risen briskly.  However, 
business spending for transportation equipment, in-
cluding aircraft and motor vehicles, likely declined in 
the fourth quarter of 2010 after expanding rapidly earli-
er in the year.  Surveys of purchasing managers re-
ported that firms planned to increase their capital 
spending this year.  Reports on planned capital expend-
itures by small businesses showed some signs of im-
provement in recent months, although they remained 
relatively subdued.  Business outlays for nonresidential 
structures stayed weak, reflecting high vacancy rates 
and low property values for office and commercial 
properties, as well as tight credit conditions for com-
mercial real estate.  In contrast, investment in drilling 
and mining structures increased, buoyed by rising ener-
gy prices.     

Real nonfarm inventory investment appeared to have 
slowed substantially in the fourth quarter after a sizable 
increase in the previous quarter.  Much of the fourth-
quarter downswing was likely associated with a draw-
down of motor vehicle stocks after an accumulation in 
the third quarter.  Book-value data for October and 
November suggested that the pace of inventory accu-
mulation also was slowing outside of the motor vehicle 
sector.  Inventory-to-sales ratios toward the end of 
2010 were close to their pre-recession norms, and most 
purchasing managers surveyed in December reported 
that their customers’ inventories were not too high. 

Measures of underlying consumer price inflation re-
mained low.  In December, the core consumer price 
index (CPI) edged up, as goods prices were unchanged 
and prices of non-energy services rose slightly.  The  
12-month change in the core CPI remained near the 
very low readings of the previous two months.  Other 
measures of underlying inflation, such as the trimmed-
mean and median CPIs, also remained subdued.  De-
spite the steep run-up in agricultural commodity prices 
over the second half of last year, increases in retail food 
prices remained modest.  However, consumer energy 
prices moved up sharply in December, and prices of 
most types of crude oil increased during December and 
into January.  The prices of nonfuel industrial com-
modities also continued to rise over the intermeeting 
period.  In December and early January, survey meas-
ures of households’ long-term inflation expectations 
stayed in the range that has prevailed for some time.   

Available measures of labor compensation showed that 
labor cost pressures were still restrained, as wage in-
creases slowed along with inflation and productivity

gains appeared to remain substantial.  The 12-month 
change in average hourly earnings for all employees 
continued to be low in December.   

The U.S. international trade deficit narrowed slightly in 
November, as both nominal exports and imports 
moved up by almost the same amount.  The increase in 
exports was driven by agricultural goods, in part reflect-
ing higher prices, as well as by consumer goods.  In 
contrast, exports of machinery and automotive prod-
ucts fell, reversing their October gains.  The rise in im-
ports reflected an increase in the value of imported 
petroleum products, mostly explained by higher prices, 
and of capital goods, which was supported importantly 
by a jump in computers.  At the same time, noticeable 
decreases were registered for imports of automotive 
products, services, and consumer goods, which were 
primarily due to pharmaceuticals.  These developments, 
combined with the substantial narrowing in the trade 
deficit in October, implied that the trade deficit likely 
shrank considerably in the fourth quarter of 2010.  

Recent indicators of foreign economic activity sug-
gested that the global recovery was strengthening.  
Much of this strength was centered in the emerging 
market economies (EMEs), where widespread increases 
in exports and in manufacturing purchasing managers 
indexes (PMIs) pointed to a resurgence in economic 
growth following a slowdown in the third quarter of 
2010.  For China and Singapore, real gross domestic 
product (GDP) data for the fourth quarter confirmed a 
rebound in economic growth.  In contrast, the rise in 
economic activity in the advanced foreign economies 
(AFEs) remained at a subdued pace.  In the euro area, 
the incoming economic data were mixed:  Industrial 
production, manufacturing PMIs, and industrial confi-
dence firmed, but retail sales and consumer confidence 
softened.  The data also pointed to an uneven expan-
sion across the euro area, suggesting that economic 
growth in Germany continued to outpace that in the 
euro-area periphery.  In Japan, exports and household 
spending were soft, although industrial production 
firmed.  Foreign inflation picked up noticeably in the 
fourth quarter of 2010, mostly because of an accelera-
tion of energy and food prices.  Measures of core infla-
tion remained much more subdued, although they also 
moved up in some countries.  In the EMEs, concerns 
about inflation prompted a number of central banks to 
tighten policy.  Some EMEs reportedly took steps to 
limit the appreciation of their currencies by intervening 
in foreign exchange markets, and some acted to dis-
courage capital inflows.   

Staff Review of the Financial Situation 
The decision by the FOMC at its December meeting to 
maintain the 0 to ¼ percent target range for the federal 
funds rate was widely anticipated.  Both the accompa-
nying statement and the minutes of the meeting were 
broadly in line with market expectations and elicited 
limited price action in financial markets.  Yields on me-
dium- and longer-term nominal Treasury securities in-
creased slightly, on net, over the intermeeting period.  
Yields rose in response to data releases that generally 
pointed to some firming of the economic recovery, but 
the upward pressure on yields apparently was tempered 
by expectations of only a gradual pace of improvement 
in the labor market, the belief that the Federal Reserve 
was likely to maintain an accommodative policy stance, 
and ongoing concerns about fiscal and banking pres-
sures in the euro area.  Futures quotes indicated that 
the expected path for the federal funds rate did not 
change appreciably over the intermeeting period.  Mar-
ket-based measures of uncertainty about longer-term 
Treasury yields, which had risen ahead of year-end, de-
clined on balance, likely in part reflecting solidifying 
market expectations regarding the ultimate size of the 
FOMC’s asset purchase program.  The purchases of 
longer-term Treasury securities by the Desk during the 
intermeeting period reportedly had no significant ef-
fects on measures of day-to-day Treasury market func-
tioning. 

Inflation compensation over the next 5 years based on 
Treasury inflation-protected securities (TIPS) moved 
up, likely pushed higher by rising prices for oil and oth-
er commodities and by the firming of the economic 
outlook.  Further out, TIPS-based inflation compensa-
tion 5 to 10 years ahead edged down slightly on net.  
Yields on investment-grade corporate bonds were little 
changed over the intermeeting period, while those on 
speculative-grade corporate bonds declined a little, 
leaving both investment- and speculative-grade spreads 
over yields on comparable-maturity Treasury securities 
somewhat narrower.  In the secondary market for lev-
eraged loans, the average bid price moved up further 
over the intermeeting period.  The municipal bond 
market appeared to continue to price in an atypically 
high level of default risk.  The ratios of yields on long-
term general obligation bonds to those on comparable-
maturity Treasury securities moved up to a very high 
level.  Despite these strains, gross issuance of long-term 
municipal bonds remained strong in December.  

Conditions in short-term funding markets remained 
stable over the intermeeting period.  Spreads of dollar 
London interbank offered rates, or Libor, over over-

Minutes of the Meeting of January 25-26, 2011 Page 9_____________________________________________________________________________________________



night index swap rates held fairly steady across the term 
structure, as the year-end passed without incident.  
Some modest year-end pressures were observed in re-
purchase agreement markets, but they dissipated by 
early January.  On net, spreads on unsecured nonfinan-
cial commercial paper remained low, and spreads on 
asset-backed commercial paper appeared to have stabi-
lized after having been somewhat volatile across year-
end.  Anecdotal reports suggested that the modestly 
rising trend in the use of dealer-intermediated leverage 
evident in 2010 had continued into 2011, but informa-
tion from a variety of sources indicated that leverage 
remained well below the levels reached before the cri-
sis.  

Broad U.S. stock price indexes rose, on net, over the 
intermeeting period, extending their recent strong per-
formance; bank stock prices modestly outperformed 
the broader market.  The increase in equity prices re-
flected the apparent firming of the economic recovery 
and favorable early reports on fourth-quarter corporate 
earnings.  Option-implied volatility on the S&P 500 
index remained at a relatively low level.  The spread 
between the staff’s estimate of the expected real equity 
return for S&P 500 firms and the real 10-year Treasury 
yield—a rough measure of the equity risk premium—
narrowed further over the period but remained elevated 
relative to longer-run norms.  

Overall, net debt financing by U.S. nonfinancial corpo-
rations was robust in the fourth quarter of 2010.  Net 
issuance of bonds was particularly strong, supported by 
heavy issuance in both the speculative- and investment-
grade sectors.  Meanwhile, nonfinancial commercial 
paper outstanding decreased slightly over the quarter.  
Issuance of syndicated leveraged loans, especially those 
funded by institutional investors, stayed strong.  Meas-
ures of the credit quality of nonfinancial corporations 
continued to improve.  Gross public equity issuance by 
nonfinancial firms dropped back in December to its 
average pace in 2010.   

Financing conditions for most types of commercial real 
estate remained tight over the intermeeting period, and 
delinquency rates for broad categories of commercial 
real estate loans stayed elevated.  However, for larger 
nonresidential properties in strong markets, credit ap-
peared to have become somewhat less restricted, and 
prices moved up, on net, from their lows at the begin-
ning of 2010; at the same time, prices of other nonresi-
dential properties continued to trend down.  Issuance 
of commercial mortgage-backed securities increased in 

the fourth quarter of 2010 but was still only a fraction 
of its pre-crisis level. 

Rates on conforming fixed-rate residential mortgages 
edged down a bit during the intermeeting period after 
having risen appreciably in November and early De-
cember, leaving their spreads over the 10-year Treasury 
yield down slightly.  Refinancing activity, which had 
fallen in response to the increase in mortgage rates in 
November, remained at a low level during the period.  
Outstanding residential mortgage debt declined further 
in the third quarter of 2010, reflecting weak housing 
activity and tight lending standards.  Serious delinquen-
cy rates on prime and subprime mortgages flattened 
out in October and November after having moved 
down earlier in the year.  Signs of improvement were 
evident in the consumer credit market, where issuance 
of consumer asset-backed securities was strong early in 
the fourth quarter.  In addition, delinquency rates on 
consumer loans continued to trend down toward their 
longer-run norms.   

Banks made a sizable reduction in their holdings of 
securities in December.  Core loans on banks’ books—
the sum of commercial and industrial (C&I), real estate, 
and consumer loans—edged down again, but the rate 
of contraction appeared to be abating.  C&I loans ex-
panded at a robust pace in December.  Despite contin-
ued weakness in many residential real estate indicators, 
closed-end residential mortgage loans held by large 
banks rose noticeably for the fifth consecutive month 
in December.  By contrast, commercial real estate 
loans, home equity loans, and consumer loans de-
creased during that month.  The behavior of the com-
ponents of core loans in recent months was broadly 
consistent with the results of the Senior Loan Officer 
Opinion Survey on Bank Lending Practices conducted 
in January.  The survey responses indicated that, during 
the fourth quarter of 2010, modest net fractions of 
banks continued to ease standards for C&I loans and 
that larger net fractions eased some terms on such 
loans.  Changes in banks’ lending policies for other 
categories of loans were reportedly mixed and generally 
small.  Meanwhile, moderate net fractions of respon-
dents indicated that demand for C&I loans had streng-
thened over the preceding three months, and that in-
quiries from business borrowers for new or increased 
credit lines had picked up.  In contrast, demand report-
edly weakened somewhat, on balance, for residential 
real estate loans and was little changed for consumer 
loans.  Respondents indicated that the recent increase 
in their holdings of closed-end residential mortgage 
loans reflected the relative attractiveness of such loans

compared with other assets and, for some, a desire to 
expand their balance sheets by adding to this loan cate-
gory.   

In December, M2 expanded at a rate a bit below its 
pace in November.  Liquid deposits, the largest com-
ponent of M2, continued to increase rapidly, while the 
contraction in small time deposits and retail money 
market mutual funds persisted.  The ongoing composi-
tional shift within M2 toward liquid deposits likely re-
flected the relatively high yields on liquid deposits 
compared with yields on many other components of 
M2.  Currency growth slowed in December, due in part 
to weather-related transportation difficulties that de-
layed flows of U.S. bank notes to international destina-
tions.  

The broad nominal index of the U.S. dollar declined 
more than 1 percent over the intermeeting period, de-
preciating by roughly similar amounts, on average, 
against the currencies of the AFEs and the EMEs.  The 
dollar’s decline appeared to reflect a variety of factors:  
signs of stronger economic activity abroad, particularly 
in the EMEs; actual and prospective monetary policy 
tightening in foreign economies; and increases in the 
prices of oil and other commodities, which lent support 
to the currencies of commodity-exporting countries.  
Benchmark 10-year sovereign yields moved higher in 
the core euro-area economies and the United Kingdom 
but were little changed in Japan and Canada.  Equity 
prices increased in the AFEs and in many EMEs as 
market participants appeared to revise upward their 
outlook for the global economy.   

Financial market strains in the euro area continued dur-
ing the intermeeting period.  Greek, Irish, and Portu-
guese sovereign debt spreads over German bunds rose 
in December and early January as credit rating agencies 
downgraded the sovereign debt of Ireland and Portu-
gal.  Subsequently, though, spreads narrowed following 
some relatively successful sovereign debt auctions by 
countries in the euro-area periphery, evidence of 
stepped-up purchases of peripheral sovereign bonds by 
the European Central Bank (ECB), and reports that the 
European Union was considering expanding the back-
stop capacity of the European Financial Stability Facili-
ty.  Some modest dollar funding pressures developed as 
year-end approached, but they did not persist into Jan-
uary.  To continue to support liquidity conditions in 
global money markets, on December 21, the Federal 
Reserve announced an extension through August 1, 
2011, of its swap line arrangements with the ECB and 
the central banks of Japan, Canada, Switzerland, and 

the United Kingdom.  In addition, the Bank of Eng-
land established a temporary liquidity swap facility with 
the ECB designed to provide Ireland’s central bank 
with sterling to help meet the potential needs of the 
Irish banking system.  

Staff Economic Outlook 
Because the incoming data on production and spending 
were stronger, on balance, than the staff’s expectations 
at the time of the December FOMC meeting, the near-
term forecast for the increase in real GDP was revised 
up.  However, the staff’s outlook for the pace of eco-
nomic growth over the medium term was adjusted only 
slightly relative to the projection prepared for the De-
cember meeting.  Compared with the December fore-
cast, the conditioning assumptions underlying the fore-
cast were little changed and roughly offsetting:  Al-
though higher equity prices and a lower foreign ex-
change value of the dollar were expected to be slightly 
more supportive of economic growth, the staff antic-
ipated that these influences would be about offset by 
lower house prices and higher oil prices.  In addition, 
the staff’s assumptions about fiscal policy changed lit-
tle—the fiscal package enacted in December was close 
to what the staff had already incorporated in their pre-
vious projection.  In the medium term, the recovery in 
economic activity was expected to receive support from 
accommodative monetary policy, further improvements 
in financial conditions, and greater household and 
business confidence.  Over the projection period, the 
rise in real GDP was expected to be sufficient to slowly 
reduce the rate of unemployment, but the jobless rate 
was anticipated to remain elevated at the end of 2012.  

The underlying rate of consumer price inflation in re-
cent months was in line with what the staff anticipated 
at the time of the December meeting, and the staff 
continued to project that increases in core PCE prices 
would remain subdued in 2011 and 2012.  As in pre-
vious projections, the persistent wide margin of eco-
nomic slack in the forecast was expected to maintain 
downward pressure on inflation, but this influence was 
anticipated to be counterbalanced by the continued 
stability of inflation expectations and by increases in 
the prices of imported goods.  The staff anticipated 
that brisk increases in energy prices would raise total 
consumer price inflation above core inflation this year, 
but that upward pressure from energy prices would 
wane by next year.

Participants’ Views on Current Conditions and the 
Economic Outlook 
In conjunction with this FOMC meeting, all meeting 
participants—the six members of the Board of Gover-
nors and the presidents of the 12 Federal Reserve 
Banks—provided projections of output growth, the 
unemployment rate, and inflation for each year from 
2011 through 2013 and over the longer run.  Longer-
run projections represent each participant’s assessment 
of the rate to which each variable would be expected to 
converge, over time, under appropriate monetary policy 
and in the absence of further shocks.  Participants’ 
forecasts are described in the Summary of Economic 
Projections, which is attached as an addendum to these 
minutes. 

In the discussion of intermeeting developments and 
their implications for the outlook, the participants gen-
erally expressed greater confidence that the economic 
recovery would be sustained and would gradually 
strengthen over coming quarters.  Their more positive 
assessment reflected both the tenor of the incoming 
economic data and information received from business 
contacts since the previous meeting.  Spending by 
households picked up noticeably in the fourth quarter, 
business outlays continued to grow at a moderate pace, 
and conditions in labor and financial markets improved 
somewhat over the intermeeting period.  Although 
business contacts remained somewhat cautious about 
the economic outlook, they generally indicated greater 
optimism regarding their own prospects for sales and 
hiring than at the time of the previous meeting.  While 
participants viewed the downside risks to their fore-
casts of economic activity over the projection period as 
having diminished, their assessment of the most likely 
outcomes for economic activity and inflation over the 
projection period was not greatly changed.  Most par-
ticipants raised their forecast of real GDP growth in 
2011 somewhat and continued to anticipate stronger 
growth this year than in 2010, with a further gradual 
acceleration during 2012 and 2013.  The unemploy-
ment rate was still projected to decline gradually over 
the forecast period but to remain elevated.  Total infla-
tion was still expected to remain subdued, and core 
inflation was projected to trend up slowly over the next 
few years as economic activity picks up but inflation 
expectations remain well anchored. 

Participants’ judgment that the economic recovery was 
on a firmer footing was supported by the strength in 
household spending in the fourth quarter.  The incom-
ing data indicated that households stepped up sharply 
their purchases of durable goods, particularly automo-

biles, last quarter.  Spending on luxury goods also in-
creased, and the pace of holiday sales was better than in 
recent years.  However, some participants noted that it 
was not clear whether the recent pace of consumer 
spending would be sustained.  On the one hand, the 
additional spending could reflect pent-up demand fol-
lowing the downturn or greater confidence on the part 
of households about the future, in which case it might 
be expected to continue.  On the other hand, the addi-
tional spending could prove short lived given that a 
good portion of it appeared to have occurred in rela-
tively volatile categories such as autos. 

Activity in the business sector also indicated that the 
economic recovery remained on track.  For instance, 
indicators of business investment in equipment and 
software continued to rise.  Industrial production post-
ed solid gains, supported in part by U.S. exports that 
appeared to have been noticeably stronger in the fourth 
quarter.  A wide range of business contacts expressed 
cautious optimism about the durability and strength of 
the recovery, and some were planning for an expansion 
in production in order to meet an anticipated rise in 
sales.  In addition, although residential construction 
spending remained weak, spending on commercial con-
struction projects showed some tentative signs of bot-
toming out.   

Participants noted that conditions in labor markets 
continued to improve gradually.  Payroll employment 
increased at a modest pace, and, although the data had 
been somewhat erratic, a slight downward trend was 
apparent in the recent pattern of weekly initial claims 
for unemployment insurance.  In addition, some sur-
veys of employers suggested a somewhat more upbeat 
outlook for employment.  Business contacts provided a 
range of information regarding hiring intentions, with 
some indicating that workers at all skill levels were  
readily obtainable, while others reported that they had 
upgraded skill requirements and that some of the cur-
rently unemployed did not meet those new require-
ments.  Some businesses remained reluctant to add 
permanent positions and were planning to meet their 
labor requirements with temporary workers.  Overall, 
meeting participants continued to express disappoint-
ment in both the pace and the unevenness of the im-
provements in labor markets and noted that they would 
monitor labor market developments closely.   

Conditions in financial markets improved somewhat 
further over the intermeeting period.  Broad equity 
prices rose, adding to their substantial gains since the 
middle of 2010.  Yields on longer-term nominal Treas-

Page 12 Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________



ury securities were little changed, on balance, over the 
period, but they had increased quite a bit in recent 
months, leaving the Treasury yield curve noticeably 
steeper.  Some participants noted that a steep yield 
curve is a typical feature of an economy in recovery, 
and that much of the steepening appeared to have oc-
curred in response to stronger-than-expected economic 
data.  Market-based measures of inflation compensa-
tion over the next few years increased further over the 
intermeeting period, extending the rise that occurred 
over recent months.  Some participants suggested that 
the increase likely reflected, in part, a decline in inves-
tors’ perceptions of the near-term risk of further disin-
flation.  At the same time, longer-term inflation expec-
tations had remained stable.  Credit spreads on the debt 
of nonfinancial corporations continued to narrow over 
the period, reaching levels noticeably lower than those 
posted several months ago, with the largest declines 
coming on speculative-grade bonds.  However, credit 
conditions remained tight for smaller, bank-dependent 
firms, although bank loan growth had clearly picked up 
in some sectors.  Some participants noted that, taken 
together, these financial developments were consistent 
with a more accommodative stance of monetary policy 
since last summer or a reduction in risk aversion on the 
part of market participants.   

Meeting participants noted that headline inflation had 
been boosted by higher prices for energy and other 
commodities, as well as by increases in the prices of 
imported goods.  Some participants indicated that while 
unit labor costs generally had declined and profit mar-
gins were wide, the higher commodity prices were 
boosting costs of production for many firms.  Some 
business contacts indicated that they were going to try 
to pass a portion of these higher costs through to their 
customers but were uncertain about whether that 
would be possible given current market conditions.  
Many participants expected that, with significant slack 
in resource markets and longer-term inflation expecta-
tions stable, measures of core inflation would remain 
close to current levels in coming quarters.  However, 
the importance of resource slack as a factor influencing 
inflation was debated, and some participants suggested 
that other variables, such as current and expected rates 
of economic growth, could be useful indicators of in-
flation pressures.   

Overall, most participants indicated that the somewhat 
better-than-expected economic data and anecdotal in-
formation from business contacts had importantly in-
creased their confidence in the continuation of a mod-
erate recovery in activity this year.  Accordingly, partic-

ipants generally agreed that the downside risks to their 
forecasts of both economic growth and inflation―as 
well as the odds of a period of deflation―had dimi-
nished.  Participants also generally agreed that the re-
cent data had not led them to significantly change their 
outlooks for the most likely rates of economic growth 
and inflation in coming quarters.  Participants noted 
that some of the strength in the recent data reflected 
factors that could prove temporary, such as the large 
contribution from net exports, a volatile category, and 
the sharp step-up in auto sales.  Most participants con-
tinued to anticipate that the recovery in economic ac-
tivity was likely to be restrained by a variety of econom-
ic factors, including still-high unemployment, modest 
income growth, lower housing wealth, high rates of 
mortgage foreclosure, elevated inventories of unsold 
homes, and tight credit conditions in a number of sec-
tors.  In addition, although many business contacts ex-
pressed more optimism about the economic recovery, a 
number had aimed their recent investments primarily at 
enhancing productivity rather than expanding employ-
ment, and hiring for some businesses reportedly was 
focused on temporary workers.  Some participants 
noted that incoming data on production, spending, and 
employment would need to be solid for a while longer 
to justify a significant upward revision to their outlook 
for the likely pace of the recovery.   

Participants generally saw the risks to their outlook for 
economic growth and employment as having become 
broadly balanced, but they continued to see significant 
risks to both sides of the outlook.  On the downside, 
participants remained worried about the possible ef-
fects of spillovers from the banking and fiscal strains in 
peripheral Europe, the ongoing fiscal adjustments by 
U.S. state and local governments, and the continued 
weakness in the housing market.  On the upside, the 
recent strength in household spending raised the possi-
bility that domestic final demand could snap back more 
rapidly than anticipated.  If so, a considerably stronger 
recovery could take hold, more in line with the sorts of 
recoveries seen following deep economic recessions in 
the past.   

Regarding risks to the inflation outlook, some partici-
pants noted that increases in energy and other com-
modity prices as well as in the prices of imported goods 
from EMEs posed upside risks.  Others, however, 
noted that the pass-through from increases in com-
modity prices to broad measures of consumer price 
inflation in the United States had generally been fairly 
small.  Some participants expressed concern that in a 
situation in which businesses had been unable to raise 

Minutes of the Meeting of January 25-26, 2011 Page 13_____________________________________________________________________________________________



prices in response to higher costs for some time, firms 
might increase them substantially once they found 
themselves with sufficient pricing power.  In any case, 
the factors affecting the ability of businesses to pass 
through higher prices to consumers were viewed as 
complex and hard to monitor in real time.  Most partic-
ipants saw the large degree of resource slack in the 
economy as likely to remain a force restraining infla-
tion, and while the risk of further disinflation had de-
clined, a number of participants cited concerns that 
inflation was below its mandate-consistent level and 
was expected to remain so for some time.  Finally, 
some participants noted that if the very large size of the 
Federal Reserve’s balance sheet led the public to doubt 
the Committee’s ability to withdraw monetary accom-
modation when doing so becomes appropriate, the re-
sult could be upward pressure on inflation expectations 
and so on actual inflation.  To mitigate such risks, it 
was noted that the Committee should continue its 
planning for the eventual exit from the current excep-
tionally accommodative stance of policy.  

Committee Policy Action 
In their discussion of monetary policy for the period 
ahead, members agreed that no changes to the Com-
mittee’s asset purchase program or to its target range 
for the federal funds rate were warranted at this meet-
ing.  While the information received over the inter-
meeting period increased members’ confidence in the 
sustainability of the economic recovery, the pace of the 
recovery was insufficient to bring about a significant 
improvement in labor market conditions, and measures 
of underlying inflation had trended downward.  More-
over, the economic projections submitted for this 
meeting indicated that unemployment was expected to 
remain above, and inflation to remain somewhat below, 
levels consistent with the Committee’s objectives for 
some time.  Accordingly, the Committee agreed to con-
tinue to expand its holdings of longer-term Treasury 
securities as announced in November in order to pro-
mote a stronger pace of economic recovery and to help 
ensure that inflation, over time, is at levels consistent 
with the Committee’s mandate.  The Committee de-
cided to maintain its existing policy of reinvesting prin-
cipal payments from its securities holdings and reaf-
firmed its intention to purchase $600 billion of longer-
term Treasury securities by the end of the second quar-
ter of 2011.  A few members remained unsure of the 
likely effects of the asset purchase program on the 
economy, but felt that making changes to the program 
at this time was not appropriate.  Members emphasized 
that the Committee would continue to regularly review 

the pace of its securities purchases and the overall size 
of the asset purchase program in light of incoming in-
formation—including information on the outlook for 
economic activity, developments in financial markets, 
and the efficacy of the purchase program and any unin-
tended consequences that might arise—and would ad-
just the program as needed to best foster maximum 
employment and price stability.  A few members noted 
that additional data pointing to a sufficiently strong 
recovery could make it appropriate to consider reduc-
ing the pace or overall size of the purchase program.  
However, others pointed out that it was unlikely that 
the outlook would change by enough to substantiate 
any adjustments to the program before its completion.  
In addition, the Committee reiterated its expectation 
that economic conditions were likely to warrant excep-
tionally low levels for the federal funds rate for an ex-
tended period.  With respect to the statement to be 
released following the meeting, members agreed that 
only small changes were necessary to reflect the im-
provement in the near-term economic outlook and to 
make clear that the policy decision reflected a continua-
tion of the asset purchase program announced in No-
vember. 

At the conclusion of the discussion, the Committee 
voted to authorize and direct the Federal Reserve Bank 
of New York, until it was instructed otherwise, to ex-
ecute transactions in the System Account in accordance 
with the following domestic policy directive: 

“The Federal Open Market Committee seeks 
monetary and financial conditions that will 
foster price stability and promote sustainable 
growth in output.  To further its long-run 
objectives, the Committee seeks conditions 
in reserve markets consistent with federal 
funds trading in a range from 0 to ¼ per-
cent.  The Committee directs the Desk to 
execute purchases of longer-term Treasury 
securities in order to increase the total face 
value of domestic securities held in the Sys-
tem Open Market Account to approximately 
$2.6 trillion by the end of June 2011.  The 
Committee also directs the Desk to reinvest 
principal payments from agency debt and 
agency mortgage-backed securities in longer-
term Treasury securities.  The System Open 
Market Account Manager and the Secretary 
will keep the Committee informed of ongo-
ing developments regarding the System’s 
balance sheet that could affect the attain-
ment over time of the Committee’s objec-

Page 14 Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________



tives of maximum employment and price 
stability.” 

The vote encompassed approval of the statement be-
low to be released at 2:15 p.m.: 

“Information received since the Federal 
Open Market Committee met in December 
confirms that the economic recovery is con-
tinuing, though at a rate that has been insuf-
ficient to bring about a significant improve-
ment in labor market conditions.  Growth in 
household spending picked up late last year, 
but remains constrained by high unemploy-
ment, modest income growth, lower housing 
wealth, and tight credit.  Business spending 
on equipment and software is rising, while 
investment in nonresidential structures is still 
weak.  Employers remain reluctant to add to 
payrolls.  The housing sector continues to be 
depressed.  Although commodity prices have 
risen, longer-term inflation expectations have 
remained stable, and measures of underlying 
inflation have been trending downward.   

Consistent with its statutory mandate, the 
Committee seeks to foster maximum em-
ployment and price stability.  Currently, the 
unemployment rate is elevated, and measures 
of underlying inflation are somewhat low, 
relative to levels that the Committee judges 
to be consistent, over the longer run, with its 
dual mandate.  Although the Committee an-
ticipates a gradual return to higher levels of 
resource utilization in a context of price sta-
bility, progress toward its objectives has been 
disappointingly slow.   

To promote a stronger pace of economic re-
covery and to help ensure that inflation, over 
time, is at levels consistent with its mandate, 
the Committee decided today to continue 
expanding its holdings of securities as an-
nounced in November.  In particular, the 
Committee is maintaining its existing policy 
of reinvesting principal payments from its 
securities holdings and intends to purchase 
$600 billion of longer-term Treasury securi-
ties by the end of the second quarter of 
2011.  The Committee will regularly review 
the pace of its securities purchases and the 
overall size of the asset-purchase program in 
light of incoming information and will adjust 

the program as needed to best foster maxi-
mum employment and price stability.   

The Committee will maintain the target 
range for the federal funds rate at 0 to        
¼ percent and continues to anticipate that 
economic conditions, including low rates of 
resource utilization, subdued inflation trends, 
and stable inflation expectations, are likely to 
warrant exceptionally low levels for the fed-
eral funds rate for an extended period.   

The Committee will continue to monitor the 
economic outlook and financial develop-
ments and will employ its policy tools as ne-
cessary to support the economic recovery 
and to help ensure that inflation, over time, 
is at levels consistent with its mandate.” 

Voting for this action:  Ben Bernanke, William C. 
Dudley, Elizabeth Duke, Charles L. Evans, Richard W. 
Fisher, Narayana Kocherlakota, Charles I. Plosser,  
Sarah Bloom Raskin, Daniel K. Tarullo, Kevin Warsh, 
and Janet L. Yellen. 

Voting against this action:  None. 

Next, the Committee turned to a discussion of its ex-
ternal communications, specifically the importance of 
communicating both broadly and effectively.  FOMC 
participants noted the importance of fair and equal 
access by the public to information that could be in-
formative about future policy decisions, and they con-
sidered approaches to address this issue.  Several partic-
ipants noted that increased clarity of communications 
was a key objective, and some referred to the central 
role of communications in the monetary policy trans-
mission process.  A focus of the discussion was on how 
to encourage dialogue with the public in an appropriate 
and transparent manner.  The subcommittee on com-
munications agreed to consider whether further guid-
ance in this area would be useful. 

It was agreed that the next meeting of the Committee 
would be held on Tuesday, March 15, 2011.  The meet-
ing adjourned at 2:40 p.m. on January 26, 2011. 

Notation Vote 
By notation vote completed on January 3, 2011, the 
Committee unanimously approved the minutes of the 
FOMC meeting held on December 14, 2010.

Summary of Economic Projections
 

In conjunction with the January 25–26, 2011, Federal 
Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting, the mem-
bers of the Board of Governors and the presidents of 
the Federal Reserve Banks, all of whom participate in 
the deliberations of the FOMC, submitted projections 
for growth of real output, the unemployment rate, and 
inflation for the years 2011 to 2013 and over the longer 
run.  The projections were based on information avail-
able through the end of the meeting and on each par-
ticipant’s assumptions about factors likely to affect 
economic outcomes, including his or her assessment of 
appropriate monetary policy.  “Appropriate monetary 
policy” is defined as the future path of policy that each 
participant deems most likely to foster outcomes for 
economic activity and inflation that best satisfy his or 
her interpretation of the Federal Reserve’s dual objec-
tives of maximum employment and stable prices.  
Longer-run projections represent each participant’s 
assessment of the rate to which each variable would be 
expected to converge over time under appropriate 
monetary policy and in the absence of further shocks. 

As depicted in figure 1, FOMC participants’ projections 
for the next three years indicated that they expect a 
sustained recovery in real economic activity, marked by 
a step-up in the rate of increase in real gross domestic 
product (GDP) in 2011 followed by further modest 
acceleration in 2012 and 2013.  They anticipated that, 
over this period, the pace of the recovery would exceed 

their estimates of the longer-run sustainable rate of 
increase in real GDP by enough to gradually lower the 
unemployment rate.  However, by the end of 2013, 
participants projected that the unemployment rate 
would still exceed their estimates of the longer-run un-
employment rate.  Most participants expected that in-
flation would likely move up somewhat over the fore-
cast period but would remain at rates below those they 
see as consistent, over the longer run, with the Com-
mittee’s dual mandate of maximum employment and 
price stability.   

As indicated in table 1, relative to their previous projec-
tions in November 2010, participants anticipated 
somewhat more rapid growth in real GDP this year, 
but they did not significantly alter their expectations for 
the pace of the expansion in 2012 and 2013 or for the 
longer run.  Participants made only minor changes to 
their forecasts for the path of the unemployment rate 
and for the rate of inflation over the next three years.  
Although most participants anticipated that the econ-
omy would likely converge to sustainable rates of in-
crease in real GDP and prices over five or six years, a 
number of participants indicated that they expected 
that the convergence of the unemployment rate to its 
longer-run level would require additional time. 

As they did in November, participants judged the level 
of uncertainty associated with their projections for real 
economic activity and inflation as unusually high rela-

absence of further shocks to the economy.  The November projections were made in conjunction with the meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee on 
November 2–3, 2010.

tive to historical norms.  Most continued to see the 
risks surrounding their forecasts of GDP growth, the 
unemployment rate, and inflation over the next three 
years to be generally balanced.  However, fewer noted 
downside risks to the likely pace of the expansion and, 
accordingly, upside risks to the unemployment rate 
than in November; fewer also saw downside risks to 
inflation.   

The Outlook 
The central tendency of participants’ forecasts for the 
change in real GDP in 2011 was 3.4 to 3.9 percent, 
somewhat higher than in the November projections.  
Participants stated that the economic information re-
ceived since November indicated that consumer spend-
ing, business investment, and net exports increased 
more strongly at the end of 2010 than expected earlier; 
industrial production also expanded more rapidly than 
they previously anticipated.  In addition, after the No-
vember projections were prepared, the Congress ap-
proved fiscal stimulus measures that were expected to 
provide further impetus to household and business 
spending in 2011.  Moreover, participants noted that 
financial conditions had improved since November, 
including a rise in equity prices, a pickup in activity in 
capital markets, reports of easing of credit conditions in 
some markets, and an upturn in bank lending in some 
sectors.  Many participants viewed the stronger tenor 
of the recent information, along with the additional 
fiscal stimulus, as suggesting that the recovery had 
gained some strength—a development seen as likely to 
carry into 2011—and that the expansion was on firmer 
footing.  Participants expected that the expansion in 
real economic activity this year would continue to be 
supported by accommodative monetary policy and by 
ongoing improvement in credit and financial market 
conditions.  The strengthening in private demand was 
anticipated to be led by increases in consumer and 
business spending; over time, improvements in house-
hold and business confidence and in labor market con-
ditions would likely reinforce the rise in domestic de-
mand.  Nonetheless, participants recognized that the 
information available since November also indicated 
that the expansion remained uneven across sectors of 
the economy, and they expected that the pace of eco-
nomic activity would continue to be moderated by the 
weakness in residential and nonresidential construction, 
the still relatively tight credit conditions in some sec-
tors, an ongoing desire by households to repair their 
balance sheets, business caution about hiring, and the 
budget difficulties faced by state and local govern-
ments. 

Participants expected that the economic expansion 
would strengthen further in 2012 and 2013, with the 
central tendencies of their projections for the growth in 
real GDP moving up to 3.5 to 4.4 percent in 2012 and 
then to 3.7 to 4.6 percent in 2013.  Participants cited, as 
among the likely contributors to a sustained pickup in 
the pace of the expansion, a continued improvement in 
financial market conditions, further expansion of credit 
availability to households and businesses, increasing 
household and business confidence, and a favorable 
outlook for U.S. exports.  Several participants noted 
that, in such an environment, and with labor market 
conditions anticipated to improve gradually, the re-
straints on household spending from past declines in 
wealth and the desire to rebuild savings should abate.  
A number of participants saw such conditions fostering 
a broader and stronger recovery in business investment, 
with a few noting that the market for commercial real 
estate had recently shown signs of stabilizing.  None-
theless, participants saw a number of factors that would 
likely continue to moderate the pace of the expansion.  
Most participants expected that the recovery in the 
housing market would remain slow, restrained by the 
overhang of vacant properties, prospects for weak 
house prices, and the difficulties in resolving foreclo-
sures.  In addition, some participants expected that the 
fiscal strains on the budgets of state and local govern-
ments would damp their spending for a time and that 
the federal government sector would likely be a drag on 
economic activity after 2011.    

Participants anticipated that a gradual but steady reduc-
tion in the unemployment rate would accompany the 
pickup in the pace of the economic expansion over the 
next three years.  The central tendency of their fore-
casts for the unemployment rate at the end of 2011 was 
8.8 to 9.0 percent—a decline of less than 1 percentage 
point from the actual rate in the fourth quarter of 2010.  
Although participants generally expected further de-
clines in the unemployment rate over the subsequent 
two years—to a central tendency of 6.8 to 7.2 percent 
at the end of 2013—they anticipated that, at the end of 
that period, unemployment would remain noticeably 
higher than their estimates of the longer-run rate.  
Many participants thought that, with appropriate 
monetary policy and in the absence of further shocks, 
the unemployment rate would continue to converge 
gradually toward its longer-run rate within five to six 
years, but a number of participants indicated that the 
convergence process would likely be more extended.  

While participants viewed the projected pace of the 
expansion in economic activity as the principal factor

underlying their forecasts for the path of the unem-
ployment rate, they also indicated that their projections 
were influenced by a number of other factors that were 
likely to contribute to a relatively gradual recovery in 
the labor market.  In that regard, several participants 
noted that dislocations associated with the uneven re-
covery across sectors of the economy might retard the 
matching of workers and jobs.  In addition, a number 
of participants viewed the modest pace of hiring in 
2010 as, in part, the result of business caution about the 
durability of the recovery and of employers’ efforts to 
achieve additional increases in productivity; several par-
ticipants also cited the particularly slow recovery in 
demand experienced by small businesses as a factor 
restraining new job creation.  With demand expected to 
strengthen across a range of businesses and with busi-
ness confidence expected to improve, participants an-
ticipated that hiring would pick up over the forecast 
period. 

Participants continued to expect that inflation would be 
relatively subdued over the next three years and kept 
their longer-run projections of inflation unchanged.  
Many participants indicated that the persistence of large 
margins of slack in resource utilization should contri-
bute to relatively low rates of inflation over the forecast 
horizon.  In addition, participants noted that appropri-
ate monetary policy, combined with stable longer-run 
inflation expectations, should help keep inflation in 
check.  The central tendency of their projections for 
overall personal consumption expenditures (PCE) in-
flation in 2011 was 1.3 to 1.7 percent, while the central 
tendency of their forecasts for core PCE inflation was 
lower—1.0 to 1.3 percent.  Increases in the prices of 
energy and other commodities, which were very rapid 
in 2010, were anticipated to continue to push headline 
PCE inflation above the core rate this year.  The central 
tendency of participants’ forecasts for inflation in 2012 
and 2013 widened somewhat relative to 2011 and 
showed that inflation was expected to drift up modest-
ly.  In 2013, the central tendency of forecasts for both 
the total and core inflation rates was 1.2 to 2.0 percent.  
For most participants, inflation in 2013 was not ex-
pected to have converged to the longer-run rate of in-
flation that they individually considered most consis-
tent with the Federal Reserve’s dual mandate for max-
imum employment and stable prices.  However, a 
number of participants anticipated that inflation would 
reach its longer-run rate within the next three years. 

 

 
Uncertainty and Risks  
Most participants continued to share the view that their 
projections for economic activity and inflation were 
subject to a higher level of uncertainty than was the 
norm during the previous 20 years.1  They identified a 
number of uncertainties that compounded the inherent 
difficulties in forecasting output growth, unemploy-
ment, and inflation.  Among them were uncertainties 
about the nature of economic recoveries from reces-
sions associated with financial crises, the effects of un-
conventional monetary policies, the persistence of 
structural dislocations in the labor market, the future 
course of federal fiscal policy, and the global economic 
outlook.   

Almost all participants viewed the risks to their fore-
casts for the strength of the recovery in real GDP as 
broadly balanced.  By contrast, in November, the dis-
tribution of views had been somewhat skewed to the 
downside.  In weighing the risks to the projected 
growth rate of real economic activity, some participants 
noted the upside risk that the recent strengthening of 
aggregate spending might mark the beginning of a 
more normal cyclical rebound in economic activity in 
which consumer spending might be spurred by pent-up

change in real GDP, the unemployment rate, and total con-
sumer price inflation over the period from 1990 to 2009.  At 
the end of this summary, the box “Forecast Uncertainty” 
discusses the sources and interpretation of uncertainty in the 
economic forecasts and explains the approach used to assess 
the uncertainty and risks attending the participants’ projec-
tions.

demand for household durables and in which business 
investment might be accelerated by the desire to re-
build stocks of fixed capital.  A more-rapid-than-
expected easing of credit availability was also seen as a 
factor that might boost the pickup in private demand.  
As to the downside risks, many participants pointed to 
the recent declines in house prices and the potential for 
a slower resolution of existing problems in mortgage 
and real estate markets as factors that could have more-
adverse-than-expected consequences for household 
spending and bank balance sheets.  In addition, several 
participants expressed concerns that, in an environ-
ment of only gradual improvement in labor market and 
credit conditions, households might be unusually fo-
cused on reducing debt and boosting saving.  A num-
ber of participants also saw a downside risk in the pos-
sibility that the fiscal problems of some state and local 
governments might lead to a greater retrenchment in 
their spending than currently anticipated.  Finally, sev-
eral participants expressed concerns that the financial 
and fiscal strains in the euro area might spill over to 
U.S. financial markets. 

The risks surrounding participants’ forecasts of the 
unemployment rate were also broadly balanced and 
generally reflected the risks attending participants’ 
views of the likely strength of the expansion in real ac-
tivity.  However, a number of participants noted that 
the unemployment rate might decline less than they 
projected if businesses were to remain hesitant to ex-
pand their workforces because of uncertainty about the 
durability of the expansion or about employment costs 
or if mismatches of workers and jobs were more persis-
tent than anticipated. 

Most participants judged the risks to their inflation out-
look over the period from 2011 to 2013 to be broadly 
balanced as well.  Compared with their views in No-
vember, several participants no longer saw the risks as 
tilted to the downside, and an additional participant 
viewed the risks as weighted to the upside.  In assessing 
the risks, a number of participants indicated that they 
saw the risks of deflation or further unwanted disinfla-
tion to have diminished.  Many participants identified 
the persistent gap between their projected unemploy-
ment rate and its longer-run rate as a risk that inflation 
could be lower than they projected.  A few of those 
who indicated that inflation risks were skewed to the 
upside expressed concerns that the expansion of the 

Federal Reserve’s balance sheet, if left in place for too 
long, might erode the stability of longer-run inflation 
expectations.  Alternatively, several participants noted 
that upside risks to inflation could arise from persis-
tently rapid increases in the costs of energy and other 
commodities.   

Diversity of Views 
Figures 2.A and 2.B detail the diversity of participants’ 
views regarding the likely outcomes for real GDP 
growth and the unemployment rate in 2011, 2012, 
2013, and over the longer run.  The dispersion in these 
projections reflected differences in participants’ as-
sessments of many factors, including the likely evolu-
tion of conditions in credit and financial markets, the 
timing and the degree to which various sectors of the 
economy and the labor market will recover from the 
dislocations associated with the deep recession, the 
outlook for economic and financial developments 
abroad, and appropriate future monetary policy and its 
effects on economic activity.  For 2011 and 2012, the 
dispersions of participants’ forecasts for the strength in 
the expansion of real GDP and for the unemployment 
rate were somewhat narrower than they were last No-
vember, while the ranges of views for 2013 and for the 
longer run were little changed. 

Figures 2.C and 2.D provide the corresponding infor-
mation about the diversity of participants’ views regard-
ing the outlook for total and core PCE inflation.  These 
distributions were somewhat more tightly concentrated 
for 2011, but for 2012 and 2013, they were much the 
same as they were in November.  In general, the dis-
persion in the participants’ inflation forecasts for the 
next three years represented differences in judgments 
regarding the fundamental determinants of inflation, 
including estimates of the degree of resource slack and 
the extent to which such slack influences inflation out-
comes and expectations as well as estimates of how the 
stance of monetary policy may influence inflation ex-
pectations.  Although the distributions of participants’ 
inflation forecasts for 2011 through 2013 continued to 
be relatively wide, the distribution of projections of the 
longer-run rate of overall inflation remained tightly 
concentrated.  The narrow range illustrates the broad 
similarity in participants’ assessments of the approx-
imate level of inflation that is consistent with the Fed-
eral Reserve’s dual objectives of maximum employment 
and price stability.

Forecast Uncertainty 

  

 

The economic projections provided by 
the members of the Board of Governors and 
the presidents of the Federal Reserve Banks 
inform discussions of monetary policy among 
policymakers and can aid public understand-
ing of the basis for policy actions.  Consider-
able uncertainty attends these projections, 
however.  The economic and statistical models 
and relationships used to help produce eco-
nomic forecasts are necessarily imperfect de-
scriptions of the real world.  And the future 
path of the economy can be affected by myr-
iad unforeseen developments and events.  
Thus, in setting the stance of monetary policy, 
participants consider not only what appears to 
be the most likely economic outcome as em-
bodied in their projections, but also the range 
of alternative possibilities, the likelihood of 
their occurring, and the potential costs to the 
economy should they occur. 

Table 2 summarizes the average historical 
accuracy of a range of forecasts, including 
those reported in past Monetary Policy Reports 
and those prepared by Federal Reserve Board 
staff in advance of meetings of the Federal 
Open Market Committee.  The projection 
error ranges shown in the table illustrate the 
considerable uncertainty associated with eco-
nomic forecasts.  For example, suppose a par-
ticipant projects that real gross domestic 
product (GDP) and total consumer prices will 
rise steadily at annual rates of, respectively,     
3 percent and 2 percent.  If the uncertainty   
attending those  projections  is  similar to  that 
 

experienced in the past and the risks around 
the projections are broadly balanced, the num-
bers reported in table 2 would imply a proba-
bility of about 70 percent that actual GDP 
would expand within a range of 1.7 to 4.3 per-
cent in the current year, 1.3 to 4.7 percent in 
the second year, and 1.2 to 4.8 percent in the 
third year.  The corresponding 70 percent con-
fidence intervals for overall inflation would be 
1.0 to 3.0 percent in the current and second 
years, and 0.9 to 3.1 percent in the third year. 

Because current conditions may differ 
from those that prevailed, on average, over his-
tory, participants provide judgments as to 
whether the uncertainty attached to their pro-
jections of each variable is greater than, smaller 
than, or broadly similar to typical levels of 
forecast uncertainty in the past as shown in 
table 2.  Participants also provide judgments as 
to whether the risks to their projections are 
weighted to the upside, are weighted to the 
downside, or are broadly balanced.  That is, 
participants judge whether each variable is 
more likely to be above or below their projec-
tions of the most likely outcome.  These judg-
ments about the uncertainty and the risks at-
tending each participant’s projections are dis-
tinct from the diversity of participants’ views 
about the most likely outcomes.  Forecast un-
certainty is concerned with the risks associated 
with a particular projection rather than with 
divergences across a number of different pro-
jections.
