By unanimous vote, the Committee selected David W. 
Wilcox to serve as Economist, and Lawrence Slifman 
to  serve  as  Associate  Economist,  effective  Novem-
ber 1, 2011, until the selection of their successors at the 
first regularly scheduled meeting of the Committee in 
2012. 

Developments in Financial Markets and the Fed-
eral Reserve’s Balance Sheet 
The Manager of the System Open Market Account 
(SOMA) reported on developments in domestic and 
foreign markets during the period since the Federal 
Open  Market  Committee  (FOMC)  met  on  Septem-
ber 20–21, 2011.  He also discussed the developments 
in connection with the bankruptcy filing of MF Global 

Holdings Ltd. and its finance subsidiary, MF Global 
Finance USA Inc., and with the termination of MF 
Global Inc. as a primary dealer.  The Manager reported 
on System open market operations, including the ongo-
ing reinvestment into agency-guaranteed mortgage-
backed securities (MBS) of principal payments received 
on SOMA holdings of agency debt and agency-
guaranteed MBS as well as the operations related to the 
maturity extension program authorized at the Septem-
ber 20–21 FOMC meeting.  By unanimous vote, the 
Committee ratified the Desk’s domestic transactions 
over the intermeeting period.  There were no interven-
tion operations in foreign currencies for the System’s 
account over the intermeeting period. 

Monetary Policy Strategies and Communication 
The staff gave a presentation on alternative monetary 
policy strategies, and meeting participants discussed 
those alternatives as well as potential approaches for 
enhancing the clarity of their public communications.  
No decision was made at this meeting to change the 
Committee’s policy strategy or communications.  It was 
noted that many central banks around the world pursue 
an explicit inflation objective, maintain flexibility to 
stabilize economic activity, and seek to communicate 
their forecasts and policy plans as clearly as possible.  
Many participants pointed to the merits of specifying 
an explicit longer-run inflation goal, but it was noted 
that such a step could be misperceived as placing great-
er weight on price stability than on maximum employ-
ment; consequently, some suggested that a numerical 
inflation goal would need to be set forth within a con-
text that clearly underscored the Committee’s commit-
ment to fostering both parts of its dual mandate.  More 
broadly, a majority of participants agreed that it could 
be beneficial to formulate and publish a statement that 
would elucidate the Committee’s policy approach, and 
participants generally expressed interest in providing 
additional information to the public about the likely 
future path of the target federal funds rate.  The 
Chairman asked the subcommittee on communications 
to give consideration to a possible statement of the 
Committee’s longer-run goals and policy strategy, and 
he also encouraged the subcommittee to explore poten-
tial approaches for incorporating information about 
participants’ assessments of appropriate monetary poli-
cy into the Summary of Economic Projections. 

Committee participants shared their views regarding 
the potential merits and pitfalls of making conditional 
commitments regarding the future course of monetary 
policy.  As noted in the staff briefing, economic theory 
and model simulations suggested that a policy strategy 

Page 2 Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________



involving such commitments could foster better mac-
roeconomic outcomes than a discretionary approach of 
reoptimizing policy at every meeting, so long as the 
public understood the central bank’s strategy and be-
lieved that policymakers would follow through on 
those commitments.  Some participants noted that 
conditional commitments might be particularly helpful 
in providing additional accommodation and mitigating 
downside risks when the policy rate is close to its effec-
tive lower bound, because a central bank can commit 
to a shallower interest rate trajectory than investors 
would expect if policymakers followed a purely discre-
tionary approach.  However, many pointed out that the 
implementation of such a strategy could pose substan-
tial communication challenges and that the benefits 
would be diminished if the strategy was not fully credi-
ble.  Indeed, one participant suggested that additional 
purchases of longer-term securities would be a clearer 
and more effective way to provide additional monetary 
accommodation when the federal funds rate was near 
its lower bound.   

Given the potential pitfalls of pursuing commitment 
strategies extending far out into the future, many par-
ticipants thought that the Committee should consider 
policies intended to accrue some of the gains from 
conditional commitments and to perform well in a 
wide range of alternative scenarios.  In this vein, a 
number of participants expressed support for the pos-
sibility of clarifying the conditionality of the Commit-
tee’s forward guidance about the trajectory of the fed-
eral funds rate through setting numerical thresholds for 
unemployment and inflation that would warrant excep-
tionally low levels for the policy rate.  However, several 
participants noted that such thresholds could be con-
fusing in the absence of a clear expression of the 
Committee’s longer-term goals.  Moreover, others sug-
gested that such an approach could be problematic in 
light of significant uncertainties about the longer-run 
normal rate of unemployment.  One participant 
pointed to those uncertainties as instead supporting the 
use of thresholds as a way of managing potential infla-
tion risks associated with additional accommodation.   

The Committee also considered policy strategies that 
would involve the use of an intermediate target such as 
nominal gross domestic product (GDP) or the price 
level.  The staff presented model simulations that sug-
gested that nominal GDP targeting could, in principle, 
be helpful in promoting a stronger economic recovery 
in a context of longer-run price stability.  Other simula-
tions suggested that the single-minded pursuit of a 
price-level target would not be very effective in foster-

ing maximum sustainable employment; it was noted, 
however, that price-level targeting where the central 
bank maintained flexibility to stabilize economic activi-
ty over the short term could generate economic out-
comes that would be more consistent with the dual 
mandate.  More broadly, a number of participants ex-
pressed concern that switching to a new policy frame-
work could heighten uncertainty about future monetary 
policy, risk unmooring longer-term inflation expecta-
tions, or fail to address risks to financial stability.  Sev-
eral participants observed that the efficacy of nominal 
GDP targeting depended crucially on some strong as-
sumptions, including the premise that the Committee 
could make a credible commitment to maintaining such 
a strategy over a long time horizon and that policymak-
ers would continue adhering to that strategy even in the 
face of a significant increase in inflation.  In addition, 
some participants noted that such an approach would 
involve substantial operational hurdles, including the 
difficulty of specifying an appropriate target level.  In 
light of the significant challenges associated with the 
adoption of such frameworks, participants agreed that 
it would not be advisable to make such a change under 
present circumstances. 

Staff Review of the Economic Situation 
The information reviewed at the November 1–2 meet-
ing indicated that the pace of economic activity streng-
thened somewhat in the third quarter, reflecting in part 
a reversal of the temporary factors that weighed on 
economic growth in the first half of the year.  Howev-
er, labor market conditions continued to be weak.  
Overall consumer price inflation was more moderate 
than earlier in the year, as prices of energy and some 
commodities declined from their recent peaks.  Infla-
tion for other goods and services also appeared to have 
moderated, and measures of longer-run inflation expec-
tations remained stable.    

Private nonfarm employment rose modestly in Sep-
tember, boosted in part by the return of communica-
tions workers who were on strike in August.  Nonethe-
less, the pace of private-sector job gains in the third 
quarter as a whole was less than it was in the first half 
of the year.  Meanwhile, employment in the state and 
local government sector continued to trend lower.  The 
unemployment rate held at 9.1 percent in September, 
and both long-duration unemployment and the share 
of workers employed part time for economic reasons 
were still high.  Initial claims for unemployment insur-
ance have edged down since the middle of September 
but have remained at a level consistent with only mod-

Minutes of the Meeting of November 1–2, 2011 Page 3_____________________________________________________________________________________________



est employment growth, and most indicators of busi-
nesses’ hiring plans have showed no improvement.  

Industrial production rose modestly in September, and 
the manufacturing capacity utilization rate edged up.  
Output in the motor vehicle–related sectors continued 
to step up following the disruptions associated with the 
earthquake in Japan earlier in the year, but the pace of 
factory production outside of those sectors was slug-
gish.  Motor vehicle assemblies were scheduled to rise 
further in the fourth quarter, but broader indicators of 
near-term manufacturing activity, such as the diffusion 
indexes of new orders from the national and regional 
manufacturing surveys, remained at levels consistent 
with only modest increases in production in the coming 
months.   

Real personal consumption expenditures (PCE) rose 
briskly in September but posted a more moderate gain 
for the third quarter as a whole.  Motor vehicle pur-
chases increased significantly in September to a level 
well above that in the spring (when availability of some 
models was limited by supply chain disruptions), and 
sales of new light motor vehicles stepped up further in 
October.  However, real disposable income declined in 
the third quarter, as increases in consumer prices more 
than offset small gains in nominal income.  Moreover, 
consumer sentiment continued to be downbeat in Oc-
tober. 

Housing market activity remained very weak, held 
down by the large overhang of foreclosed and dis-
tressed properties along with limited demand in an en-
vironment of uncertainty about future home prices and 
tight underwriting standards for mortgage loans.  Al-
though starts and permits for new single-family homes 
edged up in September, they stayed near the depressed 
levels seen since the middle of last year.  Sales of new 
and existing homes continued to be soft in recent 
months, and home prices trended lower.  

Real business purchases of equipment and software 
expanded appreciably in the third quarter.  Moreover, 
new orders for nondefense capital goods continued to 
run ahead of shipments in August and September; the 
buildup of unfilled orders pointed toward further in-
creases in spending for business equipment in subse-
quent months.  Nevertheless, survey measures of busi-
ness conditions and sentiment in October suggested 
that firms remained cautious.  Real business expendi-
tures for nonresidential construction also rose appreci-
ably in the third quarter, but spending was still at a rela-
tively low level and continued to be held back by ele-
vated vacancy rates and tight credit conditions for con-

struction loans.  In the third quarter, businesses in-
creased their inventories at a much slower pace than in 
the second quarter, and inventory-to-sales ratios in 
most industries appeared to be in a comfortable range.  

Real federal purchases increased in the third quarter, as 
defense expenditures continued to rise from unusually 
low levels early in the year, more than offsetting a de-
crease in nondefense spending.  At the state and local 
level, real purchases declined in the third quarter at a 
noticeably slower rate than in the first half of the year 
as the pace of reductions in payrolls eased and con-
struction spending rose slightly.   

The U.S. international trade deficit was virtually the 
same in August as it was in July, as both exports and 
imports moved down only by small amounts.  The de-
crease in exports reflected lower sales of automotive 
products and capital goods, which more than offset 
increases in exports of industrial supplies and consumer 
goods.  The dip in imports was the result of lower pur-
chases of capital goods, automotive products, and con-
sumer goods, which outweighed an increase in petro-
leum imports.  The advance release of the third-quarter 
data for the national income and product accounts 
showed real exports of goods and services expanding 
faster than real imports.  As a result, net exports were 
estimated to have made a small positive contribution to 
real GDP growth in the third quarter, a contribution of 
about the same size as in the second quarter. 

Overall U.S. consumer price inflation, as measured by 
the PCE price index, was more moderate in the third 
quarter than in the first half of the year.  Consumer 
prices for food and energy increased last quarter at a 
slower pace than earlier in the year, and consumer pric-
es excluding food and energy rose a bit less than in the 
preceding quarter.  Near-term inflation expectations 
from the Thomson Reuters/University of Michigan 
Surveys of Consumers in October continued to be well 
below the elevated level seen in the spring, and longer-
term inflation expectations in the survey remained sta-
ble. 

Measures of labor compensation showed that wage 
increases continued to be subdued.  The employment 
cost index increased at a modest rate over the year end-
ing in the third quarter, and compensation per hour in 
the nonfarm business sector appeared to have decal-
erated somewhat last quarter.  Similarly, the 12-month 
change in average hourly earnings for all employees 
remained subdued in September.

Foreign economic activity appeared to have largely re-
covered from the effects of the Japanese disaster in 
March, as production in Japan rebounded and supply 
disruptions waned.  However, recent data pointed to 
considerable weakness in the euro-area economy.  
Elsewhere, indicators were somewhat more upbeat, 
with employment in Canada continuing to rise through 
September, while GDP growth in China over the year 
ending in the third quarter was a little less than in the 
first half of the year but still quite robust.  Foreign in-
flation remained contained, although the reversal of 
earlier increases in energy prices appeared to be passing 
through to consumer price inflation relatively slowly in 
some countries. 

Staff Review of the Financial Situation  
Financial markets were quite volatile over the period 
since the September FOMC meeting.  Investor senti-
ment was strongly influenced by prospects for Europe, 
as market participants remained highly attuned to de-
velopments regarding possible steps to contain the fis-
cal and banking problems there.  Economic data releas-
es that were, on balance, somewhat better than market 
participants expected provided some support to finan-
cial markets. 

Longer-term Treasury yields declined appreciably fol-
lowing the release of the September FOMC statement.  
Investors reportedly viewed the Committee’s assess-
ment of the economic outlook as more downbeat than 
anticipated.  In addition, the announcement that the 
Federal Reserve would lengthen the average maturity of 
its portfolio by purchasing longer-term Treasury securi-
ties and selling an equivalent amount of shorter-term 
Treasury securities reportedly contributed to the de-
cline in longer-term yields on the day.  Yields on cur-
rent-coupon agency MBS also moved lower on the an-
nouncement that the Federal Reserve would begin to 
reinvest principal payments on agency securities in 
agency MBS.  Over the following weeks, movements in 
yields were driven by shifts in investors’ assessments of 
the ongoing efforts to address the European fiscal and 
banking situation and by somewhat stronger-than-
expected U.S. economic data.  On balance since the 
September FOMC meeting, Treasury yields on shorter-
dated securities and the expected path of the federal 
funds rate implied by money market futures quotes 
were not much changed.  Yields on Treasury securities 
with maturities beyond 10 years moved down.  Meas-
ures of near-term inflation compensation derived from 
nominal and inflation-protected Treasury securities 
rose slightly over the intermeeting period, while similar 

measures of longer-term inflation compensation were 
about unchanged.   

Credit default swap (CDS) spreads and equity prices of 
large U.S. banking organizations were again volatile 
over the period.  Investor sentiment toward these fi-
nancial institutions was strongly influenced by changes 
in investors’ assessments of the risks associated with 
the European fiscal and banking problems and the ex-
posure of various financial institutions to Europe.  
Third-quarter U.S. bank earnings reports generally met 
investors’ expectations.  On net, equity prices for U.S. 
banking firms were not much changed over the period 
since the last FOMC meeting, while their CDS spreads 
were a bit higher.  European bank CDS spreads re-
mained elevated, and these institutions continued to 
face somewhat strained conditions in short-term bank 
funding markets.   

Although equity markets were volatile, broad U.S. equi-
ty price indexes ended the intermeeting period little 
changed.  Earnings reports for nonfinancial firms gen-
erally came in somewhat better than investors expected 
and about in line with second-quarter levels.  Gross 
public equity issuance by nonfinancial firms continued 
to be very weak in September and October, with a large 
number of firms shelving planned initial public offer-
ings amid the volatility in equity markets.   

Yields on investment- and speculative-grade corporate 
bonds edged lower, on net, over the period, leaving 
their spreads to Treasury securities slightly narrower.  
Credit flows for nonfinancial firms were mixed in Sep-
tember and October.  The pace of bond financing by 
investment-grade nonfinancial corporations slowed 
some in October from its robust September pace, while 
bond issuance by speculative-grade firms was limited.  
Nonfinancial commercial paper outstanding posted 
solid growth in October.  In the leveraged loan market, 
issuance financed by institutional investors slowed sig-
nificantly in the third quarter. 

Financing conditions for commercial real estate (CRE) 
markets appeared to have deteriorated in some re-
spects.  Issuance of commercial mortgage-backed se-
curities (CMBS) slowed further in the third quarter 
amid widening CMBS spreads, and only a small num-
ber of deals were in the pipeline for the rest of the year.  
Prices of most types of commercial properties re-
mained depressed, and aggregate vacancy and delin-
quency rates for commercial properties were close to 
their recent highs.  

Minutes of the Meeting of November 1–2, 2011 Page 5_____________________________________________________________________________________________



Interest rates on residential mortgages changed little, 
on net, over the intermeeting period but remained at 
historically low levels.  The recent low rates appeared 
to have only a modest effect on the pace of mortgage 
refinancing, as tight underwriting standards and low 
home equity continued to limit the access of many 
households to the mortgage market.  However, in Oc-
tober, the Federal Housing Finance Agency announced 
changes to the Home Affordable Refinance Program to 
expand eligibility and take-up among borrowers with 
mortgages backed by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.  
Indicators of home prices remained weak, reflecting a 
large inventory of unsold properties and modest de-
mand for homes.  The pace at which performing prime 
mortgages became newly delinquent rose over the 
summer but remained below last year’s levels.   

Consumer credit decreased in August.  Growth in non-
revolving credit, which had been volatile due to a shift 
in the timing of student loan originations, stepped 
down from the pace seen earlier in the year but re-
mained solid in recent months.  Issuance of consumer 
credit asset-backed securities continued at a moderate 
pace through mid-October.  Delinquency rates for sev-
eral categories of consumer loans remained low, a ref-
lection in part of tighter underwriting standards that 
shifted the composition of borrowers toward those 
with stronger credit histories. 

Core commercial bank loans expanded slightly in the 
third quarter.  Commercial and industrial (C&I) loans 
accelerated following the already strong increases seen 
over the first half of the year.  That growth was con-
centrated among large domestic banks and non-
European foreign institutions.  Consumer loans on 
banks’ books advanced modestly in the third quarter, 
ending a two-year string of quarterly declines.  Closed-
end residential mortgage loans held by banks also in-
creased amid the modest pickup in refinancing activity, 
while CRE loans contracted.  The October Senior Loan 
Officer Opinion Survey on Bank Lending Practices 
showed less net easing of lending standards by domes-
tic banks than in the past few surveys.  In particular, 
domestic banks reported little change in their standards 
on C&I loans over the third quarter, on net, compared 
with more widespread reports of easing in the previous 
several quarters.  Demand for loans reportedly was lit-
tle changed, on balance, over the third quarter.   

M2 grew at a modest pace in September and October, 
well below the rapid rate seen in July and August.  
Some of the factors that contributed to M2 growth 
over the summer, such as concerns about European 

financial developments and equity market volatility, 
persisted and supported elevated levels of M2 deposits 
but did not trigger additional sizable inflows.  The 
monetary base also grew moderately as its major com-
ponents—reserve balances and currency—increased 
over the period. 

Foreign financial markets remained volatile over the 
intermeeting period, and funding pressures for many 
European financial institutions continued.  After falling 
sharply in August and early September, foreign equity 
prices rose, with stocks in the euro area outperforming 
those in most other economies.  For most of the pe-
riod, market participants seemed heartened by Euro-
pean leaders’ efforts to address the fiscal and financial 
challenges present in the euro area, although the news 
late in the period on a possible Greek referendum sent 
stock prices down sharply.  Benchmark sovereign yields 
increased over the period, but spreads of yields on    
10-year sovereign bonds of the most vulnerable euro-
area countries over yields on German bunds were little 
changed on net.  Some reversal of safe-haven flows in 
October reportedly led the dollar to give back most of 
the gains it registered in late September, leaving the 
broad nominal foreign exchange value of the dollar 
little changed, on balance, relative to its level at the 
time of the September FOMC meeting.  At the end of 
October, Japanese officials intervened in foreign ex-
change markets through sales of yen. 

The first round of the three-month U.S. dollar auctions 
that major foreign central banks announced on Sep-
tember 15 was held in October; demand was quite lim-
ited, and only the European Central Bank (ECB) drew 
on its swap line with the Federal Reserve.  Korea and 
Japan announced that they would increase the size and 
scope of their bilateral currency swap arrangements, 
expanding the size of their existing won–yen swap ar-
rangement and establishing a $30 billion facility in 
which dollars could be swapped for either won or yen. 

A number of central banks announced additional 
measures to stimulate economic activity.  The Bank of 
England and Bank of Japan each announced expan-
sions of their respective asset purchase programs, and 
the ECB announced that it would conduct two refi-
nancing operations with maturities of slightly more 
than a year and launched a new covered bond purchase 
program.  The central banks of Brazil, Indonesia, and 
Israel lowered their policy rates, citing a potential slow-
down in global growth.

Staff Economic Outlook 
With the recent data on spending, particularly for con-
sumer expenditures and business outlays for capital 
goods and nonresidential construction, stronger than 
the staff anticipated at the time of the September 
FOMC meeting, the staff’s near-term projection for the 
rate of increase in real GDP was revised up.  However, 
other important near-term indicators of economic ac-
tivity remained downbeat:  Measures of consumer sen-
timent were still very low, business surveys pointed to 
continued caution by firms, conditions in the labor 
market remained weak, and gains in manufacturing 
production outside of the motor vehicle–related sectors 
were sluggish.  Moreover, many of the factors that have 
been restraining the recovery, such as the large over-
hang of vacant houses, tight credit conditions, and ele-
vated risk premiums, remained in place.  Consequently, 
the staff’s outlook for economic activity over the me-
dium term was similar to the projection prepared for 
the September FOMC meeting.  The staff continued to 
project that real GDP would accelerate gradually in 
2012 and 2013, supported by accommodative monetary 
policy, further improvements in credit conditions, and 
a pickup in consumer and business sentiment from 
their current low levels.  Over the forecast period, the 
increase in real GDP was projected to be sufficient to 
reduce the slack in product and labor markets only 
slowly, and the unemployment rate was expected to 
remain elevated at the end of 2013. 

The staff’s forecast for inflation was essentially un-
changed from the projection prepared for the Septem-
ber FOMC meeting.  The upward pressure on consum-
er prices from the rise in commodity and import prices 
early in the year was anticipated to ease further in the 
current quarter.  With longer-run inflation expectations 
stable and significant slack anticipated to persist in la-
bor and product markets, the staff continued to expect 
prices to rise at a subdued pace in 2012 and 2013. 

Participants’ Views on Current Conditions and the 
Economic Outlook 
In conjunction with this FOMC meeting, all partici-
pants—the five members of the Board of Governors 
and the presidents of the 12 Federal Reserve Banks—
provided projections of output growth, the unemploy-
ment rate, and inflation for each year from 2011 
through 2014 and over the longer run.  Longer-run 
projections represent each participant’s assessment of 
the rate to which each variable would be expected to 
converge, over time, under appropriate monetary policy 
and in the absence of further shocks to the economy.  
Although participants had revised downward their pro-

jections for growth since their previous forecasts in 
June, they continued to anticipate that economic 
growth would pick up and the unemployment rate 
would decline gradually through 2014.  They also con-
tinued to project that inflation would settle at or below 
levels consistent with the Committee’s dual mandate.  
Participants’ forecasts are described in more detail in 
the Summary of Economic Projections, which is at-
tached as an addendum to these minutes. 

In their discussion of the economic situation and out-
look, meeting participants regarded the information 
received during the intermeeting period as indicating 
that economic growth had strengthened somewhat in 
the third quarter, reflecting in part a reversal of tempo-
rary factors that had weighed on the economic recovery 
in the first half of the year.  Participants noted that 
global supply chain disruptions associated with the nat-
ural disaster in Japan had diminished, and that the pric-
es of energy and some commodities had come down 
from their recent peaks, easing strains on household 
budgets and likely contributing to a somewhat stronger 
pace of consumer spending in recent months.  More 
broadly, final demand from consumers and businesses 
was stronger than had been expected at the time of the 
September FOMC meeting.  Nonetheless, most partic-
ipants anticipated that the pace of economic growth 
would remain moderate over coming quarters.  While 
they believed that the economic recovery would con-
tinue to be supported by accommodative monetary 
policy, ongoing improvements in households’ and 
businesses’ financial positions, and pent-up demand for 
goods and services, a number of factors were seen as 
likely to continue to restrain the pace of economic 
growth.  Those included persistent weakness in the 
labor and housing markets, still-tight credit conditions 
for many households and small businesses, low con-
sumer and business confidence, fiscal consolidation at 
all levels of government, and elevated volatility in fi-
nancial markets.  Moreover, the recovery was still sub-
ject to significant downside risks, including strains in 
global financial markets.  With longer-term inflation 
expectations remaining stable, the effects of earlier in-
creases in the prices of energy and other commodities 
continuing to wane, and low levels of resource utiliza-
tion restraining increases in prices and wages, most par-
ticipants anticipated that inflation would settle, over 
coming quarters, at or below levels they judged to be 
most consistent with their dual mandate.   

In the household sector, incoming data on retail sales 
were somewhat stronger than expected, and partici-
pants reported scattered optimism among their con-

tacts regarding the prospects for holiday spending.  
Some participants thought that the effects of balance 
sheet deleveraging might be running their course or 
that such effects could be less powerful than had been 
thought.  Others noted that the recent pickup in con-
sumer spending outpaced growth in after-tax incomes 
and was accompanied by a decline in the saving rate, 
raising doubts about its sustainability unless income 
growth picked up.  In addition, households appeared to 
remain pessimistic about the prospects for their future 
income, the job market was still weak, consumer confi-
dence was historically very low, and credit conditions 
for many households were still tight.  The housing sec-
tor continued to be depressed, and some meeting par-
ticipants indicated that the elevated supply of available 
homes and the overhang of foreclosures, together with 
limited access to mortgage credit, were continuing to 
put downward pressure on house prices and housing 
construction.  A few participants noted that recent 
government initiatives aimed at helping high-loan-to-
value borrowers refinance could be useful steps toward 
stabilizing the housing market.   

Business contacts in many parts of the country were 
reported to be cautious and uncertain about the eco-
nomic and political outlook and so remained reluctant 
to hire or expand capacity.  However, production in the 
manufacturing, agriculture, and energy sectors contin-
ued to increase, and the auto sector was rebounding 
from earlier supply chain disruptions.  In addition, 
businesses in a number of regions reported ongoing 
capital investment to increase productivity.  Input cost 
pressures were said to have abated somewhat, while 
labor costs remained subdued.  Overall, credit costs 
were low, and profits and balance sheets at nonfinancial 
corporations were healthy, with many firms continuing 
to hold very high levels of cash.  

Despite some signs of improvement of late, the availa-
ble indicators pointed to continued weakness in overall 
labor market conditions, and the unemployment rate 
remained elevated.  Some participants suggested that 
the persistently high level of unemployment reflected 
the impact of structural factors, including mismatches 
between the skills of the unemployed and the skills 
demanded in sectors in which jobs were currently avail-
able.  Consistent with this view, some business contacts 
reportedly were concerned about the low quality of 
many job applicants, while other contacts noted that 
workers with some specialized skills continued to be in 
short supply.  However, other participants indicated 
that such concerns were not new and that much of the 
current elevated level of unemployment reflected cyc-

lical factors, with one pointing to the lack of wage pres-
sures as evidence.  As a result, they expected that un-
employment would fall back as the economy recovered.  
Some participants again warned that the exceptionally 
high level of long-term unemployment could ultimately 
lead to permanent negative effects on the skills and 
employment prospects of the unemployed.   

Meeting participants observed that financial markets 
continued to be particularly volatile during the inter-
meeting period as investors responded to incoming 
economic data and to news regarding fiscal and finan-
cial developments in Europe.  Liquidity in many mar-
kets worsened, in part because financial institutions 
more reliant on short-term funding markets reportedly 
pulled back from risk-taking and became somewhat less 
willing to make markets.  Participants noted the an-
nouncement by European policymakers of a new pack-
age of measures to address Greece’s fiscal situation as 
well as the vulnerabilities of European banks and sov-
ereigns.  However, participants indicated that many 
details of the new plan had not yet been worked out 
and that a number of important issues remained unre-
solved.  Participants took note of the possible adverse 
effects on U.S. financial markets and the broader U.S. 
economy if European sovereign debt and banking 
problems intensified.  Participants observed, however, 
that the capital and liquidity positions of U.S. banks 
had strengthened in recent quarters and that the credit 
quality of loans to businesses and households had im-
proved further.  Contacts in the banking sector re-
ported that U.S. banks continued to be willing to ex-
tend loans to creditworthy borrowers, but loan demand 
remained weak and competition for such borrowers 
was putting pressure on net interest margins.  It was 
noted that very low interest rates were negatively affect-
ing pension funds and the profitability of the life insur-
ance industry.  Participants also discussed the events 
surrounding the bankruptcy filing of MF Global Hold-
ings Ltd. and saw the financial stability implications of 
this development as limited to date. 

Participants generally agreed that measures of total in-
flation appeared to have moderated since earlier in the 
year as prices of energy and some commodities de-
clined from their peaks.  Measures of core inflation also 
seemed to have declined in recent months, and longer-
term inflation expectations remained well anchored.  
Nonetheless, some participants noted that core infla-
tion had not come down as quickly or by as much as 
they had expected in light of the reduction in commod-
ity prices, perhaps suggesting that the level of potential 
output was lower than had been thought.  However, 

Page 8 Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________



other participants pointed to the subdued pace of gains 
in labor costs as a factor damping inflation, and reports 
from contacts suggested that upward pressure on wages 
remained limited.  

Regarding their overall outlook for economic activity, 
participants generally agreed that, even with the posi-
tive news received over the intermeeting period, the 
most probable outcome was a moderate pace of eco-
nomic growth over the medium run with only a gradual 
decline in the unemployment rate.  While some factors 
were seen as likely to support growth going forward—
such as pent-up demand, improvements in household 
and business balance sheets, and accommodative mon-
etary policy—participants observed that the pace of 
economic recovery would likely continue to be held 
down for some time by persistent headwinds.  In par-
ticular, they pointed to very low levels of consumer and 
business confidence, further efforts by households to 
deleverage, cutbacks at all levels of government, ele-
vated financial market volatility, still-tight credit condi-
tions for some households and small businesses, and 
the ongoing weakness in the labor and housing mar-
kets.  While recent incoming data suggested reduced 
odds that the economy would slide back into recession, 
participants still saw significant downside risks to the 
outlook for economic growth.  Risks included potential 
spillovers to U.S. financial markets and institutions, and 
so to the broader U.S. economy, if the European debt 
and banking crisis were to worsen significantly.  In ad-
dition, participants noted the risk of a larger-than-
expected fiscal tightening and the possibility that struc-
tural problems in the housing market had attenuated 
the transmission of monetary policy actions to the real 
economy.  It was also noted that the extended period 
of highly accommodative monetary policy could even-
tually lead to a buildup of financial imbalances.  A few 
participants, however, mentioned the possibility that 
economic growth could be more rapid than currently 
expected, particularly if gains in output and employ-
ment led to a virtuous cycle of improvements in 
household balance sheets, increased confidence, and 
easier credit conditions. 

With respect to the outlook for inflation, participants 
generally anticipated that inflation would recede further 
over coming quarters and would settle over the me-
dium run at levels at or below those judged to be most 
consistent with the Committee’s dual mandate. They 
pointed to the further dissipation of the effects of earli-
er increases in the prices of energy and some commodi-
ties, the significant slack in resource utilization, the 
continued subdued growth in labor compensation, and 

well-anchored inflation expectations as factors likely to 
contribute to the moderation in inflation over time.  A 
number of participants saw the risks to the outlook for 
inflation as roughly balanced.  A few participants felt 
that the continuation of the current stance of monetary 
policy, coupled with the possibility of a rebound in 
energy and commodity prices, posed some upside risks 
to inflation.  Other participants instead saw inflation 
risks as tilted to the downside, in light of their expecta-
tions for persistent resource slack.  It was noted that 
U.S. inflation had been influenced relatively more by 
commodity price fluctuations in recent years; because 
commodity prices reflect global economic conditions, 
U.S. inflation might be less affected by domestic factors 
and more linked to the global outlook than in the past.   

Committee Policy Action 
Members noted that information received over the in-
termeeting period pointed to somewhat stronger eco-
nomic growth in the third quarter, partly reflecting a 
reversal of temporary factors that had depressed eco-
nomic growth in the first half of the year.  However, 
overall labor market conditions remained weak.  Mem-
bers generally anticipated that unemployment would 
decline only gradually from levels significantly above 
those that the Committee would expect to prevail in 
the longer run, with inflation likely to settle at levels at 
or below those consistent with the Committee’s dual 
mandate.  Accordingly, in the discussion of monetary 
policy for the period ahead, all Committee members 
agreed to continue the program of extending the aver-
age maturity of the Federal Reserve’s holdings of secur-
ities as announced in September.  The Committee de-
cided to maintain its existing policy of reinvesting prin-
cipal payments from its holdings of agency debt and 
agency MBS in agency MBS and of rolling over matur-
ing Treasury securities at auction.  In addition, the 
Committee agreed to keep the target range for the fed-
eral funds rate at 0 to ¼ percent and to reiterate its ex-
pectation that economic conditions—including low 
rates of resource utilization and a subdued outlook for 
inflation over the medium run—are likely to warrant 
exceptionally low levels for the federal funds rate at 
least through mid-2013.  A few members expressed 
interest in using language specifying a period of time 
during which the federal funds rate was expected to 
remain exceptionally low, rather than a calendar date, 
arguing that such language might be better to indicate a 
constant stance of monetary policy over time.  Howev-
er, members generally preferred to retain the existing 
forward guidance, at least for now.  A few members 
indicated that they believed the economic outlook 

Minutes of the Meeting of November 1–2, 2011 Page 9_____________________________________________________________________________________________



might warrant additional policy accommodation.  
However, it was noted that any such accommodation 
would likely be more effective if it were provided in the 
context of a future communications initiative, and most 
of these members agreed that they could support reten-
tion of the current policy stance at this meeting.  One 
member dissented from the policy decision on the 
grounds that additional monetary policy accommoda-
tion was warranted at this time.  With the Committee in 
the process of reviewing its monetary policy strategies 
and communication, and no additional accommodation 
being provided at this meeting, a few members indi-
cated that they could support the Committee’s decision 
even though they had not favored recent policy actions.  
The Committee reiterated that it will regularly review 
the size and composition of its securities holdings and 
that it is prepared to adjust those holdings as appropri-
ate to promote a stronger economic recovery in the 
context of price stability.  With respect to the statement 
to be released following the meeting, members agreed 
that only relatively small changes were needed to reflect 
the modest improvement in the economic outlook and 
to note that the Committee would continue to imple-
ment its policy steps from recent meetings. 

At the conclusion of the discussion, the Committee 
voted to authorize and direct the Federal Reserve Bank 
of New York, until it was instructed otherwise, to ex-
ecute transactions in the System Account in accordance 
with the following domestic policy directive: 

“The Federal Open Market Committee seeks 
monetary and financial conditions that will 
foster price stability and promote sustainable 
growth in output.  To further its long-run 
objectives, the Committee seeks conditions 
in reserve markets consistent with federal 
funds trading in a range from 0 to ¼ percent.  
The Committee directs the Desk to continue 
the maturity extension program it began in 
September to purchase, by the end of June 
2012, Treasury securities with remaining ma-
turities of approximately 6 years to 30 years 
with a total face value of $400 billion, and to 
sell Treasury securities with remaining matur-
ities of 3 years or less with a total face value 
of $400 billion.  The Committee also directs 
the Desk to maintain its existing policies of 
rolling over maturing Treasury securities into 
new issues and of reinvesting principal pay-
ments on all agency debt and agency mort-
gage-backed securities in the System Open 
Market Account in agency mortgage-backed 

securities in order to maintain the total face 
value of domestic securities at approximately 
$2.6 trillion.  The Committee directs the 
Desk to engage in dollar roll transactions as 
necessary to facilitate settlement of the Fed-
eral Reserve’s agency MBS transactions.  The 
System Open Market Account Manager and 
the Secretary will keep the Committee in-
formed of ongoing developments regarding 
the System’s balance sheet that could affect 
the attainment over time of the Committee’s 
objectives of maximum employment and 
price stability.” 

The vote encompassed approval of the statement be-
low to be released at 12:30 p.m.: 

“Information received since the Federal 
Open Market Committee met in September 
indicates that economic growth strengthened 
somewhat in the third quarter, reflecting in 
part a reversal of the temporary factors that 
had weighed on growth earlier in the year.  
Nonetheless, recent indicators point to con-
tinuing weakness in overall labor market 
conditions, and the unemployment rate re-
mains elevated.  Household spending has in-
creased at a somewhat faster pace in recent 
months.  Business investment in equipment 
and software has continued to expand, but 
investment in nonresidential structures is still 
weak, and the housing sector remains de-
pressed.  Inflation appears to have mod-
erated since earlier in the year as prices of 
energy and some commodities have declined 
from their peaks.  Longer-term inflation ex-
pectations have remained stable. 

Consistent with its statutory mandate, the 
Committee seeks to foster maximum em-
ployment and price stability.  The Committee 
continues to expect a moderate pace of eco-
nomic growth over coming quarters and 
consequently anticipates that the unemploy-
ment rate will decline only gradually toward 
levels that the Committee judges to be con-
sistent with its dual mandate.  Moreover, 
there are significant downside risks to the 
economic outlook, including strains in global 
financial markets.  The Committee also antic-
ipates that inflation will settle, over coming 
quarters, at levels at or below those consis-
tent with the Committee’s dual mandate as 

Page 10 Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________



the effects of past energy and other com-
modity price increases dissipate further.  
However, the Committee will continue to 
pay close attention to the evolution of infla-
tion and inflation expectations. 

To support a stronger economic recovery 
and to help ensure that inflation, over time, 
is at levels consistent with the dual mandate, 
the Committee decided today to continue its 
program to extend the average maturity of its 
holdings of securities as announced in Sep-
tember.  The Committee is maintaining its 
existing policies of reinvesting principal 
payments from its holdings of agency debt 
and agency mortgage-backed securities in 
agency mortgage-backed securities and of 
rolling over maturing Treasury securities at 
auction.  The Committee will regularly re-
view the size and composition of its securi-
ties holdings and is prepared to adjust those 
holdings as appropriate. 

The Committee also decided to keep the tar-
get range for the federal funds rate at 0 to   
¼ percent and currently anticipates that eco-
nomic conditions—including low rates of re-
source utilization and a subdued outlook for 
inflation over the medium run—are likely to 
warrant exceptionally low levels for the fed-
eral funds rate at least through mid-2013. 

The Committee will continue to assess the 
economic outlook in light of incoming in-
formation and is prepared to employ its tools 
to promote a stronger economic recovery in 
a context of price stability.” 

Voting for this action:  Ben Bernanke, William C. 
Dudley, Elizabeth Duke, Richard W. Fisher, Narayana 

Kocherlakota, Charles I. Plosser, Sarah Bloom Raskin, 
Daniel K. Tarullo, and Janet L. Yellen. 

Voting against this action:  Charles L. Evans. 

Mr. Evans dissented because he saw the high unem-
ployment rate and the outlook for only weak economic 
growth as calling for additional policy accommodation 
at this meeting.  Moreover, the longer the current situa-
tion of low resource utilization lasted, the more the 
economy’s longer-term growth potential could be im-
paired.  Furthermore, given current policy, his outlook 
was for inflation to come in below levels consistent 
with the Committee’s dual mandate, bolstering the case 
for additional monetary easing at this time.  He also 
believed policies with more-explicit forward guidance 
about the economic conditions under which exception-
ally low levels of the funds rate could be maintained 
would improve the prospects for growth and employ-
ment and, while possibly admitting somewhat higher 
inflation for a time, would still safeguard price stability. 

It was agreed that the next meeting of the Committee 
would be held on Tuesday, December 13, 2011.  The 
meeting adjourned at 10:30 a.m. on November 2, 2011. 

Notation Vote 
By notation vote completed on October 11, 2011, the 
Committee unanimously approved the minutes of the 
FOMC meeting held on September 20–21, 2011.

Summary of Economic Projections
 

In conjunction with the November 1–2, 2011, Federal 
Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting, the mem-
bers of the Board of Governors and the presidents of 
the Federal Reserve Banks, all of whom participate in 
the deliberations of the FOMC, submitted projections 
for growth of real output, the unemployment rate, and 
inflation for the years 2011 to 2014 and over the longer 
run.  The projections were based on information avail-
able at the time of the meeting and on each partici-
pant’s assumptions about factors likely to affect eco-
nomic outcomes, including his or her assessment of 
appropriate monetary policy.  “Appropriate monetary 
policy” is defined as the future path of policy that each 
participant deems most likely to foster outcomes for 
economic activity and inflation that best satisfy his or 
her interpretation of the Federal Reserve’s dual objec-
tives of maximum employment and stable prices.  
Longer-run projections represent each participant’s 
assessment of the rate to which each variable would be 
expected to converge over time under appropriate 
monetary policy and in the absence of further shocks. 

As depicted in figure 1, FOMC participants expected 
the economic recovery to continue at a moderate pace, 
with the growth of real gross domestic product (GDP) 
slowing this year compared with its pace in 2010 but 
then picking up gradually through 2014.  With expecta-
tions that the pace of economic growth will modestly 
exceed participants’ estimates of the longer-run sus-
tainable rate of increase in real GDP, the unemploy-

ment rate is projected to decline only gradually over 
this projection period.  As a result, participants antic-
ipated that, at the end of 2014, the unemployment rate 
would remain well above their estimates of the unem-
ployment rate that they see as consistent, over the 
longer run, with the Committee’s dual mandate of max-
imum employment and price stability.  Most partici-
pants anticipated that the factors underlying the notice-
able rise in overall inflation in 2011 would be largely 
transitory and that inflation would move lower in 2012; 
thereafter, inflation was expected to remain at levels 
roughly consistent with or below rates that they see as 
consistent with the Committee’s dual mandate.  Partic-
ipants generally viewed the rate of core inflation as like-
ly to remain at or somewhat below its 2011 level 
throughout the projection period. 

On balance, as indicated in table 1, participants antic-
ipated somewhat slower economic growth and some-
what higher unemployment relative to their projections 
in June; they raised their projections for inflation in 
2011 but left their projections for inflation from 2012 
onward about unchanged since the June meeting.  All 
of the participants made substantial downward revi-
sions to their projections for GDP growth in 2011, and 
most marked down their projections for economic 
growth in 2012 and 2013; however, participants did not 
materially alter their expectations for the normal rate of 
economic growth that would prevail in the longer run.  
Although participants continue to expect a gradual de-

   NOTE:  Projections of change in real gross domestic product (GDP) and projections for both measures of inflation are from the fourth quarter of the previous 
year to the fourth quarter of the year indicated.  PCE inflation and core PCE inflation are the percentage rates of change in, respectively, the price index for per-
sonal consumption expenditures (PCE) and the price index for PCE excluding food and energy.  Projections for the unemployment rate are for the average civi-
lian unemployment rate in the fourth quarter of the year indicated.  Each participant’s projections are based on his or her assessment of appropriate monetary 
policy.  Longer-run projections represent each participant’s assessment of the rate to which each variable would be expected to converge under appropriate
monetary policy and in the absence of further shocks to the economy.  The June projections were made in conjunction with the meeting of the Federal Open 
Market Committee on June 21–22, 2011.

cline in the unemployment rate over time, most partici-
pants revised up their projections for the path of the 
unemployment rate over the forecast period, and some 
participants also raised their projections of the longer-
run rate of unemployment compared with June.  Partic-
ipants’ projections for overall and core inflation this 
year were slightly higher than in June, but their projec-
tions for 2012, 2013, and over the longer run were 
broadly similar to those made in June. 

As indicated in figure 2, a sizable majority of partici-
pants continued to attach an unusually high level of 
uncertainty to their projections for economic growth, 
the unemployment rate, and inflation relative to histor-
ical norms.  Most participants viewed the risks to out-
put growth as being weighted to the downside and the 
risks to the unemployment rate as being weighted to 
the upside.  Most participants saw the risks to overall 
and core inflation as broadly balanced. 

The Outlook 
Participants marked their forecasts down significantly 
for real GDP growth in 2011, with the central tendency 
of their projections forming a narrow band from 1.6 to 
1.7 percent, down from 2.7 to 2.9 percent in June.  Par-
ticipants stated that the downward revision reflected 
the body of economic data received since June, particu-
larly the comprehensive annual revisions and the esti-
mate of second-quarter GDP published by the Bureau 
of Economic Analysis, which showed that the expan-
sion in real GDP in the first half of the year had been 
considerably slower than the participants had expected 
at the time of their June projections.  More-recent data 
indicated that output growth strengthened during the 
third quarter, reflecting in part a reversal of the tempo-
rary factors that had weighed on real activity earlier in 
the year, including the damping effect of higher food 
and energy prices on consumer purchasing power and 
spending as well as supply chain disruptions associated 
with the disaster in Japan.  However, several partici-
pants indicated that some of the factors contributing to 
the slowdown in GDP growth earlier in the year, in-
cluding reduced spending by state and local govern-
ments, were likely to be more persistent.  Participants 
also noted that heightened uncertainty regarding eco-
nomic and financial developments, as well as low con-
fidence among businesses and consumers, continued to 
restrain economic activity. 

Looking further ahead, participants continued to expect 
a moderate pickup in the pace of the economic recov-
ery over the next couple of years, albeit to growth rates 
somewhat below those previously projected.  The cen-

tral tendency of participants’ projections for output 
growth in 2012 was 2.5 to 2.9 percent, followed by cen-
tral tendencies of 3.0 to 3.5 percent in 2013 and 3.0 to 
3.9 percent in 2014.  Participants anticipated that the 
economic expansion would be supported by continued 
monetary policy accommodation, reduced commodity 
cost pressures, strengthening household balance sheets, 
and improving financial conditions.  However, in 
downgrading the trajectory of their projections com-
pared with those in June, participants cited a number of 
forces that were likely to restrain the pace of output 
growth over the next few years, including tighter fiscal 
policy at all levels of government, ongoing drag from 
the troubled housing sector, volatility in financial mar-
kets, and possibly reduced external demand.  Many also 
pointed to the additional headwinds of still-tight credit 
conditions for some households and smaller business-
es, weak consumer and business sentiment, persistently 
high unemployment, and slow income growth.  In addi-
tion, some participants noted that although energy and 
commodity prices had fallen back, they remain at ele-
vated levels that might weigh on spending for a time.  
The central tendency of participants’ projections for 
the longer-run rate of real GDP growth, in the absence 
of further shocks, was 2.4 to 2.7 percent, a bit slower 
than projected in June. 

In response to the ongoing weakness in labor market 
conditions and the downward revisions to their as-
sessments of the economic outlook, participants 
marked up their forecasts for the unemployment rate 
over the forecast period.  For the fourth quarter of this 
year, the central tendency of participants’ projections 
rose to 9.0 to 9.1 percent from 8.6 to 8.9 percent re-
ported in June.  Similar upward revisions were made 
for 2012 and 2013, with the central tendencies of the 
unemployment rate projections for those years now at 
8.5 to 8.7 percent and 7.8 to 8.2 percent, respectively.  
The central tendency of their unemployment rate pro-
jections for the end of 2014 was 6.8 to 7.7 percent, in-
dicating expectations for an ongoing, gradual im-
provement in the employment situation, but one that 
continued to leave the unemployment rate well above 
the 5.2 to 6.0 percent central tendency of participants’ 
estimates of the unemployment rate that would prevail 
over the longer run in the absence of further shocks.  
The upper bound of the central tendency of partici-
pants’ longer-run projections was higher than in June, 
although the range of participants’ estimates was un-
changed. 

Participants noted that measures of consumer price 
inflation had increased this year relative to both their

levels in 2010 and the projections made in June, reflect-
ing in part higher prices of oil and other commodities 
that had larger effects than previously expected.  The 
central tendency of their estimates for total personal 
consumption expenditures (PCE) inflation in 2011 rose 
to 2.7 to 2.9 percent compared with 2.3 to 2.5 percent 
in June.  Most participants anticipated that the influ-
ence of higher commodity prices and supply chain dis-
ruptions from Japan would be temporary and that infla-
tion pressures in the next several years would be sub-
dued as commodity prices stabilized, inflation expecta-
tions remained well anchored, and large margins of 
slack in labor markets kept labor costs in check.  As a 
result, the central tendency of participants’ projections 
of total PCE inflation was about 1.5 to 2.0 percent in 
2012, 2013, and 2014, similar to their forecasts in June 
and at or slightly below the 1.7 to 2.0 percent central 
tendency of their estimates of the longer-run, mandate-
consistent rate of inflation.  The central tendency of 
participants’ projections of core PCE inflation in 2011 
shifted up to 1.8 to 1.9 percent, compared with 1.5 to 
1.8 percent in June, as some of this year’s run-up in 
commodity prices passed through to core prices.  
However, the central tendencies of the projections of 
core inflation for the next three years were approx-
imately 1.5 to 2.0 percent, essentially unchanged from 
their June levels and roughly similar to participants’ 
projections for headline inflation. 

Uncertainty and Risks 
In their assessments of the uncertainty and risks asso-
ciated with their projections, a substantial majority of 
participants continued to judge that the levels of uncer-
tainty associated with their projections for economic 
growth, the unemployment rate, and inflation were 
greater than the average levels that had prevailed over 
the past 20 years.1  They pointed to a number of factors 
that raised their assessments of uncertainty regarding 
output growth and unemployment, including concerns 
about the ongoing developments in Europe, the severi-
ty of the recent recession, and the pace at which the 
numerous financial and economic headwinds buffeting 
the economy will recede.  However, slightly fewer par-
ticipants reported a higher-than-average degree of un-

                                                 
1 Table 2 provides estimates of forecast uncertainty for the 
change in real GDP, the unemployment rate, and total con-
sumer price inflation over the period from 1991 to 2010.  At 
the end of this summary, the box “Forecast Uncertainty”

economic forecasts and explains the approach used to assess 
the uncertainty and risks attending the participants’ projec-
tions. 

certainty around their inflation projections than in June.  
Participants noted that uncertainties about the pace of 
economic recovery and the effects of the Federal Re-
serve’s extraordinary monetary policy accommodation, 
as well as the timing of exit from it, were significant 
sources of uncertainty in the outlook for inflation.  
However, a number of participants highlighted that 
inflation currently remains anchored by stable longer-
term inflation expectations. 

Although several participants noted that the risks of a 
near-term recession had likely diminished, most partic-
ipants continued to judge that the balance of risks to 
economic growth was weighted to the downside (that 
is, they judged that economic growth was more likely to 
be below their projection of its most likely outcome 
than above it).  The remaining participants saw the 
risks as balanced.  The most frequently cited downside 
risks to growth included possible financial market and 
economic spillovers from an intensification of the fi-
nancial strains in Europe, vulnerabilities related to weak 
consumer and business confidence, the possible effects 
on spending of uncertainties about regulatory policy, 
and the potential consequences of larger-than-expected 
near-term fiscal consolidation.  The risks surrounding 
participants’ forecasts of the unemployment rate 
shifted higher, with a larger number of participants rel-
ative to June viewing the risks to their projections as 
weighted to the upside, and the remaining participants 
seeing the risks as broadly balanced. 

A majority of the participants continued to judge the 
risks to their projections of overall and core inflation to

be broadly balanced.  Compared with their assessments 
in June, a smaller number of participants viewed the 
risks to inflation as being weighted to the upside, and 
more participants indicated that the risks were weighted 
to the downside; the changes left the number of partic-
ipants who saw a skew in either direction more evenly 
distributed.  Some participants saw a risk that elevated 
resource slack could put more downward pressure on 
inflation than expected.  Nevertheless, some partici-
pants noted the risk that commodity prices could expe-
rience renewed volatility or have a longer-lasting influ-
ence than expected.  A few participants pointed to the 
possibility that the current highly accommodative 
stance of monetary policy, if it were maintained for 
longer than is appropriate, could lead to higher infla-
tion expectations and actual inflation; some also 
thought that fiscal imbalances could have a similar ef-
fect. 

Diversity of Views 
Figures 3.A and 3.B provide further details on the di-
versity of participants’ views regarding the likely out-
comes for real GDP growth and the unemployment 
rate over the next few years and over the longer run.  
The dispersion in these projections continued to reflect 
differences in participants’ assessments of many fac-
tors, including the underlying momentum in economic 
activity, appropriate future monetary policy and its ef-
fects on economic activity, the effects of the European 
situation, and the future path of U.S. fiscal policy.  
With much of the data for 2011 now in hand, the dis-
persion of participants’ projections of output growth 
and the unemployment rate this year narrowed substan-
tially relative to June.  The range of participants’ projec-
tions for these variables in 2012 and 2013 also nar-
rowed somewhat; however, the range of projections for 
real GDP growth in each of those years shifted to the 
lower end of the range of their June projections, and 
the range of projections for the unemployment rate 
shifted to the higher end of the June distribution.  The 
dispersion associated with participants’ longer-run pro-
jections of output growth and the unemployment rate 
changed very little, although the dispersion of their 

projections in 2014 exceeded the dispersion of their 
longer-run ranges, suggesting greater agreement among 
policymakers about the economy’s longer-run perfor-
mance than the path of convergence toward it.  A siza-
ble majority of the participants judged that, in the ab-
sence of any additional shocks, the economy would 
converge fully to its longer-run rates of GDP growth, 
unemployment, and inflation within about five or six 
years; a few participants indicated that convergence 
might take a longer period of time, and one participant 
believed convergence could occur more rapidly. 

Figures 3.C and 3.D provide corresponding informa-
tion about the diversity of participants’ outlooks for 
inflation.  The center of mass of the distributions of 
participants’ projections for overall and core PCE infla-
tion in 2011 shifted to the right relative to the ranges of 
these projections provided in June.  The dispersion of 
projections for total PCE inflation in 2012 and 2013 
changed little, although the top end of the range of par-
ticipants’ projections was somewhat higher than that of 
their projections for core inflation, suggesting that a 
few participants are concerned that elevated price in-
creases for food and energy will persist for a time.  The 
dispersion of projections for core inflation narrowed 
somewhat, driven predominantly by a decline in the 
upper end of the ranges.  The ranges of inflation pro-
jections for 2014 were similar to those for 2012 and 
2013.  In general, the dispersion of participants’ infla-
tion forecasts for the next few years represented differ-
ences in judgments regarding the fundamental determi-
nants of inflation, including the degree of resource 
slack and the extent to which resource slack influences 
inflation outcomes and expectations, as well as esti-
mates of how the stance of monetary policy may influ-
ence inflation expectations.  By contrast, the unchanged 
and relatively concentrated distribution of participants’ 
projections for overall inflation over the longer run 
continued to reflect broad similarity in participants’ 
assessments of the approximate level of inflation that is 
consistent with the Federal Reserve’s dual objectives of 
maximum employment and price stability.

Forecast Uncertainty 

  

 

The economic projections provided by 
the members of the Board of Governors and 
the presidents of the Federal Reserve Banks 
inform discussions of monetary policy among 
policymakers and can aid public understand-
ing of the basis for policy actions.  Consider-
able uncertainty attends these projections, 
however.  The economic and statistical models 
and relationships used to help produce eco-
nomic forecasts are necessarily imperfect de-
scriptions of the real world, and the future 
path of the economy can be affected by myr-
iad unforeseen developments and events.  
Thus, in setting the stance of monetary policy, 
participants consider not only what appears to 
be the most likely economic outcome as em-
bodied in their projections, but also the range 
of alternative possibilities, the likelihood of 
their occurring, and the potential costs to the 
economy should they occur. 

Table 2 summarizes the average historical 
accuracy of a range of forecasts, including 
those reported in past Monetary Policy Reports 
and those prepared by the Federal Reserve 
Board’s staff in advance of meetings of the 
Federal Open Market Committee.  The pro-
jection error ranges shown in the table il-
lustrate the considerable uncertainty associated 
with economic forecasts.  For example, sup-
pose a participant projects that real gross do-
mestic product (GDP) and total consumer 
prices will rise steadily at annual rates of, re-
spectively, 3 percent and 2 percent.  If the 
uncertainty attending those projections is simi-
lar to that experienced in the past and the risks 

around the projections are broadly balanced, 
the numbers reported in table 2 would imply a 
probability of about 70 percent that actual 
GDP would expand within a range of 2.4 to  
3.6 percent in the current year, 1.6 to 4.4 per-
cent in the second year, 1.3 to 4.7 percent in the 
third year, and 1.2 to 4.8 percent in the fourth 
year.  The corresponding 70 percent confidence 
intervals for overall inflation would be 1.5 to    
2.5 percent in the current year, 1.1 to 2.9 per-
cent in the second year, and 1.0 to 3.0 percent 
in the third and fourth years. 

Because current conditions may differ 
from those that prevailed, on average, over his-
tory, participants provide judgments as to 
whether the uncertainty attached to their pro-
jections of each variable is greater than, smaller 
than, or broadly similar to typical levels of 
forecast uncertainty in the past, as shown in 
table 2.  Participants also provide judgments as 
to whether the risks to their projections are 
weighted to the upside, are weighted to the 
downside, or are broadly balanced.  That is, 
participants judge whether each variable is 
more likely to be above or below their projec-
tions of the most likely outcome.  These judg-
ments about the uncertainty and the risks at-
tending each participant’s projections are dis-
tinct from the diversity of participants’ views 
about the most likely outcomes.  Forecast un-
certainty is concerned with the risks associated 
with a particular projection rather than with 
divergences across a number of different pro-
jections.
