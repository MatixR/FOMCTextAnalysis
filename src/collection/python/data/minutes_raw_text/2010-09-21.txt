Developments in Financial Markets and the Fed-
eral Reserve’s Balance Sheet 
The Manager of the System Open Market Account 
(SOMA) reported on developments in domestic and 
foreign financial markets during the period since the 
Committee met on August 10, 2010.  He also reported 
on System open market operations during the inter-
meeting period, including the implementation of the 
Committee’s decision at the August meeting to reinvest 
principal payments on agency debt and agency      
mortgage-backed securities (MBS) in longer-term Trea-
sury securities.  Following the August meeting, the 
Open Market Desk at the Federal Reserve Bank of 
New York announced that purchase operations would 
follow a schedule that would be released in the middle 
of each month, with the amounts calibrated to offset 
the amount of principal payments from agency debt 
and agency MBS expected to be received from the 
middle of the month to the middle of the following 
month.  The Desk conducted 12 such operations over 
the intermeeting period and purchased about $28 bil-
lion of Treasury securities, with maturities concentrated 
in the 2- to 10-year sector of the nominal Treasury 
curve, although purchases were made across both the 
nominal and inflation-protected Treasury coupon yield 
curves.  The Manager also briefed the Committee on 
progress in developing temporary reserve draining 
tools.  Over the intermeeting period, the Federal Re-
serve announced a schedule for ongoing small-value 
auctions of term deposits.  The auctions, which will be 
held about every other month, are intended to ensure 
the operational readiness of the term deposit facility 
and to increase the familiarity of eligible participants 
with the auction procedures.  In addition, the Desk 
continued to conduct small-scale tri-party reverse re-
purchase operations using MBS collateral with the pri-
mary dealers, and it published a list of money market 

mutual funds that have been accepted as counterparties 
for reverse repurchase operations.  The Manager also 
discussed plans to publish a new set of criteria that 
would allow a broader set of money market funds to 
become eligible counterparties.  There were no open 
market operations in foreign currencies for the Sys-
tem’s account over the intermeeting period.  By unan- 
imous vote, the Committee ratified the Desk’s transac-
tions over the intermeeting period. 

Staff Review of the Economic Situation 
The information reviewed at the September 21 meeting 
indicated that the pace of the economic expansion 
slowed in recent months and that inflation remained 
low.  Private businesses increased employment modest-
ly in August, but the length of the workweek was un-
changed and the unemployment rate remained elevated.  
Industrial production advanced at a solid pace in July 
and rose further in August.  Consumer spending con-
tinued to increase at a moderate rate in July and ap-
peared to move up again in August.  The rise in busi-
ness outlays for equipment and software looked to 
have moderated recently following outsized gains in the 
first half of the year.  Housing activity weakened fur-
ther, and nonresidential construction remained de-
pressed.  After falling in the previous three months, 
headline consumer prices rose in July and August as 
energy prices retraced some of their earlier decline 
while prices for core goods and services edged up 
slightly. 

The labor market situation continued to improve only 
slowly.  The average monthly increase in private payroll 
employment over the three months ending in August 
was small and was less than the average gain earlier in 
the year.  Moreover, average weekly hours of all em-
ployees were little changed, on net, in recent months 
after rising during the first half of the year.  The unem-
ployment rate ticked up in August and remained close 
to the level that has prevailed since the beginning of 
this year.  The labor force participation rate moved up 
a little in August but was still low.  Initial claims for 
unemployment insurance remained at an elevated level 
over the intermeeting period.  In addition, other indica-
tors of labor demand, such as measures of hiring and 
job vacancies, did not improve. 

Industrial production increased solidly in July and then 
rose more moderately in August.  Manufacturing pro-
duction was boosted in July by a pickup in motor ve-
hicle assemblies as automakers replenished lean stocks 
at dealers.  However, the production of motor vehicles 
was pared back in August.  More broadly, the output of

high-technology items and other business equipment 
expanded at a solid pace in July and August.  The out-
put of utilities declined over the past two months after 
it was boosted by unseasonably hot weather in the pre-
ceding two months.  Capacity utilization in manufactur-
ing ticked up further in August from its mid-2009 low, 
but it was still substantially below its longer-run aver-
age. 

Real personal consumption expenditures rose modestly 
in July, similar to the average increase over the preced-
ing two months.  Data for retail sales and the sales of 
light motor vehicles pointed to a moderate gain in real 
consumer spending in August.  Real disposable person-
al income declined a bit in July after increasing at a sol-
id pace in the second quarter.  The personal saving rate 
edged down in July but remained near the high level 
registered in the second quarter.  Indicators of house-
hold net worth were mixed; home prices moved down 
in July, while equity prices inched up, on balance, over 
the intermeeting period.  After falling back in July, con-
sumer confidence remained downbeat in August and 
early September, with households more pessimistic 
about the outlook for their personal financial situations 
and general economic conditions. 

Housing activity, which had been supported earlier in 
the year by the availability of homebuyer tax credits, 
softened further in July.  Sales of new single-family 
homes remained at a depressed level.  Sales of existing 
homes fell substantially in July, and the index of pend-
ing home sales suggested that sales were muted in Au-
gust.  Starts of new single-family houses in July and 
August were below the low level seen in June, and the 
number of new permits issued in August appeared to 
signal that little improvement in new homebuilding was 
likely in September.  House prices declined modestly in 
July after changing little, on net, in recent months.  The 
interest rate for 30-year fixed-rate conforming mort-
gages remained essentially unchanged over the inter-
meeting period at a historically low level. 

Real business spending on equipment and software 
appeared to have slowed in July after expanding rapidly 
over the preceding three quarters.  Both new orders 
and shipments of nondefense capital goods excluding 
aircraft dipped in July.  Moreover, survey indicators of 
business conditions softened further in August.  In-
coming construction data indicated that business in-
vestment in nonresidential structures decreased in the 
second quarter but at a slower pace than over the pre-
ceding year.  Increases in spending for drilling and min-
ing structures were more than offset by continued de-

clines in outlays for other types of nonresidential build-
ings.  Despite some indications that the difficult finan-
cial conditions in commercial real estate markets might 
be stabilizing, credit was still tight and vacancy rates for 
office and commercial space remained high.  In the 
second quarter, businesses appeared to build their in-
ventories at a faster pace than earlier in the year, but 
ratios of inventories to sales for most industries did not 
point to any sizable overhangs. 

Inflation remained subdued in recent months.  Head-
line consumer prices rose in July and August as energy 
prices rebounded after their decline over the previous 
three months.  At the same time, prices for core goods 
and services moved up slightly.  At earlier stages of 
production, producer prices of core intermediate mate-
rials moved down, on net, during July and August while 
most indexes of spot commodity prices increased.  
Survey measures of short- and long-term inflation ex-
pectations were essentially unchanged. 

Unit labor costs at the end of the second quarter re-
mained below their level one year earlier, as labor com-
pensation continued to increase only slowly and labor 
productivity stayed near its recent high level.  Hourly 
labor compensation—as measured by compensation 
per hour in the nonfarm business sector and the em-
ployment cost index—rose modestly during the year 
ending in the second quarter.  More recently, the year-
over-year change in average hourly earnings of all em-
ployees in July and August remained subdued.  While 
output per hour in the nonfarm business sector de-
clined in the second quarter following large increases in 
the preceding three quarters, productivity was still well 
above its level one year earlier. 

The U.S. international trade deficit narrowed in July 
after widening in June.  The rise in exports in July more 
than offset their decline in June, as overseas sales of 
capital goods rose sharply.  Most other major categories 
of exports were little changed in July, although exports 
of automotive products posted their first decline since 
May 2009.  The narrowing of the trade deficit in July 
also reflected a broad-based decline in imports follow-
ing their large increase in June.  Imports of consumer 
goods fell substantially in July, while imports of indus-
trial supplies, capital goods, and automotive products 
also moved down.  In contrast, imports of petroleum 
products remained about flat in July. 

Increases in foreign economic activity were robust, on 
average, in the second quarter.  In particular, gross do-
mestic product (GDP) grew strongly in the emerging 
market economies, even though gains in China appar-

ently moderated.  Among the advanced foreign econ-
omies, Europe posted a notable rise in economic activi-
ty in the second quarter; rapid expansion in Germany 
more than offset weaker outcomes in other euro-area 
economies, particularly those experiencing financial 
stress related to concerns about their fiscal situations 
and potential vulnerabilities in their banking sectors.  In 
Canada and Japan, the rise in real GDP slowed notice-
ably in the second quarter.  Recent indicators of foreign 
economic activity for the third quarter, including data 
on exports, production, and purchasing managers in-
dexes, generally pointed to a slowing in the pace of ex-
pansion in economic activity abroad.  Headline infla-
tion rates in foreign economies generally were re-
strained in the second quarter by a deceleration in food 
and energy prices, but prices appeared to be rising a bit 
more rapidly of late. 

Staff Review of the Financial Situation 
The decision by the Federal Open Market Committee 
(FOMC) at its August meeting to maintain the 0 to     
¼ percent target range for the federal funds rate was 
widely anticipated, but Treasury yields declined as in-
vestors reportedly focused on the indication in the ac-
companying statement that principal payments from 
agency debt and MBS in the Federal Reserve’s portfolio 
would be reinvested in longer-term Treasury securities 
and also on the characterization of the economic out-
look, which was seen as somewhat more downbeat 
than expected.  The expected path of the federal funds 
rate moved down early in the intermeeting period in 
response to weaker-than-expected economic data.  The 
Chairman’s Jackson Hole speech was reportedly viewed 
by market participants as more encouraging about eco-
nomic prospects and as providing more clarity about 
the policy options available to the FOMC, but it did 
not have a sustained effect on policy expectations.  The 
expected path of the federal funds rate rose for a time 
following the more-positive-than-expected data on 
manufacturing activity and the labor market released in 
early September, but the path ended the intermeeting 
period down on balance. 

Yields on nominal Treasury coupon securities were 
volatile and ended the period somewhat lower, particu-
larly for intermediate- and longer-term maturities.  In 
addition to Federal Reserve communications and news 
about the economic outlook, market participants 
pointed to strong demand for long-duration assets by 
institutional investors and speculation about additional 
large-scale asset purchases by the Federal Reserve as 
factors contributing to the drop in longer-term yields.  
Five-year inflation compensation based on Treasury 

inflation-protected securities (TIPS) fell, while forward 
inflation compensation 5 to 10 years ahead edged up, 
on net, over the intermeeting period but remained at a 
lower level than in the spring.  Treasury auctions over 
the intermeeting period were generally well received.  
Yields on investment- and speculative-grade corporate 
bonds moved roughly in line with those on compara-
ble-maturity Treasury securities, leaving risk spreads 
little changed.  Measures of liquidity in secondary mar-
kets for corporate bonds remained stable.  In the sec-
ondary market for syndicated leveraged loans, the aver-
age bid price moved up and bid-asked spreads edged 
down. 

Conditions in short-term funding markets continued to 
improve following the recent stresses related to con-
cerns about financial stability in Europe.  In dollar 
funding markets, spreads of term London interbank 
offered rates (or Libor) over those on overnight index 
swaps fell further at most horizons over the intermeet-
ing period.  Spreads on unsecured financial commercial 
paper were little changed at low levels.  In secured 
funding markets, spreads on asset-backed commercial 
paper remained narrow, and rates on repurchase 
agreements involving various types of collateral held 
steady.  In the September Senior Credit Officer Opin- 
ion Survey on Dealer Financing Terms (SCOOS), deal-
ers indicated, on net, that they loosened credit terms 
applicable to several important classes of counterparties 
and types of collateral over the past three months amid 
increased demand for funding for most types of securi-
ties covered in the survey. 

Broad U.S. stock price indexes edged up, on balance, 
over the intermeeting period, and option-implied vola-
tility on the S&P 500 index was little changed on net.  
The spread between the staff’s estimate of the expected 
real return on equities over the next 10 years and an 
estimate of the expected real return on a 10-year Trea-
sury note—a rough measure of the equity risk pre-
mium—remained at an elevated level.  Bank stocks 
underperformed the broader equity market and contin-
ued to be more volatile, while credit default swap 
spreads for large banking organizations edged up.  The 
greater volatility in bank stocks reportedly reflected, in 
part, the effects of domestic and international financial 
regulatory reform efforts. 

Net debt financing by U.S. nonfinancial corporations 
remained robust in August.  Gross bond issuance was 
strong, a pattern that appeared to persist into the first 
part of September.  Meanwhile, nonfinancial commer-
cial paper outstanding contracted as very low yields on 

Page 4 Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________



 
 

corporate bonds led to some substitution toward   
longer-term debt.  Measures of the credit quality of 
nonfinancial corporations remained solid.  The pace of 
initial public offerings and seasoned equity offerings by 
nonfinancial firms slowed in August, partly reflecting 
typical seasonal patterns. 

Commercial real estate markets continued to face diffi-
cult financial conditions, although some further signs 
emerged that this sector might be stabilizing.  The pric-
es of commercial properties appeared to have edged up 
in the first half of the year, and the volume of commer-
cial real estate sales rose again in August.  A few small 
commercial mortgage-backed securities (CMBS) deals 
were issued over the intermeeting period and were re-
portedly well received by investors, consistent with an 
easing of conditions and renewed interest in the CMBS 
market since the beginning of the year that was re-
ported in the SCOOS.  Nonetheless, the volume of 
CMBS issuance in 2010 remained quite low compared 
with the levels seen before the onset of the financial 
crisis, and total commercial mortgage debt continued to 
contract amid further increases in delinquency rates on 
commercial mortgages. 

For households, record-low mortgage rates supported a 
relatively high level of refinancing activity, but many 
borrowers reportedly remained unable to refinance be-
cause of insufficient home equity or poor credit histo-
ries.  Consumer credit declined in the second quarter 
and appeared to contract further in July.  Issuance of 
consumer asset-backed securities in August proceeded 
at a moderate pace that was similar to that posted in 
July.  Spreads of interest rates on consumer loans rela-
tive to the yield on the two-year Treasury note were 
little changed on balance.  The credit quality of con-
sumer loans continued to improve; delinquency and 
charge-off rates for most types of loans dropped fur-
ther in recent months, although they remained elevated. 

Bank credit expanded in August, reflecting significant 
purchases of Treasury securities and agency MBS by 
large banks.  Bank loans continued to contract, but the 
pace of contraction slowed noticeably from earlier in 
the year.  Commercial and industrial loans rose slightly 
in July, the first increase on a monthly basis since late 
2008, and held steady in August.  In addition, holdings 
of closed-end residential mortgage loans expanded 
moderately in August, reportedly spurred by refinanc-
ing activity.  However, both home equity loans and 
commercial real estate loans contracted further in Au-
gust, while consumer loans fell sharply. 

On average over July and August, M2 expanded at a 
rate slightly above its pace in the second quarter.  Liq-
uid deposits grew fairly rapidly over the two months, 
reflecting in part a compositional shift from other   
lower-yielding M2 assets.  Currency trended higher, 
while small time deposits and retail money market mu-
tual funds contracted further, as yields on these assets 
remained at extremely low levels. 

In foreign markets, concerns about the global econom-
ic outlook prompted substantial drops in equity prices 
and benchmark sovereign bond yields in many coun-
tries in August, and the dollar appreciated broadly on 
safe-haven demands.  In September, however, as better 
economic news led to some improvement in investor 
sentiment, equity prices and bond yields moved back 
up, and the dollar retraced its earlier appreciation.  
Yield spreads relative to German bunds on the 10-year 
sovereign bonds of Greece, Ireland, and Portugal wi-
dened to near-record levels over the period.  Moreover, 
euro-area bank stock prices fell on continued concerns 
about the condition of some troubled institutions. 

With the yen at a 15-year high against the dollar in  
nominal terms, Japan’s Ministry of Finance intervened 
in currency markets on September 15 to buy dollars 
against yen, and the Bank of Japan (BOJ) noted that it 
would continue to provide ample liquidity.  In reaction, 
the yen depreciated about 3 percent against the dollar, 
essentially reversing its rise over the preceding part of 
the intermeeting period.  The European Central Bank 
(ECB) said that it would continue to provide term li-
quidity by offering several more full-allotment three-
month refinancing operations through the end of the 
year.  In contrast to the continued accommodative 
stance of the ECB and the BOJ, the Bank of Canada 
increased its target for the overnight rate by 25 basis 
points to 1 percent, its third hike since June.  Several 
other central banks tightened monetary policy over the 
intermeeting period, including those of Chile, India, 
Indonesia, Sweden, and Thailand. 

Staff Economic Outlook 
In the economic forecast prepared for the September 
FOMC meeting, the staff lowered its projection for the 
increase in real economic activity over the second half 
of 2010.  The staff also reduced slightly its forecast of 
growth next year but continued to anticipate a mod-
erate strengthening of the expansion in 2011 as well as 
a further pickup in economic growth in 2012.  The sof-
ter tone of incoming economic data suggested that the 
underlying level of demand was weaker than projected 
at the time of the August meeting.  Moreover, the out-

look for foreign economic activity also appeared a bit 
weaker.  In the medium term, the recovery in economic 
activity was expected to receive support from accom-
modative monetary policy, further improvements in 
financial conditions, and greater household and busi-
ness confidence.  Over the forecast period, the increase 
in real GDP was projected to be sufficient to slowly 
reduce economic slack, although resource slack was 
anticipated to still remain elevated at the end of 2012. 

Overall inflation was projected to remain subdued, with 
the staff’s forecasts for headline and core inflation little 
changed from the previous projection.  The current 
and projected wide margins of economic slack were 
expected to contribute to a small slowing in core infla-
tion in 2011, which was anticipated to be tempered by 
stable inflation expectations.  Inflation was projected to 
change little in 2012, as considerable economic slack 
was expected to remain even as economic activity was 
anticipated to strengthen. 

Participants’ Views on Current Conditions and the 
Economic Outlook 
In their discussion of the economic situation and out-
look, meeting participants generally agreed that the in-
coming data indicated that output and employment 
were increasing only slowly and at rates well below 
those recorded earlier in the year.  Although partici-
pants considered it unlikely that the economy would 
reenter a recession, many expressed concern that out-
put growth, and the associated progress in reducing the 
level of unemployment, could be slow for some time.  
Participants noted a number of factors that were re-
straining growth, including low levels of household and 
business confidence, heightened risk aversion, and the 
still weak financial conditions of some households and 
small firms.  A few participants noted that economic 
recoveries were often uneven and were typically slow 
following downturns triggered by financial crises.  A 
number of participants observed that the sluggish pace 
of growth and continued high levels of slack left the 
economy exposed to potential negative shocks.  Never-
theless, participants judged the economic recovery to 
be continuing and generally expected growth to pick up 
gradually next year. 

Indicators of spending by businesses and households 
were mixed.  Several participants observed that data on 
retail sales had been a bit stronger than expected over 
the intermeeting period, although business contacts 
indicated that shoppers remained very price sensitive.  
There were some reports of retailers cautiously boost-
ing inventories ahead of the holiday season by some-

what more than they did a year ago.  Households were 
continuing efforts to repair their balance sheets by sav-
ing more and paying down debt.  Participants noted 
that elevated uncertainty about employment prospects 
continued to weigh on consumption spending.  Many 
businesses had built up large reserves of cash, in part 
by issuing long-term debt, but were refraining from 
adding workers or expanding plants and equipment.  A 
number of business contacts indicated that they were 
holding back on hiring and spending plans because of 
uncertainty about future fiscal and regulatory policies.  
However, businesses also indicated that concerns about 
actual and anticipated demand were important factors 
limiting investment and hiring.  Businesses reported 
continued strong foreign demand for their products, 
particularly from Asia. 

Participants noted that the housing sector, including 
residential construction and home sales, continued to 
be very weak.  Despite efforts aimed at mitigation, 
fore-closures continued to add to the elevated supply 
of available homes, putting downward pressure on 
home prices and housing construction. 

Financial developments were mixed over the intermeet-
ing period.  Banks remained generally cautious and un-
certain about the regulatory outlook, although investors 
appeared confident that U.S. banks could meet the new 
international standards for bank capital and liquidity 
that were announced over the intermeeting period.  
Improving household financial conditions were contri-
buting to better consumer loan performance, and credit 
problems more broadly appeared to have mostly 
peaked, although banks continued to report elevated 
losses on commercial real estate loans, especially con-
struction and land development loans.  Credit remained 
readily available for larger corporations with access to 
financial markets, and there were some signs that credit 
conditions had begun to improve for smaller firms.  
Asset prices had been relatively sensitive to incoming 
economic data over the intermeeting period but gener-
ally ended the period little changed on net.  Stresses in 
European financial markets remained broadly con-
tained but bore watching going forward. 

A number of participants noted that the current slug-
gish pace of employment growth was insufficient to 
reduce unemployment at a satisfactory pace.  Several 
participants reported feedback from business contacts 
who were delaying hiring until the economic and regu-
latory outlook became more certain.  Participants dis-
cussed the possible extent to which the unemployment 
rate was being boosted by structural factors such as 

Page 6 Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________



 
 

mismatches between the skills of the workers who had 
lost their jobs and the skills needed in the sectors of the 
economy with vacancies, the inability of the unem-
ployed to relocate because their homes were worth less 
than their mortgages, and the effects of extended un-
employment benefits.  Participants agreed that factors 
like these were pushing the unemployment rate up, but 
they differed in their assessments of the extent of such 
effects.  Nevertheless, many participants saw evidence 
that the current unemployment rate was considerably 
above levels that could be explained by structural fac-
tors alone, pointing, for example, to declines in em-
ployment across a wide range of industries during the 
recession, job vacancy rates that were relatively low, 
and reports that weak demand for goods and services 
remained a key reason why firms were adding em-
ployees only slowly. 

Inflation had declined since the start of the recession, 
and most participants indicated that underlying infla-
tion was at levels somewhat below those that they 
judged to be consistent with the Committee’s dual 
mandate for maximum employment and price stability.  
Although prices of some commodities and imported 
goods had risen recently, many business contacts re-
ported that they currently had little pricing power and 
that they anticipated limited, if any, increases in labor 
costs.  Meeting participants noted that several measures 
of inflation expectations had changed little, on net, 
over the intermeeting period and that analysis of the 
components of price indexes suggested disinflation 
might be abating.  However, TIPS-based inflation 
compensation had declined, on balance, in recent quar-
ters.  While underlying inflation remained subdued, 
participants saw only small odds of deflation. 

Participants discussed the medium-term outlook for 
monetary policy and issues related to monetary policy 
implementation.  Many participants noted that if eco-
nomic growth remained too slow to make satisfactory 
progress toward reducing the unemployment rate or if 
inflation continued to come in below levels consistent 
with the FOMC’s dual mandate, it would be appropri-
ate to provide additional monetary policy accommoda-
tion.  However, others thought that additional accom-
modation would be warranted only if the outlook wor-
sened and the odds of deflation increased materially.  
Meeting participants discussed several possible ap-
proaches to providing additional accommodation but 
focused primarily on further purchases of longer-term 
Treasury securities and on possible steps to affect infla-
tion expectations.  Participants reviewed the likely ben-
efits and costs associated with a program of purchasing 

additional longer-term assets—with some noting that 
the economic benefits could be small in current cir-
cumstances—as well as the best means to calibrate and 
implement such purchases.  A number of participants 
commented on the important role of inflation expecta-
tions for monetary policy:  With short-term nominal 
interest rates constrained by the zero bound, a decline 
in short-term inflation expectations increases short-
term real interest rates (that is, the difference between 
nominal interest rates and expected inflation), thereby 
damping aggregate demand.  Conversely, in such cir-
cumstances, an increase in inflation expectations lowers 
short-term real interest rates, stimulating the economy.  
Participants noted a number of possible strategies for 
affecting short-term inflation expectations, including 
providing more detailed information about the rates of 
inflation the Committee considered consistent with its 
dual mandate, targeting a path for the price level rather 
than the rate of inflation, and targeting a path for the 
level of nominal GDP.  As a general matter, partici-
pants felt that any needed policy accommodation 
would be most effective if enacted within a framework 
that was clearly communicated to the public.  The mi-
nutes of FOMC meetings were seen as an important 
channel for communicating participants’ views about 
monetary policy. 

Committee Policy Action 
In their discussion of monetary policy for the period 
immediately ahead, nearly all of the Committee mem-
bers agreed that it would be appropriate to maintain the 
target range for the federal funds rate of 0 to ¼ percent 
and to leave unchanged the level of the combined hold-
ings of Treasury, agency debt, and agency mortgage-
backed securities in the SOMA.  Although many mem-
bers considered the recent and anticipated progress 
toward meeting the Committee’s mandate of maximum 
employment and price stability to be unsatisfactory, 
members observed that incoming data over the inter-
meeting period indicated that the economic recovery 
was continuing, albeit slowly.  Moreover, the data had 
been mixed, with readings early in the period generally 
weaker than anticipated but the more-recent data com-
ing in on the strong side of expectations.  In light of 
the considerable uncertainty about the current trajecto-
ry for the economy, some members saw merit in accu-
mulating further information before reaching a decision 
about providing additional monetary stimulus.  In addi-
tion, members wanted to consider further the most 
effective framework for calibrating and communicating 
any additional steps to provide such stimulus.  Several 
members noted that unless the pace of economic re-

covery strengthened or underlying inflation moved 
back toward a level consistent with the Committee’s 
mandate, they would consider it appropriate to take 
action soon. 

With respect to the statement to be released following 
the meeting, members agreed that it was appropriate to 
adjust the statement to make it clear that underlying 
inflation had been running below levels that the Com-
mittee judged to be consistent with its mandate for 
maximum employment and price stability, in part to 
help anchor inflation expectations.  Nearly all members 
agreed that the statement should reiterate the expecta-
tion that economic conditions were likely to warrant 
exceptionally low levels of the federal funds rate for an 
extended period.  One member, however, believed that 
continuing to communicate that expectation in the 
Committee’s statement would create conditions that 
could lead to macroeconomic and financial imbalances.  
Members generally thought that the statement should 
note that the Committee was prepared to provide addi-
tional accommodation if needed to support the eco-
nomic recovery and to return inflation, over time, to 
levels consistent with its mandate.  Such an indication 
accorded with the members’ sense that such accom-
modation may be appropriate before long, but also 
made clear that any decisions would depend upon fu-
ture information about the economic situation and out-
look. 

At the conclusion of the discussion, the Committee 
voted to authorize and direct the Federal Reserve Bank 
of New York, until it was instructed otherwise, to ex-
ecute transactions in the System Account in accordance 
with the following domestic policy directive: 

“The Federal Open Market Committee seeks 
monetary and financial conditions that will 
foster price stability and promote sustainable 
growth in output.  To further its long-run 
objectives, the Committee seeks conditions 
in reserve markets consistent with federal 
funds trading in a range from 0 to ¼ percent.  
The Committee directs the Desk to maintain 
the total face value of domestic securities 
held in the System Open Market Account at 
approximately $2 trillion by reinvesting prin-
cipal payments from agency debt and agency 
mortgage-backed securities in longer-term 
Treasury securities.  The System Open Mar-
ket Account Manager and the Secretary will 
keep the Committee informed of ongoing 
developments regarding the System’s balance 

sheet that could affect the attainment over 
time of the Committee’s objectives of maxi-
mum employment and price stability.” 

The vote encompassed approval of the statement be-
low to be released at 2:15 p.m.: 

“Information received since the Federal 
Open Market Committee met in August in-
dicates that the pace of recovery in output 
and employment has slowed in recent 
months.  Household spending is increasing 
gradually, but remains constrained by high 
unemployment, modest income growth, low-
er housing wealth, and tight credit.  Business 
spending on equipment and software is ris-
ing, though less rapidly than earlier in the 
year, while investment in nonresidential 
structures continues to be weak.  Employers 
remain reluctant to add to payrolls.  Housing 
starts are at a depressed level.  Bank lending 
has continued to contract, but at a reduced 
rate in recent months.  The Committee antic-
ipates a gradual return to higher levels of re-
source utilization in a context of price stabili-
ty, although the pace of economic recovery is 
likely to be modest in the near term. 

Measures of underlying inflation are current-
ly at levels somewhat below those the Com-
mittee judges most consistent, over the long-
er run, with its mandate to promote maxi-
mum employment and price stability.  With 
substantial resource slack continuing to re-
strain cost pressures and longer-term infla-
tion expectations stable, inflation is likely to 
remain subdued for some time before rising 
to levels the Committee considers consistent 
with its mandate. 

The Committee will maintain the target 
range for the federal funds rate at 0 to         
¼ percent and continues to anticipate that 
economic conditions, including low rates of 
resource utilization, subdued inflation trends, 
and stable inflation expectations, are likely to 
warrant exceptionally low levels for the fed-
eral funds rate for an extended period.  The 
Committee also will maintain its existing pol-
icy of reinvesting principal payments from its 
securities holdings. 

The Committee will continue to monitor the 
economic outlook and financial develop-

ments and is prepared to provide additional 
accommodation if needed to support the 
economic recovery and to return inflation, 
over time, to levels consistent with its 
mandate.” 

Voting for this action:  Ben Bernanke, William C. 
Dudley, James Bullard, Elizabeth Duke, Sandra Pianal-
to, Eric Rosengren, Daniel K. Tarullo, and Kevin 
Warsh. 

Voting against this action:  Thomas M. Hoenig.  

Mr. Hoenig dissented, emphasizing that the economy 
was entering the second year of moderate recovery and 
that, while the zero interest rate policy and “extended 
period” language were appropriate during the crisis and 
its immediate aftermath, they were no longer appropri-
ate with the recovery under way.  Mr. Hoenig also em- 
phasized that, in his view, the current high levels of 
unemployment were not caused by high interest rates 
but by an extended period of exceptionally low rates 
earlier in the decade that contributed to the housing 
bubble and subsequent collapse and recession.  He be-
lieved that holding rates artificially low would invite the 
development of new imbalances and undermine long-
run growth.  He would prefer removing the “extended 

period” language and thereafter moving the federal 
funds rate upward, consistent with his views at past 
meetings that it approach 1 percent, before pausing to 
determine what further policy actions were needed.  
Also, given current economic and financial conditions, 
Mr. Hoenig did not believe that continuing to reinvest 
principal payments from SOMA securities holdings was 
required to support the Committee’s policy objectives. 

It was agreed that the next meeting of the Committee 
would be held on Tuesday-Wednesday, November 2-3, 
2010.  The meeting adjourned at 1:10 p.m. on Septem-
ber 21, 2010. 

Notation Vote 
By notation vote completed on August 30, 2010, the 
Committee unanimously approved the minutes of the 
FOMC meeting held on August 10, 2010.
