Developments in Financial Markets and the Fed-
eral Reserve’s Balance Sheet 
The Manager of the System Open Market Account 
(SOMA) reported on developments in domestic and 
foreign financial markets during the period since the 
Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) met on Au-
gust 9, 2011.  He also reported on System open market 
operations, including the continuing reinvestment into 
longer-term Treasury securities of principal payments 
received on SOMA holdings of agency debt and agen-
cy-guaranteed mortgage-backed securities (MBS).  By 
unanimous vote, the Committee ratified the Desk’s 
domestic transactions over the intermeeting period. 

Staff Presentation on Policy Tools 
The staff gave a presentation on several tools that 
could be used, within the Committee’s current policy 
framework, to provide additional monetary policy ac-
commodation to support the economic recovery.  The 
presentation first reviewed three options for managing 
the size and composition of the SOMA portfolio:  a 
reinvestment maturity extension program, a SOMA 
portfolio maturity extension program, and a large-scale 
asset purchase program.  Under the first of these op-
tions, the Federal Reserve would reinvest the principal 
payments it receives on its holdings of agency securities 
exclusively in long-term Treasury securities.  Under the 
second option, the Committee would purchase long-
term Treasury securities and sell the same amount of 

shorter-term Treasury securities; these transactions 
would significantly increase the average maturity of the 
SOMA portfolio, but the size of the Federal Reserve’s 
balance sheet and the level of reserve balances would 
be largely unaffected in the near term.  Under the third 
option, the Committee would purchase longer-term 
Treasury securities, increasing the size of its balance 
sheet and the supply of reserve balances.  The staff also 
summarized a set of options for clarifying, for the pub-
lic, the Committee’s longer-run objectives under its 
dual mandate as well as the Committee’s forward guid-
ance about the likely future stance of monetary policy.  
The options focused on ways to elucidate the economic 
conditions that could warrant raising the level of short-
term interest rates.  Finally, the staff presentation 
summarized the potential implications of reducing the 
interest rate that the Federal Reserve pays on reserve 
balances that depository institutions hold in accounts at 
the Federal Reserve Banks (the IOR rate). 

Meeting participants expressed a range of views on the 
potential efficacy of policy tools tied to the size and 
composition of the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet.  
Many judged that these policies could provide addi-
tional monetary policy accommodation by lowering 
longer-term interest rates and easing financial condi-
tions at a time when further reductions in the federal 
funds rate are infeasible.  However, a number saw the 
potential effects on real economic activity as limited or 
only transitory, particularly in the current environment 
of balance sheet deleveraging, credit constraints, and 
household and business uncertainty about the econom-
ic outlook.  Participants noted that a SOMA maturity 
extension program would not expand the Federal Re-
serve’s balance sheet or the level of reserve balances, 
and that the scale of such a program was necessarily 
limited by the size of the Federal Reserve’s holdings of 
shorter-term securities so that it could not be repeated 
to provide further stimulus.  A number of participants 
saw large-scale asset purchases as potentially a more 
potent tool that should be retained as an option in the 
event that further policy action to support a stronger 
economic recovery was warranted.  Some judged that 
large-scale asset purchases and the resulting expansion 
of the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet would be more 
likely to raise inflation and inflation expectations than 
to stimulate economic activity and argued that such 
tools should be reserved for circumstances in which the 
risk of deflation was elevated.  In commenting on the 
implications of a maturity extension program or anoth-
er large-scale asset purchase program, several partici-
pants noted that the System should avoid holding a

very large proportion of the outstanding stock of long-
er-term Treasury securities in its portfolio because the 
result could be a deterioration in market functioning.  
A number of participants suggested directing some 
purchases or reinvestments into agency MBS; however, 
a couple of participants saw such actions as unlikely to 
have benefits, or as a form of credit allocation. 

Most participants indicated that they favored taking 
steps to increase further the transparency of monetary 
policy, including providing more information about the 
Committee’s longer-run policy objectives and about the 
factors that influence the Committee’s policy decisions.  
Participants generally agreed that a clear statement of 
the Committee’s longer-run policy objectives could be 
helpful; some noted that it would also be useful to clar-
ify the linkage between these longer-run objectives and 
the Committee’s approach to setting the stance of 
monetary policy in the short and medium run.  That 
said, a number of participants expressed concerns 
about the conceptual issues associated with establishing 
and communicating explicit longer-run objectives for 
the unemployment rate or other measures of labor 
market conditions, inasmuch as the long-run equili-
brium levels of such measures are influenced impor-
tantly by nonmonetary factors, are subject to change 
over time, and are estimated with considerable uncer-
tainty.  In contrast, participants noted that the long-run 
level of inflation is determined primarily by monetary 
policy.  Accordingly, many felt that if the Committee 
were to reach a consensus on more explicit statements 
of its longer-run objectives, it would need to provide an 
in-depth explanation to the public of how those objec-
tives were determined and how they fit into the poli-
cymaking framework.  Participants generally saw the 
Committee’s post-meeting statements as not well suited 
to communicate fully the Committee’s thinking about 
its objectives and its policy framework, and agreed that 
the Committee would need to use other means to 
communicate that information or to supplement in-
formation in the statement. 

Most participants also indicated that they saw advan-
tages in being more transparent about the conditionali-
ty in the Committee’s forward guidance by providing 
more information about the economic conditions to 
which the guidance refers.  They judged that such a 
step could make the Committee’s forward guidance 
more effective and increase the likelihood that financial 
markets would respond to incoming economic infor-
mation in ways that would help monetary policy 
achieve its goals.  However, several participants saw a 
risk that any explicit statement of economic conditions 

specified in the Committee’s forward guidance could be 
mistaken for a statement of its longer-run objectives.  
Others thought this risk of misinterpretation could be 
managed through careful communications.  A number 
of participants suggested that the Committee’s periodic 
Summary of Economic Projections could be used to 
provide more information about their views on the 
longer-run objectives and the likely evolution of mone-
tary policy. 

Participants discussed whether to reduce the IOR rate, 
weighing potential benefits and costs.  A number of 
participants judged that a reduction would result in at 
least marginally lower money market rates and could 
help stimulate bank lending.  Several noted that reduc-
ing the IOR rate could help signal the Committee’s 
intention to keep the federal funds rate low.  Some par-
ticipants observed that keeping the IOR rate noticeably 
above the market rate on other safe, short-term in-
struments could be perceived as subsidizing some 
banking institutions.  However, some others noted that 
a recent change in deposit insurance assessments had 
the effect of significantly reducing the net return that 
many banks receive from holding reserve balances.  
Moreover, many participants voiced concerns that re-
ducing the IOR rate risked costly disruptions to money 
markets and to the intermediation of credit, and that 
the magnitude of such effects would be difficult to 
predict in advance.  In addition, the federal funds mar-
ket could contract as a result and the effective federal 
funds rate could become less reliably linked to other 
short-term interest rates.  Participants generally agreed 
that they needed more information on the likely effects 
of a reduction in the IOR rate in order to judge its use-
fulness as a policy tool in the current environment. 

Staff Review of the Economic Situation 
The information reviewed at the September 20–21 
meeting indicated that economic activity continued to 
expand at a slow pace and that labor market conditions 
remained weak.  Consumer price inflation appeared to 
have moderated since earlier in the year, and measures 
of long-run inflation expectations remained stable. 

Private nonfarm employment rose only slightly in Au-
gust, and job gains were weak even after adjusting for 
the effects of a strike by communications workers dur-
ing the month.  Meanwhile, employment at state and 
local governments declined further, reflecting their 
tight budget conditions.  The unemployment rate re-
mained at 9.1 percent in August, and both long-
duration unemployment and the share of workers em-
ployed part time for economic reasons were still ele-

vated.  Initial claims for unemployment insurance 
edged up, on net, over the previous few weeks, and 
many indicators of firms’ hiring plans deteriorated 
somewhat in recent months. 

Industrial production expanded solidly but unevenly in 
July and August, and the manufacturing capacity utiliza-
tion rate moved up.  Output increased markedly at 
both motor vehicle manufacturers and their upstream 
suppliers as the supply chain disruptions associated 
with the earthquake in Japan eased.  In contrast, the 
pace of factory production softened among industries 
unlikely to have been affected by the supply disrup-
tions.  Motor vehicle assemblies were scheduled to rise 
noticeably in September and then increase further in 
the fourth quarter, but broader indicators of near-term 
manufacturing activity, such as the diffusion indexes of 
new orders from the national and regional manufactur-
ing surveys, remained at levels consistent with only 
meager gains in output in the coming months. 

Real consumer spending posted a solid gain in July, in 
part reflecting a rebound in motor vehicle purchases 
from their low level in the spring when the availability 
of some models was limited.  However, nominal retail 
sales, excluding purchases at motor vehicles and parts 
outlets, only inched up in August, and sales of new 
light motor vehicles ticked down.  Real disposable in-
come edged lower in July, as gains in nominal income 
were offset by the rise in consumer prices.  Consumer 
sentiment deteriorated significantly further in August 
and stayed downbeat in early September. 

Activity in the housing market continued to be de-
pressed by weak demand, uncertainty about future 
home prices, tight credit conditions for mortgages and 
construction loans, and a substantial inventory of fore-
closed and distressed properties.  Starts and permits for 
new single-family homes in July and August stayed near 
the very low levels seen since the middle of last year.  
Sales of new and existing homes remained subdued in 
recent months, and home prices edged down further. 

Real business spending on equipment and software 
appeared to expand further.  Nominal shipments of 
nondefense capital goods increased in July, and busi-
ness purchases of new motor vehicles trended higher.  
New orders of nondefense capital goods continued to 
run ahead of shipments in July, and the expanding 
backlog of unfilled orders pointed toward further gains 
in outlays for business equipment in subsequent 
months.  In contrast, survey measures of business con-
ditions and sentiment remained at muted levels in Au-
gust and September.  Real business expenditures for 

office and commercial buildings moved up in recent 
months, but outlays were still at a very low level and 
continued to be restrained by high vacancy rates and 
tight credit conditions for construction loans.  Mean-
while, spending for drilling and mining structures in-
creased further.  Businesses seemed to be adding to 
inventories at a more modest pace in July, as the re-
stocking of motor vehicle inventories depleted by the 
earlier production disruptions was offset by slowing 
accumulation in other sectors.  In most industries, in-
ventories looked to be reasonably well aligned with 
sales. 

Real federal government purchases appeared to in-
crease in recent months as defense expenditures con-
tinued to rise from unusually low levels early in the 
year.  At the state and local level, real government pur-
chases seemed set to decline further as payrolls were 
reduced and construction spending decreased. 

The nominal U.S. international trade deficit widened in 
June but narrowed significantly in July.  Exports rose 
briskly in July, particularly in industrial supplies and 
capital goods, after having decreased in June.  Imports 
moved down in both months, as declines in petroleum 
products—reflecting both lower prices and decreased 
volumes—more than offset large gains in automotive 
products following the easing of supply chain disrup-
tions in Japan.  Trade data for July suggested that net 
exports continued to boost U.S. real gross domestic 
product (GDP) growth in the third quarter. 

Monthly U.S. consumer price inflation picked up in 
July and August after slowing in May and June, but re-
mained a bit lower than earlier in the year.  Consumer 
energy prices stepped up in July and August but only 
partially retraced their decline over the previous two 
months, and the increases in food prices were some-
what below the pace seen early in the year.  The con-
sumer price index excluding food and energy rose at 
about the same average monthly rate in July and Au-
gust as in the second quarter.  Near-term inflation ex-
pectations from the Thomson Reuters/University of 
Michigan Surveys of Consumers in August and Sep-
tember stayed well below the elevated level seen in the 
spring, and longer-term inflation expectations remained 
stable. 

Available measures of labor compensation indicated 
that wage increases continued to be restrained by the 
large margin of slack in the labor market.  Average 
hourly earnings for all employees posted a small gain, 
on net, over July and August, and their rate of increase 
from 12 months earlier remained subdued.

Foreign economic growth declined in the second quar-
ter.  Growth slowed notably in Europe; economic ac-
tivity also decelerated in the emerging market econo-
mies.  Real GDP contracted in Canada due to a large 
decline in exports.  Output also fell in Japan, reflecting 
the dislocations caused by the March earthquake.  Part 
of the downshift in global economic growth appeared 
to have been driven by temporary supply chain disrup-
tions caused by Japan’s earthquake.  Although the wan-
ing of these disruptions seemed to be supporting a re-
bound in foreign GDP growth in the third quarter, re-
cent indicators suggested only sluggish gains in underly-
ing economic activity.  With the intensification of fiscal 
and financial stress in the euro area, measures of con-
sumer and business confidence declined in August, and 
indicators of manufacturing activity in the region dete-
riorated.  For many emerging market economies, the 
recent slowing in growth of economic activity was most 
evident in exports, industrial production, and other 
indicators of manufacturing activity.  Inflation abroad 
eased in the second quarter as the effects of earlier in-
creases in food and energy prices began to fade.  More 
recently, however, increases in domestic food prices 
appeared to be pushing up consumer price inflation in 
some economies. 

Staff Review of the Financial Situation 
Financial markets were volatile over the intermeeting 
period as investors responded to mostly downbeat 
news on economic activity in the United States and 
abroad.  Fluctuations in investors’ level of concern 
about European fiscal and financial prospects also con-
tributed to market volatility. 

The expected path of the federal funds rate moved 
down appreciably over the intermeeting period.  Invest-
ors initially focused on the firmer forward guidance in 
the August FOMC statement indicating that the Com-
mittee anticipated that economic conditions were likely 
to warrant exceptionally low levels of the federal funds 
rate at least through mid-2013.  Over subsequent 
weeks, weak economic data contributed to rising expec-
tations of additional monetary accommodation; those 
expectations and increasing concerns about the finan-
cial situation in Europe led to an appreciable decline in 
intermediate- and longer-term nominal Treasury yields.  
Partly in reaction to the softer economic outlook, 
measures of inflation compensation for the next 5 years 
as well as 5 to 10 years ahead derived from nominal 
and inflation-protected Treasury securities each fell to 
the low end of their ranges for this year. 

Since early August, the equity prices of large U.S. finan-
cial institutions fell and their credit default swap (CDS) 
spreads widened.  More-pronounced declines in equity 
prices and larger increases in CDS spreads occurred for 
some European financial institutions.  Though many 
large European banks found it increasingly difficult, in 
recent weeks, to get unsecured dollar funding beyond 
the very short term, the conditions faced by U.S. finan-
cial institutions in these markets were little changed.  In 
secured funding markets, term financing reportedly 
remained readily available for both domestic and Euro-
pean financial institutions through repurchase agree-
ments backed by Treasury and agency collateral.  How-
ever, some strains emerged late in the intermeeting pe-
riod in the market for repurchase agreements backed 
by lower-quality, nontraditional collateral.  In response 
to dollar funding pressures abroad, the Bank of Eng-
land, the European Central Bank (ECB), and the Swiss 
National Bank announced that they would offer banks 
in their jurisdictions dollar loans for periods of approx-
imately three months as well as continue to offer dollar 
loans for one-week periods; the Bank of Japan added to 
its previously announced program of three-month and 
seven-day dollar loans. 

Broad stock price indexes were volatile but increased, 
on net, since the August FOMC meeting, following 
sharp declines in the days just preceding that meeting.  
Gross public equity issuance by nonfinancial firms 
weakened substantially in recent weeks, and a large 
number of planned initial public offerings were shelved 
amid the heightened market volatility. 

Spreads of yields on investment- and speculative-grade 
corporate bonds over those on comparable-maturity 
Treasury securities rose significantly over the intermeet-
ing period, reaching levels last registered in late 2009, 
and average bid prices in the secondary market for syn-
dicated leveraged loans declined.  Credit flows in Au-
gust offered additional evidence that debt markets had 
become less hospitable to lower-rated nonfinancial 
firms.  Bond issuance by speculative-grade firms nearly 
came to a halt, and the volume of new leveraged loans 
financed by institutional investors appeared to drop 
sharply after having moved down in July.  However, 
net bond issuance by investment-grade companies re-
mained robust in August despite wider spreads, and 
nonfinancial commercial paper outstanding increased 
slightly. 

In the September 2011 Senior Credit Officer Opinion 
Survey on Dealer Financing Terms, dealers reported 
only small changes in credit terms across major classes 

Minutes of the Meeting of September 20-21, 2011 Page 5_____________________________________________________________________________________________



of counterparties over the past three months.  Respon-
dents noted that the use of financial leverage by hedge 
funds decreased somewhat over the same period.  
Dealers also indicated that their clients’ willingness to 
bear risk generally had declined somewhat; that was 
particularly true of hedge funds. 

Financing conditions for commercial real estate re-
mained weak.  Issuance of commercial mortgage-
backed securities (CMBS) slowed further in July and 
August, and investors appeared to demand greater 
compensation for risk.  Prices of most types of com-
mercial properties remained depressed despite a slight 
decline in vacancy rates in the second quarter.  Delin-
quency rates on loans that back existing CMBS hovered 
at an elevated level in August, but delinquency rates on 
commercial real estate loans held by banks decreased in 
the second quarter. 

Residential MBS yields and residential mortgage inter-
est rates declined, on net, over the intermeeting period 
to historically low levels, but their spreads to yields on 
long-term Treasury securities increased.  However, low 
mortgage rates spurred little refinancing activity, in part 
because of tight underwriting standards and low levels 
of home equity for many households.  Residential 
mortgage debt contracted further in the second quarter, 
and the volume of mortgage applications to purchase 
homes moved down so far in the third quarter.  Rates 
of serious mortgage delinquency continued to mod-
erate but remained high, while the rate at which prime 
mortgages moved into delinquency stepped up, on bal-
ance, in recent months. 

Consumer credit increased at a solid pace in July, as a 
sizable increase in nonrevolving credit—driven by a 
surge in federally funded student loans—more than 
offset a decrease in revolving credit.  Issuance of con-
sumer asset-backed securities moved down in August, 
but spreads on these securities remained low.  Delin-
quency rates for several categories of consumer loans 
moved down further in recent months, with some 
reaching levels not seen since the 2008–09 recession 
began. 

Core commercial bank loans—the sum of commercial 
and industrial (C&I), real estate, and consumer loans—
expanded slightly in July and August.  C&I loans grew 
strongly, consumer loans showed tepid growth, and 
real estate loans continued to decline.  The upturn in 
lending was concentrated at large domestic and foreign 
institutions; at smaller banks, core loans declined in July 
and August at about the same pace as in recent quar-
ters. 

M2 surged in July and August, as investors and asset 
managers sought the relative safety and liquidity of 
bank deposits and other assets that make up the M2 
aggregate.  Notably, institutional investors, concerned 
about exposures of money funds to European financial 
institutions, shifted from prime money funds to bank 
deposits, and money fund managers accumulated siza-
ble bank deposits in anticipation of potentially large 
redemptions by investors.  In addition, retail investors 
evidently placed redemptions from equity and bond 
mutual funds into bank deposits and retail money mar-
ket funds. 

The foreign exchange value of the dollar increased over 
the intermeeting period, reflecting a flight to safety that 
also contributed to lower benchmark sovereign yields 
in Germany, the United Kingdom, and Canada.  In 
contrast, the yield on two-year Greek sovereign bonds 
rose sharply as market participants became increasingly 
concerned that Greece might default on its sovereign 
debt.  Equity prices in the euro area decreased over the 
intermeeting period, following sharp declines in early 
August.  After falling steeply before the August FOMC 
meeting, emerging market equity prices were little 
changed, on net, over the period. 

The European Central Bank continued to purchase, in 
the secondary market, sovereign debt of euro-area 
countries.  Yields on Italian and Spanish debt, which 
declined following reported ECB purchases in early 
August, drifted higher during the intermeeting period.  
Prices of money market futures contracts indicated that 
monetary policy was expected to become more ac-
commodative in both the euro area and the United 
Kingdom.  The Swiss National Bank took several steps 
to ease monetary policy, including intervening in the 
foreign exchange market to counter further apprecia-
tion of its currency and eventually announcing that it is 
prepared to buy unlimited quantities of foreign curren-
cy to prevent the Swiss franc from trading in the for-
eign exchange market at a rate below 1.2 Swiss francs 
per euro.  Citing concerns over the global economic 
outlook, the central bank of Brazil reduced its policy 
rate after having raised it several times earlier this year.  
In contrast, China continued to tighten its monetary 
policy, extending reserve requirements to a wider range 
of bank liabilities as it attempted to rein in off-balance-
sheet lending by its banks. 

Staff Economic Outlook 
In the economic forecast prepared for the September 
FOMC meeting, the staff lowered its projection for the 
increase in real GDP in the second half of 2011 and in 

Page 6 Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________



the medium term.  The incoming data on household 
and business spending were about as expected, on bal-
ance, but labor market conditions and indicators of 
near-term economic activity, such as consumer and 
business sentiment, were weaker than anticipated.  In 
addition, financial conditions deteriorated since the 
time of the previous forecast as investors pulled back 
from riskier assets.  Nevertheless, the staff continued to 
forecast that economic activity would increase more 
rapidly in the second half of this year than over the first 
half, as supply chain disruptions in the motor vehicle 
sector eased.  In the medium term, the staff still pro-
jected real GDP to accelerate gradually, supported by 
accommodative monetary policy, further increases in 
credit availability, and improvements in consumer and 
business confidence from their current low levels.  The 
increase in real GDP was expected to be sufficient to 
reduce the unemployment rate only slowly over the 
projection period, and the jobless rate was anticipated 
to remain elevated at the end of 2013. 

The staff’s projection for inflation was little changed 
from its forecast at the time of the August FOMC 
meeting.  The upward pressure on consumer prices 
from increases in import and commodity prices earlier 
in the year, along with the temporary boost to motor 
vehicle prices from low inventories, were expected to 
recede further in the coming quarters.  With stable 
long-run inflation expectations and considerable slack 
in labor and product markets anticipated to persist over 
the forecast period, the staff continued to project that 
inflation would be subdued in 2012 and 2013. 

Participants’ Views on Current Conditions and the 
Economic Outlook 
In their discussion of the economic situation and out-
look, meeting participants agreed that the information 
received during the intermeeting period indicated that 
economic growth remained slow but did not suggest a 
contraction in activity.  Temporary factors that had 
contributed to slower growth during the first half of 
the year had partly reversed, contributing to some re-
bound in final sales and production, particularly in the 
manufacturing sector where progress had been made in 
resolving supply chain disruptions.  But stresses in 
global financial markets, sluggish growth in households’ 
real incomes, and heightened uncertainty about eco-
nomic prospects seemed to have contributed to lower 
consumer and business sentiment and to be weighing 
on economic growth.  Recent indicators pointed to 
continuing weakness in overall labor market conditions, 
and the unemployment rate remained elevated.  Infla-
tion appeared to have moderated since earlier in the 

year as prices of energy and some commodities de-
clined from their peaks, but inflation had not yet come 
down as much as participants had expected earlier this 
year.  Labor costs remained subdued. 

Looking ahead, participants continued to expect some 
pickup in the pace of recovery over coming quarters 
but anticipated that the unemployment rate would de-
cline only gradually.  They generally judged that risks to 
the growth outlook, including strains in global financial 
markets, were significant and tilted to the downside; 
moreover, slow growth left the recovery more vulnera-
ble to negative shocks.  With longer-term inflation ex-
pectations remaining stable and the effects of past in-
creases in energy and commodity prices continuing to 
dissipate, most participants saw both core and headline 
inflation as likely to settle, over coming quarters, at or 
below the levels they see as most consistent with their 
dual mandate.  Participants continued to see the out-
look for growth and inflation as more uncertain than 
usual. 

Participants noted modest growth in consumer spend-
ing on average in recent months, with some rebound in 
purchases of new motor vehicles as manufacturers 
made progress in resolving supply chain disruptions 
and increased the availability of popular models.  Sur-
veys suggested that households were pessimistic about 
their future incomes, and consumer confidence had 
dropped to historically low levels.  Low confidence, 
continuing efforts to repair balance sheets, and height-
ened caution in the face of an uncertain economic envi-
ronment were seen as factors likely to weigh on house-
hold spending.  Several participants pointed to de-
pressed home prices and financial constraints, including 
still-tight credit conditions for many households, as 
also likely to restrain consumer spending for a time.  
However, household debt-service burdens had de-
clined, indicating that there had been further progress 
in repairing household balance sheets. 

Business sentiment had worsened, seemingly in re-
sponse to weaker economic prospects and increased 
downside risks to the outlook for U.S. and global 
growth.  Contacts at communications, technology, and 
transportation firms indicated that growth had slowed 
in those sectors; surveys also indicated that growth in 
the manufacturing sector had weakened during the 
summer.  One participant suggested that hurricanes 
and subsequent flooding had contributed to the slow-
ing in some parts of the country.  In contrast, business 
contacts reported that commodity-related sectors such 
as energy, agriculture, and mining continued to show 

Minutes of the Meeting of September 20-21, 2011 Page 7_____________________________________________________________________________________________



strong gains; tourism also appeared to be doing well.  
Exports remained a bright spot for U.S. manufacturers 
and commodity producers.  Business investment in 
equipment and software had continued to expand in 
recent months, but some contacts expressed concern 
that firms would cut capital spending if their sales 
slowed further. 

The housing sector remained depressed, with construc-
tion at very low levels and seen as likely to remain so 
given the weakness in new home sales and the continu-
ing flow of foreclosed properties into the market.  
Though mortgage rates were very low, spreads between 
mortgage rates and yields on Treasury securities were 
unusually wide.  Moreover, still-tight credit standards 
meant that many households were unable to qualify for 
loans to buy a home, and the drop in house prices in 
recent years left others unable to refinance an existing 
higher-rate mortgage.  Nonresidential construction 
generally remained weak, apart from investment in ex-
tractive industries, and forward-looking indicators of 
nonresidential construction had dropped. 

Meeting participants generally noted that overall labor 
market conditions had shown no improvement or had 
deteriorated in recent months and the unemployment 
rate remained elevated.  Even after adjusting for the 
effects of strikes on reported payrolls, the employment 
report for August showed weak job gains.  Moreover, 
both the average workweek and aggregate hours 
worked declined.  Contacts reported that slower 
growth, depressed business confidence, and uncertainty 
about the economic outlook were restraining hiring as 
well as capital investment; many also cited uncertainty 
about regulatory and tax policies as contributing to 
businesses’ reluctance to spend.  Some business con-
tacts reported that their firms had made contingency 
plans to reduce output and employment if demand for 
their products were to turn down.  Participants general-
ly agreed that sluggish job growth and the elevated un-
employment rate reflected both weak demand for 
goods and services and a mismatch between the charac-
teristics of the unemployed and the needs of the em-
ployers that currently have jobs available, but they had 
varying views about the relative importance of these 
two factors.  Many participants judged that weak de-
mand was of most importance, while a few argued that 
structural and geographic mismatches were key.  A few 
commented that business contacts reported receiving 
large numbers of applications for relatively low-skilled 
positions but having difficulty finding and hiring candi-
dates for some highly skilled positions.  Several partici-
pants again noted that the exceptionally high level of 

long-duration unemployment could lead to permanent 
negative effects on the skills and employment prospects 
of those affected and so reduce the economy’s longer-
run productive potential. 

Participants noted that financial markets were volatile 
over the intermeeting period and that financial condi-
tions were strained at times, as investors reacted to the 
incoming economic data and to news about European 
fiscal and financial developments.  Several participants 
argued that broader financial conditions had become 
less accommodative over the intermeeting period:  Risk 
spreads had widened appreciably, likely reflecting a re-
duced willingness of investors to bear risk, a weaker 
outlook for growth in the United States and globally, 
and greater uncertainty about economic prospects.  On 
the positive side, some participants noted that the re-
duction in leverage and increase in financial firms’ liq-
uidity cushions since the height of the financial crisis 
likely had attenuated the adverse effects of heightened 
risk aversion.  Contacts in the banking sector reported 
that U.S. banks remained willing to lend to qualified 
customers, but that loan demand was weak.  While not-
ing that conditions in bank funding markets had tight-
ened, particularly for European banks, participants ob-
served that the capital and liquidity positions of U.S. 
banks had strengthened in recent quarters and that the 
credit quality of both business and household loans had 
continued to improve.  Nonetheless, some large U.S. 
banks had seen further pressure on their stock prices 
and CDS spreads.  Participants agreed that, if European 
policymakers did not respond effectively, European 
sovereign debt and banking problems could intensify, 
with potentially serious spillovers to the U.S. economy.  
However, it was noted that the ECB was providing 
ample liquidity to European banks, and that it had sub-
stantial capacity to provide additional liquidity through 
its lending facilities if necessary. 

Most participants agreed that inflation appeared to 
have moderated in recent months compared with earli-
er in the year as prices of energy and some commodi-
ties declined from their peaks, though the moderation 
was not as substantial as many participants had ex-
pected.  Longer-term inflation expectations had re-
mained stable.  Most participants anticipated that, with 
stable inflation expectations, significant slack in labor 
and product markets, slow wage growth, and little evi-
dence of pricing power among firms, inflation was like-
ly to decline moderately over time.  Several suggested 
that slowing growth in the United States and abroad 
made a new surge in commodity prices unlikely.  How-
ever, some noted that core as well as headline inflation 

Page 8 Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________



had moved up, on balance, since last fall.  A few sug-
gested that the juxtaposition of higher core inflation 
and somewhat lower unemployment could mean that 
the degree of slack in labor markets and the level of 
potential output were lower than the Committee had 
thought.  Some argued that the rise in core inflation 
from very low levels reflected the accommodative 
stance of monetary policy and indicated that the large-
scale asset purchases the Committee undertook from 
November through June had been a successful re-
sponse to the deflation risks of a year ago.  Many par-
ticipants judged that the risks to the outlook for infla-
tion were roughly balanced.  Some saw medium-run 
inflation risks as tilted to the downside, in light of per-
sistent resource slack; some others argued that the ac-
commodative stance of monetary policy and the up-
ward trend in measures of core inflation this year sug-
gested inflation risks were tilted to the upside.  Partici-
pants generally judged that there was relatively little risk 
of deflation.  One commented that surveys showed 
that forecasters saw a low likelihood of deflation; a 
second, however, noted that a measure of the probabil-
ity of deflation calculated from prices of Treasury infla-
tion-protected securities (TIPS) had declined as the 
Federal Reserve conducted its second large-scale asset 
purchase program but more recently had been rising. 

Participants saw considerable uncertainty surrounding 
the outlook for a gradual pickup in economic growth.  
It was again noted that the cyclical impetus to econom-
ic expansion appeared to be weaker than in past reco-
veries, but that the reasons for the weakness were un-
clear, contributing to greater uncertainty about the eco-
nomic outlook.  Several commented that, with house-
holds and businesses seeking to reduce leverage rather 
than to borrow and with housing markets in distress, 
some of the normal mechanisms through which mone-
tary policy actions are transmitted to the real economy 
appeared to be attenuated.  Many participants saw sig-
nificant downside risks to economic growth.  While 
they did not anticipate a downturn in economic activity, 
several remarked that, with growth slow, the recovery 
was more vulnerable to adverse shocks.  Risks included 
the possibility of more pronounced or more protracted 
deleveraging by households, the chance of a larger-
than-expected near-term fiscal tightening, and potential 
spillovers to the United States if the financial situation 
in Europe were to worsen appreciably.  Participants 
agreed to consider further how best to use their mone-
tary policy and liquidity tools to deal with such shocks 
if they were to occur. 

Committee Policy Action 
In the discussion of monetary policy for the period 
ahead, most members agreed that the revisions to the 
economic outlook warranted some additional monetary 
policy accommodation to support a stronger recovery 
and to help ensure that inflation, over time, was at a 
level consistent with the Committee’s dual mandate.  
While they recognized that monetary policy alone could 
not completely address the economy’s ills, most mem-
bers judged that additional accommodation could con-
tribute importantly to better outcomes in terms of the 
Committee’s dual mandate of maximum employment 
and price stability.  Those viewing greater policy ac-
commodation as appropriate at this meeting generally 
supported a maturity extension program that would 
combine asset purchases and sales to extend the aver-
age maturity of securities held in the SOMA without 
generating a substantial expansion of the Federal Re-
serve’s balance sheet or reserve balances.  Specifically, 
those members supported a program under which the 
Committee would announce its intention to purchase, 
by the end of June 2012, $400 billion of Treasury secur-
ities with remaining maturities of 6 years to 30 years 
and to sell an equal amount of Treasury securities with 
remaining maturities of 3 years or less.  They expected 
this program to put downward pressure on longer-term 
interest rates and to help make broader financial condi-
tions more accommodative.  While the scale of such a 
maturity extension program was necessarily limited by 
the amount of shorter-term securities in the SOMA 
portfolio, most members judged the action as appro-
priate, given economic conditions and the outlook.  
Two members said that current conditions and the out-
look could justify stronger policy action, but they sup-
ported undertaking the maturity extension program at 
this meeting as it did not rule out additional steps at 
future meetings.  Three members concluded that addi-
tional accommodation was not appropriate at this time.  
The Committee discussed whether to specify the para-
meters of the maturity extension program by stating its 
intention to complete the full set of transactions by 
June 2012 or by stating that it would undertake these 
transactions at a specified monthly pace.  Members saw 
benefits to both approaches:  The former would pro-
vide the public greater clarity about the likely scale of 
the program and the latter might allow the Committee 
greater flexibility to adjust the scale of the program in 
response to unexpected economic developments.  A 
majority favored the first approach.  Members noted, 
however, that the Committee will continue to regularly 
review the size and composition of its securities hold-

ings and that it is prepared to adjust those holdings as 
appropriate. 

Most members also supported a change in the Com-
mittee’s reinvestment policy.  To help support condi-
tions in mortgage markets, the Committee decided to 
reinvest principal received from its holdings of agency 
debt and agency MBS in agency MBS rather than con-
tinuing to reinvest in longer-term Treasury securities as 
had been the Committee’s practice for more than a 
year.  The effect of this change will be to keep the 
SOMA’s holdings of agency securities at an approx-
imately constant level; under the previous practice, 
those holdings were declining on an ongoing basis.  
This change in reinvestment policy was expected to 
help reduce the spread between yields on mortgage-
backed securities and those on comparable-maturity 
Treasury securities seen this year and so contribute to 
lower mortgage rates.  Members also noted that the 
change in reinvestment policy could help prevent the 
shares of outstanding longer-term Treasury securities 
held by the Federal Reserve from reaching levels high 
enough to result in a deterioration in Treasury market 
functioning.  One member who opposed the maturity 
extension program also opposed the change in rein-
vestment policy because he judged that it would not 
benefit housing markets.  At the same time, the Com-
mittee decided to maintain its existing policy of rolling 
over maturing Treasury securities at auction. 

The Committee also decided to keep the target range 
for the federal funds rate at 0 to ¼ percent and to reaf-
firm its anticipation that economic conditions—
including low rates of resource utilization and a sub-
dued outlook for inflation over the medium run—are 
likely to warrant exceptionally low levels for the federal 
funds rate at least through mid-2013.  A couple of 
members noted that they would prefer to change the 
Committee’s forward guidance to provide greater clari-
ty about the economic conditions that would be likely 
to warrant maintaining exceptionally low levels of the 
target federal funds rate, but no decision was taken on 
this point. 

The Committee agreed that it was important to ac-
knowledge, in the statement to be released following 
the meeting, that economic growth remained slow and 
that indicators pointed to continuing weakness in over-
all labor market conditions.  It also agreed to note that 
inflation appeared to have moderated since earlier in 
the year as prices of energy and some commodities had 
declined from their recent peaks, and that longer-term 
inflation expectations remained stable.  Members gen-

erally continued to expect some pickup in the pace of 
the economic recovery over coming quarters but antic-
ipated that the unemployment rate would decline only 
gradually and agreed that there were significant down-
side risks to the economic outlook, including strains in 
global financial markets.  The Committee again antic-
ipated that inflation would settle, over coming quarters, 
at levels at or below those consistent with the Commit-
tee’s mandate as the effects of past energy and com-
modity price increases dissipate further. 

At the conclusion of the discussion, the Committee 
voted to authorize and direct the Federal Reserve Bank 
of New York, until it was instructed otherwise, to ex-
ecute transactions in the System Account in accordance 
with the following domestic policy directive: 

“The Federal Open Market Committee seeks 
monetary and financial conditions that will 
foster price stability and promote sustainable 
growth in output.  To further its long-run 
objectives, the Committee seeks conditions 
in reserve markets consistent with federal 
funds trading in a range from 0 to ¼ percent.  
The Committee directs the Desk to pur-
chase, by the end of June 2012, Treasury se-
curities with remaining maturities of approx-
imately 6 years to 30 years with a total face 
value of $400 billion, and to sell Treasury se-
curities with remaining maturities of 3 years 
or less with a total face value of $400 billion.  
The Committee also directs the Desk to 
maintain its existing policy of rolling over 
maturing Treasury securities into new issues 
and to reinvest principal payments on all 
agency debt and agency mortgage-backed se-
curities in the System Open Market Account 
in agency mortgage-backed securities in or-
der to maintain the total face value of do-
mestic securities at approximately $2.6 tril-
lion.  The Committee directs the Desk to en-
gage in dollar roll transactions as necessary to 
facilitate settlement of the Federal Reserve’s 
agency MBS transactions.  The System Open 
Market Account Manager and the Secretary 
will keep the Committee informed of ongo-
ing developments regarding the System’s bal-
ance sheet that could affect the attainment 
over time of the Committee’s objectives of 
maximum employment and price stability.” 

The vote encompassed approval of the statement be-
low to be released at 2:15 p.m.: 

Page 10 Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________



“Information received since the Federal 
Open Market Committee met in August in-
dicates that economic growth remains slow.  
Recent indicators point to continuing weak-
ness in overall labor market conditions, and 
the unemployment rate remains elevated.  
Household spending has been increasing at 
only a modest pace in recent months despite 
some recovery in sales of motor vehicles as 
supply-chain disruptions eased.  Investment 
in nonresidential structures is still weak, and 
the housing sector remains depressed.  How-
ever, business investment in equipment and 
software continues to expand.  Inflation ap-
pears to have moderated since earlier in the 
year as prices of energy and some commodi-
ties have declined from their peaks.  Longer-
term inflation expectations have remained 
stable. 

Consistent with its statutory mandate, the 
Committee seeks to foster maximum em-
ployment and price stability.  The Committee 
continues to expect some pickup in the pace 
of recovery over coming quarters but antic-
ipates that the unemployment rate will de-
cline only gradually toward levels that the 
Committee judges to be consistent with its 
dual mandate.  Moreover, there are signifi-
cant downside risks to the economic out-
look, including strains in global financial 
markets.  The Committee also anticipates 
that inflation will settle, over coming quar-
ters, at levels at or below those consistent 
with the Committee’s dual mandate as the ef-
fects of past energy and other commodity 
price increases dissipate further.  However, 
the Committee will continue to pay close at-
tention to the evolution of inflation and in-
flation expectations. 

To support a stronger economic recovery 
and to help ensure that inflation, over time, 
is at levels consistent with the dual mandate, 
the Committee decided today to extend the 
average maturity of its holdings of securities.  
The Committee intends to purchase, by the 
end of June 2012, $400 billion of Treasury 
securities with remaining maturities of          
6 years to 30 years and to sell an equal 
amount of Treasury securities with remaining 
maturities of 3 years or less.  This program 
should put downward pressure on longer-

term interest rates and help make broader fi-
nancial conditions more accommodative.  
The Committee will regularly review the size 
and composition of its securities holdings 
and is prepared to adjust those holdings as 
appropriate. 

To help support conditions in mortgage 
markets, the Committee will now reinvest 
principal payments from its holdings of 
agency debt and agency mortgage-backed se-
curities in agency mortgage-backed securities.  
In addition, the Committee will maintain its 
existing policy of rolling over maturing  
Treasury securities at auction. 

The Committee also decided to keep the tar-
get range for the federal funds rate at 0 to   
¼ percent and currently anticipates that eco-
nomic conditions—including low rates of re-
source utilization and a subdued outlook for 
inflation over the medium run—are likely to 
warrant exceptionally low levels for the fed-
eral funds rate at least through mid-2013. 

The Committee discussed the range of policy 
tools available to promote a stronger eco-
nomic recovery in a context of price stability.  
It will continue to assess the economic out-
look in light of incoming information and is 
prepared to employ its tools as appropriate.” 

Voting for this action:  Ben Bernanke, William C. 
Dudley, Elizabeth Duke, Charles L. Evans, Sarah 
Bloom Raskin, Daniel K. Tarullo, and Janet L. Yellen. 

Voting against this action:  Richard W. Fisher, Na-
rayana Kocherlakota, and Charles I. Plosser. 

Messrs. Fisher, Kocherlakota, and Plosser dissented 
because they did not support additional policy accom-
modation at this time.  Mr. Fisher saw a maturity exten-
sion program as providing few, if any, benefits in sup-
port of job creation or economic growth, while it could 
potentially constrain or complicate the timely removal 
of policy accommodation.  In his view, any reduction in 
long-term Treasury rates resulting from this policy ac-
tion would likely lead to further hoarding by savers, 
with counterproductive results on business and con-
sumer confidence and spending behaviors.  He felt that 
policymakers should instead focus their attention on 
improving the monetary policy transmission mechan-
ism, particularly with regard to the activity of commu-
nity banks, which are vital to small business lending 
and job creation.  Mr. Kocherlakota’s perspective on 

Minutes of the Meeting of September 20-21, 2011 Page 11_____________________________________________________________________________________________



the policy decision was again shaped by his view that in 
November 2010, the Committee had chosen a level of 
accommodation that was well calibrated for the condi-
tion of the economy.  Since November, inflation, and 
the one-year-ahead forecast for inflation, had risen, 
while unemployment, and the one-year-ahead forecast 
for unemployment, had fallen. He did not believe that 
providing more monetary accommodation was the ap-
propriate response to those changes in the economy, 
given the current policy framework.  Mr. Plosser felt 
that a maturity extension program would do little to 
improve near-term growth or employment, in light of 
the ongoing structural adjustments and fiscal challenges 
both in the United States and abroad.  Moreover, in his 
view, with inflation continuing to run above earlier 
forecasts, such a program could risk adding unwanted 
inflationary pressures and complicate the eventual exit 
from the period of extraordinarily accommodative 
monetary policy. 

Following the policy vote, the Manager of the System 
Open Market Account summarized how the Desk 
would implement the Committee’s decisions.  To im-
plement the maturity extension program, the Desk 
would distribute purchases about evenly across nominal 
Treasury securities with 6 to 8 years to maturity, with 8 
to 10 years to maturity, and with 10 to 30 years to ma-
turity; the Desk would also buy a small amount of TIPS 
with remaining maturities of 6 to 30 years.  This distri-
bution would allocate a much larger share of purchases 

to longer maturities than was the case in the Commit-
tee’s previous asset purchase programs.  At the same 
time, the Desk would sell, from the SOMA portfolio, 
Treasury securities with remaining maturities of 3 
months to 3 years.  All Treasury purchases and sales 
would be conducted using competitive auctions.  With 
respect to the MBS reinvestment program, the Desk 
would concentrate purchases in newly issued agency-
backed MBS and would conduct purchases through a 
competitive bidding process. 

It was agreed that the next meeting of the Committee 
would be held on Tuesday–Wednesday, November 1-2, 
2011.  The meeting adjourned at 12:30 p.m. on Sep-
tember 21, 2011. 

Secretary’s Note:  The following information 
regarding the June 21–22, 2011 FOMC 
meeting was inadvertently omitted from pre-
vious minutes.  By unanimous vote at that 
meeting, the Committee ratified the Desk’s 
domestic transactions since the April 26-27, 
2011 meeting, and by notation vote com-
pleted on July 11, 2011, the Committee un-
animously approved the minutes of the June 
21–22 FOMC meeting.
