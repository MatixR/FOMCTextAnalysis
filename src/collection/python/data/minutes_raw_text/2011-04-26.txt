Developments in Financial Markets and the Fed-
eral Reserve’s Balance Sheet 
The Manager of the System Open Market Account 
(SOMA) reported on developments in domestic and 
foreign financial markets during the period since the 
Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) met on 
March 15, 2011.  He also reported on System open 
market operations, including the continuing reinvest-
ment into longer-term Treasury securities of principal 
payments received on the SOMA’s holdings of agency 
debt and agency-guaranteed mortgage-backed securities 
(MBS) as well as the ongoing purchases of additional 
Treasury securities first authorized in November 2010.  
Since November, purchases by the Open Market Desk 
of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York had in-
creased the SOMA’s holdings by $422 billion.  The 
Manager reported on the U.S. authorities’ participation 
in the coordinated foreign exchange intervention an-
nounced by the Group of Seven (G-7) finance minis-
ters and central bank governors on March 17, 2011.  By 
unanimous votes, the Committee ratified the Desk’s 
domestic and foreign exchange market transactions 
over the intermeeting period. 

By unanimous vote, the Committee agreed to extend 
the reciprocal currency (swap) arrangements with the 
Bank of Canada and the Banco de México for an addi-
tional year beginning in mid-December 2011; these 
arrangements are associated with the Federal Reserve’s 
participation in the North American Framework 

Agreement of 1994.  The arrangement with the Bank of 
Canada is in the amount of $2 billion equivalent, and 
the arrangement with the Banco de México is in the 
amount of $3 billion equivalent.  The vote to renew the 
System’s participation in these swap arrangements was 
taken at this meeting because of a provision in the ar-
rangements that requires each party to provide six 
months’ prior notice of an intention to terminate its 
participation. 

The staff next gave a presentation on strategies for 
normalizing the stance and conduct of monetary policy 
over time as the economy strengthens.  Normalizing 
the stance of policy would entail the withdrawal of the 
current extraordinary degree of accommodation at the 
appropriate time, while normalizing the conduct of policy 
would involve draining the large volume of reserve bal-
ances in the banking system and shrinking the overall 
size of the balance sheet, as well as returning the 
SOMA to its historical composition of essentially only 
Treasury securities.  The presentation noted a few key 
issues that the Committee would need to address in 
deciding on its approach to normalization.  The first 
key issue was the extent to which the Committee would 
want to tighten policy, at the appropriate time, by in-
creasing short-term interest rates, by decreasing its 
holdings of longer-term securities, or both.  Because 
the two policies would restrain economic activity by 
tightening financial conditions, they could be combined 
in various ways to achieve similar outcomes.  For ex-
ample, in principle, the Committee could accomplish 
essentially the same degree of monetary tightening by 
selling assets sooner and faster but raising the target for 
the federal funds rate later and more slowly, or by sell-
ing assets later and more slowly but increasing the fed-
eral funds rate target sooner and faster.  The SOMA 
portfolio could be reduced by selling securities outright, 
by ceasing the reinvestment of principal payments on 
its securities holdings, or both.  A second key issue was 
the extent to which the Committee might choose to 
vary the pace of any asset sales it undertakes in re-
sponse to economic and financial conditions.  If it 
chose to make the pace of sales quite responsive to 
conditions, the FOMC would be able to actively use 
two policy instruments—asset sales and the federal 
funds rate target—to pursue its economic objectives, 
which could increase the scope and flexibility for ad-
justing financial conditions.  In contrast, sales at a pace 
that varied less with changes in economic and financial 
conditions and was preannounced and largely prede-
termined would leave the federal funds rate target as 
the Committee’s primary active policy instrument, 

Page 2 Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________



which could result in policy that is more straightfor-
ward for the Committee to calibrate and to communi-
cate.  Finally, the staff presentation noted that the 
Committee would need to decide if and when to use 
the tools that it has developed to temporarily reduce 
reserve balances—reverse repurchase agreements and 
term deposits—in order to tighten the correspondence 
between any changes in the interest rate the Federal 
Reserve pays on excess reserves and the changes in the 
federal funds rate. 

Meeting participants agreed on several principles that 
would guide the Committee’s strategy for normalizing 
monetary policy.  First, with regard to the normaliza-
tion of the stance of monetary policy, the pace and se-
quencing of the policy steps would be driven by the 
Committee’s monetary policy objectives for maximum 
employment and price stability.  Participants noted that 
the Committee’s decision to discuss the appropriate 
strategy for normalizing the stance of policy at the cur-
rent meeting did not mean that the move toward such 
normalization would necessarily begin soon.  Second, 
to normalize the conduct of monetary policy, it was 
agreed that the size of the SOMA’s securities portfolio 
would be reduced over the intermediate term to a level 
consistent with the implementation of monetary policy 
through the management of the federal funds rate ra-
ther than through variation in the size or composition 
of the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet.  Third, over the 
intermediate term, the exit strategy would involve re-
turning the SOMA to holding essentially only Treasury 
securities in order to minimize the extent to which the 
Federal Reserve portfolio might affect the allocation of 
credit across sectors of the economy.  Such a shift was 
seen as requiring sales of agency securities at some 
point.  And fourth, asset sales would be implemented 
within a framework that had been communicated to the 
public in advance, and at a pace that potentially could 
be adjusted in response to changes in economic or fi-
nancial conditions.   

In addition, nearly all participants indicated that the 
first step toward normalization should be ceasing to 
reinvest payments of principal on agency securities and, 
simultaneously or soon after, ceasing to reinvest prin-
cipal payments on Treasury securities.  Most partici-
pants viewed halting reinvestments as a way to begin to 
gradually reduce the size of the balance sheet.  It was 
noted, however, that ending reinvestments would con-
stitute a modest step toward policy tightening, implying 
that that decision should be made in the context of the 
economic outlook and the Committee’s policy objec-
tives.  In addition, changes in the statement language 

regarding forward policy guidance would need to ac-
company the normalization process. 

Participants expressed a range of views on some as-
pects of a normalization strategy.  Most participants 
indicated that once asset sales became appropriate, 
such sales should be put on a largely predetermined 
and preannounced path; however, many of those par-
ticipants noted that the pace of sales could nonetheless 
be adjusted in response to material changes in the eco-
nomic outlook.  Several other participants preferred 
instead that the pace of sales be a key policy tool and 
be varied actively in response to changes in the out-
look.  A majority of participants preferred that sales of 
agency securities come after the first increase in the 
FOMC’s target for short-term interest rates, and many 
of those participants also expressed a preference that 
the sales proceed relatively gradually, returning the 
SOMA’s composition to all Treasury securities over 
perhaps five years.  Participants noted that, for any giv-
en degree of policy tightening, more-gradual sales that 
commenced later in the normalization process would 
allow for an earlier increase of the federal funds rate 
target from its effective lower bound than would be the 
case if asset sales commenced earlier and at a more rap-
id pace.  As a result, the Committee would later have 
the option of easing policy with an interest rate cut if 
economic conditions then warranted.  An earlier in-
crease in the federal funds rate was also mentioned as 
helpful to limit the potential for the very low level of 
that rate to encourage financial imbalances.  A few par-
ticipants expressed a preference that sales begin before 
any increase in the federal funds rate target, and a few 
other participants indicated that sales and increases in 
the federal funds rate target should commence at the 
same time.  The participants who favored earlier sales 
also generally indicated a preference for relatively rapid 
sales, with some suggesting that agency securities in the 
SOMA be reduced to zero over as little as one or two 
years.  Such an approach was viewed as allowing for a 
faster return to a normal policy environment, potential-
ly reducing any upside risks to inflation stemming from 
outsized reserve balances, and more quickly eliminating 
any effects of SOMA holdings of agency securities on 
the allocation of credit.   

Most participants saw changes in the target for the fed-
eral funds rate as the preferred active tool for tighten-
ing monetary policy when appropriate.  A number of 
participants noted that it would be advisable to begin 
using the temporary reserves-draining tools in advance 
of an increase in the Committee’s federal funds rate 
target, in part because doing so would put the Federal

Reserve in a better position to assess the effectiveness 
of the draining tools and judge the size of draining op-
erations that might be required to support changes in 
the interest on excess reserves (IOER) rate in imple-
menting a desired increase in short-term rates.  A num-
ber of participants also noted that they would be pre-
pared to sell securities sooner if the temporary reserves- 
draining operations and the end of the reinvestment of 
principal payments were not sufficient to support a 
fairly tight link between increases in the IOER rate and 
increases in short-term market interest rates. 

In the discussion of normalization, some participants 
also noted their preferences about the longer-run 
framework for monetary policy implementation.  Most 
of these participants indicated that they preferred that 
monetary policy eventually operate through a corridor-
type system in which the federal funds rate trades in the 
middle of a range, with the IOER rate as the floor and 
the discount rate as the ceiling of the range, as opposed 
to a floor-type system in which a relatively high level of 
reserve balances keeps the federal funds rate near the 
IOER rate.  A couple of participants noted that any 
normalization strategy would likely involve an elevated 
balance sheet with the federal funds rate target near the 
IOER rate—as in floor-type systems—for some time, 
and therefore the Committee would accumulate expe-
rience during the process of normalizing policy that 
would allow it to make a more informed choice regard-
ing the longer-term framework at a later date.  

The Committee agreed that more discussion of these 
issues was needed, and no decisions regarding the 
Committee’s strategy for normalizing policy were made 
at this meeting.  

Staff Review of the Economic Situation 
The information reviewed at the April 26–27 meeting 
indicated, on balance, that economic activity expanded 
at a moderate pace in recent months, and labor market 
conditions continued to improve gradually.  Headline 
consumer price inflation was boosted by large increases 
in food and energy prices, but measures of underlying 
inflation were still subdued and longer-run inflation 
expectations remained stable. 

Private nonfarm payroll employment increased again in 
March, and the gains in hiring for the first quarter as a 
whole were somewhat above the pace seen in the 
fourth quarter.  A number of indicators of job open-
ings and hiring plans improved in February and March.  
Although initial claims for unemployment insurance 
were flat, on net, from early March through the middle 
of April, they remained lower than earlier in the year.  

The unemployment rate edged down further to 
8.8 percent in March, while the labor force participa-
tion rate was unchanged.  However, both long-duration 
unemployment and the share of workers employed part 
time for economic reasons were still very high. 

Industrial production in the manufacturing sector ex-
panded at a robust pace in February and March.  The 
manufacturing capacity utilization rate moved up fur-
ther, though it continued to be a good bit lower than its 
longer-run average.  Most forward-looking indicators 
of industrial activity, such as the new orders indexes in 
the national and regional manufacturing surveys, re-
mained at levels consistent with solid gains in produc-
tion in the near term.  However, motor vehicle assem-
blies were expected to step down in the second quarter 
from their level in March, reflecting emerging shortages 
of specialized components imported from Japan. 

The rise in consumer spending appeared to have 
slowed to a moderate rate in the first quarter from the 
stronger pace posted in the fourth quarter of last year.  
Total real personal consumption expenditures picked 
up in February after being about unchanged in January.  
Nominal retail sales, excluding purchases at motor ve-
hicles and parts outlets, posted a sizable gain in March, 
but sales of new light motor vehicles declined some-
what.  Real disposable income edged down in February 
following an increase in January that reflected the tem-
porary reduction in payroll taxes.  In addition, consum-
er sentiment declined noticeably in March and re-
mained relatively downbeat in early April. 

Activity in the housing market remained very weak, as 
the large overhang of foreclosed and distressed proper-
ties continued to restrain new construction.  Starts and 
permits of new single-family homes inched down, on 
net, in February and March, and they have been essen-
tially flat since around the middle of last year.  Demand 
for housing also continued to be depressed.  Sales of 
new and existing homes moved lower, on net, in Feb-
ruary and March, while measures of home prices slid 
further in February. 

Real business investment in equipment and software 
(E&S) appeared to have increased more robustly in the 
first quarter than in the fourth quarter of last year.  
Nominal shipments of nondefense capital goods rose 
in February and March, and businesses’ purchases of 
new vehicles trended higher.  New orders of nonde-
fense capital goods continued to run ahead of ship-
ments in February and March, and this expanding 
backlog of unfilled orders pointed to further increases 
in shipments in subsequent months.  In addition, sur-

Page 4 Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________



vey measures of business conditions and sentiment in 
recent months were consistent with continued robust 
gains in E&S spending.  In contrast, business outlays 
for nonresidential construction remained extremely 
weak in February, restrained by high vacancy rates, low 
prices for office and commercial properties, and tight 
credit conditions for commercial real estate lending. 

Real nonfarm inventory investment appeared to have 
moved up to a moderate pace in the first quarter after 
slowing sharply in the preceding quarter.  Motor ve-
hicle inventories were drawn down more slowly in the 
first quarter than in the fourth quarter, while data 
through February suggested that the pace of stock-
building outside of motor vehicles had picked up a bit.  
Book-value inventory-to-sales ratios in February were 
in line with their pre-recession norms, and survey data 
in March provided little evidence that businesses per-
ceived that their inventories were too high. 

The available data on government spending indicated 
that real federal purchases fell in the first quarter, led by 
a reduction in defense outlays.  Real expenditures by 
state and local governments also appeared to have de-
clined, as outlays for construction projects decreased 
further in February to a level well below that in the 
fourth quarter, and state and local employment contin-
ued to contract in March. 

The U.S. international trade deficit narrowed slightly in 
February after widening sharply in January.  Following 
a solid increase in January, exports fell back some in 
February, with declines widespread across categories.  
Imports also declined in February after posting large 
gains in January.  On average, the trade deficit in Janu-
ary and February was wider than in the fourth quarter. 

Overall U.S. consumer price inflation moved up further 
in February and March, as increases in the prices of 
energy and food commodities continued to be passed 
through to the retail level.  More recently, survey data 
through the middle of April pointed to additional in-
creases in retail gasoline prices, while increases in the 
prices of food commodities appeared to have mod-
erated somewhat.  Excluding food and energy, core 
consumer price inflation remained relatively subdued.  
Although core consumer price inflation over the first 
three months of the year stepped up somewhat, the  
12-month change in the core consumer price index 
through March was essentially the same as it was a year 
earlier.  Near-term inflation expectations from the 
Thomson Reuters/University of Michigan Surveys of 
Consumers remained elevated in early April.  But  
longer-term inflation expectations moved down in early 

April—reversing their uptick in March—and stayed 
within the range that has prevailed over the past several 
years. 

Available measures of labor compensation suggested 
that wage increases continued to be restrained by the 
presence of a large margin of slack in the labor market.  
Average hourly earnings for all employees were flat in 
March, and their average rate of increase over the pre-
ceding 12 months remained low. 

The pace of recovery abroad appeared to have    
strengthened earlier this year, but the disaster in Japan 
raised uncertainties about foreign activity in the near 
term.  In the euro area, production expanded at a solid 
pace, though indicators of consumer spending       
weakened.  While measures of economic activity in 
Germany posted strong gains, economic conditions in 
Greece and Portugal deteriorated further.  The damage 
caused by the earthquake and tsunami in Japan ap-
peared to be sharply curtailing Japanese economic ac-
tivity and posed concerns about disruptions to supply 
chains and production in other economies.  Emerging 
market economies (EMEs) continued to expand rapid-
ly.  Rising prices of oil and other commodities boosted 
inflation in foreign economies.  However, core inflation 
remained subdued in most of the advanced foreign 
economies, and inflation in the EMEs seemed to have 
declined as food price inflation slowed. 

Staff Review of the Financial Situation 
The decisions by the FOMC at its March meeting to 
continue its asset purchase program and to maintain 
the 0 to ¼ percent target range for the federal funds 
rate were in line with market expectations; nonetheless, 
the accompanying statement prompted a modest rise in 
nominal yields, as market participants reportedly per-
ceived a somewhat more optimistic tone in the Com-
mittee’s economic outlook, as well as heightened con-
cern about inflation risks.  Over the intermeeting pe-
riod, yields on nominal Treasury securities changed 
little, on net, amid swings in investors’ assessments of 
global risks.  Short-term funding rates, including the 
effective federal funds rate, shifted down several basis 
points in early April following a change in the Federal 
Deposit Insurance Corporation’s deposit insurance 
assessment system.  On net, the expected path of the 
federal funds rate over the next two years was little 
changed over the intermeeting period. 

Measures of inflation compensation over the next 
5 years based on nominal and inflation-protected   
Treasury securities increased slightly, on net, over the 
intermeeting period, partly reflecting the ongoing rise in 

Minutes of the Meeting of April 26-27, 2011 Page 5_____________________________________________________________________________________________



commodity prices.  Staff models suggested that the 
modest increase in inflation compensation 5 to 10 years 
ahead was mostly attributable to increases in liquidity 
and inflation-risk premiums rather than higher ex-
pected inflation. 

Over the intermeeting period, yields on corporate 
bonds were generally little changed, on net, and spreads 
of investment- and speculative-grade corporate bonds 
relative to comparable-maturity Treasury securities nar-
rowed slightly.  Average secondary-market prices for 
syndicated leveraged loans moved up further.  Howev-
er, conditions in the municipal bond market remained 
somewhat strained. 

Broad U.S. stock price indexes rose, on net, over the 
intermeeting period, as initial reports of better-than-
expected first-quarter earnings lifted stock prices in late 
April.  Option-implied volatility on the S&P 500 index 
was moderately lower, on net, ending the intermeeting 
period at the low end of its recent range.   

Net debt financing by nonfinancial corporations re-
mained robust in March.  Net issuance of investment- 
and speculative-grade bonds by nonfinancial corpora-
tions continued to be strong, and outstanding amounts 
of commercial and industrial (C&I) loans and nonfi-
nancial commercial paper increased noticeably.  Gross 
public equity issuance by nonfinancial firms was robust 
in March, and indicators of the credit quality of nonfi-
nancial firms improved further. 

Commercial mortgage markets showed some signs of 
stabilization.  Delinquency rates for commercial real 
estate loans appeared to have leveled off in recent 
months.  Issuance of commercial mortgage-backed 
securities picked up in the first quarter, although com-
mercial real estate loans at banks continued to run off.  
In commercial real estate markets, property sales re-
mained tepid, and prices stayed at depressed levels. 

Rates on conforming fixed-rate residential mortgages 
rose modestly during the intermeeting period, and their 
spreads relative to 10-year Treasury yields narrowed 
slightly.  Mortgage refinancing activity remained near its 
lowest level in more than two years.  The Treasury De-
partment’s announcement in late March that it would 
begin selling its holdings of agency MBS at a gradual 
pace had little lasting effect on MBS spreads.  The Fed-
eral Reserve began competitive sales of the non-agency 
residential MBS held by Maiden Lane II LLC; initial 
sales met with strong demand, but market prices of 
non-agency residential MBS were reportedly little 
changed overall.  The rates of serious delinquencies for 

subprime and prime mortgages were nearly unchanged 
but remained at elevated levels.  However, the rate of 
new delinquencies on prime mortgages declined fur-
ther. 

Conditions in consumer credit markets continued to 
improve gradually.  Total consumer credit growth 
picked up in February, as a gain in nonrevolving credit 
more than offset a further contraction in revolving cre-
dit.  Delinquency and charge-off rates for credit card 
debt moved down in recent months and approached 
pre-crisis levels.  Issuance of consumer asset-backed 
securities remained steady in the first quarter of the 
year. 

Bank credit was about unchanged in March after de-
clining, on average, in January and February.  Core 
loans—the sum of C&I, real estate, and consumer 
loans—continued to contract, while holdings of securi-
ties increased moderately.  The Senior Loan Officer 
Opinion Survey on Bank Lending Practices conducted 
in April indicated that, on net, bank lending standards 
and terms had eased somewhat further during the first 
quarter of the year and demand for C&I loans, com-
mercial mortgages, and auto loans had increased, while 
demand for residential mortgages continued to decline.  

M2 expanded at a moderate pace in March.  Liquid 
deposits, the largest component of M2, advanced at a 
solid pace likely reflecting very low opportunity costs 
of holding such deposits.  Currency advanced signifi-
cantly, supported by robust foreign demand for U.S. 
bank notes. 

Foreign sovereign bond yields generally were little 
changed and equity prices rose, on net, over the inter-
meeting period, although equity prices in Japan re-
mained below their pre-earthquake levels despite the 
record amounts of liquidity injected by the Bank of 
Japan and the expansion of its asset purchase program.  
The European Central Bank raised its main policy rate 
25 basis points to 1¼ percent during the intermeeting 
period, and markets appeared to have priced in addi-
tional rate increases over the rest of the year.  The Bank 
of England and the Bank of Canada left their policy 
rates unchanged, but quotes from futures markets con-
tinued to suggest that both central banks would raise 
rates later this year.  China’s monetary authority further 
increased banks’ lending rates and deposit rates and 
continued to tighten reserve requirements; monetary 
policy in a number of other EMEs was also tightened 
over the intermeeting period.

The broad nominal index of the U.S. dollar declined 
more than 2 percent over the intermeeting period, 
though the dollar appreciated, on net, against the Japa-
nese yen.  The yen strengthened to an all-time high 
against the dollar after the earthquake in Japan, but this 
move was more than reversed when the G-7 countries 
intervened to sell yen.   

In early April, the Portuguese government requested 
financial support from the European Union and the 
International Monetary Fund, but market participants 
reportedly remained concerned about whether the Por-
tuguese government would reach agreement on an as-
sociated fiscal consolidation plan.  Later in the inter-
meeting period, yields on Greece’s and other peripheral 
European countries’ sovereign debt jumped, reflecting 
heightened market focus on a possible restructuring of 
Greek sovereign debt. 

Staff Economic Outlook 
With the recent data on spending somewhat weaker, on 
balance, than the staff had expected at the time of the 
March FOMC meeting, the staff revised down its pro-
jection for the rate of increase in real gross domestic 
product (GDP) over the first half of 2011.  The effects 
from the disaster in Japan were also anticipated to tem-
porarily hold down real GDP growth in the near term.  
Over the medium term, the staff’s outlook for the pace 
of economic growth was broadly similar to its previous 
forecast:  As in the March projection, the staff expected 
real GDP to increase at a moderate rate through 2012, 
with the ongoing recovery in activity receiving contin-
ued support from accommodative monetary policy, 
increasing credit availability, and further improvements 
in household and business confidence.  The average 
pace of GDP growth was expected to be sufficient to 
gradually reduce the unemployment rate over the pro-
jection period, though the jobless rate was anticipated 
to remain elevated at the end of 2012. 

Recent increases in consumer food and energy prices, 
together with the small uptick in core consumer price 
inflation, led the staff to raise its near-term projection 
for consumer price inflation.  However, inflation was 
expected to recede over the medium term, as food and 
energy prices were anticipated to decelerate.  As in pre-
vious forecasts, the staff expected core consumer price 
inflation to remain subdued over the projection period, 
reflecting stable longer-term inflation expectations and 
persistent slack in labor and product markets. 

Participants’ Views on Current Conditions and the 
Economic Outlook 
In conjunction with this FOMC meeting, all meeting 
participants—the five members of the Board of Gov-
ernors and the presidents of the 12 Federal Reserve 
Banks—provided projections of output growth, the 
unemployment rate, and inflation for each year from 
2011 through 2013 and over the longer run.  Longer-
run projections represent each participant’s assessment 
of the rate to which each variable would be expected to 
converge, over time, under appropriate monetary policy 
and in the absence of further shocks.  Participants’ 
forecasts are described in the Summary of Economic 
Projections, which is attached as an addendum to these 
minutes. 

In discussing intermeeting developments and their im-
plications for the economic outlook, participants 
agreed that the information received since their pre-
vious meeting was broadly consistent with continuation 
of a moderate economic recovery, despite an unex-
pected slowing in the pace of economic growth in the 
first quarter.  While construction activity remained 
anemic, measures of consumer spending and business 
investment continued to expand and labor market con-
ditions continued to improve gradually.  Participants 
viewed the weakness in first-quarter economic growth 
as likely to be largely transitory, influenced by unusually 
severe weather, increases in energy and other commod-
ity prices, and lower-than-expected defense spending.  
As a result, they saw economic growth picking up later 
this year.   

Participants’ forecasts for economic growth for 2012 
and 2013 were largely unchanged from their January 
projections and continued to indicate expectations that 
the recovery will strengthen somewhat over time.  
Nonetheless, the pickup in the pace of the economic 
expansion was expected to be limited, reflecting the 
effects of high energy prices, modest changes in hous-
ing wealth, subdued real income gains, and fiscal con-
traction at the federal, state, and local levels.  Partici-
pants continued to project the unemployment rate to 
decline gradually over the forecast period but to remain 
elevated compared with their assessments of its longer-
run level.  Participants revised up their projections for 
total inflation in 2011, reflecting recent increases in 
energy and other commodity prices, but they generally 
anticipated that the recent increase in inflation would 
be transitory as commodity prices stabilize and inflation 
expectations remain anchored.  However, they all 
agreed on the importance of closely monitoring devel-
opments regarding inflation and inflation expectations. 

Minutes of the Meeting of April 26-27, 2011 Page 7_____________________________________________________________________________________________



Participants’ judgment that the recovery was continuing 
at a moderate pace reflected both the incoming eco-
nomic indicators and information received from busi-
ness contacts.  Growth in consumer spending remained 
moderate despite the effects of higher gasoline and 
food prices, which appeared to have largely offset the 
increase in disposable income from the payroll tax cut.  
Participants noted that these higher prices had weighed 
on consumer sentiment about near-term economic 
conditions but that underlying fundamentals for con-
tinued moderate growth in spending remained in place.  
These underlying factors included continued improve-
ment in household balance sheets, easing credit condi-
tions, and strengthening labor markets. 

Activity in the industrial sector also expanded further.  
Industrial production posted solid gains, and, while the 
most recent readings from some of the regional manu-
facturing surveys showed small declines, in some cases 
these were from near-record highs.  Manufacturers re-
mained upbeat, although automakers were reporting 
some difficulties in obtaining parts normally produced 
in Japan, which might weigh on motor vehicle produc-
tion in the current quarter.  Investment in equipment 
and software was fairly robust.  In contrast, the housing 
sector remained distressed, with house prices flat to 
down and a large overhang of vacant properties re-
straining new construction, although reports indicated 
that sales volumes and traffic were higher in a few 
areas.  Activity in the commercial real estate sector con-
tinued to be weak.  

Several participants indicated that, in contrast to the 
somewhat weaker recent economic data, their business 
contacts were more positive about the economy’s 
prospects, which supported the participants’ view that 
the recent weakness was likely to prove temporary.  
They acknowledged, however, that sentiment can 
change quickly; indeed, one participant noted that his 
contacts had recently turned more pessimistic, and sev-
eral participants indicated that their business contacts 
expressed concern about the effects of higher com-
modity prices on their own costs and on the purchasing 
power of households.  

Participants judged that overall conditions in labor 
markets had continued to improve, albeit gradually.  
The unemployment rate had decreased further and pay-
roll employment had risen again in March.  Some par-
ticipants reported that more of their business contacts 
have plans to increase their payrolls later this year.  A 
few participants noted that firms may be poised to ac-
celerate their pace of hiring because they have ex-

hausted potential productivity gains, but others indi-
cated that some firms may be putting hiring plans on 
hold until they are more certain of the future trend in 
materials and other input costs.  Signs of rising wage 
pressures were reportedly limited to a few skilled job 
categories for which workers are in short supply, while, 
in general, increases in wages have been subdued.  Par-
ticipants discussed whether the significant drop in the 
unemployment rate might be overstating the degree of 
improvement in labor markets because many of the 
unemployed have dropped out of the labor force or 
have accepted jobs that are less desirable than their 
former jobs.   

Financial market conditions continued to improve over 
the intermeeting period.  Equity prices had risen, on 
balance, since the previous meeting, reflecting an im-
proved outlook for earnings, and were up more sub-
stantially since the start of the year.  Bankers again re-
ported improvements in credit quality, with the volume 
of nonperforming assets declining at larger banks and 
leveling off at smaller banks.  In general, loan demand 
remained weak.  However, bank lending to medium-
sized and larger companies increased, and lending to 
small businesses picked up slightly.  Banks reported an 
easing of lending terms on C&I loans, usually prompt-
ed by increased competition in the face of still-weak 
loan demand.  Consumer credit conditions also eased 
somewhat from the tight conditions seen during the 
recession.  However, demand for consumer credit oth-
er than auto loans reportedly changed little.  A few par-
ticipants expressed concern that the easing of credit 
conditions was creating incentives for increased lev-
erage and risk-taking in some areas, such as leveraged 
syndicated loans and loans to finance land acquisition, 
and that this trend, if it became widespread and exces-
sive, could pose a risk to financial stability.   

Participants discussed the recent rise in inflation, which 
had been driven largely by significant increases in ener-
gy and, to a somewhat lesser extent, other commodity 
prices.  These commodity price increases, in turn, re-
flected robust global demand and geopolitical devel-
opments that had reduced supply.  One participant 
suggested that excess liquidity might be leading to 
speculation in commodity markets, possibly putting 
upward pressure on prices.  Many participants reported 
that an increasing number of business contacts ex-
pressed concerns about rising cost pressures and were 
intending, or already attempting, to pass on at least a 
portion of these higher costs to their customers in or-
der to protect profit margins.  This development was 
also reflected in the rising indexes of prices paid and

received in several regional manufacturing surveys.  
Some participants noted that higher commodity prices 
were negatively affecting both business and consumer 
sentiment.  Core inflation and other indicators of un-
derlying inflation over the medium term had increased 
modestly in recent months, but their levels remained 
subdued.   

Participants generally anticipated that the higher level 
of overall inflation would be transitory.  This outlook 
was based partly on a projected leveling-off of com-
modity prices and the belief that longer-run inflation 
expectations would remain stable.  Some participants 
noted that pressures on labor costs continued to be 
muted; if such circumstances continued, a large, persis-
tent rise in inflation would be unusual.  Measures of 
near-term inflation expectations had risen along with 
the recent rise in overall inflation.  While some indica-
tors of longer-term expectations had increased, others 
were little changed or down, on net, since March.  
Many participants had become more concerned about 
the upside risks to the inflation outlook, including the 
possibilities that oil prices might continue to rise, that 
there might be greater pass-through of higher com-
modity costs into broader price measures, and that ele-
vated overall inflation caused by higher energy and oth-
er commodity prices could lead to a rise in longer-term 
inflation expectations.  Participants agreed that moni-
toring inflation trends and inflation expectations closely 
was important in determining whether action would be 
needed to prevent a more lasting pickup in the rate of 
general price inflation, which would be costly to re-
verse.  Maintaining well-anchored inflation expectations 
would depend on the credibility of the Committee’s 
commitment to deliver on the price stability part of its 
mandate.  A few participants suggested that clearer 
communication about the Committee’s inflation out-
look, such as explaining the measures it uses to gauge 
medium-term trends in general price inflation and an-
nouncing an explicit numerical inflation objective, 
would be helpful in this regard.  

While rising energy prices posed an upside risk to the 
inflation forecast, they also posed a downside risk to 
economic growth.  Although most participants contin-
ued to see the risks to their outlooks for economic 
growth as being broadly balanced, a number now 
judged those risks to be tilted to the downside.  These 
downside risks included a larger-than-expected drag on 
household and business spending from higher energy 
prices, continued fiscal strains in Europe, larger-than-
anticipated effects from supply disruptions in the af-
termath of the disaster in Japan, continuing fiscal ad-

justments at all levels of government in the United 
States, financial disruptions that would be associated 
with a failure to increase the federal debt limit, and the 
possibility that the economic weakness in the first quar-
ter was signaling less underlying momentum going for-
ward.  However, participants also noted that the rapid 
decline in the unemployment rate over the past several 
months suggested the possibility of stronger-than-
anticipated economic growth over coming quarters. 

In their discussion of monetary policy, some partici-
pants expressed the view that in the context of in-
creased inflation risks and roughly balanced risks to 
economic growth, the Committee would need to be 
prepared to begin taking steps toward less-
accommodative policy.  A few of these participants 
thought that economic conditions might warrant action 
to raise the federal funds rate target or to sell assets in 
the SOMA portfolio later this year, but noted that even 
with such steps, monetary policy would remain ac-
commodative for some time to come.  However, some 
participants indicated that underlying inflation re-
mained subdued; that longer-term inflation expecta-
tions were likely to remain anchored, partly because 
modest changes in labor costs would constrain inflation 
trends; and that given the downside risks to economic 
growth, an early exit could unnecessarily damp the on-
going economic recovery.  

Committee Policy Action 
Committee members agreed that no changes to the 
Committee’s asset purchase program or to its target 
range for the federal funds rate were warranted at this 
meeting.  The information received over the intermeet-
ing period indicated that the economic recovery was 
proceeding at a moderate pace, albeit somewhat slower 
than had been anticipated earlier in the year.  Overall 
conditions in the labor market were gradually improv-
ing, and the unemployment rate continued to decline, 
although it remained elevated relative to levels that the 
Committee judged to be consistent, over the longer 
run, with its statutory mandate of maximum employ-
ment and price stability.  Significant increases in energy 
and other commodity prices had boosted overall infla-
tion, but members expected this increase to be transito-
ry and to unwind when commodity price increases  
abated.  Notwithstanding recent modest increases, indi-
cators of medium-term inflation remained subdued and 
somewhat below the levels seen as consistent with the 
dual mandate as indicated by the Committee’s longer-
run inflation projections.  Near-term inflation expecta-
tions had increased with energy prices and overall infla-
tion.  Recent movements in measures of longer-term 

Minutes of the Meeting of April 26-27, 2011 Page 9_____________________________________________________________________________________________



inflation expectations were discussed.  While some 
measures of longer-term inflation expectations had ris-
en, others were little changed or down, on net, since 
March, and members agreed that longer-term inflation 
expectations had remained stable.  Given this economic 
outlook, the Committee agreed to continue to expand 
its holdings of longer-term Treasury securities as an-
nounced in November in order to promote a stronger 
pace of economic recovery and to help ensure that in-
flation, over time, is at levels consistent with the Com-
mittee’s mandate.  Specifically, the Committee main-
tained its existing policy of reinvesting principal pay-
ments from its securities holdings and affirmed that it 
will complete purchases of $600 billion of longer-term 
Treasury securities by the end of the current quarter.  A 
few members remained uncertain about the benefits of 
the asset purchase program but, with the program near-
ly completed, judged that making changes to the pro-
gram at this time was not appropriate.  The Committee 
continued to anticipate that economic conditions, in-
cluding low rates of resource utilization, subdued infla-
tion trends, and stable inflation expectations, were like-
ly to warrant exceptionally low levels for the federal 
funds rate for an extended period.  That said, a few 
members viewed the increase in inflation risks as sug-
gesting that economic conditions might well evolve in a 
way that would warrant the Committee taking steps 
toward less-accommodative policy sooner than current-
ly anticipated.  

Members agreed that the Committee will regularly re-
view the size and composition of its securities holdings 
in light of incoming information and that they are pre-
pared to adjust those holdings as needed to best foster 
maximum employment and price stability.  Some 
members pointed out that there would need to be a 
significant change in the economic outlook, or the risks 
to that outlook, before another program of asset pur-
chases would be warranted; in their view, absent such 
changes, the benefits of additional purchases would be 
unlikely to outweigh the costs.   

In the statement to be released following the meeting, 
members decided to indicate that the economic recov-
ery was proceeding at a moderate pace and that overall 
conditions in the labor market were gradually improv-
ing.  The Committee also decided to summarize its cur-
rent thinking about inflation pressures and to empha-
size that it will closely monitor the evolution of infla-
tion and inflation expectations.  Members anticipated 
that the Chairman, who would deliver his first post-
meeting press briefing later that afternoon, would pro-

vide additional context for the Committee’s policy de-
cisions. 

At the conclusion of the discussion, the Committee 
voted to authorize and direct the Federal Reserve Bank 
of New York, until it was instructed otherwise, to ex-
ecute transactions in the System Account in accordance 
with the following domestic policy directive: 

“The Federal Open Market Committee seeks 
monetary and financial conditions that will fos-
ter price stability and promote sustainable 
growth in output.  To further its long-run ob-
jectives, the Committee seeks conditions in re-
serve markets consistent with federal funds 
trading in a range from 0 to ¼ percent.  The 
Committee directs the Desk to execute pur-
chases of longer-term Treasury securities in 
order to increase the total face value of domes-
tic securities held in the System Open Market 
Account to approximately $2.6 trillion by the 
end of June 2011.  The Committee also directs 
the Desk to reinvest principal payments from 
agency debt and agency mortgage-backed se-
curities in longer-term Treasury securities.  The 
System Open Market Account Manager and 
the Secretary will keep the Committee in-
formed of ongoing developments regarding 
the System’s balance sheet that could affect the 
attainment over time of the Committee’s ob-
jectives of maximum employment and price 
stability.” 

The vote encompassed approval of the statement be-
low to be released at 12:30 p.m.: 

“Information received since the Federal Open 
Market Committee met in March indicates that 
the economic recovery is proceeding at a mod-
erate pace and overall conditions in the labor 
market are improving gradually.  Household 
spending and business investment in equip-
ment and software continue to expand.  How-
ever, investment in nonresidential structures is 
still weak, and the housing sector continues to 
be depressed.  Commodity prices have risen 
significantly since last summer, and concerns 
about global supplies of crude oil have contri-
buted to a further increase in oil prices since 
the Committee met in March.  Inflation has 
picked up in recent months, but longer-term 
inflation expectations have remained stable 
and measures of underlying inflation are still 
subdued.  

Page 10 Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________



Consistent with its statutory mandate, the 
Committee seeks to foster maximum employ-
ment and price stability.  The unemployment 
rate remains elevated, and measures of under-
lying inflation continue to be somewhat low, 
relative to levels that the Committee judges to 
be consistent, over the longer run, with its dual 
mandate.  Increases in the prices of energy and 
other commodities have pushed up inflation in 
recent months.  The Committee expects these 
effects to be transitory, but it will pay close at-
tention to the evolution of inflation and infla-
tion expectations.  The Committee continues 
to anticipate a gradual return to higher levels of 
resource utilization in a context of price stabili-
ty.  

To promote a stronger pace of economic re-
covery and to help ensure that inflation, over 
time, is at levels consistent with its mandate, 
the Committee decided today to continue ex-
panding its holdings of securities as announced 
in November.  In particular, the Committee is 
maintaining its existing policy of reinvesting 
principal payments from its securities holdings 
and will complete purchases of $600 billion of 
longer-term Treasury securities by the end of 
the current quarter.  The Committee will regu-
larly review the size and composition of its se-
curities holdings in light of incoming informa-
tion and is prepared to adjust those holdings as 
needed to best foster maximum employment 
and price stability.  

The Committee will maintain the target range 
for the federal funds rate at 0 to ¼ percent and 
continues to anticipate that economic condi

tions, including low rates of resource utiliza-
tion, subdued inflation trends, and stable infla-
tion expectations, are likely to warrant excep-
tionally low levels for the federal funds rate for 
an extended period.  

The Committee will continue to monitor the 
economic outlook and financial developments 
and will employ its policy tools as necessary to 
support the economic recovery and to help en-
sure that inflation, over time, is at levels con-
sistent with its mandate.” 

Voting for this action:  Ben Bernanke, William C. 
Dudley, Elizabeth Duke, Charles L. Evans, Richard W. 
Fisher, Narayana Kocherlakota, Charles I. Plosser,  
Sarah Bloom Raskin, Daniel K. Tarullo, and Janet L. 
Yellen. 

Voting against this action:  None. 

It was agreed that the next meeting of the Committee 
would be held on Tuesday–Wednesday, June 21–22, 
2011.  The meeting adjourned at 10:15 a.m. on April 
27, 2011.

Summary of Economic Projections 
 

In conjunction with the April 26–27, 2011, Federal 
Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting, the mem-
bers of the Board of Governors and the presidents of 
the Federal Reserve Banks, all of whom participate in 
the deliberations of the FOMC, submitted projections 
for growth of real output, the unemployment rate, and 
inflation for the years 2011 to 2013 and over the longer 
run.  The projections were based on information avail-
able through the end of the meeting and on each par-
ticipant’s assumptions about factors likely to affect 
economic outcomes, including his or her assessment of 
appropriate monetary policy.  “Appropriate monetary 
policy” is defined as the future path of policy that each 
participant deems most likely to foster outcomes for 
economic activity and inflation that best satisfy his or 
her interpretation of the Federal Reserve’s dual objec-
tives of maximum employment and stable prices.  
Longer-run projections represent each participant’s 
assessment of the rate to which each variable would be 
expected to converge over time under appropriate 
monetary policy and in the absence of further shocks. 

As depicted in figure 1, FOMC participants expected 
the economic recovery to continue at a moderate pace, 
with growth of real gross domestic product (GDP) 
picking up modestly this year (relative to 2010) and 
strengthening further in 2012 and a bit more in 2013.  
With the pace of economic growth exceeding their  
estimates of the longer-run sustainable rate of increases 

in real GDP, the unemployment rate is projected to 
gradually trend lower over this projection period.  
However, participants anticipated that, at the end of 
2013, the unemployment rate would still be well above 
their estimates of the longer-run unemployment rate.  
Most participants expected that overall inflation would 
move up this year, but they projected this increase to 
be temporary, with overall inflation moving back in line 
with core inflation in 2012 and 2013 and remaining at 
or below rates they see as consistent, over the longer 
run, with the Committee’s dual mandate of maximum 
employment and price stability.  Participants generally 
saw core inflation gradually edging higher over the next 
two years from its current relatively low level. 

On balance, as indicated in table 1, participants antic-
ipated somewhat lower GDP growth and slightly high-
er inflation over the forecast period than they projected 
in January.  Participants marked down their forecasts 
for real GDP growth this year, revised them down by 
less for 2012 and 2013, and did not alter their expecta-
tions for economic growth in the longer run.  Most 
participants also lowered their forecasts for the average 
unemployment rate at the end of this year, but they 
continued to see the unemployment rate moving down 
slowly in 2012 and 2013 to levels that were little 
changed from the previous projections.  Participants 
raised their forecasts for overall inflation this year; 
however, most expected that the increase would be

transitory and made only minor changes to their fore-
casts for the rate of inflation in 2012 and 2013 or for 
the longer run.  Most participants anticipated that five 
or six years would likely be required for the economy to 
converge fully to its longer-run path characterized by 
rates of output growth, unemployment, and inflation 
consistent with their interpretation of the Federal Re-
serve’s dual objectives. 

A sizable majority of participants continued to judge 
the level of uncertainty associated with their projections 
for real economic activity and inflation as unusually 
high relative to historical norms.  About one-half of the 
participants viewed the risks to output growth as ba-
lanced, but a number now judged those risks to be 
tilted to the downside.  Meanwhile, a majority of partic-
ipants viewed the risks to overall inflation as weighted 
to the upside. 

The Outlook 
Participants marked down their forecasts for real GDP 
growth in 2011, with the central tendency of their pro-
jections moving down to 3.1 to 3.3 percent from       
3.4 to 3.9 percent in January.  Participants stated that 
the change reflected importantly the somewhat slower-
than-expected pace of expansion in the first quarter.  
Participants generally thought that much of the unex-
pected weakness in the first quarter would prove tem-
porary, but they viewed a number of recent develop-
ments as potential restraints on the pace of economic 
recovery in the near term.  Those developments in-
cluded the effects of the rise in energy prices on real 
income and consumer sentiment, indications that the 
recovery in the housing market was further off, and 
constraints on state and local government budgets. 

Looking further ahead, participants’ revisions to their 
forecasts for economic growth were modest, and they 
continued to see the economic recovery strengthening 
over the forecast period, with the central tendency of 
their projections for growth in real GDP stepping up to 
3.5 to 4.2 percent in 2012 and remaining near those 
rates in 2013.  Participants cited the effects of contin-
ued monetary policy accommodation, further im-
provements in banking and financial market conditions, 
rising consumer confidence as labor market conditions 
strengthen gradually, improved household balance 
sheets, stabilizing commodity prices, continued expan-
sion in business investment in equipment and software, 
and gains in U.S. exports as being among the likely 
contributors to a sustained pickup in the pace of ex-
pansion.  However, participants also saw a number of 
factors that would likely continue to hinder the pace of 

expansion over the next two years.  Most participants 
anticipated that the recovery in the housing market 
would remain slow, restrained by the overhang of va-
cant properties and depressed home values; most also 
expected increasing fiscal drag at the federal, state, and 
local levels.  In addition, some participants noted the 
negative impact on household purchasing power of the 
elevated levels of energy and food prices.  In the ab-
sence of further shocks, participants generally expected 
that, over time, real GDP growth would eventually set-
tle down at an annual rate of 2.5 to 2.8 percent, a pace 
that appeared to be sustainable in view of expected 
long-run trends in labor supply and labor productivity.  

Reflecting the decline in the unemployment rate in re-
cent months, participants lowered their forecasts for 
the average unemployment rate in the fourth quarter of 
this year, with the central tendency of their projections 
at 8.4 to 8.7 percent, down from 8.8 to 9.0 percent in 
January.  Participants’ projections for the jobless rate at 
the end of 2012 and 2013 were little changed from their 
previous forecasts.  Consistent with their expectations 
of a moderate economic recovery, most participants 
projected that the unemployment rate would be        
6.8 to 7.2 percent even in late 2013—still well above 
the 5.2 to 5.6 percent central tendency of their esti-
mates of the unemployment rate that would prevail 
over the longer run in the absence of further shocks.  
The central tendency for the participants’ projections 
of the unemployment rate in the longer run was some-
what narrower than the 5 to 6 percent interval reported 
in January. 

Participants noted that the prices of oil and other 
commodities had risen significantly since the time of 
their January projections, largely reflecting geopolitical 
developments and robust global demand.  Those in-
creases had led to a sharp rise in consumer energy pric-
es and, to a lesser extent, food prices, which had 
boosted overall inflation.  As a result, participants 
raised their forecasts for total personal consumption 
expenditures (PCE) inflation in 2011, with the central 
tendency of their estimates significantly higher.  With 
the outlook for oil and other commodity prices uncer-
tain, the dispersion of the projections was noticeably 
wider than in January.  Most participants expected that 
overall inflation would run 2.1 to 2.8 percent this year, 
compared with 1.3 to 1.7 percent in their January pro-
jections.  However, many participants anticipated that 
the pass-through of higher commodity prices into core 
inflation would be contained by downward pressures 
on inflation from large margins of slack in resource 
utilization and consequent subdued labor costs.  Partic-

ipants indicated that well-anchored inflation expecta-
tions, combined with the appropriate stance of mone-
tary policy, should help keep inflation in check.  As a 
result, participants anticipated that the increase in total 
PCE inflation would be temporary, with the central 
tendency of their estimates moving down to              
1.2 to 2.0 percent in 2012 and 1.4 to 2.0 percent in 
2013—at or below the 1.7 to 2.0 percent central ten-
dency for their estimates of the longer-run, mandate-
consistent rate of inflation.  Nonetheless, the central 
tendencies of participants’ projections for core PCE 
inflation for this year and next year shifted up a bit to 
1.3 to 1.6 percent in 2011 and 1.3 to 1.8 percent in 
2012.  The central tendency of the core PCE inflation 
projections in 2013 was 1.4 to 2.0 percent, little 
changed from the January SEP. 

Uncertainty and Risks 
A sizable majority of participants continued to judge 
that the levels of uncertainty associated with their pro-
jections for economic activity and inflation were greater 
than the average levels that had prevailed over the past 
20 years.1  They pointed to a number of factors contri-
buting to their assessments of the uncertainty that they 
attached to their projections, including structural dislo-
cations in the labor market, the outlook for fiscal poli-
cy, the future path of energy and other commodity 
prices, the global economic outlook, and the effects of 
unconventional monetary policy. 

About one-half of the participants continued to view 
the risks to their outlooks for economic growth as ba-
lanced, but a number of participants now judged that 
those risks had become tilted to the downside.  The 
most frequently mentioned downside risks to GDP 
growth included the possibility of further increases in 
energy and other commodity prices, a tighter-than-
anticipated stance of fiscal policy in the United States, 
an even weaker-than-expected housing sector adversely 
affecting consumer spending and the health of financial 
institutions, and possible spillovers from the fiscal 
strains in Europe.  A few participants saw the risks to 
growth as tilted to the upside; it was noted that the cy-
clical rebound in economic activity might prove strong-
er  than   anticipated.    The  risks  surrounding  partici- 
                                                 
1 Table 2 provides estimates of forecast uncertainty for the 
change in real GDP, the unemployment rate, and total con-
sumer price inflation over the period from 1991 to 2010.  At 
the end of this summary, the box “Forecast Uncertainty” 
discusses the sources and interpretation of uncertainty in the 
economic forecasts and explains the approach used to assess 
the uncertainty and risks attending the participants’ projec-
tions.

described in the box “Forecast Uncertainty,” under certain assumptions, 
there is about a 70 percent probability that actual outcomes for real 
GDP, unemployment, and consumer prices will be in ranges implied by 
the average size of projection errors made in the past. Further informa-
tion is in David Reifschneider and Peter Tulip (2007), “Gauging the 
Uncertainty of the Economic Outlook from Historical Forecasting

pants’ forecasts of the unemployment rate remained 
broadly balanced and continued to reflect in large part 
the risks attending participants’ views of the likely 
strength of the expansion in real activity. 

Whereas most participants’ assessments of the risks 
associated with their overall inflation projections over 
the period from 2011 to 2013 were broadly balanced in 
January, a majority of participants now judged the risks 
as weighted to the upside.  Although participants gen-
erally indicated that the amount of pass-through of 
higher oil and other commodity prices into core infla-
tion had so far remained limited and that inflation ex-
pectations continued to be stable, some participants 
noted the risk that the extent of pass-through might 
increase and that the resulting rise in inflation could 
unmoor longer-term inflation expectations.  A few par-
ticipants noted the possibility that the current highly 
accommodative stance of monetary policy could be 
maintained for too long, leading to higher inflation ex-
pectations and actual inflation.   

Diversity of Views 
Figures 2.A and 2.B provide further details on the di-
versity of participants’ views regarding the likely out-
comes for real GDP growth and the unemployment 
rate in 2011, 2012, 2013, and over the longer run.  The 
dispersion in these projections generally continued to 
reflect differences in participants’ assessments of many 
factors, including the likely evolution of conditions in 
credit and financial markets, the current degree of un-
derlying momentum in economic activity, the timing 
and the degree to which the labor market will recover 
from the dislocations associated with the deep reces-
sion, the outlook for economic and financial develop-

ments abroad, and appropriate future monetary policy 
and its effects on economic activity.  Regarding partici-
pants’ projections for real GDP growth, the distribu-
tion for this year shifted noticeably lower and was sig-
nificantly more tightly concentrated than the distribu-
tion in January, with more than one-half of participants 
expecting the change in real GDP in 2011 to be in the 
3.2 to 3.3 percent interval.  By contrast, the distribu-
tions for real GDP growth in 2012 and 2013 were little 
changed.  Regarding participants’ projections for the 
unemployment rate, the distribution for this year 
shifted down relative to the distribution in January, 
with about one-half of participants anticipating the un-
employment rate in the final quarter of 2011 to be 8.4 
to 8.5 percent; this shift likely reflects the recent im-
provements in labor market conditions.  The distribu-
tions of the unemployment rate for 2012 and 2013 
were little changed.  The distribution of participants’ 
estimates of the longer-run unemployment rate was 
somewhat more tightly concentrated than in January, 
while that for their estimates of longer-run GDP 
growth was about unchanged. 

Corresponding information about the diversity of par-
ticipants’ views regarding the inflation outlook is pro-
vided in figures 2.C and 2.D.  In general, the dispersion 
in the participants’ inflation forecasts for the next few 
years represented differences in judgments regarding 

the fundamental determinants of inflation, including 
estimates of the degree of resource slack and the extent 
to which such slack influences inflation outcomes and 
expectations, as well as estimates of how the stance of 
monetary policy may influence inflation expectations.  
Regarding overall PCE inflation, the distribution of 
participants’ projections for 2011 shifted noticeably 
higher relative to the distribution in January, reflecting 
the recent increases in energy and other commodity 
prices, but the dispersion in forecasts was little 
changed.  The distributions for 2012 and 2013 were 
generally little changed and remained fairly wide.  Re-
garding core PCE inflation, the distribution of partici-
pants’ projections for 2011 shifted noticeably to the 
right, but it remained about as wide as in January.  The 
distributions of core inflation for 2012 and 2013 also 
shifted somewhat higher but were otherwise little 
changed.  Although the distributions of participants’ 
inflation forecasts for 2011 through 2013 continued to 
be relatively wide, the distribution of projections of the 
longer-run rate of overall PCE inflation remained 
tightly concentrated.  The narrow range illustrates the 
broad similarity in participants’ assessments of the ap-
proximate level of inflation that is consistent with the 
Federal Reserve’s dual objectives of maximum em-
ployment and price stability.

Forecast Uncertainty 

  

 

The economic projections provided by 
the members of the Board of Governors and 
the presidents of the Federal Reserve Banks 
inform discussions of monetary policy among 
policymakers and can aid public understand-
ing of the basis for policy actions.  Consider-
able uncertainty attends these projections, 
however.  The economic and statistical models 
and relationships used to help produce eco-
nomic forecasts are necessarily imperfect de-
scriptions of the real world.  And the future 
path of the economy can be affected by myr-
iad unforeseen developments and events.  
Thus, in setting the stance of monetary policy, 
participants consider not only what appears to 
be the most likely economic outcome as em-
bodied in their projections, but also the range 
of alternative possibilities, the likelihood of 
their occurring, and the potential costs to the 
economy should they occur. 

Table 2 summarizes the average historical 
accuracy of a range of forecasts, including 
those reported in past Monetary Policy Reports 
and those prepared by the Federal Reserve 
Board’s staff in advance of meetings of the 
Federal Open Market Committee.  The pro-
jection error ranges shown in the table il-
lustrate the considerable uncertainty associated 
with economic forecasts.  For example, sup-
pose a participant projects that real gross do-
mestic product (GDP) and total consumer 
prices will rise steadily at annual rates of, re-
spectively, 3 percent and 2 percent.  If the 
uncertainty attending those projections is sim- 

ilar to that experienced in the past and the risks 
around the projections are broadly balanced, 
the numbers reported in table 2 would imply a 
probability of about 70 percent that actual 
GDP would expand within a range of 2.0 to 4.0 
percent in the current year, 1.4 to 4.6 percent in 
the second year, and 1.2 to 4.8 percent in the 
third year.  The corresponding 70 percent con-
fidence intervals for overall inflation would be 
1.2 to 2.8 percent in the current year, and 1.0 to 
3.0 percent in the second and third years. 

Because current conditions may differ 
from those that prevailed, on average, over his-
tory, participants provide judgments as to 
whether the uncertainty attached to their pro-
jections of each variable is greater than, smaller 
than, or broadly similar to typical levels of 
forecast uncertainty in the past as shown in 
table 2.  Participants also provide judgments as 
to whether the risks to their projections are 
weighted to the upside, are weighted to the 
downside, or are broadly balanced.  That is, 
participants judge whether each variable is 
more likely to be above or below their projec-
tions of the most likely outcome.  These judg-
ments about the uncertainty and the risks at-
tending each participant’s projections are dis-
tinct from the diversity of participants’ views 
about the most likely outcomes.  Forecast un-
certainty is concerned with the risks associated 
with a particular projection rather than with 
divergences across a number of different pro-
jections.
