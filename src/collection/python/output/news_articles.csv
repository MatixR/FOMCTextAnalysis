2007-09-18 00:00:00,2007-09-19 00:00:00,The New York Times,"Fed Cuts Rate Half Point, And Stock Markets Soar","WASHINGTON, Sept. 18 -- The Federal Reserve rolled out its most powerful interest rate weapon on Tuesday in a bid to stop the turmoil in housing and financial markets from bringing down the overall economy.    But even as stock markets soared in a thunderous rally, the Fed carefully stopped short of implying any commitment to reduce rates even more in the months ahead. Indeed, policy makers cautioned that they still have lingering worries about inflation -- a concern that would weigh against stimulating the economy further with cheaper money.    In reducing its benchmark interest rate by an unusually large one-half percentage point, to 4.75 percent from 5.25 percent, the central bank made it clear that policy makers viewed the turbulence and disruptions of the past couple of months as too dangerous to ignore.    The reaction in stock markets was ecstatic: the Dow Jones industrial average jumped 200 points almost instantly and ended the day up 335 points, or 2.51 percent, at 13,739.39.    The move was the Fed's first rate reduction of any kind in four years, the steepest in nearly five years and its most abrupt reversal of course since January 2001, when policy makers sharply cut rates at an unscheduled emergency meeting just before the last recession.    ''Shock therapy,'' summed up Ethan Harris, chief United States economist at  Lehman Brothers. For consumers, the Fed's move could mean lower borrowing costs for mortgages and automobile loans. But the impact may be muted, because investors remain deeply anxious about the credit quality of mortgages and other long-term loans. The main problem in the last month has not been high rates so much as the availability of capital to complete deals.    Analysts described the Fed's action as a bold attempt to restore confidence, with a quieter caveat that investors and consumers should not assume the certainty of more painkillers later this year.    ''The important policy debate now centers on the future interest rate path, but Fed officials left that more ambiguous,'' said Richard Berner, chief United States economist at  Morgan Stanley. Indeed, while many on Wall Street have been clamoring for an aggressive rate cut, some economists had warned against it, saying that it might send the wrong signal by bailing out those who contributed to the housing bubble and encourage future market excesses.    In both the bold stroke and the fine print, the Fed's move offered a revealing hint about Ben. S. Bernanke, the former professor from Princeton who took over as Fed chairman last year.    Mr. Bernanke, a champion of steady rules to guide monetary policy, has long been seen as more skeptical about reacting to financial turbulence than his predecessor, Alan Greenspan.    Mr. Bernanke, for example, made it clear that he did not want to rescue investors or real estate speculators who made bad decisions. But in shielding the economy from a downturn, the Fed will inevitably be helping some of the very people Mr. Bernanke did not want to help.    What seems to have driven Mr. Bernanke to act more boldly, analysts said, was the jolt from the Labor Department's unexpectedly poor employment report for August, which showed that the nation had lost jobs for the first time in four years.    Still, Mr. Bernanke's move was nothing if not a Greenspanian display of ''discretionary'' policy in response to trouble but before the signs of an economic downturn were unambiguous. And in doing so, he obtained unanimous agreement from other board members, even though some Fed officials have been dubious about the need for a rescue.    The Fed's course change has been under way since early August, when fears about huge losses on subprime mortgage loans and a continued downturn in housing caused a much broader panic in credit markets.    The resulting credit tightness has now affected all but the safest home mortgages and has also greatly reduced the ability of private equity funds and hedge funds to borrow money at low rates. Many banks, which had been planning to resell their loans into the giant market for tradable commercial debt securities, are now being forced to absorb loans that the securities markets will no longer take.    In the rate cut and an accompanying statement, the central bank acknowledged that the risks of a recession were too big to ignore.    ''The tightening of credit conditions has the potential to intensify the housing correction and restrain economic growth more generally,'' the Fed's policy-making committee said in its statement. ''Today's action is intended to forestall some of the adverse effects on the broader economy that might otherwise arise from the disruptions in financial markets.''    Leaving the door open for the possibility of additional rate cuts, the central bank said it would ''continue to assess'' the economic outlook and ''act as needed to foster price stability and sustainable economic growth.''    But while Fed policy makers abandoned previous statements that the risk of inflation was their ''predominant concern,'' they did not say that the risk of a downturn had replaced inflation as their main worry. Rather, they spoke of ''uncertainty'' and left it at that.    ''The Fed kept its cards much closer to its vest than anyone would have guessed,'' said David Rosenberg, chief North American economist for  Merrill Lynch. ''It's not at all clear they think they have more to do.''    Trading among investors indicated that Wall Street expects the central bank to keep cutting rates. Many analysts contend that it needs to cut twice as deeply as it has so far by early next year.    And in a sign that the politics of rate-cutting could become more bruising, at least one prominent Democrat quickly criticized the Fed's cautionary warning about inflation at a time of slowing growth. Representative Barney Frank, Democrat of Massachusetts and chairman of the House Financial Services Committee, said he was ''surprised'' by the Fed's statement.    ''I hope, in this instance, that markets and consumers will pay more attention to what the F.O.M.C. did than to what it said,'' Mr. Frank added, referring to the Federal Open Market Committee, which sets interest rates.    In a separate move to bolster the banking system, the Fed also said that it had cut its discount lending rate, which applies to short-term emergency loans to banks, by a half a percentage point, to 5.25 percent.    As in 2001, the Fed's move came after a panic in financial markets and the collapse of a speculative bubble. Today, the panic is in credit markets unnerved by dubious mortgages on inflated housing prices. Back then, it was the stock market that was in trouble, initially because the air went out of inflated dot-com stocks.    But the debate within the Fed was all about risk probabilities: what were the odds that the twin meltdowns in housing and mortgage markets would tip the overall economy into a recession?    If policy makers cut rates too cautiously, they risk a recession; if they cut them too much or too early, they risk stoking inflation.    Ever since the jobs data was released this month, it seemed clear that Fed policy makers were no longer debating whether to reduce rates but how much to lower them. A smaller rate reduction posed a risk of moving too slowly if the economy was indeed in danger of stalling. But a bigger rate reduction could have been taken as a sign of Fed panic, and it added to the risk of stoking inflationary pressures that the central bank had just begun to tamp down.    Just a few hours before the central bank announced its decision, new statistics indicated that the pace of home foreclosures was accelerating.    RealtyTrac of Irvine, Calif., reported that the number of foreclosure filings -- from default notices and auction sale notices to bank repossessions -- was 36 percent higher in August than in July and 115 percent higher than one year ago.    But except for the housing downturn, which Fed officials admit is much more severe than they had expected, the evidence of a recession in the real economy is indecisive. Global economic growth is much stronger than in 2001, and American exports have climbed about 14 percent over the last year.    Instead of the United States being the world's engine of growth, the global economy could now become the engine of American growth.    Many Wall Street economists place the odds of a recession at about one-in-three or somewhat higher. Mr. Greenspan puts the odds at somewhat more than the one-in-three that he estimated earlier this year.    On Aug. 17, the Federal Reserve moved to ease the liquidity crisis by encouraging banks to borrow money through its discount window, an outlet originally created as an emergency source of overnight funding for banks in a cash squeeze.    But by most accounts, the turmoil in the credit markets has abated very little. The market for subprime mortgages has all but disappeared and demand for all forms of asset-backed commercial paper -- which are securities backed by mortgages, credit card debt and company receivables -- remains very weak.

1998-02-04 00:00:00,1998-02-05 00:00:00,The New York Times,Fed Decision to Stand Pat Sends Treasury Prices Up,"Bond prices ended higher yesterday after the Federal Reserve's policy-making committee voted to leave interest rates unchanged, although the gains were slight because most market participants had anticipated such a decision. The price of the 30-year Treasury bond rose 3/32, to 103 25/32. The yield, which moves in the opposite direction, dropped to 5.85 percent, from 5.86 percent on Tuesday. The Federal Open Market Committee, at its first meeting of the year, kept the Federal funds rate at 5.50 percent, where the short-term benchmark rate has remained for almost a year. What was not disclosed at the end of the two-day meeting is whether committee members have shifted to a neutral stance from their previous position of maintaining a bias toward raising rates. But given the prevailing evidence of benign inflation and the expected economic slowdown due to Asia's financial crisis, bond market analysts said such a change would not surprise them. ''In any event, monetary policy is likely to remain on hold for quite some time before economic conditions change sufficiently to dictate otherwise,'' said Donald Fine, chief market analyst at Chase Asset Management. The bond market's attention has now shifted to tomorrow's labor statistics for January, the freshest reading from the Government on the economy's stamina. Mr. Fine said payroll growth was expected to remain strong but might have slowed from its strong pace in the last months of 1997. The average hourly earnings data, which will be released tomorrow, may also receive more attention than usual given the recent spurt in the Employment Cost Index, a measure of inflation closely followed by the Fed. The bond market showed little reaction yesterday to the Treasury's announcement of the size of its quarterly refunding auction next week, $35 billion, which had been expected. In when-issued trading ahead of the auction, the three-year note was offered at a price to yield 5.31 percent, the 10-year note at a price to yield 5.52 percent and the 30-year bond at 5.87 percent. In municipal bond dealings, the City of New York sold $1.05 billion in debt, the bulk in tax-exempt general obligation bonds, some taxable bonds not offered to the public and some zero-coupon bonds, through underwriters led by Salomon Smith Barney. Yields ranged from 3.90 percent for an issue due in 1999 to 5.04 percent in 2011. The zero-coupon bond due in 2008 does not make interest rate payments, but held to maturity yields 4.75 percent. The underlying rating for the bond issue is Baa-1 by Moody's Investors Service Inc. and BBB-plus by the Standard & Poor's Corporation, with some bonds rated triple-A because they are insured."
