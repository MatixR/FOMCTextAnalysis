2003-09-16 00:00:00,2003-09-17 00:00:00,Federal Reserve Statement on Rates,"Following is the text of a statement released by the Federal Reserve yesterday after the Fed's monetary policy panel, the Federal Open Market Committee, decided to leave interest rates unchanged:The Federal Open Market Committee decided today to keep its target for the federal funds rate at 1 percent.The committee continues to believe that an accommodative stance of monetary policy, coupled with robust underlying growth in productivity, is providing important ongoing support to economic activity. The evidence accumulated over the intermeeting period confirms that spending is firming, although the labor market has been weakening. Business pricing power and increases in core consumer prices remain muted.The committee perceives that the upside and downside risks to the attainment of sustainable growth for the next few quarters are roughly equal. In contrast, the probability, though minor, of an unwelcome fall in inflation exceeds that of a rise in inflation from its already low level. The committee judges that on balance, the risk of inflation becoming undesirably low remains the predominant concern for the foreseeable future. In these circumstances, the committee believes that policy accommodation can be maintained for a considerable period.Voting for the F.O.M.C. monetary policy action were: Alan Greenspan, chairman; Ben S. Bernanke; Susan S. Bies; J. Alfred Broaddus Jr.; Roger W. Ferguson Jr.; Edward M. Gramlich; Jack Guynn; Donald L. Kohn; Michael H. Moskow; Mark W. Olson; Robert T. Parry; and Jamie B. Stewart Jr.

2003-09-16 00:00:00,2003-09-17 00:00:00,Fed Leaves Short-Term Rates Unchanged,"The Federal Reserve retained its cautious outlook for the economy today, leaving short-term interest rates unchanged at 1 percent.The decision was not a surprise as Fed officials announced a month ago that they were prepared to keep the benchmark federal funds rate at its current low levels ''for a considerable period.''If there was an added nuance to the decision today by the Federal Open Market Committee, which sets monetary policy, it was in its slightly more pessimistic tone about unemployment. In its statement accompanying today's decision, the Fed noted that the labor market had been weakening. That reflected the continued loss of jobs last month and several unexpected jumps in the number of people seeking unemployment claims. By contrast, the Fed described labor conditions last month as mixed.The wording suggested that Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve, was more worried than before that a continuation of the relatively high unemployment rate -- slightly above 6 percent of the work force -- could affect economic growth in the months ahead.

Prices of Treasury bonds and notes moved lower yesterday, with the bulk of the losses recorded among long-term issues.The Commerce Department's merchandise trade data, which showed only a marginal narrowing of the deficit in October from September, were in line with market expectations.Nevertheless, the figures, which showed that the deficit fell to $10.35 billion in October from a revised $10.67 billion for September, were a disappointment to many traders.''The Street was secretly thinking that the deficit figure would be $9 billion or lower,'' one government securities trader said. ''Also, the number we got told us that we will not be getting any further improvement, that with the dollar where it is we may continue to run monthly deficits in the $10 billion to $11 billion range.'' $1 Billion Bond Sale While the trade data provided an early impetus to sell, the bulk of the downward move in bond prices was provided by what market participants described as a huge move out of 30-year bonds and into 10-year notes. According to some traders, the transaction, which was done for a domestic account, involved the sale of $1 billion worth of bonds.

The nation's trade deficit narrowed modestly in October to $10.3 billion, as imports declined twice as much as exports, the Commerce Department reported today.It was the second straight month in which the deficit has narrowed, but the $400 million improvement, though about as expected, was far less than in September. Economists and other experts were divided on whether the latest trade figures represented a positive development.Some economists said the slower pace of both imports and exports indicated a welcome slowdown in the economy that might relieve some pressure on the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates further to counter a possible speed-up in inflation. 'A Little Moderation'''It does suggest we're seeing a little moderation,'' Evelina M. Tainer, a senior economist at the First National Bank of Chicago, said of the trade numbers. She added that ''there still is an improving trend'' in trade.

Other analysts disagreed. Even though the economy showed signs of settling back into a more sustainable growth path during the summer, this now appears to have been only a temporary lull partly as a result of the drought.

Following is a transcript of President-elect Bush's remarks and some of Clayton Y. Yeutter's remarks at a news conference in Washington yesterday, as recorded by The New York Times through the facilities of ABC Radio News:  OPENING STATEMENTSMR. BUSH: Well, I'm pleased today to announce another Cabinet selection and a very, very important one. It is my intention to nominate Clayton Yeutter to serve as Secretary of Agriculture. His wide knowledge of the issues, obviously demonstrated skill and broad experience make him quite simply the best man for this very important job. He himself has worked in farming. He's a noted scholar of agricultural economics and he's twice before held sensitive regulatory and trade posts in the Department of Agriculture. And for many years now he's served the nation with highest distinction as trade representative and international negotiator.Since 1985, Clayton has served in the Cabinet as U.S.T.R. - United States Trade Representative - the man principally responsible for the development and execution of American trade policy. And in that office he's accomplished much in the way of notable work for our country on a number of fronts. Our new and historic free trade agreement with Canada is as much as anything the product of his personal dedication and his personal diplomacy. He's the man who persuaded Congress to remove dangerous protectionist provisions from the omnibus trade and competitiveness bill of 1988, and then his ongoing work in international trade will make a perfect jumping-off point for the important work that lies ahead in American agricultural policy.Ambassador Yeutter has just returned from Montreal where the 96 member nations of GATT completed this midterm review of the Uruguay round of multilateral trade negotiations. Now President Reagan's objectives in these negotiations are mine, and I know they're Clayton Yeutter's as well - a comprehensive reform of world agricultural trade rules by 1990. And I'm confident that Ambassador Yeutter will continue to ably pursue this goal in his new post, and that our shared national goal of free agricultural trade and expanded agricultural exports abroad will have no better spokesman, no greater advocate. So he knows foreign policy domestically, he knows it internationally, and I am just delighted to think that I will be serving with him as our new - when he becomes our new Secretary of Agriculture.

You're entitled to equal time:MR. YEUTTER: Well, thank you Mr. Vice President. I won't take equal time, because that was a very eloquent statement. I would simply say, Mr. Vice President, as you already know, that I really had intended to return to the private sector at the conclusion of the Reagan Administration, and as I said to you this morning there are only a few people in the world who could convince me to carry forward in another stint in Government, but you're one of those few. And I am deeply honored to serve you, Mr. Vice President, in the coming years, and I hope we'll have a lot of fun in dealing with some very difficult issues - difficult and challenging issues in agriculture. But those are the kinds of issues that make life interesting and rewarding.

2009-11-04 00:00:00,2009-11-05 00:00:00,Stocks Lose Steam at Close on Wall Street,"The Dow Jones industrial average erased almost all of a 156-point rally after the House of Representatives passed a bill to curb rate increases on credit cards, touching off concern about bank earnings. The news outweighed investor optimism after the Federal Reserve said it planned to keep interest rates at a record low, Bloomberg News reported.
“Businesses are still cutting back on fixed investment and staffing, though at a slower pace,” the Federal Open Market Committee said in a statement on Wednesday after meeting in Washington. “Activity in the housing sector has increased over recent months.”
Gold surged, settling at $1,092.20 an ounce, after the Fed announcement. The dollar, meanwhile, slipped as much as 1 percent against a basket of six currencies.
This year, gold has soared 24 percent, heading for a ninth annual gain, as the dollar fell 6.8 percent. Gold has climbed on speculation that central banks and investors will buy more metal to hedge against a falling dollar. India’s central bank said this week that it bought 200 metric tons of gold from the International Monetary Fund last month.
“With interest rates so low, money is seeking markets that have an upside,” Leonard Kaplan, the president of Prospector Asset Management in Evanston, Ill., told Bloomberg News. “Momentum is crucial, and gold has a lot of momentum.”
The Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index wiped out most of a 1.5 percent rally that began after the Fed said it would leave interest rates at “exceptionally low” levels for an extended period.
“If you’re going to limit how much banks could charge in their credit cards, that’s going to limit profits,” said Art Hogan, the chief market analyst at Jefferies & Company. “So it’s certainly another source of pressure.”
At the end of the day, the S.& P. 500 added 0.1 percent, or 1.09 points, to 1,046.5. The Dow increased 30.23 points, or 0.3 percent, to 9,802.14. About five stocks fell for every four that rose on the New York Stock Exchange.
Wells Fargo, JPMorgan Chase and Citigroup led financial shares to the steepest loss among 10 industries. The House legislation would move up the start date of many rule changes that will make it more difficult for banks to increase rates on credit cards.
The S.& P. 500 rallied in morning trading after the Institute for Supply Management’s report on nonmanufacturing businesses showed 1.4 percent growth in new orders and a 2 percent increase in the backlog of orders. The main index in the report fell to 50.6, below analysts’ estimates but still signaling growth.
Some traders may have sold shares in anticipation of the Friday report on the job market in the United States. Economists on average are estimating that the unemployment rate increased to 9.9 percent in October, according to a Bloomberg survey.
The Treasury’s 10-year note fell 16/32, to 100 26/32. The yield rose 3.52 percent, from 3.47 percent late Tuesday.

 July 2, 1992, Page 00002Buy Reprints The New York Times Archives
Eleven Senate Democrats today brought out a $22 billion package of bills that they said would revive the nation's competitiveness in international markets.Competitiveness and trade policy have faded as issues in the Presidential campaign, as have unsuccessful candidates in both parties who focused on them. And the senators, led by George Mitchell of Maine, the majority leader, conceded that many of the 30 proposals in their package were not new. But they contended that the presentation of their ideas as a package would dramatize the Bush Administration's reluctance to pursue an industrial policy.They called the plan a comprehensive strategy to maintain American technological leadership, rebuild manufacturing, create high-wage jobs and tighten trade laws. At its core is a trade bill with two central provisions.  Reviewing Foreign TradingOne would allow industries to force the Administration to review foreign compliance with trade bills. The other would revive Super 301, a section of American trade law, much criticized by foreign governments, that would force the United States trade representative to challenge foreign trade barriers on a faster and more rigid schedule. The bill would not include restrictions on car imports from Japan.

1999-08-24 00:00:00,1999-08-25 00:00:00,Statement by Fed Panel on Rate Increase,"Following is the statement by the Federal Open Market Committee, the Federal Reserve's monetary policy panel, after its decision yesterday to raise short-term interest rates:The Federal Open Market Committee today voted to raise its target for the Federal funds rate by 25 basis points, to 5.25 percent. In a related action, the board of governors approved a 25-basis-point increase in the discount rate, to 4.75 percent.With financial markets functioning more normally, and with persistent strength in domestic demand, foreign economies firming and labor markets remaining very tight, the degree of monetary ease required to address the global financial market turmoil of last fall is no longer consistent with sustained, noninflationary economic expansion.Today's increase in the Federal funds rate, together with the policy action in June and the firming of conditions more generally in U.S. financial markets over recent months, should markedly diminish the risk of rising inflation going forward. As a consequence, the directive the Federal Open Market Committee adopted is symmetrical with regard to the outlook for policy over the near term.In taking the discount rate action, the Federal Reserve Board approved requests submitted by the boards of directors of the Federal Reserve Banks of Boston, New York, Philadelphia, Cleveland, Richmond, Atlanta, Chicago, St. Louis, Kansas City and San Francisco. The discount rate is the interest rate that is charged depository institutions when they borrow from their district Federal Reserve Banks.

Prices of Treasury bonds and notes were little changed yesterday in trading ahead of today's vote on the North American Free Trade Agreement in the House of Representatives.The outlook for approval of the trade treaty linking the United States, Canada and Mexico is still unclear. But some traders said yesterday that they were a little more confident that the Clinton Administration could win approval. A vote is not expected until after trading is finished in New York today.In a separate development, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York said that it had requested data on the trading of the 30-year bond from the primary dealers that are at the center of trading in the bond market.The request confirms that the Fed is looking into what the market already knows: there is a shortage of the 30-year bond, which could be pushing price artifically higher. What could happen next is that the Treasury could decide to issue more of the same bond in an effort to relieve the shortage. The speculation in the market yesterday was that this increase could occur even before the next scheduled 30-year auction, which is in Feburary.

2005-09-20 00:00:00,2005-09-21 00:00:00,Text of Statement by the Fed Policy Panel,"Following is the text of a statement released by the Federal Reserve yesterday after the Fed's monetary policy panel, the Federal Open Market Committee, decided to raise its benchmark interest rates a quarter-point:The Federal Open Market Committee decided today to raise its target for the federal funds rate by 25 basis points to 3 3/4 percent.Output appeared poised to continue growing at a good pace before the tragic toll of Hurricane Katrina. The widespread devastation in the gulf region, the associated dislocation of economic activity and the boost to energy prices imply that spending, production and employment will be set back in the near term. In addition to elevating premiums for some energy products, the disruption to the production and refining infrastructure may add to energy price volatility.While these unfortunate developments have increased uncertainty about near-term economic performance, it is the committee's view that they do not pose a more persistent threat. Rather, monetary policy accommodation, coupled with robust underlying growth in productivity, is providing ongoing support to economic activity. Higher energy and other costs have the potential to add to inflation pressures. However, core inflation has been relatively low in recent months and longer-term inflation expectations remain contained.The committee perceives that, with appropriate monetary policy action, the upside and downside risks to the attainment of both sustainable growth and price stability should be kept roughly equal. With underlying inflation expected to be contained, the committee believes that policy accommodation can be removed at a pace that is likely to be measured. Nonetheless, the committee will respond to changes in economic prospects as needed to fulfill its obligation to maintain price stability.Voting for the F.O.M.C. monetary policy action were: Alan Greenspan, chairman; Timothy F. Geithner, vice chairman; Susan S. Bies; Roger W. Ferguson Jr.; Richard W. Fisher; Donald L. Kohn; Michael H. Moskow; Anthony M. Santomero; and Gary H. Stern. Voting against was Mark W. Olson, who preferred no change in the federal funds rate target at this meeting.In a related action, the board of governors unanimously approved a 25-basis-point increase in the discount rate to 4 3/4 percent. In taking this action, the board approved the requests submitted by the boards of directors of the Federal Reserve Banks of Boston, New York, Philadelphia, Richmond, Chicago, Minneapolis and Kansas City.

While some inflation risks persist, they are diminished by the more moderate pace of economic activity and by the absence of any indication that longer-term inflation expectations have increased. The committee will continue to monitor closely the evolving economic situation.Against the background of its long-run goals of price stability and sustainable economic growth and of the information currently available, the committee consequently believes that the risks are weighted mainly toward conditions that may generate economic weakness in the foreseeable future.

The Dow Jones industrial average fell 61.05 points, to 10,584.37, after being up as much as 139 points before the announcement. The Nasdaq composite index fell 112.81 points, to 2,511.71, its lowest level since August 1999.

Business equipment spending and industrial production have weakened in recent months, and slowing economic activity in many foreign economies is damping the prospects for United States exports. Moreover, the intensification of financial market turmoil is likely to exert additional restraint on spending, partly by further reducing the ability of households and businesses to obtain credit.In light of the declines in the prices of energy and other commodities and the weaker prospects for economic activity, the committee expects inflation to moderate in coming quarters to levels consistent with price stability.

2008-10-29 00:00:00,2008-10-30 00:00:00,Late-Day Selling Surge Drives Shares Down,"For a few moments, Wall Street seemed on track for its most encouraging two-day performance in a month.
But then the sellers rushed in, The New York Times’s Sharon Otterman reports. Within 13 minutes, the momentary upswing that had followed the Federal Reserve’s Wednesday afternoon announcement of a half-point cut in interest rates was gone, and the market’s volatility was back.
The late-day decline echoed other final-hour moves in the market in recent weeks, indicating to investors that the combination of forced selling, profit taking and fear that has kept the market on edge since the start of the financial crisis had not yet resolved into a more reassuring stability.
The Dow Jones industrial average closed down 0.82 percent, or 74.16 points, to 8,990.96. The broader Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index declined 1.1 percent, or 10.42 points, to 930.09 and the Nasdaq finished slightly higher at 1,657.21. All three markets rose 10 percent or more on Tuesday.
“We’ve seen this before. Any time you have a market like this, you are setting yourself up for people to sell and take advantage of these profits,” Ryan Larson, head equity trader at Voyageur Asset Management, told The Times. “The short-sellers came in, and the profit takers came in, and they came in hard.”
Meeting in Washington, the Federal Open Markets Committee decided unanimously on Wednesday afternoon to cut the benchmark federal funds target rate to 1 percent. It was the latest of a series of moves by the Fed to try to encourage the flow of credit to ease the downturn in the broader economy.
Stocks initially lost ground after the Fed announcement, as some investors had predicted even a larger rate cut. The major indexes then reversed course, with the Dow soaring more than 200 points before the final losses.
Some uncertainty may have been because of varying readings of the statement issued by the Fed along with the rate cut, analysts said. The statement said the central bank would “act as needed to promote sustainable economic growth and price stability,” but did not explicitly outline any additional moves to shore up the economy.
“I think some investors were disappointed that the statement didn’t indicate that the Fed was poised to do more,” said Jane Caron, chief economic strategist at Dwight Asset Management.
After Tuesday’s rally had sent the Dow soaring 889 points, helped by expectations of the interest rate cut, stocks opened lower Wednesday. They then staged a midmorning rally, a hopeful indication for investors that most of the gains would hold.
“There was a very tepid response in terms of a sell-off in the morning, so that’s a healthy sign,” said Michael Holland, the chairman of Holland & Company.
New economic data released may have also brought the markets some short-lived optimism. In one economic report released Wednesday, the Commerce Department reported that orders for durable goods rose 0.8 percent, surprising economists who had expected a decline. Orders fell 5.5 percent in August in the biggest setback in nearly two years.
Lending between banks also continued to ease. The government’s plan to assist businesses by buying commercial paper – the short-term i.o.u.’s that companies issue to borrow money for payroll and other immediate needs – began to have some impact, with the volume of commercial paper issued rising by nearly 50 percent since the program began on Monday. The closely watched three-month Libor rate was down, indicating an increase in trust between banks.
“Right now, it looks as if some of the remedies are taking hold,” Mr. Holland said. “Confidence is returning to the credit markets.”
The benchmark 10-year Treasury note fell 6/32, to 101 5/32. The yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, was 3.85 percent, up from 3.83 percent late Tuesday.
The dollar was weaker against major currencies, falling to 97.47 yen, down from 97.63 yen late Tuesday.
Crude oil for December delivery settled at $67.50 a barrel in New York trading.
Overseas, stocks were mostly higher in Europe and Asia as investors focused on the prospect of additional interest rate cuts. The European Central Bank and the Bank of England are expected to cut rates next week.
The markets in Asia were higher on Thursday morning. The Nikkei 225 rose 3.38 percent in early trading in Tokyo as investors speculated that the Bank of Japan might cut rates as well. In Australia, the S.& P./ASX 200 index was up 3.14 percent. In a bid to spur growth and shore up exports, China cut key interest rates for the third time in six weeks on Wednesday.
Despite the recent rallies, major stock market indexes globally remain 30 percent to 65 percent down so far this year.
“I think that uncertainty and volatile trading will continue to be the rule until we rehabilitate the years of excess in the credit markets,” Douglas M. Peta, a market strategist at J.& W. Seligman, told The Times. “It’s hard to know how long that is going to take, but we know it’s going to take a while.”

Prices of Treasury securities moved higher yesterday despite a signal from the Federal Reserve Board that it had not yet decided to reduce short-term interest rates.Credit market participants said they were surprised when the Fed chose to drain reserves from the banking system when the overnight Federal funds rate was trading at 4 3/8 percent, just under the 4 1/2 percent level that is widely seen as the Fed's target.Prices of short-term notes and bills fell in the wake of the Fed's move, but recovered later on.""They clearly are telling us that they haven't eased yet,"" one trader said. ""But that doesn't mean they won't do it tomorrow. That is how the market is interpreting what happened.""The Fed's Open Market Committee met yesterday to consider whether it should make any adjustments in monetary policy.  What the Economy Needs

""There is no question but that the economy needs the Fed to do more,"" said Joseph Liro, a senior vice president and money market economist at S. G. Warburg & Company.

Evidence mounted today that the economy has halted its slide and that the improvement already under way in housing may have begun to spread.The Government revised its retail sales figures for March to show a rise of four-tenths of 1 percent instead of an eight-tenths drop and it said sales essentially held this gain in April.""It certainly is going in the direction of an upturn,"" said Rosanne M. Cahn, an economist at the First Boston Corporation, citing recent increases in industrial production, consumer sentiment and corporate purchasing as well as housing. ""Perhaps the economy bottomed in April, but, if not, it will probably be May or June.""The relative strength in retail sales disclosed today by the Commerce Department appeared to touch off declines in both the bond and stock markets, reflecting diminished chances that the Federal Reserve will need to cut interest rates again to arrest the economic decline and spur a recovery. Stocks, which have been anticipating a recovery since early in the year, are now taking their cue from interest rates. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 37.57 points to end at 2,886.85.

The Consumer Price Index rose by four-tenths of 1 percent in November, as food and shelter grew more costly while energy prices edged down, the Labor Department said today.The increase, which was a bit more than expected, was believed to have been of some concern to those participating in an important Federal Reserve strategy meeting today.With the economy generally seen as sluggish, the Fed has allowed interest rates to decline slightly, but an inflation signal viewed as too strong could give the Fed pause in easing further. The dominant view among economists, however, was that the rise in inflation last month was not high enough to prevent the Fed from easing credit some more in coming days or weeks. Pressure on Credit MarketsStill, the Fed, whose Open Market Committee completed two days of meetings today, did not enter the credit markets, disappointing those who had hoped for an immediate move toward lower interest rates. As a result, traders said, the markets for Government securities, particularly short-term instruments, were under pressure.  [ Page D16. ]  Major parts of the economy, including automotive and other manufacturing sectors, are in the doldrums, economists noted. The housing market is also in a downturn, with the Government reporting today that housing starts dropped by 4.7 percent last month.  [ Page D8. ]  And last Friday's Government report on prices received by producers showed small declines at both the finished goods and intermediate goods levels, indicating that down the road consumer prices should follow suit.

''Inflation remains under control,'' Marlin Fitzwater, the White House spokesman, said today, with recent results holding ''some promise'' of lower interest rates.

Prices of Treasury securities were narrowly mixed in light trading yesterday. Dealers sold some securities when it became apparent that the Federal Reserve Board was not prepared to ease credit conditions immediately.The Fed, whose Open Market Committee completed two days of meetings yesterday, refrained from conducting open-market operations.As a consequence of the Fed's inaction, ''the front end of the market is under a great deal of pressure,'' one trader said, referring to short-term securities. ''We are torn between people's perceptions that the economy is slipping into recession and a Fed which seems to disagree with that analysis.''Economists at MMS International, an economic information and consulting firm, said in its daily commentary that ''the lack of Fed intervention severely reduces the chances of a pre-1990 easing, according to our forecasts.''

1998-11-17 00:00:00,1998-11-18 00:00:00,THE MARKETS; Federal Reserve Cuts Key Rates In Its 3d Attack on Global Slump,"The Federal Reserve cut interest rates again by a quarter of a percentage point today to help keep a gradual economic slowdown from turning into a recession, but the central bank signaled it might hold off on further reductions in coming months.The cut was the third in seven weeks, and like the previous two it was driven by the concern that the global financial crisis was making it hard for companies to raise money, threatening the long expansion in the United States.In reducing rates but suggesting that investors should not count on further cuts, the Federal Reserve was walking a line between calming Wall Street's fears of global turmoil and giving too much stimulation to an economy that has shown surprising resilience in the face of shocks from abroad.With the outlook for further rate cuts now uncertain, the markets reacted with ambivalence. Down 75 points just before the Fed's announcement at 2:20 this afternoon, the Dow Jones industrial average pushed 75 points into positive territory after the announcement, then fell back again and closed at 8,986.28, off 24.97 points for the day.

2009-01-28 00:00:00,2009-01-29 00:00:00,Text of the Federal Reserve’s Statement on Rates,"Following is the full text of the statement by the Federal Reserve on Wednesday announcing it was holding its base federal funds target rate at a record low between zero and 0.25 percent:The Federal Open Market Committee decided today to keep its target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to  1/4 percent. The committee continues to anticipate that economic conditions are likely to warrant exceptionally low levels of the federal funds rate for some time.Information received since the committee met in December suggests that the economy has weakened further. Industrial production, housing starts and employment have continued to decline steeply, as consumers and businesses have cut back spending. Furthermore, global demand appears to be slowing significantly. Conditions in some financial markets have improved, in part reflecting government efforts to provide liquidity and strengthen financial institutions; nevertheless, credit conditions for households and firms remain extremely tight. The committee anticipates that a gradual recovery in economic activity will begin later this year, but the downside risks to that outlook are significant.In light of the declines in the prices of energy and other commodities in recent months and the prospects for considerable economic slack, the committee expects that inflation pressures will remain subdued in coming quarters. Moreover, the committee sees some risk that inflation could persist for a time below rates that best foster economic growth and price stability in the longer term.The Federal Reserve will employ all available tools to promote the resumption of sustainable economic growth and to preserve price stability. The focus of the committee’s policy is to support the functioning of financial markets and stimulate the economy through open market operations and other measures that are likely to keep the size of the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet at a high level. The Federal Reserve continues to purchase large quantities of agency debt and mortgage-backed securities to provide support to the mortgage and housing markets, and it stands ready to expand the quantity of such purchases and the duration of the purchase program as conditions warrant.The committee also is prepared to purchase longer-term Treasury securities if evolving circumstances indicate that such transactions would be particularly effective in improving conditions in private credit markets. The Federal Reserve will be implementing the Term Asset-Backed Securities Loan Facility to facilitate the extension of credit to households and small businesses. The committee will continue to monitor carefully the size and composition of the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet in light of evolving financial market developments and to assess whether expansions of or modifications to lending facilities would serve to further support credit markets and economic activity and help to preserve price stability.

2009-01-28 00:00:00,2009-01-29 00:00:00,Bank Stocks Lead Wall Street Rally,"For one day, at least, battered bank stocks actually helped the markets.
Reports that the government was considering a deal to set up a “bad bank” to absorb toxic assets ignited a broad rally on Wednesday, with financial companies leading the way, The New York Times’s Jack Healy reports. It was Wall Street’s third consecutive day of gains, which reached across all sectors.
The Obama administration did not announce formal plans to absorb billions of dollars in toxic assets still lingering on the balance sheets of banks. But the Treasury secretary, Timothy F. Geithner, has confirmed that officials were considering such a system, to be run by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.
“Investors are concluding that if the F.D.I.C. is going to run the bad bank and take on all the bad assets of the commercial banking system, then they will suddenly be transformed overnight into good banks,” Ed Yardeni, president of Yardeni Research, told The Times,  adding, “which is a bit of a stretch.”
Stocks rose to their highest point in two weeks, injecting a note of cheer into markets that have been stricken by new fears about the scope of the economic downturn.
The Dow Jones industrial average rose 200.72 points, or 2.46 percent, to 8,375.45, while the broader Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index jumped 28.38 points, or 3.36 percent, to 874.09. The technology-heavy Nasdaq composite index increased 53.44 points, or 3.55 percent, to 1,558.34.
Once again, investors watched developments in Washington as the House prepared to vote on an $825 billion stimulus plan that contains a combination of tax cuts and new spending.
And a statement released by the Federal Open Market Committee indicated that interest rates would stay near zero in the face of the persistent recession. The Fed indicated it was growing more concerned about deflation and the health of the economy and said it was willing to expand programs to buy mortgage-backed securities, which are aimed at unfreezing the credit markets.
“The Federal Reserve will employ all available tools to promote the resumption of sustainable economic growth and to preserve price stability,” the committee said in a statement.
Wells Fargo posted a fourth-quarter loss of $2.55 billion, its profit hurt by mortgage assets that it assumed after it took over Wachovia. But the results were better than some analysts had expected, sending the stock up $5, or 30.88 percent, to $21.19.
Financial companies including Citigroup, Bank of America, Morgan Stanley and JPMorgan Chase rose by double digits. Citigroup gained 66 cents, or 18.59 percent, to $4.21. Bank of America jumped 89 cents, or 13.69 percent, to $7.39. Morgan Stanley rose $3.48, or 17.83 percent, to $23. JPMorgan jumped $2.60, or 10.38 percent, to $27.66.
Shares of banks and brokerage firms were pummeled in 2008 as the credit crisis unfolded and troubles in mortgage-backed assets came to light.
“I would not be backing up the truck to financial stocks just yet,” Stephanie Giroux, chief investment strategist at TD Ameritrade, told The Times.
And analysts said that the gains in financial shares could quickly evaporate.
“A lot of these bank stocks are getting awfully close to zero,” Mr. Yardeni told The Times. “I don’t think you’re seeing buyers. I think you’re seeing short-covering.”
Treasury prices fell as the Fed provided little new guidance on whether it would buy government debt to keep borrowing costs low as the government embarks on broad new deficit spending. The Fed said it was “prepared” to buy longer-term Treasuries if such an action would be “particularly effective” in aiding the credit markets.
The Treasury’s 10-year note fell 1 9/32, to 109 9/32. The yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, rose to 2.67 percent, from 2.53 percent late Tuesday.

Lawrence H. Summers, head of the White House’s National Economic Council; Sheila C. Bair, the Federal Insurance Deposit Corporation chairwoman; and Mr. Geithner have been involved in the talks, the Wall Street officials told The Times.
Federal policy makers are discussing how to use the second $350 billion portion of bailout funds. About $50 billion to $100 billion is expected to be allocated to stave off home foreclosures. That would leave up to $250 billion available for the banks, with the bulk going to buying troubled assets.
On Wednesday, the head of the Congressional Budget Office told lawmakers that weakening banks would probably need hundreds of billions in additional funds beyond the Troubled Asset Relief Program, or TARP.
But administration officials believe that trillions of dollars more may be needed to buy the majority of bad assets from banks.
“The size of the problem is so large that no one knows if you just wiped out all the assets, how much it would cost,” Senator Charles E. Schumer, Democrat of New York and vice chairman of the Joint Economic Committee, told The Times. He added that a number of officials estimate it may take up to $3 trillion to $4 trillion to buy the bad assets.
Federal officials are trying to find a delicate balance between stabilizing banks and keeping the nation’s finances steady. Mr. Summers privately expressed concern last week that spending too much to buy bad assets could cripple the dollar, according to a person who spoke with him.
Administration officials are also worried that lawmakers might reject the high price tag. At the same time, spending too little may not provide enough to plug the deepening hole.
“None of the solutions are very easy,” Mr. Schumer told The Times. “All of these proposals sound very appealing until you start to examine them in detail. And then you find that all of them have problems. The good bank-bad bank idea — the problem, first and foremost, is how do you value the assets? No one knows how to do that.”
Lawmakers have complained that the $350 billion already spent under TARP has failed to prevent institutions from continuing to decline. On Wednesday, several senior members of Congress, including Christopher J. Dodd, chairman of the Senate Banking Committee, and Barney Frank, chairman of the House Financial Services Committee, urged the administration to detail swiftly how it will run the assets program.
Administration officials have been moving with some caution. They say that they hope to avoid the spectacle of the last administration, which lurched from policy to policy, and in the process lost some credibility in Congress.
Senior officials including Ben S. Bernanke, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, and Ms. Bair have recommended that the new administration consider a so-called aggregator bank that would relieve banks of their worst assets. Such a move, they contend, would restore investor confidence in the banks and encourage investors to provide them with fresh capital.
One version of the plan being floated by bankers would have the F.D.I.C. take the lead in running the “bad bank” and buying the toxic assets for a combination of cash and notes backed by the bad bank.
In return, the government would demand some sort of equity stake. The banks would still be responsible for collecting payments on the loans that they sold, according to bankers briefed on the situation.
Other issues still need to be resolved, including how the government would determine what to pay for the toxic assets, which assets would qualify, and what conditions might be attached. Also under discussion was whether to require banks that dump their assets into the fund to separately raise private capital. That could put pressure on weaker banks.
Government officials are considering other ideas for stabilizing the financial system. Those include expanding the types of government guarantees given to Citigroup and Bank of America to cover more assets at more financial companies. Another idea is to pour even more federal money into the banks, possibly in return for common stock.
In a sense the debate over creation of an aggregator bank or nationalization is really a discussion over how much to expand policies begun during the Bush administration, officials said on Wednesday.
The government in effect has already nationalized several large institutions, including the American International Group, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, when it seized control. And it has taken the same steps as creating a bad bank when it took $29 billion in assets held by Bear Stearns and guaranteed more than $300 billion in declining assets at Citigroup.
Officials said the debate within the administration was over how much and under what terms to extend those programs to other institutions. Compounding the complexity is the fact that the administration is simultaneously asking for a stimulus package of more than $800 billion.
Moreover, as the excesses of Wall Street — from expensive corporate jets at Citigroup to huge bonuses and extravagant renovations at Merrill Lynch — ring through Capitol Hill, the idea of a large bailout that does not penalize shareholders and senior executives becomes a tough sell.
The concept of a bad bank has gained momentum in the financial industry as the economy deteriorates, slashing the value of risky assets on banks’ books and increasing the need for banks to hold capital against those losses.
Shares in Citigroup and Bank of America, which both recently received a second taxpayer lifeline, surged 19 percent and 14 percent respectively as the stock market rose on optimism that the administration would relieve banks of money-losing assets.
The Fed said Wednesday the economy remained gloomy, and vowed to use “all available tools to promote the resumption of sustainable economic growth and to preserve price stability.” Its Federal Open Market Committee voted to keep the federal funds target rate at zero to 0.25 percent.
Analysts estimated that the economy contracted by more than 5 percent in the fourth quarter, one of the sharpest quarterly drops in decades. Employers eliminated two million jobs from September through December.
In the past, the Fed has tried to steer the overall economy almost entirely through the federal funds rate, the rate that banks charge each other to lend overnight reserves. But because banks remained reluctant to lend, even after the Fed lowered the overnight rate time after time, the central bank began creating new programs last fall in which it stepped in as a lender itself.
To push down interest rates on mortgages, the Fed began a program this month to buy $500 billion in mortgage-backed securities issued by Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and the federal agencies. Buying large volumes of a security pushes up its price in the market, which leads to lower yields or interest rates.
Thus far, the Fed has bought about $53 billion of the securities. But rates for the kind of traditional mortgages that Fannie and Freddie guarantee dropped sharply and stayed low as soon as the Fed announced plans for the program in late November.
The committee also served notice that it might purchase longer-term Treasury bonds, a move that would drive down long-term interest rates of all types.
In the next several weeks, the Fed expects to start a $200 billion program to finance securities backed by consumer loans, including car loans and credit card debt. This month, the Fed started a program to buy $500 billion in mortgage-backed securities.
Wednesday’s policy vote was not unanimous. Jeffrey M. Lacker, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, in Virginia, voted against the decision.

2009-01-28 00:00:00,2009-01-29 00:00:00,Should the Mayor Keep Control of the Schools?,"When close allies of Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg banded together last summer to create a political organization to push for the renewal of a 2002 state law that gave New York City’s mayor control over its public schools, the initial buzz was that it would become a powerhouse lobbying group, raising as much as $20 million and helping shape the debate over the year.
 Instead, the group, called Learn NY, has raised less than $3 million from several foundations. Rather than producing flashy television announcements, it has placed simple ads on Web sites of news organizations and urbanbaby.com, and has tried to spread its positions by posting on education and community listservs and blogs.
At times, such efforts have backfired, with parents calling the posters puppets of the mayor and suggesting that they take their suggestions elsewhere.
With the first of five public hearings on mayoral control by the Assembly’s Education Committee scheduled for Thursday in Queens, the group has lined up supporters to testify about what they see as Mr. Bloomberg’s successes and how the school system is better off now than when the initial legislation took effect.

Some had counted on selling their hoards to investors fleeing the stock market, but a calm day there created no appetite for bonds.The sharp selloff reflected some traders' beliefs that Fed policy makers, who met yesterday, might not lower their rates as soon, or as much, as had been expected.The Fed has already cut its discount rate, which it charges for loans to banks, seven times in less than two years, leaving it at 3 percent, about the same low level as inflation.

The 30-year bond's yield -- which moves in the opposite direction of its price -- fell as low as 6.83 percent and by late in the day the price was up 110/32 , to 92 18/32 , for a yield of 6.84 percent. The drop of 11 basis points was the largest one-day yield decline in two and a half months. A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point. Rally in Short-Term BillsShort-term bills also rallied strongly, with the rate on three- and six-month bills down 11 basis points as well, to 3.50 percent and 3.79 percent, respectively.

1996-11-13 00:00:00,1996-11-14 00:00:00,Government Bond Prices Hold Steady,"Government bond prices were little changed yesterday, despite relief that the Federal Open Market Committee left interest rates unchanged.The benchmark 30-year bond was off 3/32, to a price of 100 23/32, for a yield of 6.45 percent. The yield, which moves in the opposite direction of the price, was up from 6.44 percent on Tuesday. Prices of some securities with shorter maturities rose slightly.Prices generally fell in early trading, despite a favorable report on producer prices for October, which would normally help the bond market. That hesitation, before today's report on consumer prices and retail sales, left many market participants wondering what it would take for bond prices to continue their recent move higher. Yields have been at their lowest levels since March.The October Producer Price Index showed that the core rate, which excludes volatile food and energy prices, down three-tenths of 1 percent, after analysts expected it to be up. The overall index was up four-tenths of 1 percent, more than expected. Traders said the market nevertheless elected to focus on the core inflation rate instead.

Jack Ablin, director of fixed-income activities and senior fund manager at the Private Bank of the Bank of Boston, said he thought that traders saw the higher energy prices as a sign of inflation. Still, he said, companies might have to absorb those higher prices, rather than passing them on to customers, thus helping keep consumer prices stable. ''While oil prices are indeed higher,'' he said, ''we see it more as a tax than an inflation factor.''

1996-11-13 00:00:00,1996-11-14 00:00:00,Interest Rates Not Changed By Fed Panel,"The Federal Reserve voted to keep interest rates unchanged today, as the Government's report on producer prices provided the latest evidence that inflation remained quiescent despite a surge last month in food and energy costs.With both the Fed and financial markets scrutinizing data for signs that inflation may be infecting the economy, the Labor Department's Producer Price Index showed that prices at the producer level actually fell by three-tenths of 1 percent last month when food and energy, which are notoriously volatile, were excluded. The decline in the so-called core component, while driven in part by technical factors, was the steepest in two years.Including food and energy, the index told a very different story: a rise in producer prices for finished goods of four-tenths of 1 percent, the biggest increase since March. But food prices are already showing signs of leveling off after surging in recent months, and the outlook is for energy prices to continue increasing but at a more moderate pace. Producer prices are the prices that manufacturers and farmers charge for the products they sell to retailers, distributors or other buyers.Indeed, the markets, many economists and presumably the Fed concentrated on the decline in the core rate to conclude that despite steady growth and low unemployment in the sixth year since the end of the last recession, the economy is showing no sustained signs of slipping into the kind of upward wage-price spiral that typically derails expansions.

''The truth lies somewhere in the middle. It's a benign environment, but I don't think inflation is falling.''

The yield of 30-year Treasury bonds closed unchanged at 6.58 percent as the price held at 92 15/32. The Dow Jones industrial index closed with a gain of 26.74 points, at 5,670.60.

Authorities Try to Unravel How Daiwa Trader Hid Loss  Japanese and American authorities tried to unravel how a Japanese-born bond trader working for Daiwa Bank in New York lost $1.1 billion over the last 11 years, without raising the suspicions of regulators in either country or of his employer.The trader, Toshihide Iguchi, an executive vice president, was arrested Saturday. A complaint filed in Federal court in Manhattan charged that he maintained a false set of books enabling him to cover his losses, chiefly in United States Treasury securities.  [ Page A1. ] Mr. Iguchi was an unlikely candidate to rise to executive vice president of a major Japanese bank.

[ D6. ] Morgan Stanley Profits Jump 72.7%  Morgan Stanley Group reported that its quarterly earnings rose 72.7 percent, to $209 million, or $2.45 a share, buoyed by strong revenue from investment-banking activities and better returns on its merchant-banking investments.

But it is possible that is a bargaining stance for better terms.  [ D2. ] Nearly 10 Million Cruise Cyberspace  A report to be published today by O'Reilly & Associates, a publisher of computer books and Internet software, states that 5.8 million American adults are connected directly to the Internet and an additional 3.9 million adults use commercial on-line services like America Online, Compuserve and Prodigy.

Prices of Treasury securities were mixed yesterday, after the Federal Reserve's Open Market Committee left interest rates unchanged at its policy meeting.Bonds were initially higher in early trading after the Conference Board reported its consumer confidence reading had fallen in September to 97.4, below the average trade forecast of 100. In August it was 102.4. Analysts said the report suggested signs of waning consumer optimism that could restrain growth. People buy things when they feel confident; when they do not, manufacturing slows and inventories rise.The 30-year Treasury issue gained 2/32 of a percentage point, to 103 30/32; its yield, which moves in the opposite direction from its price, slipped to 6.57 percent, from 6.58 percent on Monday. But shorter-maturity bills, because they are more sensitive to monetary policy, were down sharply. The rate for a three-month bill was up 10 basis points, or hundredths of a percentage point, to 5.27 percent.Anthony Dwyer, chief market strategist at Josephthal, Lyon & Ross, said he was sure that some of the early price gains were tied to the hopes of some who still believed that there was an outside chance the Fed would ease rates. ""But those hopes did not come to fruition, and bonds relinquished those gains,"" he said.

Currency traders often watch the performance of the bond market to gauge foreign investors' appetite for American assets, and the dollars needed to buy them.Both bonds and the dollar steadied later in the day because many investors suspected that Fed policy makers had given Alan Greenspan, the Fed chairman, authority to raise rates at his discretion before the next policy meeting on Nov. 15, said David Durst, a currency-options trader at Bear, Stearns & Company.In late New York trading yesterday, the dollar fell to 1.5417 marks, from 1.5527 marks on Monday. The dollar also fell to 1.2771 Swiss francs, from 1.2870 francs on Monday.The dollar fell against the yen yesterday on speculation that United States and Japanese trade negotiators were having trouble meeting a Friday deadline for progress in talks.

The dollar fell as much as 20 percent against the yen last year after Mr. Clinton and his aides said a strong yen could help balance trade by making Japan's exports more expensive.

Prices of Treasury long-term securities fell yesterday after the Federal Reserve left interest rates unchanged.The 30-year bond fell 18/32 , to a price of 962/32 , for a yield of 7.84 percent, up from 7.79 percent on Monday and the highest since June 23, 1992. The rates on shorter-term Treasury bills fell, however, as investors sold long-term notes and bonds into less volatile three-month and six-month bills.The market moved after the Fed announced in the afternoon that its Federal Open Market Committee has decided not to raise its target for short-term interest rates, which is now 4.75 percent. An increase would have been the sixth of this year as the Fed sought to fight future inflation by slowing economic growth.Donald Fine, chief market analyst for Chase Securities, said because the Fed did not tighten yesterday doesn't mean that it will not happen. ""I suspect they'll hike rates a few more times,"" he said. ""The last time the Fed raised rates was on Aug. 16, and they said then it would suffice for a time.""

And there is unlikely to be much upward pressure on prices as long as labor costs do not accelerate significantly and Europe and Asia remain in the economic doldrums.''I am sure most members of the committee think everything is going rather beautifully,'' said Alan Blinder, a Princeton University economist and a former Fed vice chairman. ''They have not allowed themselves to be provoked into some sort of pre-emptive action against inflation and, in hindsight, their patience has proven to be correct.''In the past, the Fed sometimes raised interest rates before any rise in the inflation rate, contending that an increase was necessary to discourage borrowing and thus slow a strong economy before companies raised prices in response to shortages and rising wage pressures.

However, the ebbing of geopolitical tensions has rolled back oil prices, bolstered consumer confidence and strengthened debt and equity markets. These developments, along with the accommodative stance of monetary policy and ongoing growth in productivity, should foster an improving economic climate over time.Although the timing and extent of that improvement remain uncertain, the committee perceives that over the next few quarters the upside and downside risks to the attainment of sustainable growth are roughly equal. In contrast, over the same period, the probability of an unwelcome substantial fall in inflation, though minor, exceeds that of a pickup in inflation from its already low level. The committee believes that, taken together, the balance of risks to achieving its goals is weighted toward weakness over the foreseeable future.

The chief danger facing the economy, the Fed said, is that inflation, which is already low, will fall further as demand for new products remains weak. Many economists say they believe that deflation can cripple an economy by effectively increasing debt levels and causing consumers to reduce their spending in anticipation of future bargains. Low inflation, on the other hand, is widely considered to be the ideal situation.

 July 1, 1988, Page 00002Buy Reprints The New York Times Archives
THE connection between a nation's internal and external deficits is clear: If a nation invests more than it saves and consumes more than it produces - as the United States has been doing - the excess must be covered by an inflow of foreign capital. The greater the internal budget deficit, the lower the rate of national savings and the greater the dependence on foreign capital.The persistent United States budget and trade deficits have lessened the ability of the nation to control its economy and hampered its leadership of the non-Communist world. Among American politicians and economists alike, there is now a consensus that to remedy the nation's external weakness the structural budget deficit must be reduced, and if possible eliminated, in the next four or five years.But there is no consensus on how to do it. The conflict between Republicans and Democrats on that issue has been widened by Vice President Bush's pledge not to raise taxes, while Gov. Michael S. Dukakis of Massachusetts has left open the option of raising taxes if expenditures cannot be cut enough to close the budget gap. Mr. Dukakis asserts he would raise taxes only ''as a last resort,'' but said in an interview with Business Week, ''No serious candidate for the Presidency can guarantee that he wouldn't raise taxes.''Mr. Bush portrays the Dukakis position as a ''fundamental'' difference with his own and apparently means to make his no-tax-increase pledge the centerpiece of his conservative campaign, following the strategy President Reagan devastatingly used against Walter F. Mondale in 1984. This week President Reagan gave strong support to Mr. Bush's assault on Governor Dukakis as a high-taxing, high-spending liberal who had just approved tax increases in Massachusetts.

Highly sensitive to the way Mr. Reagan used the tax issue to crush Mr. Mondale, the Dukakis camp was in a state of anxiety this week on how to parry the Republicans' attack. Until now Mr. Dukakis has been vague on how he would eliminate the budget deficit. He has said it would be irresponsible for him to get too specific before gaining the Presidency.

Short-term rates have not changed since March 25, when the Federal Open Market Committee increased the Federal funds target rate, which is the rate that banks charge one another for overnight loans, to 5.50 percent from 5.25 percent.Kim Rupert, economist at Standard & Poor's MMS, a market research and analysis firm in San Francisco, said, ''The Fed makes policy decisions on a risk-to-reward trade off, and currently the risks favor a steady stance.''The strength in the October employment report on Friday, which showed joblessness at 4.7 percent, a 24-year low, would have been sufficient for the Fed to push rates up, Ms. Rupert said, but global instability argued against it. Also, she continued, given the lack of domestic prices pressures and the belief that recent turmoil could slow growth slightly, the Fed can afford to wait.

Sharp declines in Asian and Latin American markets caused jitters on Wall Street, where investors appeared increasingly convinced that slowdowns in foreign economies would hurt profits of multinational companies and slow growth in the United States.

Bond prices bounced off their lows on news of the Fed's inaction.Gary Thayer, senior economist at A. G.

Donald Fine, chief market analyst at Chase Asset Management, said the Fed's decision not to raise rates gave the board another seven weeks to analyze  more data.

However, the hesitancy of the economic expansion appears to owe importantly to oil price premiums and other aspects of geopolitical uncertainties. The committee believes that as those uncertainties lift, as most analysts expect, the accommodative stance of monetary policy, coupled with ongoing growth in productivity, will provide support to economic activity sufficient to engender an improving economic climate over time.In light of the unusually large uncertainties clouding the geopolitical situation in the short run and their apparent effects on economic decision making, the committee does not believe it can usefully characterize the current balance of risks with respect to the prospects for its long-run goals of price stability and sustainable economic growth. Rather, the committee decided to refrain from making that determination until some of those uncertainties abate. In the current circumstances, heightened surveillance is particularly informative.Voting for the F.O.M.C. monetary policy action were Alan Greenspan, chairman; William J.

Saying that the economy was likely to continue growing at a “moderate pace,” the Federal Reserve held its benchmark interest rate steady yesterday and gave investors reason to think that the rate could remain at its current level of 5.25 percent for months to come.A statement accompanying the  decision by the Federal Open Market Committee was nearly identical to the one the panel released after its policy meeting last month. Since then, new economic data has given Fed officials reason to hope that they have achieved a “soft landing,” in which interest rate increases slow the economy and bring down inflation without falling into recession.“I think the Fed is feeling very good about the way the economy is developing,” said Stuart Schweitzer, a strategist at J. P. Morgan Asset and Wealth Management. “The housing slowdown is proceeding, but it’s not spiraling downward, and the rest of the economy is doing O.K.”The short-term interest rate under the Fed’s control, which influences a wide variety of other interest rates, remained unchanged for a third consecutive meeting. The panel had raised that rate — the federal funds rate on overnight bank loans — at every meeting from the middle of 2004 through this summer to slow the economy and keep inflation in check.

With the housing market in the midst of a “substantial correction,” as the Fed’s chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, has put it, overall economic growth has slowed this year. The National Association of Realtors reported yesterday that sales of previously owned homes in September declined 1.9 percent from August, a larger drop than forecasters had expected. The median sale price also fell, to $220,000, from $225,000 a year earlier. Continue reading the main story",http://www.nytimes.com/2006/10/26/business/26fed.html?searchResultPosition=5

2002-08-13 00:00:00,2002-08-14 00:00:00,No Cut in Rates As Fed Lowers Its Assessment Of the Economy,"The Federal Reserve left interest rates steady today but downgraded its view of the economy and signaled that it would consider cutting rates if the recovery from last year's recession continued to lose steam.Abandoning its previous optimism that the economy would gradually bounce back, the Fed emphasized that the decline of the stock market and disclosures of corporate wrongdoing had prolonged a sharp deceleration that became apparent in the spring.The Fed had suggested for several months that it expected its next move to be to raise rates from their current 40-year-low levels to keep the economy from overheating. But it adopted a policy stance today that is often a precursor to a rate cut, saying that the main risk now is that the economy will stall.In a sign, however, that it did not want investors, consumers and businesses to think that it would definitely cut rates -- and in a possible indication of uncertainty or disagreement within the Fed about how to proceed -- the central bank also noted that interest rates are already so low that they should eventually help get the economy going again.

The committee sees growth as likely to moderate to a more sustainable pace, partly reflecting a gradual cooling of the housing market and the lagged effects of increases in interest rates and energy prices.As yet, the run-up in the prices of energy and other commodities appears to have had only a modest effect on core inflation, ongoing productivity gains have helped to hold the growth of unit labor costs in check, and inflation expectations remain contained. Still, possible increases in resource utilization, in combination with the elevated prices of energy and other commodities, have the potential to add to inflation pressures.The committee judges that some further policy firming may yet be needed to address inflation risks but emphasizes that the extent and timing of any such firming will depend importantly on the evolution of the economic outlook as implied by incoming information.

The data also have indicated that more rapid advances in productivity have been raising that potential growth rate as well as containing costs and holding down underlying price pressures.Nonetheless, the committee remains concerned about the risk of a continuing gap between the growth of demand and potential supply at a time when the utilization of the pool of available workers remains at an unusually high level.Against the background of its long-term goals of price stability and sustainable economic growth and of the information currently available, the committee believes the risks continue to be weighted mainly toward conditions that may generate heightened inflation pressures in the foreseeable future.

2000-08-22 00:00:00,2000-08-23 00:00:00,"Still Inflation-Wary, Fed Lets Rates Stand","Reassured by evidence that wage and price increases remain under control despite robust economic growth, the Federal Reserve voted today to leave interest rates unchanged but warned that it might raise them later in the year if inflation creeps up.The decision displayed the Fed's confidence that the economy is gradually moving onto a path of slightly more modest, though more sustainable growth, but suggested as well that the central bank is not yet sure that its campaign of rate increases is complete.The task of bleeding off any inflationary pressure without ruining a business expansion is a tricky one under any circumstances. It has become especially complicated in this cycle because, many think, some old rules have been rendered obsolete by the changes that technology and globalization have brought to the economy.Analysts and policy makers are increasingly certain that the economy is capable of a substantially faster pace of noninflationary growth than it was a few years ago, though there is considerable debate in and outside the Fed about where the new tipping point might be and how close the economy is to it.

Prices of Treasury securities rose in lethargic trading yesterday, helped by a rise in the dollar in overseas markets. The move in the dollar prompted some overseas buying, but dealers in New York said most domestic customers showed little interest once trading shifted to the United States.''We have been at these price levels since early this morning,'' said David Green, manager of government bond trading at Chemical Bank. ''The last two days have been as slow as the worst days of summer. I don't know what it will take to get retail investors off the fence, but they show no signs of moving right now.'' Employment Numbers AwaitedRoberta D. Olsen, a fixed-income portfolio manager at the Banc One Asset Management Corporation in Columbus, Ohio, with $650 million under management, said, ''Nobody is going to want to get back into the Treasury market until after the employment numbers are released on Friday.'' He added that now people are doing business in specific sectors like municipals or mortgage-backed bonds, and are trading those until they get a clearer picture of where the economy is going.Still, prices of some Treasury securities moved up by more than half a point, and gains were spread across the maturity spectrum.

That cheered stock and bond markets, elevating hopes that healthy economic growth would not prompt a resumption of rate increases. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 98.38 points yesterday, or 0.79 percent, to close at 12,621.69. Yields on Treasury debt declined, with the benchmark 10-year Treasury note settling at 4.81 percent, down from 4.87 percent Tuesday, indicating that the market expected long-term interest rates to move slightly lower.

In this day and age, consumers should have more choices and not fewer.” He added: “I’d like to know how this serves the public.”Many fans have been angered by the seven-year, $700-million deal, which will move Extra Innings from cable, where it is available to 75 million subscribers, and the Dish Network into an exclusive arrangement with DirecTV, which has 15 million subscribers. Extra Innings had about 600,000 cable and satellite customers last year.A spokesman for Kerry, Vincent Morris, said the DirecTV deal would be only one of several subjects raised during the hearing.

The evidence accumulated over the intermeeting period indicates that output is continuing to expand at a solid rate and hiring appears to have picked up. Although incoming inflation data have moved somewhat higher, long-term inflation expectations appear to have remained well contained.The committee perceives the upside and downside risks to the attainment of sustainable growth for the next few quarters are roughly equal. Similarly, the risks to the goal of price stability have moved into balance. At this juncture, with inflation low and resource use slack, the committee believes that policy accommodation can be removed at a pace that is likely to be measured.Voting for the F.O.M.C. monetary policy actions were: Alan Greenspan, chairman; Timothy F.

The Fed also declared that the risks to price stability ''have moved into balance.''The statement reinforced expectations among investors that the Fed would start to push borrowing costs higher before the November presidential election. If and when it raises rates, it would be the first time in four years and could lead to the first series of increases since 1994.

2006-03-28 00:00:00,2006-03-29 00:00:00,Fed Panel Raises Rate to 4.75%,"WASHINGTON, March 28 - At Ben S. Bernanke's first meeting as head of the Federal Reserve's policy-making committee, the watchword was no surprises.As expected, the Federal Open Market Committee raised the benchmark federal funds rate on Tuesday by a quarter of a percentage point, to 4.75 percent, and suggested that at least one more increase was in the cards. It was the 15th such increase in consecutive meetings of the committee.In its statement describing the decision, the central bank veered little from the Fed's prior assessments of the economy and the expected path of monetary policy, underscoring Mr. Bernanke's stated intention to maintain the course set by his predecessor as Fed chairman, Alan Greenspan.Despite its predictability, the Fed's statement still modestly unsettled financial markets, bolstering the dollar in foreign exchange markets and sending the prices of stocks and government bonds lower. The broad Standard & Poor's 500-stock index fell 0.64 percent, to 1,293.23. [Page C9.]

Though virtually all investors expected the rate increase, a substantial minority of operators on Wall Street had held hopes that the Fed would indicate that it would be the last one in the cycle that began in June 2004, when the benchmark rate stood at 1 percent.

Economic growth has rebounded strongly in the current quarter but appears likely to moderate to a more sustainable pace.As yet, the run-up in the prices of energy and other commodities appears to have had only a modest effect on core inflation, ongoing productivity gains have helped to hold the growth of unit labor costs in check, and inflation expectations remain contained. Still, possible increases in resource utilization, in combination with the elevated prices of energy and other commodities, have the potential to add to inflation pressures. The committee judges that some further policy firming may be needed to keep the risks to the attainment of both sustainable economic growth and price stability roughly in balance. In any event, the committee will respond to changes in economic prospects as needed to foster these objectives.Voting for the F.O.M.C. monetary policy action were: Ben S.

In a related action, the board of governors approved a 50-basis-point reduction in the discount rate, to 3 1/2 percent.A significant reduction in excess inventories seems well advanced. Consumption and housing expenditures have held up reasonably well, though activity in these areas has flattened recently. Investment in capital equipment, however, has continued to decline. The erosion in current and prospective profitability, in combination with considerable uncertainty about the business outlook, seems likely to hold down capital spending going forward. This potential restraint, together with the possible effects of earlier reductions in equity wealth on consumption and the risk of slower growth abroad, continues to weigh on the economy.With pressures on labor and product markets easing, inflation is expected to remain contained. Although measured productivity growth stalled in the first quarter, the impressive underlying rate of increase that developed in recent years appears to be largely intact, supporting longer-term prospects.The committee continues to believe that against the background of its long-run goals of price stability and sustainable economic growth and of the information currently available, the risks are weighted mainly toward conditions that may generate economic weakness in the foreseeable future.In taking the discount rate action, the Federal Reserve Board approved requests submitted by the boards of directors of the Federal Reserve Banks of New York, Richmond, Chicago, St. Louis and San Francisco.

Prices of Treasury securities inched higher in moderate trading yesterday, as many participants interpreted the open-market activity by the Federal Reserve Board as a sign that the central bank has decided to push interest rates lower.Analysts have been anticipating a further easing in monetary policy by the Fed because the economic statistics of continue to be weak. When the central bank chose not to drain reserves from the banking system around noontime, the period when it normally conducts its open-market operations, analysts took the decision as an indication that the Fed was easing its policy.''The Fed's absence from the market at a time when they needed to drain reserves suggests they are moving to push the Federal funds rate down to 9 1/4 percent,'' said David M. Jones, chief economist at Aubrey G. Lanston & Company. ''That could happen over the next day or two.'' Looking for a ShiftFed watchers like Mr. Jones were more sensitive to the central bank's activities yesterday than usual because the Fed's policy-making arm, the Federal Open Market Committee, concluded two days of meetings in Washington. The windup of those sessions has occasionally provided evidence of a shift in policy.

The first Treasury debt sale under new auction guidelines imposed in the wake of the Salomon Brothers bidding scandal went extremely poorly yesterday, as the Government struggled to sell $14 billion worth of new three-year notes.Traders and analysts cited a number of reasons for the poor auction. But all agreed that it would cost the Treasury -- and the taxpayer -- well over $120 million in higher interest over the life of the securities sold yesterday.Aside from an adverse reaction by primary dealers in Government securities to the new rules, traders said that the low level of short-term market rates and disappointment that the Federal Reserve Board did not move to cut key interest rates yesterday contributed to the poor results.  Watching Fed PolicyContinued signs of economic weakness had led some traders and analysts to believe that the central bank, whose policy-making Open Market Committee met in Washington yesterday, might decide to lower the overnight Federal funds rate to 4 3/4 percent from its current target of 5 percent before the refunding auctions began.

Prices of Treasury bills and notes rose yesterday as the Federal Reserve's policy-making committee adjourned its meeting without altering interest-rate policy.But the price of the 30-year bond slipped 2/32 of a percentage point, to 96 2/32 , for a yield of 7.84 percent, unchanged from Monday.Many investors stayed on the sidelines yesterday ahead of any news that could signal a change in monetary policy. The market's focus now turns to the next meeting of the Fed's policy-making panel, the Federal Open Market Committee, which is scheduled to begin on Jan. 31.Many market participants think the Fed will choose that time for another increase in short-term interest rates to keep inflation from accelerating.

Treasury bills and notes with maturities of five years or less are more vulnerable to interest rate increases by the Fed. The shorter maturities rose after the Fed announced that the final meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee for 1994 had ended at 12:45 P.M. and that there would be ""no further announcements.""

The Federal Reserve's top officials met for nearly four hours today but adjourned without announcing any change in interest rates.Most economists and traders still expect the Fed to raise rates again, possibly at its next meeting on Jan. 31 and Feb. 1, or perhaps before then.The Fed is prepared to brake economic growth, Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, warned a Congressional panel on Dec. 7, if necessary to prevent recent increases in raw materials and other manufacturing costs from showing up in consumer prices.But the central bank's top officials also hinted earlier this month that they would probably pass up the chance today to raise short-term interest rates for the seventh time this year. Alan S. Blinder, the Fed's vice chairman, emphasized on Dec. 9 that reliable information on the economy's health for the fourth quarter would not become available until January.

The Fed has not raised or lowered rates since January, and analysts said monetary policy was likely to remain unchanged well into 1997 because the economy had shown few signs of deviating from its course of moderate growth with low inflation, even though unemployment is low and other economic indicators occasionally send warning signals.Indeed, just before the central bank's Federal Open Market Committee began meeting to consider interest rate policy today, the Commerce Department reported that construction of housing jumped sharply higher last month, suggesting that the economic growth could be picking up again in the fourth quarter after cooling down substantially over the summer.Driven in part by a decline in mortgage rates, housing starts rose 9.2 percent in November, the biggest monthly jump since July 1995, the department said. The increase, which put housing starts at an annual rate of 1.514 million units, wiped out nearly all of a decline in new housing activity recorded in September and October.

But the operations raise health care costs. Is this inflation, as the Government's statisticians contend? Or is it simply fair value for the promise of longer, healthier lives, as a blue-ribbon panel of economists argues?Or consider what happens when people shift from going out to the movies to bringing videos home. Watching ''Independence Day'' at the neighborhood theater costs, say, $7 a ticket while the video rental is $3.50, no matter how many people crowd around the television. Both prices have held steady for a while. Is that zero inflation, as the Government says? Or should the Consumer Price Index register a price decline for movies as people shift to a different movie experience that is less costly but comparable in quality, as the economists contend?In the suddenly expanding debate over the accuracy of the C.P.I. -- which is used to set everything from Social Security pensions and union wage increases to individual tax brackets -- questions like these are crucial. Indeed, behind the controversy, which was set off when the Congressionally appointed panel of economists recently released its report, lie two fundamentally different ways of looking at the economy.The blue-ribbon panel, led by Michael A. Boskin, President George Bush's chief economic adviser, concluded that the C.P.I. exaggerates the rate of inflation by slightly more than one percentage point a year. Defenders of the current way of measuring price changes -- a group that includes representatives of the elderly, labor unions and a number of economists as well -- contend that any error is much smaller.

''The market will continue to struggle with each upcoming data release, as traders attempt to divine the course of future rate moves. There is still the risk of higher rates this summer.''Because it was the short end of the market that would have been hit hard had the Federal Open Market Committee raised rates yesterday, it was the short end that experienced the sharpest rally. The price of the three-month bill rose, driving its yield down 16 basis points -- or hundredths of a percentage point -- to 5.06 percent. Bond prices and their yields move in opposite directions.

The Fed made its intentions known simply by saying that the committee had adjourned with no announcement.Private economists have begun debating whether the central bank overreacted to fears of inflation in doubling short-term rates throughout 1994. If that is true, the Fed may be forced to start cutting them again later this year if the economy slumps.Fed governors have indicated that so far they believe this is unlikely. Some expect the economy to revive later this year as business inventories are run down and falling bond yields and a weak dollar stimulate housing and exports.

Economists are predicting an annual rate of growth for the current quarter of only between 1 percent and 2 percent, with the annual inflation rate staying below 3 percent. That helps explains the Fed's hand-off policy.Nevertheless, financial markets are starting to expect that the Fed's next move will be to cut rates during the summer or autumn. This has been reflected in a continuing decline in interest rates.

Faced with slowing growth in the American economy and a strengthening dollar, the Federal Reserve left short-term interest rates unchanged at a meeting today.The Fed's interest rate policy group, the Federal Open Market Committee, signaled its decision with a brief statement. ""The F.O.M.C. meeting ended at 12:15 P.M.; there is no further announcement,"" said Joseph R. Coyne, the Fed's chief spokesman.The phrasing of the announcement matched almost exactly the wording of statements from previous meetings at which the Fed left interest rates unchanged.Few economists were surprised by the Federal Reserve's announcement. The central bank doubled short-term interest rates in the 12 months that ended on Feb. 1 in response to a burst of economic growth that appeared likely to produce some increase in inflation.

A wide range of economic indicators since then has pointed to slower growth, while inflation has barely risen. Producer prices and consumer prices did creep up in April. But last year's sharp increases in prices for raw materials like wheat and for semiprocessed goods like steel have not yet produced the run-up in finished good prices that many Wall Street economists and some Fed officials feared last year.

Bonds rallied yesterday, sending interest rates to their lowest levels in nearly a week on speculation that the Fed would cut short-term interest rates soon.The policy-making Federal Open Market Committee met without changing the Fed's monetary policy. After the meeting, the Fed's spokesman simply said, ""There is no further announcement.""William Shea, senior vice president-head government trading at Nikko Securities Company International, said that Treasuries received a lift from a report in The Washington Post yesterday that suggested Fed officials would lower the overnight bank loan rates, better known as the Federal funds rate, sometime this year. The article said that the central bank could cut short-term rates as much as 1.50 percentage points this year, if growth slowed to a 2.5 percent pace.Analysts said that since the economy was widely predicted to grow at less than that rate in the first quarter of this year, the newspaper article effectively presented a case for an easing of rates in the near term.

Wall Street rushed back to stocks for a second consecutive session yesterday, nearly wiping out last week's losses, after the Federal Reserve signaled a continuation of its steady interest-rate policy and traders speculated that there would be a rate cut later this year.As measured by the Standard & Poor's index of 500 stocks and the Nasdaq composite index, stocks raced to record levels. Traders bought back many of the stocks they had bid down last week, and much of the market has now returned to its price level of last Wednesday. The market fell 81.96 points on Thursday alone, when there was a rush of sell orders brought on by the quarterly expiration of options on Friday.The bond market continued its rally, but the rush to equities was not altogether explained by the lowering of borrowing costs implied by the rise in bond prices. For one thing, volume on the New York Stock Exchange surged to 362.7 million shares yesterday, more than the 352 million shares on Thursday, when traders were rushing for the exits.The Dow Jones industrial average rose 40.81 points, to 4,436.44, just 1.03 points shy of establishing a new high. It followed the even stronger rebound of Monday, when the Dow surged 54.30 points.

A strong dollar makes dollar-denominated investments like Treasury securities more attractive to foreign investors, who also benefit from the currency translation.But then a report on manufacturing suggested the economy was slowing. ''Indeed, economic data released today clearly indicated a slowing of economic momentum, as exemplified by the sharp decline in the National Association of Purchasing Management index, a fallback in construction spending, and the flattening in the index of leading indicators,'' Mr. Fine said. The June manufacturing index fell to 49.6 from 51.4 in May, the first time in two years that the level has dropped below 50, a sign of contraction in the industrial sector.

1998-07-01 00:00:00,1998-07-02 00:00:00,A Warning From the Fed,"Banks are lending out cash a bit too easily, with too little regard for the risks that will come if the economy stumbles into recession. So says the Federal Reserve in an unusual letter sent to all banks last week and released to the public this week.That the Fed should be worried about easy credit now is merely the latest indication that the American economy is out of sync with many other world economies. Most of Asia is in the midst of a severe credit crunch, as suddenly cautious banks try to get back the money they were lending out so willingly as recently as last year.The Fed's letter, based on a detailed analysis of a sample of loans made by large banks across the country last year, falls well short of an indictment of bank lending practices. But the tone is one of caution, and there are specific warnings that credit standards may have slipped in certain areas, among them loans to real estate investment trusts and media companies. The Fed is also concerned that banks may be charging too little on loans to corporate customers. It is a concern that some top bankers privately say is warranted.To the extent the Fed's warnings are taken to heart by bankers, the letter might serve as a mild drag on the American economy, something some Fed officials would like to see. The Fed has been unwilling to accomplish that through the usual means, raising interest rates, because of concerns that such a move would exacerbate the Asian economic crisis. No one was surprised that this week's meeting of the Fed's Open Market Committee ended without a decision to raise or lower rates.In good times bankers vie to make loans, and are sometimes willing to use overly optimistic assumptions to justify those loans both to management and to regulators. Then, after errors become apparent, bankers grow too cautious, as may be happening now in Asia. If the Fed's letter does help to hold down excessive optimism now, it could help to reduce or forestall the pain that will be felt if the American economy does suffer a setback.

A key index of manufacturing activity, the monthly purchasing managers' report, fell in June for the first time in two years. This index measures manufacturing production and its sharp decline from 51.4 in May to 49.6 in June was seen as evidence that the Asian economic turmoil is starting to affect American industrial producers.The Commerce Department also reported today that construction slumped 1.5 percent in May, the worst drop in more than four years, and the Conference Board's indicator of future economic activity remained unchanged from April to May, at 105.2. This is the second consecutive month that the Conference Board's leading indicator stayed fixed, a sign that the economy, while still on a positive track, is expected to be sluggish.

2001-01-31 00:00:00,2001-02-01 00:00:00,Text of the Fed Statement on Rate Cuts,"Following is the text of a statement released by the Federal Reserve yesterday after the Federal Open Market Committee, the Fed's monetary policy panel, decided to lower interest rates by 50 basis points, or hundredths of a percent:The Federal Open Market Committee at its meeting today decided to lower its target for the federal funds rate by 50 basis points to 5 1/2 percent. In a related action, the board of governors approved a 50 basis point reduction in the discount rate to 5 percent.Consumer and business confidence has eroded further, exacerbated by rising energy costs that continue to drain consumer purchasing power and press on business profit margins. Partly as a consequence, retail sales and business spending on capital equipment have weakened appreciably. In response, manufacturing production has been cut back sharply, with new technologies appearing to have accelerated the response of production and demand to potential excesses in the stock of inventories and capital equipment.Taken together, and with inflation contained, these circumstances have called for a rapid and forceful response of monetary policy. The longer-term advances in technology and accompanying gains in productivity, however, exhibit few signs of abating and these gains, along with the lower interest rates, should support growth of the economy over time.Nonetheless, the committee continues to believe that against the background of its long-run goals of price stability and sustainable economic growth and of the information currently available, the risks are weighted mainly toward conditions that may generate economic weakness in the foreseeable future.In taking the discount rate action, the Federal Reserve Board approved requests submitted by the boards of directors of the Federal Reserve Banks of New York, Philadelphia, Cleveland, Atlanta, Chicago, St. Louis, Minneapolis, Dallas and San Francisco.

The dollar rose yesterday against most currencies, despite a concerted round of dollar selling by the Federal Reserve and eight European central banks.Some traders and economists said they expected the dollar to continue to rise, unless there are increases in interest rates in West Germany and Japan or the Japanese central bank joins the dollar selling. And they predicted that the dollar could top 1.90 marks, which is considered the ceiling set for the currency by the Group of Seven, including the United States, Japan, West Germany, Britain, France, Canada and Italy.In late New York trading, the dollar was at 133.25 yen, up from 132.70 Monday, and at 1.8960 marks, up from 1.8834. The dollar was also sharply higher against the Swiss franc at 1.6540 and the British pound. The pound, which was at $1.7080 Monday, fell to $1.6855. Policy-Making Group MeetsThe rise in the dollar came as the Federal Reserve's Open Market Committee met yesterday to consider pushing interest rates higher to curb economic growth and inflation.

ORGANIC agriculture, espoused by those who went back to nature in the 60's, is on the verge of changing from a movement to an industry. In ever-increasing numbers and at ever-increasing speed, growers, distributors, retailers, governments, agricultural scientists and economists are responding to consumer concerns about food safety by exploring organic agriculture.''We no longer position ourselves as an alternative,'' said Fleur Hedden, vice president of marketing for Whole Foods Market, an eight-store organic- and natural-food chain in Texas. ''We are mainstream.''Organically raised food is generally described as food grown by traditional farming methods without synthetically compounded fertilizers, pesticides, herbicides or fungicides. Organic farming relies on crop rotation, manure and biological methods to control pests. Organic farming is a stricter form of sustainable agriculture, which seeks to reduce pesticide residues in food butnot necessarily to eliminate them.Less than 1 percent of the produce in this country is organic; even if sales continue to climb, experts do not expect it to be much more than 9 percent of the total produce grown in the next few years, said Robert Scowcroft, executive director of California Certified Organic Farmers.

But until recently such products were available only from relatively small producers and manufacturers, usually in natural-food shops. That situation is changing rapidly, and in the meantime, the stores that sell organic food are doing a land-office business.

1997-07-02 00:00:00,1997-07-03 00:00:00,Treasury Securities Rise in Price,"Prices of Treasury securities moved higher yesterday, as the Federal Reserve opted to keep monetary policy unchanged and more economic data pointed to a slowing economy, with low inflation.The 30-year bond rose 13/32, to a price of 98 31/32, and the yield, which moves in the opposite direction, fell to 6.71 percent, from 6.74 percent on Tuesday.While the market was relieved by the decision of the Fed's Open Market Committee not to raise interest rates, analysts said investors were equally interested in scrutinizing today's report on the labor market for signs of inflation, which erodes the value of bonds.But adding to the picture of a slowing economy, the Government reported yesterday that factory orders in May fell seven-tenths of 1 percent, more than the two-tenths of 1 percent decline that was expected. The April factory orders were revised upward to 1.4 percent, from 1.2 percent, and served only to underscore the decline in May.

''While the economy's apparent sluggishness in the second quarter, coupled with a still decelerating rate of inflation, kept the Fed at bay, there are still a number of developments in the economic picture that suggest caution in the months ahead regarding another round of Fed tightening and a potential backup in bond yields,'' said Donald Fine, chief market analyst at Chase Asset Management.

1997-07-02 00:00:00,1997-07-03 00:00:00,Wall Street Applauds As Policymakers Find No Inflation Danger : Fed Leaves U.S. Rates Unchanged,"U.S. central bankers decided to leave interest rates unchanged at their two-day policy meeting that ended Wednesday, after the economy showed few signs of inflation despite strong growth in recent months.After pushing up short-term rates by a quarter of a percentage point in March, the Federal Reserve Board's Open Market Committee has opted at its last two meetings to maintain its target for overnight interbank loans, which set a floor for U.S. rates, at 5.50 percent.Alan Greenspan, the Fed chairman, had been warning investors since late in 1996 that the central bank was concerned about rising stock and bond prices, which he said might reflect ""irrational exuberance"" about the markets' prospects. But although the economy grew at a strong 5.9 percent annual rate in the first quarter of the year, there have been few signs of inflation.It is widely believed that economic growth slowed to a rate of about 2 percent in the second quarter, but with unemployment below 5 percent for the first time in two decades, there have been questions as to whether a lack of workers would require wage increases that would kindle significant inflation.

2008-06-25 00:00:00,2008-06-26 00:00:00,Text of the Federal Reserve’s Statement,"Following is the full text of the statement released Wednesday by the Federal Reserve:The Federal Open Market Committee decided today to keep its target for the federal funds rate at 2 percent.Recent information indicates that overall economic activity continues to expand, partly reflecting some firming in household spending. However, labor markets have softened further and financial markets remain under considerable stress. Tight credit conditions, the ongoing housing contraction, and the rise in energy prices are likely to weigh on economic growth over the next few quarters.The committee expects inflation to moderate later this year and next year. However, in light of the continued increases in the prices of energy and some other commodities and the elevated state of some indicators of inflation expectations, uncertainty about the inflation outlook remains high.The substantial easing of monetary policy to date, combined with ongoing measures to foster market liquidity, should help to promote moderate growth over time. Although downside risks to growth remain, they appear to have diminished somewhat, and the upside risks to inflation and inflation expectations have increased. The committee will continue to monitor economic and financial developments and will act as needed to promote sustainable economic growth and price stability.Voting for the F.O.M.C. monetary policy action were: Ben S. Bernanke, chairman; Timothy F. Geithner, vice chairman; Donald L. Kohn; Randall S. Kroszner; Frederic S. Mishkin; Sandra Pianalto; Charles I. Plosser; Gary H. Stern; and Kevin M. Warsh. Voting against was Richard W. Fisher, who preferred an increase in the target for the federal funds rate at this meeting.

HOUSTON — The two political parties have settled on markedly different strategies for improving domestic oil supplies to help lower gasoline prices.Republicans want to end the 27-year ban on offshore drilling along much of the nation’s coastline, while Democrats want to force companies to speed up exploration in certain offshore areas that they already control. A version of the Democratic plan may come to a vote in the House of Representatives as early as Thursday.But oil experts say that neither approach will give drivers any relief in the short run from prices that stood Wednesday at nearly $4.07 a gallon, on average. They say the simple reality is that no one knows how much oil is to be found  offshore, how difficult producing it would turn out to be or how many years that might take.And oil companies, amid a global drilling frenzy, are stretched so thin they will be hard-pressed to take on big new projects anytime soon. More than 400 major drilling and production projects are competing for engineers, rigs, seismic equipment and steel to build platforms, and the costs of doing the work have skyrocketed.

2008-06-25 00:00:00,2008-06-26 00:00:00,Ex-Big Board Chairman Wins Round in Pay Fight,"On Wall Street, there are stars that fade and stars that fight. Richard A. Grasso is one of the latter.
On Wednesday, Mr. Grasso, the former chairman and chief executive of the New York Stock Exchange, won another round in his almost five-year battle to keep the $187.5 million of pay he amassed during his eight years at the helm of the Big Board.
The New York State Court of Appeals upheld a lower court ruling dismissing four of six counts originally brought by Eliot Spitzer, then New York’s attorney general, against Mr. Grasso. The decision leaves Mr. Spitzer’s successor, Andrew M. Cuomo, two claims to pursue.
Since 2004, the attorney general’s office has argued that Mr. Grasso’s pay was unreasonable under New York’s nonprofit laws and that his compensation was not properly disclosed to the exchange’s board. (The exchange became a public, profit-making corporation in 2006, after Mr. Grasso had been awarded his pay.)
But the Court of Appeals ruled that state law did not give the attorney general the authority to bring major parts of the case.
“Mr. Grasso is gratified by the court’s decision,” Gerson A. Zweifach, one of Mr. Grasso’s lawyers along with Mark C. Zauderer, told The new York Times. “He always had faith in the justice system.”
While the decision is certainly a win for Mr. Grasso, the war is not over. In 2006, Justice Charles E. Ramos of State Supreme Court in Manhattan ruled that Mr. Grasso had breached his fiduciary duty to keep the board informed about his pay and ordered Mr. Grasso to pay back at least $100 million. “Mr. Grasso’s duty is to be fully informed and to see to it that the board was fully informed,” Justice Ramos wrote. “He failed in this duty.”
Mr. Grasso is appealing that decision.
“Both sides have something to look forward to,” Richard J. Schulman, a securities lawyer for Bryan Cave, told The Times. “The attorney general has a decision from the lowest court saying there has been a breach of fiduciary duty. But Grasso has slimmed down the case against him.”
Mr. Grasso’s fight to keep his pay has drawn widespread attention, partly because of his rags-to-riches story. He grew up in a working-class neighborhood in Queens, dropped out of Pace University and started his career as a clerk at the exchange. But he rose through the ranks, ultimately securing the chairman’s title and ringing the exchange’s famous bell with business and political luminaries. He was even featured on an episode of “Sex and the City,” ringing the bell with Sarah Jessica Parker.
He protected the exchange’s open-cry auction system, which many deemed outdated and rife with human error, against the near universal move to all-electronic trading.
After the terrorist attacks in September 2001, Mr. Grasso helped get the exchange open again and reveled in his role as a high-profile cheerleader for the United States economy and its markets.
As his star rose, so did his pay. His annual compensation, including special payments, bonuses and base salary, soared from $3 million in 1996 to more than $30 million in 2001, when he was awarded a hefty bonus for his stewardship of the exchange through Sept. 11, according to an internal report conducted by the exchange’s lawyers and Winston & Strawn.
In 2003, in a move that would lead to his undoing, Mr. Grasso sought to cash out some of his retirement benefits. Some directors say he expressed concern that a future board would be less willing to give him the money, a charge he contests. The compensation committee devised a contract to award him an immediate lump sum payment of $139.5 million and an additional $48 million to be paid over four years for past and future work.
A storm of controversy followed. Some directors, including Henry M. Paulson Jr., then the head of Goldman Sachs, argued against paying out Mr. Grasso’s retirement benefits before retirement. Others said Mr. Grasso was entitled to money he had earned. By Aug. 7, 2003, when the board was scheduled to meet, some directors seemed to believe the lump sum payment would not be awarded since it was not on the agenda for a board meeting.
But the issue was presented and after a debate, those present voted to pay Mr. Grasso the lump sum. The amount was disclosed to the public. Two days later, the exchange revealed that Mr. Grasso was owed an additional $48 million. As the uproar over his pay continued to ripple around the world, the board voted 13 to 7 in favor of asking Mr. Grasso to resign.
Mr. Grasso will now wait to see what happens with his appeal of the two remaining charges, while Mr. Cuomo will have to decide how to proceed with the remaining claims. According to the appellate court’s ruling, the attorney general must prove that Mr. Grasso knew the compensation was unreasonable and that he “violated his fiduciary duties to the New York Stock Exchange by accepting awards of excessive compensation” while in the job.
Mr. Grasso’s recent victory could push the attorney general to seek a settlement. “The dismissal of these claims may ignite renewed talks of settlement,” Robert A. Mintz, a former federal prosecutor and a lawyer at McCarter & English, told The Times. “It’s a win for Grasso but the war is far from over.”

It was the third consecutive meeting at which the Fed kept monetary policy on hold, after raising rates by 1.75 percentage points in six steps starting in June of last year.In announcing its decision, the central bank's Federal Open Market Committee suggested that the economy's capacity for noninflationary growth had increased in recent years and that the expansion had slowed to near that range. But its statement was laden with caveats, and gave no indication that the Fed had begun thinking about cutting rates, as some investors had been hoping it would.Faced with the likelihood that rates would remain steady at best in coming months and might even rise, investors sent stock prices down after the Fed's announcement.

In a related action, the board of governors approved a 25-basis-point reduction in the discount rate, to 1.25 percent.Economic activity remains soft, with underlying inflation likely to edge lower from relatively modest levels. To be sure, weakness in demand shows signs of abating, but those signs are preliminary and tentative. The committee continues to believe that, against the background of its long-run goals of price stability and sustainable economic growth and of the information currently available, the risks are weighted mainly toward conditions that may generate economic weakness in the foreseeable future.Although the necessary reallocation of resources to enhance security may restrain advances in productivity for a time, the long-term prospects for productivity growth and the economy remain favorable and should become evident once the unusual forces restraining demand abate.In taking the discount rate action, the Federal Reserve Board approved the requests submitted by the boards of directors of the Federal Reserve Banks of Boston, New York, Philadelphia, Chicago and San Francisco.

In announcing the move, the Fed, the nation's central bank, noted signs that the downturn may be reaching a bottom, the first time the Fed has done so since the terrorist attacks on Sept. 11. But it added that the positive signs were tentative, and it left the door open to further rate cuts in the new year.As the Fed was meeting, Mr. Bush instructed Secretary of the Treasury Paul H. O'Neill to go to Capitol Hill with a modified offer on the proposed economic recovery package.The president's press secretary, Ari Fleischer, said Mr. Bush was willing to move toward the Democrats on several components of the package, including reducing rather than repealing the alternative minimum tax for corporations, limiting individual income tax reductions and increasing the amount of money the administration would be willing to devote to helping laid-off workers.

In a related action, the board of governors approved a 25-basis-point reduction in the discount rate, to 3 percent.

The cumulative reduction of three percentage points since January has made this one of the most concentrated periods of monetary policy easing on record.The move was in line with what investors and economists had expected. But stock prices, which were up modestly before the Fed's announcement at 2:15 this afternoon, fell sharply.The Dow Jones industrial average ended the day at 10,174.14, down 145.93 points.

2005-02-02 00:00:00,2005-02-03 00:00:00,"Fed raises rates in U.S. for a 6th time, to 2.5%","WASHINGTON — The Federal Reserve raised short-term U.S. interest rates on Wednesday, its sixth increase since last June, and signaled that its strategy of gradually raising rates is far from over. The central bank nudged up the federal funds rate, the rate charged on overnight loans between banks, by a quarter of a point, to 2.5 percent.
In a statement that accompanied the decision, the policy-setting Federal Open Market Committee repeated that it could afford to raise rates at ""a pace that is likely to be measured.""
The Fed also repeated almost word for word its previous sanguine view about the outlook for both economic growth and inflation. In so doing, it gave no hint of either slowing down or speeding up the process of tightening monetary policy.
With the decision Wednesday, the Fed has now more than doubled overnight lending rates from their 46-year low of 1 percent eight months ago.
But even with the latest rate increase, short-term borrowing costs are barely equal to the pace of inflation and below historical averages. More important, long-term interest rates for corporate bonds and home mortgages have actually declined in recent months.
Indeed, analysts say there is so much money available for lending that financial institutions are squeezing down rates for relatively high-risk corporate borrowers.
""There is so much liquidity in the marketplace that the only way lending institutions can compete is by lowering rates,"" said William Zadrozny, chief executive of Siemens Financial Services, which provides financing for business equipment and a wide array of other needs.""People are reaching to employ their money.""
Even though some Fed officials have begun to worry that rising wage costs and slowing growth of productivity could fuel inflation, the central bank said on Wednesday that the upside and downside risks to both inflation and growth are still ""roughly equal.""
By reiterating that monetary policy is still ""accommodative,"" the Fed signaled that it has not yet approached a ""neutral"" level of interest rates that neither encourages inflation nor slows down the economy.
Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Fed, has refused to say what a ""neutral"" rate would be in practice. But most analysts expect the Fed to keep raising overnight rates until they reach at least 3.5 percent and perhaps 4 percent.
Investors had almost unanimously expected the quarter-point increase.
Greenspan is expected to shed more light about the Fed's plans when he testifies before the banking committees of the U.S. House of Representatives and the Senate on Feb. 16 and 17.
Fed officials face several big uncertainties as they plot their strategy. They need to dissect conflicting pressures on inflation: consumer prices have climbed more slowly in recent months, but last year's run-up in oil prices has yet to have its full impact.
Potentially more important, Fed officials must grapple with the possibility of a prolonged slowdown in productivity growth and rising wage costs.

By echoing its policy statement from December almost word for word, the Fed indicated that it has not yet developed a plan to either accelerate or pause in its slow-but-steady approach to raising rates in small increments at each meeting. Policymakers also stuck to their relatively sanguine outlook on the economy, saying that growth appeared to be solid and inflation expectations were ""well-contained.""Since starting to tighten policy, the Fed has more than doubled overnight lending rates from their near-record low of 1 percent eight months ago. Even with the latest rate increase, short-term borrowing costs are barely equal to the pace of inflation and still well below historical averages. More important, long-term interest rates for corporate bonds and home mortgages have declined in recent months.

2009-04-29 00:00:00,2009-04-30 00:00:00,Shares Rally in a Rejection of Pessimism,"It may still be months before the economy turns around, but investors on Wednesday were acting as if a recovery were just around the bend, and bet heavily that the worst economic declines were over.
Stock markets rallied broadly as investors stampeded into financial stocks and abandoned the safe-haven investment of Treasury debt, The New York Times’s Jack Healy reported. Their mood was leavened by an optimistic gloss on the country’s first-quarter output and a statement from the Federal Reserve saying that the pace of economic contraction was “somewhat slower.” 
Although stocks gave up some of their gains in the last minutes of trading, the Dow Jones industrial average still rose 168.78 points, or 2.1 percent, to 8,185.73. The broader Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index was up 18.48 points, or 2.2 percent, to 873.64, its highest close in three months.
“The market seems to be looking forward,” Peter Cardillo, chief market economist at Avalon Partners, told The Times. “It’s a good sign that the market’s focusing on the potentials of a rebound as opposed to the decay in economic activity.”
An analyst’s report predicting healthier bank profits helped lift financial shares. Bank of America rose 6.5 percent to $8.68 as shareholders meeting in North Carolina re-elected the bank’s board. After the markets closed, the company announced that its chief executive, Kenneth D. Lewis, was voted out as chairman.
Shares of the media and entertainment companies Time Warner and DreamWorks Animation rose after they reported earnings that beat investors’ expectations.
On its face, there was little cause for jubilation in the day’s economic news. The government reported that the gross domestic product — an important measure of the economy’s total output — fell at an annual pace of 6.1 percent from January through March, nearly identical to its plunge of 6.3 percent in the last months of 2008..
But investors took consolation because consumer spending, which accounts for 70 percent of economic activity, rose slightly after six months of declines. And they expressed hopes that government spending would pick up and other economic indicators would brighten as the government’s $787 billion stimulus program kicks into gear.
And they fixed on a statement from the Fed’s Open Market Committee that looked ahead to a “gradual resumption of sustainable economic growth in a context of price stability.”
But as the government tries to combat the sluggish economy with tax cuts and huge new spending projects, investors showed signs of balking at the vast new supply of Treasury debt pouring into the marketplace. The Fed has already laid out plans to buy $300 billion in longer-term Treasuries to keep interest rates low, but it announced no additional measures on Wednesday. As credit markets begin to heal and once-wary bond investors develop an appetite for higher returns, they are beginning to stray from Treasury notes, sending yields sharply higher and potentially increasing the cost for the government.
The Treasury’s 10-year note fell 26/32, to 97. The yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, rose to 3.11 percent, from 3.01 percent late Tuesday.

2009-04-29 00:00:00,2009-04-30 00:00:00,Spare Times,"TRANSLATION SLAMTranslation is a tricky business. You never know exactly where, or how, you’re going to end up. In “A Midsummer Night’s Dream,” when Bottom, in his ass’s head, is told “thou art translated!,” he has not only been physically transformed but also magically intoxicated, transmigrated to another world. In the Translation Slam on Friday, part of the PEN World Voices Festival, the Catalan poet Narcís Comadira will allow one of his poems to transmigrate through Mary Ann Newman and Rowan Ricardo Phillips. Mr. Comadira, who is a translator as well as a poet (“Formes de l’Ombra” or “Shadow Forms”), playwright, critic and artist, will read his poem in Catalan, followed by the English versions, prepared and read by Ms. Newman, director of the Catalan Center at New York University, and Mr. Phillips, poet and professor of English at Stony Brook University.So one poem becomes three, and the audience then dissects them, weighing meanings, tone, rhythm and the “feel” of each. “The conversation becomes an analysis of the act of writing,” said Michael F. Moore, the moderator and chairman of the PEN translation committee.Changing geography, the Irish writer Nick Laird (author of the poetry collection “On Purpose” and the novel “Utterly Monkey”), will read his poem in English, followed by a Spanish translation by Valerie Mejer, a Mexican poet and artist, and the writer Javier Calvo. (Mr. Calvo’s novel “Un Mundo Maravilloso” or “Wonderful World” was translated from Spanish into English by Mara Faye Lethem, the evening’s co-migrator.)This differs from last year’s Slam, Mr. Moore said, in which poems were translated from German, Spanish and Italian into English. “It’s my subversive little contribution to making the festival even more international, by pushing the English language into the minority position,” he said, “to get writers in English thinking about what happens when their words are transported into another language.” Even with skilled interpreters, and perhaps a touch of magic, you still can’t be exactly sure where a literary journey will end. Below, an example from the Slam participants.  (Friday at 9 p.m., Bowery Poetry Club, 308 Bowery, near Bleecker Street, East Village; $10.

1999-02-03 00:00:00,1999-02-04 00:00:00,Fed Decides To Maintain Interest Rates,"Trapped between conflicting pressures at home and abroad, the Federal Reserve voted today to leave interest rates unchanged, keeping its hands off an economy that is either gratifyingly robust or too strong for its own good.The decision, almost universally expected by economists and investors, caused barely a ripple on Wall Street. But it highlighted the dilemma facing the central bank just months after it cut rates three times to insure that financial turmoil in much of the rest of the world would not derail the long American expansion.Rather than slowing, the economy grew at a torrid 5.6 percent annual rate in the fourth quarter, putting back on the agenda the possibility that inflation, long dormant, could reappear. One faction within the Federal Reserve is also concerned about rapid growth in the money supply, a cause or signal of inflation.As a result, analysts said, Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, and his colleagues on the central bank are almost certainly considering whether they will need to reverse course and raise rates later this year if growth does not slow markedly on its own.

Last fall the committee reduced interest rates to counter a significant seizing-up of financial markets in the United States. Since then, much of the financial strain has eased, foreign economies have firmed and economic activity in the United States has moved forward at a brisk pace. Accordingly, the full degree of adjustment is judged no longer necessary.Labor markets have continued to tighten over recent quarters, but strengthening productivity growth has contained inflationary pressures.Owing to the uncertain resolution of the balance of conflicting forces in the economy going forward, the F.O.M.C has chosen to adopt a directive that includes no predilection about near-term policy action. The committee, nonetheless, recognizes that in the current dynamic environment it must be especially alert to the emergence, or potential emergence, of inflationary forces that could undermine economic growth.

Coming six weeks before the presidential elections on Nov. 2, the decision pushed the federal funds rate on overnight loans between banks up to 1.75 percent from 1.5 percent.While incumbent presidents normally cringe at the prospect of higher rates before an election, the increases are not expected to pose a threat to President Bush because consumers and businesses have felt almost no tangible impact.Long-term interest rates, which determine home mortgage rates and many commercial loans, have edged down since June as fears of inflation have receded.

2008-09-16 00:00:00,2008-09-17 00:00:00,Text of the Fed Statement,"The following is the full text of the statement released Tuesday by the Federal Reserve:The Federal Open Market Committee decided today to keep its target for the federal funds rate at 2 percent.Strains in financial markets have increased significantly and labor markets have weakened further. Economic growth appears to have slowed recently, partly reflecting a softening of household spending. Tight credit conditions, the ongoing housing contraction and some slowing in export growth are likely to weigh on economic growth over the next few quarters. Over time, the substantial easing of monetary policy, combined with ongoing measures to foster market liquidity should help to promote moderate economic growth.Inflation has been high, spurred by the earlier increases in the prices of energy and some other commodities. The Committee expects inflation to moderate later this year and next year, but the inflation outlook remains highly uncertain.The downside risks to growth and the upside risks to inflation are both of significant concern to the Committee. The Committee will monitor economic and financial developments carefully and will act as needed to promote sustainable economic growth and price stability.Voting for the FOMC monetary policy action were: Ben S. Bernanke, Chairman; Christine M. Cumming; Elizabeth A. Duke; Richard W. Fisher; Donald L. Kohn; Randall S. Kroszner; Sandra Pianalto; Charles I. Plosser, Gary H. Stern; and Kevin M. Warsh. Ms. Cumming voted as the alternate for Timothy F. Geithner.

Proponents of a more systematic government role to help relieve financial institutions of their toxic securities range from Lawrence H. Summers, the former Treasury secretary under President Clinton, to former Federal Reserve chairmen Paul A. Volcker and Alan Greenspan.
In Congress, the idea that is gaining traction centers on the creation of a new agency that would buy troubled assets from hobbled companies. 
The idea was floated on Tuesday by Barney Frank, Democrat of Massachusetts, who heads the House Financial Services Committee (pictured above). Among those signaling that it merited serious consideration were Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid and the House speaker, Nancy Pelosi.
With seven weeks until the presidential elections, no one expects Congress or the White House to move quickly to create a new federal agency that puts taxpayers at risk for hundreds of billions of dollars in bad assets. Steny H. Hoyer, the House majority leader, said there was no time to consider any new proposals in the two weeks before Congress adjourns.
But in its ad hoc approach to the crisis, the Treasury Department and the Federal Reserve have, in effect, already embarked on a course similar to the proposals in Congress.
In the case of Bear Stearns, the Fed took $29 billion of the investment bank’s mortgage-related assets as collateral for a Fed loan to JPMorgan Chase, which then agreed to acquire Bear Stearns.
In the case of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the Treasury Department placed the companies in a conservatorship and explicitly backed the $5.3 trillion of mortgages they own or guarantee.
Treasury also agreed to buy an unspecified amount of Fannie’s and Freddie’s mortgage-backed securities on the open market, starting with a $5 billion purchase this month. Those securities are to be managed and ultimately sold for the government by an investment house on Wall Street.
But federal officials remain concerned about the plight of other institutions, including Washington Mutual, the nation’s largest savings association. Experts estimate that a government bailout of Washington Mutual could cut in half the size of the federal deposit insurance fund, which protects bank depositors at thousands of banks and savings and loan institutions.
Mr. Frank was among the House and Senate leaders who were hastily called to a meeting Tuesday with the Federal Reserve chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, and Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson Jr. to hear about the Fed’s latest rescue plan, this time of the American International Group.
Mr. Frank said that one of the issues discussed in the meeting was a potential need for broader, longer-term federal action in the marketplace.
“We have had a series of ad hoc interventions; this is one more ad hoc intervention,” he told The Times. “I do think, because you can’t be sure this is the last one, the question of a broader more systemic action in which the government tries to help resolve these things is very important.”
In concept, the proposal would resemble the Resolution Trust Corporation, which disposed of bad assets held by hundreds of crippled savings institutions. Created in 1989, Resolution Trust closed or reorganized 747 institutions holding assets of nearly $400 billion. It did so by seizing the assets of troubled savings and loans and then reselling them to bargain-seeking investors.
By 1995, the S.& L. crisis abated and the agency was folded into the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, which Congress created during the Great Depression to regulate banks and protect the accounts of customers when they fail.
But the parallels to Resolution Trust are inexact. The federal government, unlike now, had no choice but to acquire the assets from savings associations because they were backed by federal deposit insurance. The mortgages now at the heart of Wall Street’s woes are not backed by federally insured deposits.
Moreover, the mission of the corporation was to dispose of the assets as quickly as possible for maximum value. Its goal was to reduce taxpayer exposure.
In the current crisis, the goal is more debatable. Should the government be helping homeowners, housing or financial markets, or large companies in trouble? Moreover, policy makers already have been seeking ways to reduce the impact of hard-to-sell assets on the books of companies by encouraging healthier institutions to acquire troubled ones.
The issue is whether Congress, after the election, should create a more formal and accountable mechanism, such as a federal agency, that would provide a relief valve for the troubled assets now causing havoc on Wall Street.
“The question is, and it’s just a question, is, ‘Are we at the point where the private market has made so many bad decisions and is so depressed that it can’t get out from under?’ ” Mr. Frank, who is planning to hold a hearing next week to explore whether Congress should create an agency to help the markets dispose of hard-to-sell assets, told The Times.
“The question we have to address is, ‘Is it the case that market psychology has so depressed assets that no entity has capacity to buy and hold these assets except for the government?’ ”
Mr. Frank said it would be more appropriate for a new agency, rather than the central bank, to be relieving the markets of the troubled assets.
“It is not appropriate for the Federal Reserve either in a financial sense or in a democratic sense to take on this role,” Mr. Frank told The Times .
But Senator Christopher J. Dodd of Connecticut, the chairman of the Senate banking committee, said at a news conference announcing hearings later this week on the crisis that he wondered whether such an agency was necessary if Treasury and the Fed were already performing such a function and had the authority to continue to do it.
“I’m not opposed to it,” he told The Times of Mr. Frank’s proposal. “I’m anxious to hear what the administration would have to say about this.”
Administration officials said they had no plans to make such a proposal, and that they would leave it to the next administration.
Mr. Frank emphasized that any legislation creating a new agency would have to be accompanied by “tough new regulations” to discourage companies from making more risky investments. He acknowledged that the decision about such an agency would be in the hands of the next Congress and the next president.
In recent days, aides to the presidential campaigns of John McCain and Barack Obama have said it would be premature to consider creating a new agency. But after the election, the political imperatives could significantly change, particularly if the housing markets remain depressed and Wall Street continues to choke on the billions of dollars in mortgage-backed assets.

2008-09-16 00:00:00,2008-09-17 00:00:00,A.I.G.’s $85 Billion Government Bailout,"Fearing a financial crisis worldwide, the Federal Reserve reversed course on Tuesday and agreed to an $85 billion bailout that would give the government control of the troubled insurance giant American International Group.
The decision, only two weeks after the Treasury took over the federally chartered mortgage finance companies Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, is the most radical intervention in private business in the central bank’s history, The New York Times’s Edmund L. Andrews, Michael J. de la Merced and Mary Williams Walsh write.
With time running out after A.I.G. failed to get a bank loan to avoid bankruptcy, Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson Jr., pictured above, and the Fed chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, convened a meeting with House and Senate leaders on Capitol Hill about 6:30 p.m. Tuesday to explain the rescue plan. 
They emerged just after 7:30 p.m. with Mr. Paulson and Mr. Bernanke looking grim, but with top lawmakers initially expressing support for the plan. But the bailout is likely to prove controversial, because it effectively puts taxpayer money at risk while protecting bad investments made by A.I.G. and other institutions it does business with.
What frightened Fed and Treasury officials was not simply the prospect of another giant corporate bankruptcy, but A.I.G.’s role as an enormous provider of esoteric financial insurance contracts to investors who bought complex debt securities. They effectively required A.I.G. to cover losses suffered by the buyers in the event the securities defaulted. It meant A.I.G. was potentially on the hook for billions of dollars’ worth of risky securities that were once considered safe.
If A.I.G. had collapsed – and been unable to pay all of its insurance claims – institutional investors around the world would have been instantly forced to reappraise the value of those securities, and that in turn would have reduced their own capital and the value of their own debt. Small investors, including anyone who owned money market funds with A.I.G. securities, could have been hurt, too. And some insurance policy holders were worried, even though they have some protections.
“It would have been a chain reaction,” Uwe Reinhardt, a professor of economics at Princeton University, told The Times. “The spillover effects could have been incredible.”
Financial markets, which on Monday had plunged over worries about A.I.G.’s possible collapse and the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers, reacted with relief to the news of the bailout. In anticipation of a deal, stocks rose about 1 percent in the United States on Tuesday. Asian stock markets opened with strong gains on Wednesday morning, but the rally lost steam as worries returned about the extent of harm to the global financial system.
Still, the move will likely start an intense political debate during the presidential election campaign over who is to blame for the financial crisis that prompted the rescue.
Representative Barney Frank, Democrat of Massachusetts and chairman of the House Financial Services Committee, said Mr. Paulson and Mr. Bernanke had not requested any new legislative authority for the bailout at Tuesday night’s meeting. “The secretary and the chairman of the Fed, two Bush appointees, came down here and said, ‘We’re from the government, we’re here to help them,’ ” Mr. Frank told The Times. “I mean this is one more affirmation that the lack of regulation has caused serious problems. That the private market screwed itself up and they need the government to come help them unscrew it.”
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi quickly criticized the rescue, calling the $85 billion a “staggering sum.” Ms. Pelosi said the bailout was “just too enormous for the American people to guarantee.” Her comments suggested that the Bush administration and the Fed would face sharp questioning in Congressional hearings. President Bush was briefed earlier in the afternoon.
A major concern is that the A.I.G. rescue won’t be the last. At Tuesday night’s meeting. lawmakers asked if there was any way of knowing if this would be the final major government intervention. Mr. Bernanke and Mr. Paulson said there was not. Indeed, the markets remain worried about the financial condition of major regional banks as well as that of Washington Mutual, the nation’s largest thrift.
The decision was a remarkable turnaround by the Bush administration and Mr. Paulson, who had flatly refused over the weekend to risk taxpayer money to prevent the collapse of Lehman Brothers or the distressed sale of Merrill Lynch to Bank of America. Earlier this year, the government bailed out another investment bank, Bear Stearns, by engineering a sale to JPMorgan Chase that left taxpayers on the hook for up to $29 billion of bad investments by Bear Stearns. The government hoped at the time that this unusual step would both calm markets and lead to a recovery by the financial system. But critics warned at the time that it would only encourage others to seek bailouts, and the eventual costs to the government would be staggering.
The decision to rescue A.I.G. came on the same day that the Fed decided to leave its benchmark interest rate unchanged at 2 percent, turning aside hopes by many on Wall Street that the Fed would try to shore up confidence by cutting rates once again.
Fed and Treasury officials initially turned a cold shoulder to A.I.G. when company executives pleaded on Sunday night for the Fed to provide a $40 billion bridge loan to stave off a crippling downgrade of its credit ratings as a result of investment losses that totalled tens of billions of dollars.
But government officials reluctantly backed away from their tough-minded approach after a failed attempt to line up private financing with help from JPMorgan Chase and Goldman Sachs, which told federal officials they simply could not raise the money given both the general turmoil in credit markets and the specific fears of problems with A.I.G. The complexity of A.I.G.’s business, and the fact that it does business with thousands of companies around the globe, make its survival crucial at a time when there is stress throughout the financial system worldwide.
“It’s the interconnectedness and the fear of the unknown,” Roger Altman, a former Treasury official under President Bill Clinton, told The Times. “The prospect of the world’s largest insurer failing, together with the interconnectedness and the uncertainty about the collateral damage – that’s why it’s scaring people so much.”
Under the plan, the Fed will make a two-year loan to A.I.G. of up to $85 billion and, in return, will receive warrants that can be converted into common stock giving the government nearly 80 percent ownership of the insurer, if the existing shareholders approve. All of the company’s assets are being pledged to secure the loan. Existing stockholders have already seen the value of their stock drop more than 90 percent in the last year. Now they will suffer even more, although they will not be totally wiped out. 
The Fed was advised by Morgan Stanley, and A.I.G. by the Blackstone Group.
Fed staffers said that they expected A.I.G. would repay the loan before it comes due in two years, either through the sales of assets or through operations.
Asked why Lehman was allowed to fail, but A.I.G. was not, a Fed staffer told The Times that the markets were more prepared for the failure of an investment bank. 
Robert B. Willumstad, who became A.I.G.’s chief executive in June, will be succeeded by Edward M. Liddy, the former chairman of the Allstate Corporation. Under the terms of his employment contract with A.I.G., Mr. Willumstad could receive an exit package worth as much as $8.7 million if his removal is determined to be “without cause,” according to an analysis by James F. Reda and Associates.

The most significant near-term change from this new signal is that it will be much harder for home mortgage, corporate and Treasury interest rates to continue to edge lower.By shifting its language, the Fed gains a bit more latitude in the timing of any rate increase, in case it detects any signs that the economy is at risk of overheating.

A close reading of the statement by the Fed suggested that its chairman, Alan Greenspan, remains unlikely to push for higher interest rates for several more months.

Increases in core consumer prices are muted and expected to remain low.The committee perceives that the upside and downside risks to the attainment of sustainable growth for the next few quarters are roughly equal.

2004-01-28 00:00:00,2004-01-29 00:00:00,"Fed Keeps 1% Rate, But Hints at a Rise Sometime This Year","The Federal Reserve left short-term interest rates at just 1 percent on Wednesday, the lowest level since 1958, but it jolted markets by retreating from its open-ended pledge to keep rates low for ''a considerable period.''Though subtle, the Fed's change in language after its two-day policy meeting surprised many economists because it suggested that the central bank might raise rates before the end of the year.Prices on Treasury securities dropped, stocks declined and the dollar jumped in reaction to the news, though the markets recovered in part as analysts parsed the Fed's language in greater detail. The most significant near-term change from this new signal is that it will be much harder for home mortgage, corporate and Treasury interest rates to continue to edge lower. [Page C1.]By shifting its language, the Fed gains a bit more latitude in the timing of any rate increase, in case it detects any signs that the economy is at risk of overheating.

A close reading of the statement by the Fed suggested that its chairman, Alan Greenspan, remains unlikely to push for higher interest rates for several more months. As it has before, the Federal Open Market Committee, which sets monetary policy, reiterated its view that inflation remains low and that the economy still has a considerable amount of ''slack'' in the form of relatively high unemployment and large amounts of unused factory capacity.

 December 19, 1990, Page 00015Buy Reprints The New York Times Archives
Although widely anticipated, the Federal Reserve Board's decision to cut its discount rate by half a percentage point, to 6 1/2 percent, was enthusiastically received in the credit markets yesterday. Treasury note and bond prices posted strong gains, and interest rates fell.For the past few weeks analysts had been saying that the Fed would have to lower the discount rate, if only because the overnight Federal funds rate, the market rate the Fed most directly controls, was being moved steadily down toward 7 percent. Generally the funds rate trades at a higher level than the discount rate.Indeed, in announcing the change the Fed said that one of the reasons for the cut was to realign the discount rate with other market rates.But traders and analysts said the Fed's admission that the cut was being made against a background of ""weakness in the economy, constraints on credit and slow growth in the monetary aggregates"" was the real reason the market reacted so positively to the move.

 December 19, 1990, Page 00001Buy Reprints The New York Times Archives
Acknowledging in effect that the American economy is in recession, the Federal Reserve sent a clear signal yesterday that reversing the decline -- rather than fighting inflation -- is now its top concern.The signal came in the form of a reduction in the discount rate to 6 1/2 percent, from 7 percent. This is the rate the central bank charges for loans to commercial banks, but since banks rarely borrow from the Federal Reserve -- unless they are in trouble -- the discount rate has become largely a signpost for policy decisions.The signal this time was a strong one, coming as it did as the Fed's top policy makers concluded one of their periodic reviews of the economy. The Fed had taken a few tentative steps recently to push down rates and thus encourage consumers and business people to borrow money to spend and invest, stimulating the economy. But the action yesterday -- the first change in the discount rate in 22 months -- was seen as an unequivocal statement that policy has changed.  'The Debate Is Over'""The debate is over within the Federal Reserve,"" said Robert DiClemente, an economist at Salomon Brothers. ""Their action is a clarion call that they want rates down and they want people to borrow and spend.""

The announcement at 3:25 P.M. listed ""weakness in the economy"" as the main reason for the discount rate cut. Further evidence of that weakness came yesterday morning as the Labor Department reported that the Consumer Price Index had risen a mild three-tenths of 1 percent in November.

Consumer prices rose a modest three-tenths of 1 percent in November, less than half the torrid oil-driven pace set during the three months immediately after Iraq's invasion of Kuwait, Labor Department figures showed today.The slowdown reflected both moderation in energy prices, which benefited from diplomatic efforts to solve the crisis instead of threats of force, and a general weakness in the economy. That weakness has tended to put downward pressure on the prices of some items while preventing higher prices for energy.When food and energy are excluded, the Consumer Price Index rose by the same three-tenths of 1 percent as when these volatile items are included. The rise in so-called core inflation has now been three-tenths of 1 percent for three straight months.  Strange Behavior for HousingWhile the November increase was about as expected, many analysts had braced for an unpleasant surprise since the largest element of the price index, housing, has been behaving strangely of late and because last week's report on prices at the producer level was worse than expected.

The reassurance provided by the modest rise in the consumer index appeared to extend to the Federal Reserve, whose governors announced this afternoon a half-point cut, to 6 1/2 percent, in the discount rate, the rate charged financial institutions when they borrow at the central bank. This move came as the Fed's Open Market Committee concluded a meeting to establish the course of monetary policy until early February.

2000-06-28 00:00:00,2000-06-29 00:00:00,Text of Fed's Statement,"Following is the text of the statement by the Federal Open Market Committee, the Federal Reserve's monetary policy panel, after its decision yesterday to leave short-term interest rates unchanged:The Federal Open Market Committee at its meeting today decided to maintain the existing stance of monetary policy, keeping its target for the federal funds rate at 6.5 percent.Recent data suggest that the expansion of aggregate demand may be moderating toward a pace closer to the rate of growth of the economy's potential to produce. Although core measures of prices are rising slightly faster than a year ago, continuing rapid advances in productivity have been containing costs and holding down underlying price pressures.Nonetheless, signs that growth in demand is moving to a sustainable pace are still tentative and preliminary, and the utilization of the pool of available workers remains at an unusually high level.In these circumstances, and against the background of its long-term goals of price stability and sustainable economic growth and of the information currently available, the committee believes the risks continue to be weighted mainly toward conditions that may generate heightened inflation pressures in the foreseeable future.

2000-06-28 00:00:00,2000-06-29 00:00:00,Federal Reserve Calls a Time Out on Raising Interest Rates,"The Federal Reserve voted today to leave interest rates unchanged, giving itself more time to determine whether the series of rate increases it has imposed the last year are slowing the economy sufficiently to avoid an upturn in inflation.But the central bank warned that it could start raising rates again as soon as its next meeting, on Aug. 22. Analysts said the Fed would probably tighten policy in August unless economic indicators in coming weeks provided assurance that the red-hot pace of economic growth earlier this year had given way to a more sustainable path that reduces the threat of an inflationary spiral in wages and prices.The Federal Reserve's decision had been widely expected by economists and investors, and Wall Street took the news largely in stride. The Dow Jones industrial average climbed more than 100 points but fell back after the Fed announcement to close at 10,527.79, up 23.33, for the day. The Nasdaq composite index rose 81.38, to 3,940.34.In calling a time out today in its campaign of rate increases -- six over the last year, pushing its benchmark federal funds target rate up 1.75 percentage points, to 6.5 percent -- the Fed acknowledged that there had been some evidence that the economy was cooling off. And the central bank noted that while inflation by some measures had been accelerating, price pressures were being held down by continuing improvements in productivity, a measure of the economy's ability to produce more for less.

But the central bank's policy-making Federal Open Market Committee suggested that it remained unconvinced that the economic slowdown was real. And it stressed its continuing concern that the current low rate of unemployment -- 4.1 percent in May -- could lead wages to rise so fast that companies would be forced to raise their prices.

The evidence accumulated over the inter-meeting period indicates that output is continuing to expand at a solid pace and labor market conditions have improved. Although incoming inflation data are somewhat elevated, a portion of the increase in recent months appears to have been due to transitory factors.The committee perceives the upside and downside risks to the attainment of both sustainable growth and price stability for the next few quarters are roughly equal. With underlying inflation still expected to be relatively low, the committee believes that policy accommodation can be removed at a pace that is likely to be measured. Nonetheless, the committee will respond to changes in economic prospects as needed to fulfill its obligation to maintain price stability.Voting for the F.O.M.C. monetary policy action were: Alan Greenspan, chairman; Timothy F. Geithner, vice chairman; Ben S. Bernanke; Susan S. Bies; Roger W. Ferguson Jr.; Edward M. Gramlich; Thomas M. Hoenig; Donald L. Kohn; Cathy E. Minehan; Mark W. Olson; Sandra Pianalto; and William Poole.In a related action, the board of governors approved a 25 basis point increase in the discount rate to 2 1/4 percent. In taking this action, the board approved the requests submitted by the boards of directors of the Federal Reserve Banks of Boston, New York, Philadelphia, Cleveland, Richmond, Atlanta, Chicago, St. Louis, Minneapolis, Kansas City, Dallas and San Francisco.

2004-06-30 00:00:00,2004-07-01 00:00:00,THE RATE INCREASE: THE OVERVIEW; FEDERAL RESERVE RAISES KEY RATE A QUARTER POINT,"The Federal Reserve raised its benchmark interest rate on Wednesday for the first time in four years, officially signaling that a remarkable period of historically low rates is drawing to a close.But even as it increased the cost of borrowing for financial institutions on overnight loans to 1.25 percent from 1 percent, it sought to soothe investors by saying that inflationary pressures remained low and that further rate increases should come at a ''measured'' pace.The Fed's statement was a relief for many on Wall Street, as well as for home buyers, who will be able to get mortgages at comparatively low rates for at least a few more months.It also appears to be good news for President Bush. Even though the Fed is expected to keep increasing interest rates as the November elections approach, the economic impact of those increases is likely to be mild until at least sometime next year.

But some of the Fed's growing chorus of critics on Wall Street warned that the Fed's chairman, Alan Greenspan, might have waited too long to start raising rates. That could force the central bank to play catch-up in tightening monetary policy in the months ahead to prevent inflation from re-emerging as a serious economic threat.

Moreover, strains in financial markets have increased in recent weeks. Today’s action, combined with the policy actions taken earlier, should help promote moderate growth over time.Readings on core inflation have improved modestly this year, but elevated energy and commodity prices, among other factors, may put upward pressure on inflation. In this context, the committee judges that some inflation risks remain, and it will continue to monitor inflation developments carefully.Recent developments, including the deterioration in financial market conditions, have increased the uncertainty surrounding the outlook for economic growth and inflation. The committee will continue to assess the effects of financial and other developments on economic prospects and will act as needed to foster price stability and sustainable economic growth.Voting for the F.O.M.C. monetary policy action were: Ben S. Bernanke, chairman; Timothy F. Geithner, vice chairman; Charles L. Evans; Thomas M. Hoenig; Donald L. Kohn; Randall S. Kroszner; Frederic S. Mishkin; William Poole; and Kevin M. Warsh. Voting against was Eric S. Rosengren, who preferred to lower the target for the federal funds rate by 50 basis points at this meeting.In a related action, the Board of Governors unanimously approved a 25 basis-point decrease in the discount rate to 4.75 percent. In taking this action, the board approved the requests submitted by the Boards of Directors of the Federal Reserve Banks of New York, Philadelphia, Cleveland, Richmond, Atlanta, Chicago and St. Louis.

A Des Moines Register  opinion poll had just shown Huckabee passing Mitt Romney to take  the lead in the run-up to the Jan. 3 caucus. His picture, he already knew,  was on the front page of that morning’s USA Today. Now he was headed  to  Central College, to appear, surrounded by enthusiastic students, on ‘‘The  Early Show’’ on CBS . This kind of momentum, he hoped, would finally  produce enough cash to allow him to charter his own plane.The governor was especially happy that morning about an impending  endorsement he expected (and received the following day) from Tim  LaHaye, the author of the apocalyptic ‘‘Left Behind’’ series  of novels.‘‘Left Behind’’ is wildly popular among evangelicals,  who have bought  more than 65 million copies, making LaHaye a very rich man and one of  the few writers who is also a major philanthropist. Recently he donated a  hockey rink to Jerry Falwell’s Liberty University, although some members  of the faculty there deride ‘‘Left Behind’’ as science  fiction. Huckabee, an  ordained Southern Baptist minister, has no such reservations. He considers  the ‘‘Left Behind’’ books, in which the world comes  to a violent end as Jesus  triumphs over Satan, a ‘‘compelling story written for nontheologians.’’Huckabee’s affability and populist economic and social views have sometimes  been misinterpreted as a moderate brand of evangelical Christianity. In  fact, as he wrote in his book ‘‘Character Makes a Difference,’’ he  considers liberalism  to be a cancer on Christianity. Huckabee is an admirer of the late Jerry  Falwell (whose son, Jerry Jr., recently endorsed his candidacy) and subscribes  wholeheartedly to the principles of the Moral Majority. He also affirms the  Baptist Faith and Message statement: ‘‘The Holy Bible . . . has  truth, without  any mixture of error, for its matter. Therefore, all Scripture is totally true  and  trustworthy.’’

2005-06-30 00:00:00,2005-07-01 00:00:00,Text of Fed Statement on Rates,"Following is the text of a revised statement released by the Federal Reserve yesterday after the Fed's monetary policy panel, the Federal Open Market Committee, decided to raise its benchmark interest rates a quarter-point:The Federal Open Market Committee decided today to raise its target for the federal funds rate by 25 basis points to 31/4 percent.The committee believes that, even after this action, the stance of monetary policy remains accommodative and, coupled with robust underlying growth in productivity, is providing ongoing support to economic activity.Although energy prices have risen further, the expansion remains firm and labor market conditions continue to improve gradually. Pressures on inflation have stayed elevated, but longer-term inflation expectations remain well contained.The committee perceives that, with appropriate monetary policy action, the upside and downside risks to the attainment of both sustainable growth and price stability should be kept roughly equal. With underlying inflation expected to be contained, the committee believes that policy accommodation can be removed at a pace that is likely to be measured. Nonetheless, the committee will respond to changes in economic prospects as needed to fulfill its obligation to maintain price stability.Voting for the F.O.M.C. monetary policy action were: Alan Greenspan, Chairman; Timothy F. Geithner, Vice Chairman; Susan S. Bies; Roger W. Ferguson, Jr.; Richard W. Fisher; Edward M. Gramlich; Donald L. Kohn; Michael H. Moskow; Mark W. Olson; Anthony M. Santomero; and Gary H. Stern.In a related action, the board of governors unanimously approved a 25-basis-point increase in the discount rate to 41/4 percent. In taking this action, the board approved the requests submitted by the boards of directors of the Federal Reserve Banks of Boston, New York, Philadelphia, Cleveland, Richmond, Atlanta, Chicago, St. Louis, Minneapolis, Kansas City, Dallas and San Francisco.

Prices of Treasury notes and bonds posted modest gains in very quiet, trendless trading yesterday, recapturing most of the losses sustained during Monday's session.Traders sold securities early in the day after the release of a Commerce Department report showing that, while economic growth in the second quarter was somewhat slower than previously thought, the rate of inflation was somewhat faster.However, the losses only amounted to as much as one-quarter of a point on long-term bonds. And they were recouped later on weakness in gold and oil prices. Reserves Added by FedSomewhat surprisingly, the day's major event in the credit markets had little or no impact on prices. For the second consecutive day, the Federal Reserve added reserves to the banking system, a move that surprised traders and led some to wonder if the central bank might be sending signals that it intended to ease monetary policy.

Prices climbed at a faster clip than previously thought during the second quarter, pushing the inflation rate further above the expectations of the Federal Reserve and Administration policymakers, Commerce Department figures showed today.None of the new figures, however, made much of an impression on economists or financial markets, and the Reagan Administration insisted there was still no reason to believe inflation was headed for worrisome levels.Marlin Fitzwater, the White House spokesman, said, ''The facts, plus the moderating growth rate, point to inflation remaining under control.''The Commerce Department said that prices rose at a 5 percent rate from April through June, as measured by the fixed-weighted index tied to the gross national product, compared with the 4.7 percent rate estimated for the period in both July and August. This compared with a 3.5 percent inflation rate during the first three months of the year.

Prices of Treasury notes and bonds slumped yesterday, sending the yield on the Treasury's bellwether 30-year bond to a 10-week high of 8.24 percent.Trading was sluggish, as market participants struggled with an offering of $9.5 billion worth of new two-year Treasury notes, the latest in an avalanche of new Treasury issues.Late in the day, the Treasury said the notes were sold at an average yield of 8.37 percent, sharply higher than the average 7.75 percent yield at the last two-year auction on July 26. The price surge came despite early optimism among traders that the auction had gone well. ''We saw pockets of reasonable interest,'' one government securities trader said. ''This is the first Treasury auction in a month that has been fairly priced.''Even so, the slide continued after the auction results were released, and by late in the day the two-year notes were offered on a when-issued basis at a price to yield 8.41 percent.

Orders to American factories for durable goods tumbled 1.9 percent in July to the lowest level in nine months, the Government said today. The report provides further evidence that the economy is weakening.The Commerce Department said demand for durable goods, a wide range of consumer and commercial items expected to last three years or more, totaled a seasonally adjusted $122.9 billion last month, the lowest level since October 1988.It was the fourth drop this year in the sector, which is considered a bellwether of the economy's performance.In June, orders rose 1.4 percent, faster than expected, following a 4.5 percent plunge in May, the steepest drop in 10 months. Orders rose in April and March and fell in February and January.

The bond market rose modestly yesterday, wiping out most of Monday's losses on the 30-year bond and moving higher in other maturities. But traders and analysts are still worried about some sudden surprise from the Republican National Convention and expect the market to be volatile for the rest of the week.The day's economic data continued to paint a picture of an economy growing slowly, which is one of the main reasons prices of notes and bonds have advanced recently.The Commerce Department reported that housing starts fell 2.8 percent in July, which surprised many analysts inasmuch as home mortgage rates are close to 20-year lows. The consensus forecast was for an increase of 1.7 percent.The one possibly positive note in the housing report was that permits for new structures were up 3.7 percent last month. But a lot of those new permits were for multifamily housing, not single-family dwellings, which would give a stronger lift to the economy. Permits for single-family homes have remained basically unchanged since April. Slower Sales Seen

Earlier this year, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation warned that 200 banks with combined assets of more than $80 billion would fail this year. After seven months, however, only 70 banks with $20.9 billion of assets have failed, far below the rate the F.D.I.C. forecast.But even as banking experts debate how much the slowdown stems from election-year politics and how much from the palliative effects of the lower interest rates that make even the weakest banks more profitable, the F.D.I.C. is warning that tougher new regulations that will take effect on Dec. 19 will result in a flurry of bank closings.After Dec. 19, regulators must either start closing banks whose shareholder capital drops below 2 percent of assets, or provide good reasons why they are letting them stay open. A good reason, F.D.I.C. officials say, would be a viable plan for a quick merger or infusion of fresh capital.Under current law, state and Federal regulators do not usually close banks unless they are insolvent, meaning that the value of the bank's assets, like loans and securities, is not equal to the combined total of its capital and what it owes depositors.

""The idea is to close institutions while there is at least some theoretical value left,"" said Robert F. Mialivich, assistant director for bank supervision at the F.D.I.C.

Nonetheless, the degree of the strengthening in final demand over coming quarters, an essential element in sustained economic expansion, is still uncertain.In these circumstances, although the stance of monetary policy is currently accommodative, the committee believes that for the foreseeable future, against the background of its long-run goals of price stability and sustainable economic growth and of the information currently available, the risks are balanced with respect to the prospects for both goals.The committee decided to include in its announcements following its meetings the roll call of the vote on the federal funds rate target, including the preferred policy choice of any dissenters. This action accelerates the release of this information, currently available in the minutes with a lag.To conform to this new practice, the board of governors also decided to report in the written announcement the roll call of any vote on the discount rate, also including the preferred policy choice of any dissenters.Voting for the F.O.M.C. monetary policy action were: Alan Greenspan, chairman; William J. McDonough, vice chairman; Susan S. Bies; Roger W. Ferguson Jr.; Edward M. Gramlich; Jerry L. Jordan; Robert D. McTeer Jr.; Mark W. Olson; Anthony M. Santomero; and Gary H. Stern.

But the Fed laid the groundwork to begin reversing some of the 11 rate cuts it carried out last year as the economy sank into recession.The central bank also took a step to respond to criticism that its deliberations remain too shrouded in secrecy. It said that from now on it would immediately disclose how individual members voted on interest rate decisions. The Fed now waits to disclose the votes of individual members until after the subsequent meeting, when it releases minutes of its deliberations.At today's meeting, the Fed said, all 10 members of the open-market committee supported the decision to leave rates unchanged.

2002-03-19 00:00:00,2002-03-20 00:00:00,AROUND THE MARKETS : Divining the effect of rising rates,"Let the guessing games begin. Investment gurus around the world are turning their prodigious energies to fathoming the future direction of the financial markets in a world of rising interest rates.Not a soul expected the Federal Reserve, which met Tuesday, to lift U.S. rates immediately. The American recovery is not yet trundling ahead with enough momentum to warrant the cooling effects of a rate increase. But market players had generally expected that the Fed would shift its bias to neutral from negative, signaling that it will lift rates in coming months.And the Fed is not alone. As Nomura International put it: ""Other central banks are getting twitchy. Increasingly hawkish noises are being heard in different corners of the world: Canada, Sweden and Australasia."" Sweden and New Zealand raised their benchmark rates this week.Reading the mind of the Fed is tricky at best — and especially so at this early stage of the U.S. economy's slow crawl out of recession. Analysts at Societe Generale recently forecast that the improving American economy will put pressure on the Fed to reverse course on interest rates and start raising them sooner rather than later.

However, inflation pressures seem likely to moderate over time, reflecting contained inflation expectations and the cumulative effects of monetary policy actions and other factors restraining aggregate demand.Nonetheless, the committee judges that some inflation risks remain. The extent and timing of any additional firming that may be needed to address these risks will depend on the evolution of the outlook for both inflation and economic growth, as implied by incoming information.Voting for the F.O.M.C. monetary policy action were: Ben S. Bernanke, chairman; Timothy F. Geithner, vice chairman; Susan S. Bies; Jack Guynn; Donald L. Kohn; Randall S. Kroszner; Sandra Pianalto; Kevin M. Warsh; and Janet L. Yellen. Voting against was Jeffrey M. Lacker, who preferred an increase of 25 basis points in the federal funds rate target at this meeting.

2009-06-24 00:00:00,2009-06-25 00:00:00,Text of Federal Reserve’s Statement on Interest Rates,"Following is the text of the statement by the Federal Reserve on Wednesday announcing it was holding its base federal funds target rate at a record low between zero and 0.25 percent:Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in April suggests that the pace of economic contraction is slowing. Conditions in financial markets have generally improved in recent months. Household spending has shown further signs of stabilizing but remains constrained by ongoing job losses, lower housing wealth and tight credit. Businesses are cutting back on fixed investment and staffing but appear to be making progress in bringing inventory stocks into better alignment with sales. Although economic activity is likely to remain weak for a time, the committee continues to anticipate that policy actions to stabilize financial markets and institutions, fiscal and monetary stimulus, and market forces will contribute to a gradual resumption of sustainable economic growth in a context of price stability.The prices of energy and other commodities have risen of late. However, substantial resource slack is likely to dampen cost pressures and the committee expects that inflation will remain subdued for some time.In these circumstances, the Federal Reserve will employ all available tools to promote economic recovery and to preserve price stability. The committee will maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to  1/4 percent and continues to anticipate that economic conditions are likely to warrant exceptionally low levels of the federal funds rate for an extended period. As previously announced, to provide support to mortgage lending and housing markets and to improve overall conditions in private credit markets, the Federal Reserve will purchase a total of up to $1.25 trillion of agency mortgage-backed securities and up to $200 billion of agency debt by the end of the year. In addition, the Federal Reserve will buy up to $300 billion of Treasury securities by autumn. The committee will continue to evaluate the timing and overall amounts of its purchases of securities in light of the evolving economic outlook and conditions in financial markets. The Federal Reserve is monitoring the size and composition of its balance sheet and will make adjustments to its credit and liquidity programs as warranted.Voting for the F.O.M.C. monetary policy action were: Ben S. Bernanke, chairman; William C. Dudley, vice chairman; Elizabeth A. Duke; Charles L. Evans; Donald L. Kohn; Jeffrey M. Lacker; Dennis P. Lockhart; Daniel K. Tarullo; Kevin M. Warsh; and Janet L. Yellen.

2009-06-24 00:00:00,2009-06-25 00:00:00,The Drug Industry’s Offer,"President Obama hailed a pledge by the pharmaceutical industry to contribute $80 billion in drug discounts and other savings over the next 10 years as “a significant breakthrough on the road to health care reform.” The pledge should help large numbers of older Americans struggling to pay high drug bills. But before anyone gets too ecstatic, we will need a lot more details about what industry is giving up and what it is getting.The deal was negotiated in private among the industry, Senator Max Baucus, chairman of the Finance Committee and a crucial figure in shaping health reform, and the White House. From the broad outlines described by the White House, it looks as if $30 billion would be used to cut in half the price of brand-name drugs sold to Medicare patients who have reached a gap in coverage known as the doughnut hole.That could be a great help for elderly Americans of modest means who, after reaching the gap, stop taking their medicines rather than pay the full cost themselves. And it could reduce the need for the federal government to close the hole entirely on its own. The move has been justifiably praised by  AARP and the Medicare Rights Center, both advocates for beneficiaries.The other $50 billion pledged is meant to save the government money that could be applied to covering the uninsured. There appear to be three main elements: a big increase in the discounts drug companies are required to give to Medicaid programs for the poor; a new fee imposed upon the companies; and a new regulatory pathway to foster the development of generics to compete with brand-name biological drugs.

Eager to have a strong voice in the health care debate — and head off more draconian demands — six major health care industries have promised to help reduce the growth in spending. So far the pharmaceutical industry is the only one to  come up with specific requirements that it is willing to meet.

The Congress and the public should see these proposals as an opening bid and not the final word.They will still provide less savings to the federal budget than the administration had been seeking. And viewed against the backdrop of the $1 trillion or more needed to finance health care reform over the next decade, these cost reductions seem small. The $80 billion is also a fraction of the nation’s overall drug spending, which federal estimates suggest will total $3.3 trillion over the next decade.

2003-10-28 00:00:00,2003-10-29 00:00:00,Fed Statement on Economy,"The statement released by the Federal Reserve yesterday is nearly identical to its statements after monetary policy meetings in September and August. The only difference is its description of the labor market, which was ''weakening'' in September and appeared ''mixed'' in August, but now ''appears to be stabilizing.'' Following is the text of yesterday's statement:The Federal Open Market Committee decided today to keep its target for the federal funds rate at 1 percent. The committee continues to believe that an accommodative stance of monetary policy, coupled with robust underlying growth in productivity, is providing important ongoing support to economic activity. The evidence accumulated over the intermeeting period confirms that spending is firming, and the labor market appears to be stabilizing. Business pricing power and increases in core consumer prices remain muted.The committee perceives that the upside and downside risks to the attainment of sustainable growth for the next few quarters are roughly equal. In contrast, the probability, though minor, of an unwelcome fall in inflation exceeds that of a rise in inflation from its already low level. The committee judges that on balance, the risk of inflation becoming undesirably low remains the predominant concern for the foreseeable future. In these circumstances, the committee believes that policy accommodation can be maintained for a considerable period.Voting for the F.O.M.C. monetary policy action were: Alan Greenspan, chairman; Ben S. Bernanke; Susan S. Bies; J. Alfred Broaddus Jr.; Roger W. Ferguson Jr.; Edward M. Gramlich; Jack Guynn; Donald L. Kohn; Michael H. Moskow; Mark W. Olson; Robert T. Parry; and Jamie B. Stewart Jr.

2003-10-28 00:00:00,2003-10-29 00:00:00,"Optimistic on Jobs, Fed Keeps Interest Low","The Federal Reserve kept short-term interest rates at 1 percent on Tuesday, the lowest level in 45 years, and suggested that it would continue to do so until at least sometime next year.In a statement accompanying the decision, the Fed was optimistic for the first time this year about job creation and employment, saying, ''The labor market appears to be stabilizing.''But the Fed did not mention that economic growth appears to have accelerated to a blistering annual pace of 6 percent in recent months, or refer to a raft of data showing that business spending and investor confidence has climbed sharply.Instead, it reiterated its view of the last several months that there is more risk that inflation will be too low rather than too high, and it repeated its intention to continue its policy of rock-bottom interest rates for ''a considerable period.''

The committee continues to believe that this accommodative stance of monetary policy, coupled with still robust underlying growth in productivity, is providing important ongoing support to economic activity.The limited number of incoming economic indicators since the November meeting, taken together, are not inconsistent with the economy working its way through its current soft spot.In these circumstances, the committee believes that, against the background of its long-run goals of price stability and sustainable economic growth and of the information currently available, the risks are balanced with respect to the prospects for both goals for the foreseeable future.Voting for the F.O.M.C. monetary policy action were Alan Greenspan, chairman; William J. McDonough, vice chairman; Ben S. Bernanke, Susan S. Bies; Roger W. Ferguson Jr.; Edward M. Gramlich; Jerry L. Jordan; Donald L. Kohn, Robert D. McTeer Jr.; Mark W. Olson; Anthony M.

2002-12-10 00:00:00,2002-12-11 00:00:00,Fed Decides Not to Change Interest Rates,"The Federal Reserve kept interest rates unchanged today, leaving its main short-term rate at its lowest level in 41 years as policy makers wait for more signs of economic strength.In a statement after today's meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee, which sets monetary policy, the Fed repeated its view that the economy was working through a ''soft spot'' and that existing monetary policy was loose enough at the moment.Last month, the Federal Reserve made an aggressive move by reducing the federal funds rate on overnight loans between banks by half a percentage point, to just 1.25 percent. Alan Greenspan, the Fed chairman, has called the move an ''insurance premium'' in case the economy proves to be weaker than expected.Given the big rate cut last month and the continued signs of economic weakness, the decision today to stand pat came as no surprise. But analysts said the absence of new guidance from the Fed reinforced their view that rates would be kept down for at least the next several months.

2002-12-10 00:00:00,2002-12-11 00:00:00,Knives Drawn for a $15 Billion Family Pie,"Jay A. Pritzker, the aging scion of Chicago's wealthiest and leading philanthropic family, called a meeting in June 1995 to hand 11 members of the next generation an important memorandum, outlining the Pritzker principle that family money should be shared among them and appointing a triumvirate to replace him at the empire's helm.But after Mr. Pritzker's death in 1999 and a nasty squabble between the triumvirate and the other cousins, that blueprint was torn up last year and replaced by a secret plan to carve up the $15 billion empire over the next decade, most likely taking public key assets like the Hyatt hotel chain, and handing each of the 11 a $1.4 billion purse.Now, a cousin who was left out of that pact, Liesel Pritzker, an 18-year-old movie actress and freshman at Columbia University, has sued the family, bringing unwanted attention to the underlying dispute and threatening the agreement. In her lawsuit, Liesel, who is a member of the family's fourth generation, contends that her trust funds were emptied to benefit the other members of that generation, who are decades older. It contends they are treating her and her 20-year-old brother, Matthew, like members of the fifth generation who are closer to their ages.''The Pritzker family will no longer be the major factor it was,'' said Leon Danco, chairman of the Center for Family Business, a Cleveland consulting firm that advises family businesses on management and governance. ''The dissolution of the family is an attribute of human nature. The Pritzkers were a powerful family. Jay Pritzker died and the money is diffused and it creates new factions and new allegiances.''

However, inflation pressures seem likely to moderate over time, reflecting reduced impetus from energy prices, contained inflation expectations, and the cumulative effects of monetary policy actions and other factors restraining aggregate demand.Nonetheless, the committee judges that some inflation risks remain.

WASHINGTON, Sept. 20 — Senate Republicans formally put aside a broad immigration overhaul sought by President Bush  on Wednesday and decided instead to press ahead with narrower bills to require building 700 miles of fence on the southwestern border.Senator Bill Frist of Tennessee, the majority leader, said the fate of millions of illegal immigrants already in the United States had become a “fundamental sticking point” in trying to reach agreement with the House on a broad bill.Mr. Frist said the fence proposal, which the House has passed, was the best alternative if lawmakers wanted to salvage some immigration changes before the Nov. 7 elections.“Let’s focus on a problem the American people understand,’’ the senator said, “and that is, we have hundreds of thousands of people coming across our border every year into our country.”

1998-05-19 00:00:00,1998-05-20 00:00:00,THE MARKETS: BONDS; Treasuries Dip on Fed Inaction,"Treasury prices ended slightly lower yesterday after the Federal Reserve, as expected, left interest rates unchanged.The price of the 30-year Treasury bond fell 5/32, to 102 22/32. The bond's yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, edged up to 5.93 percent, from 5.92 percent on Monday. There was little reaction to the Fed's announcement at 2:15 P.M.Until last month, many bond market participants were confident that the central bank would not move to raise short-term interest rates anytime soon. But that changed, and there is now some anxiety looking ahead to the the next meeting of Fed policy makers, the Federal Open Market Committee, in July.''With signs of a slowing economy increasing, inflation still calm, the dollar still strong and Asia still in turmoil, the Fed decided to wait until its next powwow to see if an economic slackening actually materializes and thus provides the rationale to continue to adhere to a 5.5 percent Federal funds rate,'' said Donald Fine, the chief market analyst for Chase Asset Management.

However, he said, ''in the absence of a significant moderation in business activity, many on the F.O.M.C. will want to be pre-emptive and tighten at the July 1 meeting because of fears that the extremely low rate of unemployment will exacerbate already budding wage pressures and lead directly to increasing inflationary tendencies in the overall economy.''

Mr. Fine also said economic statistics over the next six weeks would be crucial to the Fed and would therefore come under intense scrutiny by bond investors.The Government released its April housing starts report yesterday and reaffirmed what the market already knows, that the housing industry remained strong. Consequently, the housing report had little effect on the market.

1998-05-19 00:00:00,1998-05-20 00:00:00,"Fed Lets Rates Stand, Fearing Harm to Asia","The Federal Reserve declined once again today to increase short-term interest rates, apparently determining that the threat of inflation remained remote and that the latest phase of the worsening Asian economic crisis might be exacerbated by any rate rise now in the United States.Several weeks ago, there were hints that the Federal Reserve might be leaning toward increasing interest rates sometime soon. But a number of recent indicators, including continued low inflation and the announcement this morning of a modest decline in the starts of new housing, have lessened immediate fears of an overheating of the economy, market analysts said.The decision to leave rates unchanged, at least for now, was hardly a surprise on Wall Street, where many leading economists had predicted that the policy-setting Federal Open Market Committee, which meets regularly to review interest-rate policy, would again sit on its hands. The markets yawned in response: The Dow Jones industrial average ended the day up 3.74 points, at 9,054.65, after having risen 62 points earlier in the day.While no one knows for sure what motivated the Federal Reserve's decision, its policy makers had reason to worry that an increase now would only worsen problems in Asia. In recent weeks, there have been signs of renewed economic trouble in Thailand and South Korea, and the images of Jakarta in flames last week rekindled fear of a contagion effect that would discourage further investment in Asia.

Soldiers blocked key squares and intersections. Barricades also isolated the Parliament building, where thousands of protesting students had camped overnight. A1The student protesters are treating the Suharto Government with undisguised contempt. Hundreds of students barged into the main chamber of the House of Representatives, filling up the seats and galleries and conducting a sort of spontaneous shadow government.

Meanwhile, the National Association of Purchasing Management reported that its monthly index of manufacturing activity in the Chicago region, seen as a bellwether for the economy, unexpectedly rose to 59.5 points in March from 57.8 in February.Taken together, the numbers indicate that the economy remains on a roll, analysts said.''These numbers are still remarkable,'' said Kathleen Stephansen, economist at Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette Securities. ''The expectation is that income will continue and buying plans will hold up.''With inflation nearly absent, the Federal Reserve's policy makers, as expected, held interest rates steady today at a meeting of the Open Market Committee, which has not changed borrowing costs for more than a year.

In a related action, the Board of Governors approved a 25 basis point reduction in the discount rate, to 2 percent.The committee continues to believe that an accommodative stance of monetary policy, coupled with still robust underlying growth in productivity, is providing important ongoing support to economic activity. Recent signs point to a firming in spending, markedly improved financial conditions, and labor and product markets that are stabilizing. The economy, nonetheless, has yet to exhibit sustainable growth. With inflationary expectations subdued, the committee judged that a slightly more expansive monetary policy would add further support for an economy which it expects to improve over time.The committee perceives that the upside and downside risks to the attainment of sustainable growth for the next few quarters are roughly equal. In contrast, the probability, though minor, of an unwelcome substantial fall in inflation exceeds that of a pickup in inflation from its already low level. On balance, the committee believes that the latter concern is likely to predominate for the foreseeable future.Voting for the F.O.M.C. monetary policy action were Alan Greenspan, chairman; Ben S. Bernanke; Susan S. Bies; J. Alfred Broaddus Jr.; Roger W. Ferguson Jr.; Edward M. Gramlich; Jack Guynn; Donald L. Kohn; Michael H. Moskow; Mark W. Olson; and Jamie B. Stewart Jr.Voting against the action was Robert T. Parry. President Parry preferred a 50 basis point reduction in the target for the federal funds rate.In taking the discount rate action, the Federal Reserve Board approved the requests submitted by the boards of directors of the Federal Reserve Banks of Boston, New York, St. Louis, Kansas City and San Francisco.

The full Senate has not approved the accord, but after days of dispute, it appeared to remove one of the last obstacles to approval of the bill.''We will now have clear sailing to final passage,'' said Senator Max Baucus of Montana, principal Democratic sponsor of the bill.

The economy seems likely to continue to expand at a moderate pace over coming quarters.Readings on core inflation have improved modestly in recent months.However, a sustained moderation in inflation pressures has yet to be convincingly demonstrated. Moreover, the high level of resource utilization has the potential to sustain those pressures.In these circumstances, the committee’s predominant policy concern remains the risk that inflation will fail to moderate as expected. Future policy adjustments will depend on the evolution of the outlook for both inflation and economic growth, as implied by incoming information.Voting for the F.O.M.C. monetary policy action were Ben S. Bernanke, chairman; Timothy F. Geithner, vice chairman; Thomas M. Hoenig; Donald L. Kohn; Randall S. Kroszner; Cathy E. Minehan; Frederic S. Mishkin; Michael H. Moskow; William Poole; and Kevin M.

Nonetheless, the degree of the strengthening in final demand over coming quarters, an essential element in sustained economic expansion, is still uncertain.In these circumstances, although the stance of monetary policy is currently accommodative, the committee believes that, for the foreseeable future, against the background of its long-run goals of price stability and sustainable economic growth and of the information currently available, the risks are balanced with respect to the prospects for both goals.Voting for the F.O.M.C. monetary policy action were: Alan Greenspan, chairman; William J.

The productivity gain is evidence that companies may be able to restore their depressed profit margins without having to jack up prices.The decision left the federal funds target rate on overnight loans among banks at a 40-year low, 1.75 percent, where it has been for nearly five months. Economists said the Fed would probably not seriously consider raising rates until August, especially if the unemployment rate continued to rise, as it has in recent months.On Wall Street, stock prices were little changed. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 28.51, to 9,836.55. The Nasdaq composite index closed at 1,573.82, down 4.66.

Growth in the current quarter appears robust. Fears of a credit squeeze in the bond market have abated. And while manufacturers and farmers still suffer from exports lost as a result of the financial turmoil of the last year and a half, the latest trade figures suggested that the worst may be past, even for them.

Prices of Treasury bonds and notes fell by as much as a point in fairly light trading yesterday, as market participants reacted negatively to the implications of a report showing a big drop in the nation's merchandise trade deficit in March.The sharp $4.08 billion decline in the March deficit from February's $13.8 billion shortfall was far above market expectations, and in the minutes after the 8:30 A.M. release of the figures, bond prices rallied by more than a point.But once analysts had a chance to study the numbers, the early enthusiasm gave way to sober reassessment and a sharp selloff.Closer examination of the data showed that very rapid export growth was the primary reason behind the improvement. Moreover, imports, which economists would like to see decline, rose again in March, although at a far slower rate than exports expanded.

2009-12-16 00:00:00,2009-12-17 00:00:00,Text of the Federal Reserve’s Statement,"Following is the text of the Federal Reserve’s statement on Wednesday announcing it was holding its base federal funds target rate at a record low between zero and 0.25 percent: Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in November suggests that economic activity has continued to pick up and that the deterioration in the labor market is abating. The housing sector has shown some signs of improvement over recent months. Household spending appears to be expanding at a moderate rate, though it remains constrained by a weak labor market, modest income growth, lower housing wealth and tight credit.Businesses are still cutting back on fixed investment, though at a slower pace, and remain reluctant to add to payrolls; they continue to make progress in bringing inventory stocks into better alignment with sales. Financial market conditions have become more supportive of economic growth.Although economic activity is likely to remain weak for a time, the committee anticipates that policy actions to stabilize financial markets and institutions, fiscal and monetary stimulus and market forces will contribute to a strengthening of economic growth and a gradual return to higher levels of resource utilization in a context of price stability.With substantial resource slack likely to continue to dampen cost pressures and with longer-term inflation expectations stable, the committee expects that inflation will remain subdued for some time.

The committee will maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to  ¼ percent and continues to anticipate that economic conditions, including low rates of resource utilization, subdued inflation trends and stable inflation expectations, are likely to warrant exceptionally low levels of the federal funds rate for an extended period.

To provide support to mortgage lending and housing markets and to improve overall conditions in private credit markets, the Federal Reserve is in the process of purchasing $1.25 trillion of agency mortgage-backed securities and about $175 billion of agency debt. In order to promote a smooth transition in markets, the committee is gradually slowing the pace of these purchases, and it anticipates that these transactions will be executed by the end of the first quarter of 2010. The committee will continue to evaluate the timing and overall amounts of its purchases of securities in light of the evolving economic outlook and conditions in financial markets.

2009-12-16 00:00:00,2009-12-17 00:00:00,Judge Rises to the Challenge in Tavern Trademark Case,"A federal judge who will decide whether the name Tavern on the Green belongs to New York City or the restaurant’s current operators rained a barrage of  Socratic questions on a succession of trademark lawyers  who  popped up in the legal equivalent of Whack-A-Mole on Wednesday. 
Judge Miriam Goldman Cedarbaum of the Southern District of Manhattan reserved judgment on the name, which was bestowed on the property by the city in 1934 and trademarked in 1981 by its operator at the time, Warner LeRoy, whose family has lost the right to run the restaurant and has placed it in bankruptcy proceedings. But Judge Cedarbaum seemed to give equal measures of agita and hope to each side. 
While offering little indication of which side she favored, the judge gave every evidence that she would treat the case as a complex intellectual-property dispute that could be breaking new legal ground. “This is a very interesting case,” she said at one point, assuming a half-smile.
The ownership issue has been a flash point in Tavern’s bankruptcy case since the name — which has been appraised at $19 million — is potentially the restaurant’s most valuable asset.
Lawyers on both sides were circumspect after the hearing. The case “raises a lot of issues of concern to the court,” said Gerald E. Singleton, senior intellectual property lawyer for the New York City Law Department, “and this is far from a slam dunk for either side.”
Norman N. Kinel, lawyer for the committee of Tavern’s 452 unsecured creditors, who are owed $8 million, said that “from her spirited questioning, it is very clear that the judge is familiar with the arguments, and is giving the matter appropriate consideration.”
Other lawyers — there were 10 before the court and eight more attorneys and their assistants looking on — declined to comment. 
There was quiet drama in the incisive questions that enlivened the long play of argument centering on a legendary Manhattan building that began in 1872 as a sheepfold for a herd that chomped the grass in the adjoining field, now known as the Sheep Meadow.   
And both the city and the Tavern operators seemed to bear the brunt of the judge’s acute legal scrutiny. 
To the city, the judge stated flatly: “We have an incontestable trademark that you want to overcome as a matter of law.” She added: “Selecting a name doesn’t give you a trademark.” And of the incontestability, she said: “It is a heavy burden.” 
But to Tavern’s lawyers, Judge Cedarbaum commented about Mr. LeRoy’s use of the Tavern on the Green title that “he was given the name,” adding that “the city had always owned a building in Central Park that was called Tavern on the Green.”
When Mr. LeRoy submitted the trademark application in the 1970s the judge noted that he “didn’t disclose there had been a restaurant known as Tavern on the Green in the same place in Central Park for many years before.” Of making the sheepfold a restaurant, she said, “nobody questions that was the city’s idea.” 
The judge sent lawyers for both sides scurrying back to their offices to do homework, asking for more relevant prior cases that would shed light on the trademarking of a restaurant name describing a physical location, that is also a business providing services.  
The case has been bubbling in two separate federal courts. Only two weeks ago, on Dec. 1, Judge Cedarbaum ruled that she — and not a judge in United States Bankruptcy Court in Manhattan — would decide the ownership issue. Under the federal judicial bureaucracy, bankruptcy court is subordinate when the district court asserts its jurisdiction. 
“Trademark law is something that this court regularly examines,” Judge Cedarbaum said earlier this month, referring to intellectual property disputes that frequently wind up in the Southern District. 
At his death in 2001 at the age of 65, Mr. LeRoy named his daughter Jennifer Oz LeRoy chief executive of Tavern; the family holds the license to the restaurant under the name Tavern on the Green Limited Partnership. The LeRoys and their managers have said the trademarked name would have value in other locations, and they already market a line of Tavern on the Green salad dressings and gift items.
In two weeks the LeRoys must surrender their jurisdiction over Tavern to a new operator. Dean J. Poll, who runs the Boathouse restaurant in Central Park, was awarded the city’s new 20-year license to run Tavern starting Jan. 1, but he hasn’t signed a contract with Tavern’s landlord, the Parks Department. And he has yet to come to an agreement with the Hotel Trades Council, which represents some 400 Tavern employees.
Mr. Poll’s lawyer, Barry B. LePatner, has said of the name, “the only prospective purchaser is Dean Poll — and he is not paying very much for it.”
In its most recent court papers the city argued that the Tavern name is specific to the Central Park location and “associated in the minds of consumers with a specific place.”
But in its latest legal filings before Judge Cedarbaum, Tavern’s official committee of unsecured creditors  termed the restaurant under pre-LeRoy ownership “Tavern-in-the-Red,” describing it as a “dingy little money-losing rustic pub” before the LeRoys made an “investment of many millions of dollars and a complete gut and rebuild,” transforming it to “a world-class, opulent restaurant.” 
Furthermore, the name Tavern on the Green “now stands for the excellent creation of Warner LeRoy,” David H. T. Kane, a trademark lawyer for Tavern, explained to the judge on Wednesday. Both sides agree that under the family’s tenure, it became one of the country’s most lucrative restaurants. 
But at the Wednesday hearing, the city also introduced last-minute evidence — from, yes, 1956 — in the form of press releases and questions and answers authored by Robert Moses, the city parks commissioner then, who originally oversaw the naming of the sheepfold as a restaurant called Tavern on the Green in 1934.
Mr. Moses was quoted as saying that Tavern “is patronized by hundreds of thousands every year,” adding that “in recent years the use of the Tavern on the Green in Central Park has increased so greatly that enlargement of the building” was necessary. 
Tavern’s lawyers challenged the admission of the materials, which were nevertheless discussed at length. The city’s lawyer, Mr. Singleton, was expected to use the documents as an indication that Tavern was a popular attraction long before Mr. LeRoy reinvented it in 1976, in an effort to undermine claims that Mr. LeRoy’s association amounted to value added for the restaurant. 
Potentially, the trademark could be a lucrative bankruptcy asset. Last year Gabe Fried, chief executive of another brand advisory firm hired by Tavern, Streambank LLC, said his company sold the trademark and brand of the bankrupt Circuit City electronics chain for $17.5 million, Mr. Fried said, and sold the trademark and logo of the bankrupt KB Toys chain for $2.1 million at auction. 
The Tavern on the Green name was appraised at $19 million by Marshall & Stevens, a valuation firm. But Mr. Fried said last week that “it is too early to speculate on the value” of the Tavern trademark.
Since the LeRoy family would lose the license to operate the restaurant in the new year, “the infrastructure that helped support the value of the name would not be there any more,” Mr. Fried said. Therefore, the name’s “liquidation value will be lower than the fair market value,” probably less than $19 million.
To Mr. Fried, “The bottom line is that it is hard to think of a restaurant name that has as broad national and international recognition as Tavern on the Green,” he said. 
To hedge its bets against a courtroom defeat, the city has already registered a substitute name with New York State: Tavern in the Park.
In court the LeRoys have submitted proof of the legality of the original trademark certificate of ownership, and proof that the family has successfully defended the trademark through the years; they have argued, too, that the city never challenged that trademark — even when it renewed the LeRoys’ operating license in 1985.
Furthermore, the LeRoys opened a fine-dining restaurant in Wellington, Fla., invoking the Tavern on the Green name in 2006. Though at the time the parks department sent a letter to the LeRoys requesting that the trademark be turned over to the city, the LeRoys claimed ownership and operated the restaurant until 2009 without further city objection. 
“After being silent and claiming absolutely no ownership interest in the Tavern Mark for virtually the entirety of three decades, the city now has mounted a full-court media and legal press centered on a baseless claim of trademark ownership,” the creditors have charged in court papers.
In its own court papers the city has termed the LeRoys “merely custodians and caretakers of the name,” adding that nothing in the license agreement “authorizes them to walk away with the name at the end of the license term.” 
Furthermore, the city has derided the notion, in the creditors’ arguments, that “some city employee actually had to don an apron and personally supervise food preparation at Tavern on the Green in order for the city to establish and claim trademark rights,” the city’s latest filings assert. 
The city has also excoriated the LeRoys for a “failure to produce” the early 1970s agreement whereby Warner LeRoy purchased the Tavern assets of Restaurant Associates, the previous operator, asking if the predecessor claimed to own — and sell – “the Tavern name to LeRoy?”
After an hour and a half of closely parsed disputation and pointed cut-and-thrust, Judge Cedarbaum asked for more information from the parties, saying, “I will do my best to expedite the matter.” Her decision is not expected before the end of the year.

The rally in the Government bond market continued yesterday, as traders pushed up prices of some Treasury securities as much as a point and long-term interest rates fell to their lowest levels since the Persian Gulf crisis began.The catalyst behind yesterday's move was a Federal Reserve report that industrial output had dropped eight-tenths of a percent in October, the first decline since April.The drop in the industrial production index was slightly more than had been expected, but economists and bond dealers said the depth of the decline was not as significant as its breadth.

Yesterday was a choppy one on Wall Street with stock prices dropping slightly. Trading was brisk and oil prices edged $1.25 a barrel higher, to $33.12. Program trading was heavy and small stocks picked up a bit.Nervous investors cashed in their chips after the Federal Reserve, which was widely expected to trim interest rates as soon as yesterday or today took no immediate action.By the end of the day, the Dow Jones industrial average of 30 blue- chip stocks gave up 4.95 points to close at 2,535.40. The American Stock Exchange's market value index and the Nasdaq composite index of over-the-counter stocks edged ahead.Some analysts expect an upturn in the broad market before many days, largely because the Fed's widely heralded rate cut is still believed to be on the way -- particularly because of growing concern that the economy is faltering badly.

The output of American factories, mines and utilities dropped eight-tenths of 1 percent in October, prompting many analysts to declare that the economy as a whole has now conclusively slipped into recession.The decline, the first since April and the largest since January, was exceptionally widespread. And it intensified the belief that the Federal Reserve would move soon to cut interest rates again to arrest what could become a rapid economic contraction.""The steep decline in industrial production in October demonstrates that the economy is now entering the free fall stage,"" said Gordon Richards of the National Association of Manufacturers. ""The evidence of recession is now unambiguous.""

EARLIER this month, at a conference in Tokyo, the vice chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, Manuel H. Johnson, said he was ''not uncomfortable with the current level of exchange rates.'' Hidden in that off-the-cuff comment may be a growing rift between the Federal Reserve and the Treasury Department over the dollar.Although Mr. Johnson's remarks seemed entirely consistent with those he had uttered in the past, this time the foreign exchange markets reacted by sending the dollar to three-year highs against the yen. Since then, the dollar has climbed even higher, although other factors, like the drop in the Tokyo stock market, have also had an effect.The most elementary reading of Mr. Johnson's remarks was that the Federal Reserve was content to hold interest rates firm and would refrain from intervening in the foreign exchange markets. But given the uncertainty in Japan's stock market, a non-interventionist policy would almost certainly drive the dollar higher against the yen, something the Treasury, which is concerned about exports, almost certainly does not want.Carl Weinberg, chief economist at High Frequency Economics in New York, found Mr. Johnson's comments so important that ''I devoted two issues of my newsletter to them.'' Normally, the Fed does not take a position on the value of the dollar. ''It does what it is told by the Treasury,'' Mr. Weinberg said. ''But this remark signals a potential shift in the way the Fed sees itself.''

Prices of Treasury securities dipped slightly in very slow trading yesterday, as dealers placed bids on $10 billion worth of new two-year notes - the only real activity of the day.''We thought the two-year would spark some interest, but even though the auction went well, it wasn't enough,'' said Joe Liro, a vice president and money market economist at S. G. Warburg Securities Inc. ''We believe there is a lot of money on the sidelines, but at this juncture there is no reason for that money to come in.''At the auction, the notes were sold at an average yield of 8.59 percent, up from the 8.50 percent average yield at the last two-year note sale on Feb. 21, and the highest yield on a two-year note since the auction last May 24.As expected, the attractive yields generated strong demand from investors.Non-competitive bids for the notes, a good barometer of retail demand, amounted to $1.56 billion for the new notes. It was the largest non-competitive bid since the two-year auction held on April 26. $8 Billion Sale Today Today the Treasury is expected to sell $8 billion worth of new four-year notes.

2009-09-23 00:00:00,2009-09-24 00:00:00,Text of the Federal Reserve Statement on Interest Rates,"Following is the text of the Federal Reserve’s statement on Wednesday announcing it was holding its base federal funds target rate at a record low between zero and 0.25 percent: Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in August suggests that economic activity has picked up following its severe downturn. Conditions in financial markets have improved further, and activity in the housing sector has increased. Household spending seems to be stabilizing, but remains constrained by ongoing job losses, sluggish income growth, lower housing wealth and tight credit. Businesses are still cutting back on fixed investment and staffing, though at a slower pace; they continue to make progress in bringing inventory stocks into better alignment with sales. Although economic activity is likely to remain weak for a time, the committee anticipates that policy actions to stabilize financial markets and institutions, fiscal and monetary stimulus, and market forces will support a strengthening of economic growth and a gradual return to higher levels of resource utilization in a context of price stability.With substantial resource slack likely to continue to dampen cost pressures and with longer-term inflation expectations stable, the committee expects that inflation will remain subdued for some time.In these circumstances, the Federal Reserve will continue to employ a wide range of tools to promote economic recovery and to preserve price stability. The committee will maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to   1/4 percent and continues to anticipate that economic conditions are likely to warrant exceptionally low levels of the federal funds rate for an extended period. To provide support to mortgage lending and housing markets, and to improve overall conditions in private credit markets, the Federal Reserve will purchase a total of $1.25 trillion of agency mortgage-backed securities and up to $200 billion of agency debt. The committee will gradually slow the pace of these purchases in order to promote a smooth transition in markets and anticipates that they will be executed by the end of the first quarter of 2010. As previously announced, the Federal Reserve’s purchases of $300 billion of Treasury securities will be completed by the end of October 2009. The committee will continue to evaluate the timing and overall amounts of its purchases of securities in light of the evolving economic outlook and conditions in financial markets. The Federal Reserve is monitoring the size and composition of its balance sheet and will make adjustments to its credit and liquidity programs as warranted.Voting for the F.O.M.C. monetary policy action were: Ben S.

2009-09-23 00:00:00,2009-09-24 00:00:00,Investors Retreat as Post-Fed Rally Quickly Fades,"Wall Street got an initial lift on Wednesday from the Federal Reserve’s assessment that an economic recovery was under way, but the glow faded fast, dragging stocks to their second day of losses this week.
The Dow Jones industrial average briefly crossed 9,900 points after the Fed released its statement at 2:15 p.m., but then a spree of selling pulled the market into the red, The New York Times’s Jack Healy reported. Financial firms led the way lower, and oil producers and industrial stocks slid as commodity prices dipped.
While investors found few surprises in the Fed’s words, the statement still offered some support for the prevailing economic outlook.
“The Fed statement didn’t really change anything,” Nick Kalivas, vice president of financial research at MF Globa, told The Timesl. “They went out of their way not to rock the boat.”
The Dow Jones industrial average fell 81.32 points, or 0.8 percent, to close at 9,748.55. The broader Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index lost 10.79 points, or 1 percent, to end at 1,060.87, while the Nasdaq composite index slipped 14.88 points, or 0.7 percent, to 2,131.42.
With no striking revelations from the Fed, investors homed in on nagging questions about whether stocks had become too expensive. The price-to-earnings ratio of the S.& P. 500, a broad measure of how stocks are priced compared with corporate profits, rose to its highest point in a year this week, according to Bloomberg News data.
In a regular Wall Street ritual, investors and analysts scoured a statement from the Fed as its Open Market Committee concluded a two-day meeting, seeking the central bank’s views on the prospects for inflation, interest rates and other aspects of the economy.
“Economic activity has picked up following its severe downturn,” the Fed wrote in its statement. “Conditions in financial markets have improved further, and activity in the housing sector has increased.”
As expected, the Fed left its key short-term interest rate untouched at a record low of close to zero, and it announced it would extend its program to buy more than $1 trillion in mortgage-backed securities to March 31.
Investors do not expect the Fed to lift its overnight federal funds rate until next year, given the huge challenges facing the economy as it tries to climb out of a deep recession. Unemployment is heading toward 10 percent, factories are still running at well under full capacity and credit markets are still fragile.
The prices of inflation-resistant investments fell on Wednesday as the Fed said that rapidly rising prices were not a threat, predicting that inflation would remain “subdued” for a while. Crude oil fell $2.79 a barrel, to $68.97, on the New York Mercantile Exchange, and gold and copper prices also slipped.
But investors grabbed up Treasury notes after the Fed released its statement, heartened by expectations of low inflation.
Yields on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note had been higher for much of the day after an auction of five-year notes drew lackluster response, but yields dropped after the Fed’s announcement as investors speculated that lengthening out the mortgage-purchase program would help to keep interest rates low.
“The mortgage market is such a huge driver of rates,” George Goncalves, head of fixed-income strategy at Cantor Fitzgerald, told The Times. “You have another large investor that hasn’t gone away.”
But Fed officials said the economy was continuing to improve, albeit slowly, leaving open the question of how and when the bank would begin to withdraw its emergency financing programs.
The Federal Reserve is monitoring the size and composition of its balance sheet and will make adjustments to its credit and liquidity programs as warranted.
The Treasury’s 10-year note rose 7/32 , to 101 23/32. The yield fell to 3.42 percent, from 3.44 percent on Tuesday.

2003-12-09 00:00:00,2003-12-10 00:00:00,Fed Keeps Rates Steady but Paves Way for Rise,"WASHINGTON, Dec. 9 - The Federal Reserve kept its benchmark short-term interest rate at 1 percent on Tuesday, the lowest level in 45 years, but it laid the groundwork for a gradual tightening of monetary policy next year.In a significant shift by the Federal Open Market Committee, which sets monetary policy, the Fed said the risk of ""an unwelcome fall in inflation has diminished in recent months and now appears almost equal to that of a rise in inflation.""That was a retreat from the Fed's language of the last several months, when it justified its policy of rock-bottom interest rates in large part on concern that the risks of declining prices, or deflation, were greater than those of inflation. At the same time, the Fed moved again to soothe investors by repeating its assertion that inflation remains low enough to allow a policy of cheap money ""for a considerable period.""Analysts and investors had been focused on that phrase in the run-up to Tuesday's meeting, with some predicting that the Fed would drop it and implicitly abandon its open-ended commitment to low rates.

2003-12-09 00:00:00,2003-12-10 00:00:00,Fed Statement on Interest Rates,"Following is the text of a statement released by the Federal Reserve yesterday after the Fed's monetary policy panel, the Federal Open Market Committee, decided to leave interest rates unchanged:The Federal Open Market Committee decided today to keep its target for the federal funds rate at 1 percent.The committee continues to believe that an accommodative stance of monetary policy, coupled with robust underlying growth in productivity, is providing important ongoing support to economic activity. The evidence accumulated over the intermeeting period confirms that output is expanding briskly, and the labor market appears to be improving modestly. Increases in core consumer prices are muted and expected to remain low.The committee perceives that the upside and downside risks to the attainment of sustainable growth for the next few quarters are roughly equal. The probability of an unwelcome fall in inflation has diminished in recent months and now appears almost equal to that of a rise in inflation. However, with inflation quite low and resource use slack, the committee believes that policy accommodation can be maintained for a considerable period.Voting for the F.O.M.C. monetary policy action were: Alan Greenspan, chairman; Timothy F. Geithner, vice chairman; Ben S. Bernanke; Susan S. Bies; J. Alfred Broaddus Jr.; Roger W. Ferguson Jr.; Edward M. Gramlich; Jack Guynn; Donald L. Kohn; Michael H. Moskow; Mark W. Olson; and Robert T.

At the same time, the Fed moved again to soothe investors by repeating its assertion that inflation remains low enough to allow a policy of cheap money ''for a considerable period.''Analysts and investors had been focused on that phrase in the run-up to Tuesday's meeting, with some predicting that the Fed would drop it and implicitly abandon its open-ended commitment to low rates.

The Government's chief gauge for predicting the economy fell one-tenth of 1 percent in September, the third decline in the latest five months, the Commerce Department said today.Although most economists had been expecting a small rise in the index of leading indicators, they focused today mainly on the sawtooth pattern that has developed in the index since late spring. That, they said, along with other figures, was evidence that the economy has clearly begun to slow.''Some of the momentum has been left behind,'' said Robert A. Brusca, chief economist for Nikko Securities Company International, a Wall Street firm. ''I think the index is forecasting some further sluggishness.'' Growth Rate of 2.2 PercentLast week the department said the economy had expanded at a rate of 2.2 percent in the third quarter, somewhat below the average growth of the gross national product for the first half of the year even after allowing for a substantial loss of output from this summer's drought.

The rate, the interest rate banks charge each other for overnight loans, has not been adjusted since January 1996, when the Fed cut it a quarter-point amid concern that the economy was headed for a recession. The committee did not, however, adjust the discount rate, which is the rate the Fed charges its member banks for overnight loans.While the rise in the funds rate had largely been expected, the hawkish tone of the Fed's announcement had not. ''This action was taken in light of persisting strength in demand,'' the Fed's statement said, ''which is progressively increasing the risk of inflationary imbalances developing in the economy.''The comments ''suggest the Fed will not stop tightening until the economy shows signs of slowing,'' Carl Palash, chief economist at MCM Moneywatch in New York, said.

1997-03-25 00:00:00,1997-03-26 00:00:00,FEDERAL RESERVE LIFTS A KEY RATE; FIRST RISE SINCE '95,"The Federal Reserve voted today to raise interest rates for the first time in more than two years, firing a warning shot at an inflationary threat that remained hidden over the horizon.The central bank took one of the smallest steps it could, nudging up the more important of the two short-term rates it controls -- the Federal funds target rate for overnight loans between banks -- by a quarter of a percentage point, to 5.5 percent. In doing so, it was trying to keep the economy from growing so fast that it generates wage and price pressures strong enough to threaten the nation's six-year economic expansion.Because banks tie their benchmark loan rates to the Federal funds rate, today's action will ripple through the economy, probably curbing investment and consumption somewhat by increasing the rates charged for many business and personal loans and for credit cards.The move was applauded as tempered but appropriate by a number of Wall Street and academic economists, many of whom say the current combination of strong growth and low unemployment will ultimately lead to a resurgence of inflation unless action is taken to slow the economy. They said the Federal Reserve was likely to keep trying to fine-tune the economy by raising rates at least once or twice more this year.

''What the Fed did today is about right,'' said Paul A.

In a related action, the board of governors approved a 50- basis-point reduction in the discount rate, to 4 1/2 percent.Persistent pressures on profit margins are restraining investment spending and, through declines in equity wealth, consumption. The associated backup in inventories has induced a rapid response in manufacturing output and, with spending having firmed a bit since last year, inventory adjustment appears to be well under way.Although current developments do not appear to have materially diminished the prospects for long-term growth in productivity, excess productive capacity has emerged recently. The possibility that this excess could continue for some time and the potential for weakness in global economic conditions suggest substantial risks that demand and production could remain soft. In these circumstances, when the economic situation could be evolving rapidly, the Federal Reserve will need to monitor developments closely.The committee continues to believe that against the background of its long-run goals of price stability and sustainable economic growth and of the information currently available, the risks are weighted mainly toward conditions that may generate economic weakness in the foreseeable future.In taking the discount rate action, the Federal Reserve Board approved requests submitted by the boards of directors of all 12 reserve banks.

In a related action, the board of governors approved a 25 basis point increase in the discount rate, to 5 percent.Although cost pressures appear generally contained, risks to sustainable growth persist. Despite tentative evidence of a slowing in certain interest-sensitive sectors of the economy and of accelerating productivity, the expansion of activity continues in excess of the economy's growth potential.As a consequence, the pool of available workers willing to take jobs has been drawn down further in recent months, a trend that must eventually be contained if inflationary imbalances are to remain in check and economic expansion continue.Today's increase in the federal funds rate, together with the policy actions in June and August and the firming of conditions more generally in U.S. financial markets over the course of the year, should markedly diminish the risk of inflation going forward. As a consequence, the directive the Federal Open Market Committee adopted is symmetrical with regard to the outlook for policy over the near term.In taking the discount rate action, the Federal Reserve Board approved requests submitted by the boards of directors of the Federal Reserve Banks of Boston, Cleveland, Richmond and Kansas City. The discount rate is the rate charged depository institutions when they borrow short-term adjustment credit from their district Federal Reserve Banks.

Today's increase took back the last of three quarter-point reductions  made last year in response to the global financial crisis and returned the rate to its level 14 months ago.

Stock investors generally dislike interest rate increases because, in the broadest sense, they raise the cost of operating a business. Rising rates also make bonds more attractive than stocks as investments.So it was not too surprising that the Fed's rate increase rattled stocks after it was announced. A quick blip upward could not be sustained, and the Dow Jones industrials fell about 140 points on the news.Minutes later, stock traders got their bearings and roared with approval over the move. The white-hot Nasdaq composite index gained 73.51 points on the day, a 2.28 percent increase. The Dow Jones industrial average raced ahead 171.58 points, or 1.59 percent.

The investor euphoria after the Fed's action seemed to be based on two assumptions. Most compelling was the view that the Fed's move was the last rate increase for the foreseeable future. The next meeting of the Fed's Open Market Committee takes place on Dec. 21, an unlikely occasion for anyone except Ebenezer Scrooge to raise rates. The meeting after that, in early February, is expected to feature economic statistics distorted by Year 2000 anomalies.

Aggregate spending, despite high energy prices, appears to have strengthened since late winter, and labor market conditions continue to improve gradually. Core inflation has been relatively low in recent months and longer-term inflation expectations remain well contained, but pressures on inflation have stayed elevated.The committee perceives that with appropriate monetary policy action, the upside and downside risks to the attainment of both sustainable growth and price stability should be kept roughly equal. With underlying inflation expected to be contained, the committee believes that policy accommodation can be removed at a pace that is likely to be measured. Nonetheless, the committee will respond to changes in economic prospects as needed to fulfill its obligation to maintain price stability.Voting for the F.O.M.C. monetary policy action were: Alan Greenspan, chairman; Timothy F.

The Federal Reserve ended a two-day strategy session on monetary policy today without announcing an increase in short-term interest rates or explaining its apparent inaction.Analysts took this to mean that the central bank, which had raised rates four times since early February, was satisfied with early signs that the economy is slowing enough to minimize the risk of resurgent inflation.It had been widely agreed that the Fed's assessment of the domestic economy would outweigh its interest in supporting the dollar in world currency markets, even though higher rates, by making the dollar more appealing, would tend to enhance foreign investment and minimize inflation from imports. Markets' ResponseThe financial markets responded fairly positively, though with no great enthusiasm, to the apparent outcome of the Fed meeting. The dollar rebounded from its morning declines, blue-chip stocks rallied and bond prices showed relatively little change.

Prices of Treasury securities dipped in quiet trading yesterday, as dealers took profits after the recent strong rally.The price slide began during overnight trading in Tokyo, where a rise in the value of the yen against the dollar led to a mild selloff. Later, announcements that industrial production fell by four-tenths of a percent in April and that car sales for the first 10 days of May were weak failed to stir any enthusiasm, even though they would be a disincentive for the Federal Reserve Board to raise interest rates.''The market feels a little tired, even though it continues to trade very well,'' one Government securities trader said. ''With the Fed on hold for another month at least, it looks to me like prices are at the high end of a very wide trading range that has been established over the last couple of weeks.''The Federal Reserve Board's policy-making Open Market Committee gathered yesterday in Washington, and as the trader suggested, analysts and market participants are virtually unanimous that the Fed will vote to leave monetary policy unchanged.

Prices of Treasury notes and bonds moved lower in thin, volatile trading yesterday, as dealers used movements in oil prices as their major indicator to buy or sell securities.A sharp run-up in oil prices early in the day sent out a clear sell signal, pushing bond prices down by more than a point. But oil later came down from its daily highs, and that helped erase most of the decline in bond prices.Comments from Tariq Aziz, Iraq's Foreign Minister, calling for a negotiated settlement to the crisis in the Persian Gulf also helped buttress prices, even though Mr. Aziz did not offer to withdraw Iraqi troops from Kuwait and restore its monarchy.Traders said that the drop in stock prices had little influence on activity in the credit markets. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 52.48 points, to 2,603.96.

2004-08-10 00:00:00,2004-08-11 00:00:00,Text of Fed Statement on Rate Decision,"Following is the text of a statement released by the Federal Reserve yesterday after the Fed's monetary policy panel, the Federal Open Market Committee, decided to raise its benchmark interest rates a quarter point:The Federal Open Market Committee decided today to raise its target for the federal funds rate by 25 basis points, to 11/2 percent.The committee believes that even after this action, the stance of monetary policy remains accommodative and, coupled with robust underlying growth in productivity, is providing ongoing support to economic activity. In recent months, output growth has moderated and the pace of improvement in labor market conditions has slowed. This softness likely owes importantly to the substantial rise in energy prices. The economy nevertheless appears poised to resume a stronger pace of expansion going forward. Inflation has been somewhat elevated this year, though a portion of the rise in prices seems to reflect transitory factors.The committee perceives the upside and downside risks to the attainment of both sustainable growth and price stability for the next few quarters are roughly equal. With underlying inflation still expected to be relatively low, the committee believes that policy accommodation can be removed at a pace that is likely to be measured. Nonetheless, the committee will respond to changes in economic prospects as needed to fulfill its obligation to maintain price stability.Voting for the F.O.M.C. monetary policy action were: Alan Greenspan, chairman; Timothy F. Geithner, vice chairman; Ben S. Bernanke; Susan S. Bies; Roger W. Ferguson Jr.; Edward M. Gramlich; Thomas M. Hoenig; Donald L. Kohn; Cathy E. Minehan; Mark W. Olson; Sandra Pianalto; and William Poole.In a related action, the board of governors unanimously approved a 25 basis point increase in the discount rate, to 21/2 percent. In taking this action, the board approved the requests submitted by the boards of directors of the Federal Reserve Banks of Boston, New York, Philadelphia, Cleveland, Richmond, Atlanta, Chicago, St. Louis, Minneapolis, Kansas City, Dallas and San Francisco.

And it raised another benchmark interest rate, the discount rate on loans to big banks, also by a quarter-point, to 2.5 percent.

2008-04-30 00:00:00,2008-05-01 00:00:00,Statement on Rate Cut by the Federal Reserve,"Following is the full text of the statement released Wednesday by the Federal Reserve:The Federal Open Market Committee decided today to lower its target for the federal funds rate 25 basis points, to 2 percent.Recent information indicates that economic activity remains weak. Household and business spending has been subdued and labor markets have softened further. Financial markets remain under considerable stress, and tight credit conditions and the deepening housing contraction are likely to weigh on economic growth over the next few quarters.Although readings on core inflation have improved somewhat, energy and other commodity prices have increased and some indicators of inflation expectations have risen in recent months. The committee expects inflation to moderate in coming quarters, reflecting a projected leveling-out of energy and other commodity prices and an easing of pressures on resource utilization. Still, uncertainty about the inflation outlook remains high. It will be necessary to continue to monitor inflation developments carefully.The substantial easing of monetary policy to date, combined with ongoing measures to foster market liquidity, should help to promote moderate growth over time and to mitigate the risks to economic activity. The committee will continue to monitor economic and financial developments and will act as needed to promote sustainable economic growth and price stability.Voting for the F.O.M.C. monetary policy action were: Ben S. Bernanke, chairman; Timothy F. Geithner, vice chairman; Donald L. Kohn; Randall S. Kroszner; Frederic S. Mishkin; Sandra Pianalto; Gary H. Stern; and Kevin M. Warsh. Voting against were Richard W. Fisher and Charles I. Plosser, who preferred no change in the target for the federal funds rate at this meeting.In a related action, the board of governors unanimously approved a 25-basis-point decrease in the discount rate to 2.25 percent. In taking this action, the board approved the requests submitted by the boards of directors of the Federal Reserve Banks of New York, Cleveland, Atlanta and San Francisco.

2008-04-30 00:00:00,2008-05-01 00:00:00,Dissent among the policy-setters at the Fed,"WASHINGTON — The U.S. Federal Reserve's decision to reduce short-term interest rates this week came with a repetition of the discord that has accompanied some of its previous rate cuts.The Fed, mixing concern about the feeble U.S. economy with worries about rising inflation, reduced short-term interest rates Wednesday for the seventh time since September, while signaling a pause for now in any further rate cuts.The action lowered the federal funds rate - the rate it charges banks for overnight loans - to 2 percent, from 2.25 percent, the least since November 2004. The Fed defended that step as necessary to counter the ailing U.S. housing sector and the ""considerable stress"" shadowing financial markets.But two regional Fed bank presidents on the policy-setting committee again dissented from the decision to reduce  rates. They and many other economists have called on the Fed to shift its focus from countering a possible recession to heading off inflation spurred by the increasing costs of food and energy.

WASHINGTON — The Federal Reserve, mixing concern about the feeble economy with worries about rising inflation, reduced short-term interest rates Wednesday for the seventh time  since September, while signaling a pause in any additional rate cuts for now.The Fed’s action brought the federal funds rate — the rate at which banks lend to each other —  to 2 percent, from 2.25 percent, the lowest level since November 2004. It defended that step as necessary to counter the ailing housing sector and the “considerable stress” shadowing financial markets.The move followed new indications that the economy remained fragile at best. The Commerce Department reported early Wednesday that the economy expanded only 0.6 percent on an annualized basis in the first three months of 2008, short of an overall downturn but still far from healthy.The Dow Jones industrial average, which was trading up 178 points shortly after the Fed’s announcement, dropped sharply in late trading, ending down 11.81 points at 12,820.13.

In a related action, the  board of governors approved a 25-basis-point increase in the discount rate, to 5 1/4 percent.The committee remains concerned that over time increases in demand will continue to exceed the growth in potential supply, even after taking account of the pronounced rise in productivity growth. Such trends could foster inflationary imbalances that would undermine the economy's record economic expansion.Against the background of its long-run goals of price stability and sustainable economic growth and of the information currently available, the committee believes the risks are weighted mainly toward conditions that may generate heightened inflation pressures in the foreseeable future.In taking the discount rate action, the Federal Reserve Board approved requests submitted by the boards of directors of the Federal Reserve Banks of Boston, New York, Philadelphia, Cleveland, Richmond, Atlanta, Chicago, St. Louis, Kansas City and San Francisco. The discount rate is the rate charged depository institutions when they borrow short-term adjustment credit from their district Federal Reserve Banks.

With the economy apparently recovering from a stumble in the spring, the Federal Reserve's top policy committee chose today to leave short-term rates unchanged.The decision to do nothing had been widely expected, given a recent string of strong economic indicators that suggested little need for the Fed to stimulate the economy right now. But the decision was nonetheless important as an indication that the central bank planned to move slowly on lowering rates even in the face of an equally striking set of indicators showing inflation was under control.The Federal Reserve's decision had little effect on the stock and bond markets.The group that met today, the Federal Open Market Committee, had voted on July 6 to cut interest rates for the first time since 1992. In the weeks before that meeting, the economy had seemed in worse shape, and the Fed's chairman, Alan Greenspan, had talked about the possibility of a recession.Nevertheless, the panel chose to make the smallest possible reduction in short-term interest rates, and justified the move not in terms of the need for stimulus but on the grounds that ""inflationary pressures have receded enough.""

Prices of Treasury securities slipped yesterday, as the Federal Reserve left short-term interest rates unchanged at its monetary policy meeting and the Treasury sold two-year notes in a successful auction.The 30-year bond slipped 8/32 of a percentage point, to a price of 99 28/32; its yield, which moves in the opposite direction from its price, was 6.89 percent, compared with 6.87 percent on Monday.The only data out, a weekly retail sales report by Johnson Redbook, showed a drop of 1.1 percent for sales so far this month, compared with the previous one-month period, little changed from last week's reading of a 1 percent decline. Analysts said this was consistent with recent reports of disappointing back-to-school retail activity, but since the market was already aware of the trend, the report had little market impact. What it did do was raise hopes for another easing by the Fed later this year.Supply concerns also weighed on the market, particularly so soon after the quarterly refunding earlier this month. But after the recent flurry of dollar-buying interventions by central banks, market expectations were that there could be demand for Treasury securities to make use of the dollars purchased by the central banks. And traders thought that the two-year note would be a decent vehicle to be considered.

The committee, accordingly, continues to see a risk of heightened inflation pressures. However, softening in business and household demand and tightening conditions in financial markets over recent months suggest that the economy could expand for a time at a pace below the productivity-enhanced rate of growth of its potential to produce.Nonetheless, to date the easing of demand pressures has not been sufficient to warrant a change in the committee's judgment that against the background of its long-run goals of price stability and sustainable economic growth and of the information currently available, the risks continue to be weighted mainly toward conditions that may generate heightened inflation pressures in the foreseeable future.

The statement said economic growth appeared to have slowed to a rate below what most economists consider its noninflationary speed limit of about 4 percent a year.The Fed imposed six rate increases, totaling 1.75 percentage points, between June 1999 and May of this year, in an effort to bring economic growth into a range that would diminish inflation pressures.But the committee stressed that it still saw ''a risk of heightened inflation pressures'' stemming from the low rate of joblessness -- 3.9 percent in October -- and the rise earlier this year in oil prices.

The Dow Jones industrial average and the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index are still below the highs they reached on June 17. The Nasdaq composite index is still below where it was on July 14. Many economists expected the long decline in jobs to turn the corner in July. Instead, they were surprised by another loss.And the tone of the Fed's statement was not so rosy. It said that the upside and downside risks to the economy were still ''roughly equal'' and that ''on balance'' the threat of deflation, though minor, was greater than inflation in the foreseeable future.But some analysts argue that the Fed's interest rate commitment should restrain the increase in longer-term rates, giving the weak recovery time to gain strength. With this limit on rate increases, investors are also more likely to believe that the recent rebound in corporate profits, a significant driver of share prices, can continue, setting the stage for a stock market rally.

Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady said today that no taxpayer bailout of the nation's banks would be necessary if Congress approved the Administration's proposed banking legislation and if the economy avoided a complete collapse.In an interview in his office, Mr. Brady gave an upbeat appraisal of economic prospects, but he suggested that the Federal Reserve could prolong the recession if it became ""preoccupied with inflation"" and kept interest rates too high.Over the course of an hour, Mr. Brady addressed these other topics:*The Resolution Trust Corporation, the agency overseeing the savings and loan bailout, will not be able to go out of business by the summer of 1992 as the law requires, and new legislation will be needed to allow the agency to continue to take over failed institutions after that.*The United States should not help rebuild Iraq, as it did Germany and Japan after World War II, as long as Saddam Hussein is in power.

The man allegedly behind a $50 billion Ponzi scheme also had a considerable presence in Washington, contributing hundreds of thousands of dollars to politicians and lobbying firms.
The Center for Responsive Politics has found that Mr. Madoff and his wife, Ruth, have given $238,200 to federal candidates, parties and committees since 1991, with Democrats getting 88 percent of that. “Madoff made a fortune, and he played politics with some of that money,” the nonpartisan interest group said on its Web site, OpenSecrets.org. 
Mr. Madoff gave extensively to some of his favorite politicians, including Charles E. Schumer, the Democratic Senator from New York; and Ron Wyden, the Democratic Senator from Oregon. Both lawmakers are members of the powerful Senate Finance Commmitee.
Overall, Mr. Madoff and other individuals at his company, Bernard L. Madoff Investment Securities, gave $372,100 in campaign contributions since 1991, with 89 percent to Democrats.
But that’s not all: The firm also spent $590,000 on lobbying in the last 11 years, all but $10,000 of it with the lobbying firm of Lent, Scrivner & Roth.
DealBook took a look at the lobbying records, which showed that Mr. Madoff had his K-Street crew lobby the Securities and Exchange Commission and members of both houses of Congress. 
The lobbying issues included public ownership of equity markets, securities transaction fees and stock exchange mergers — topics that appear to relate to his firm’s market-making business, which is separate from its asset-management unit. (He also paid to lobby the National Park Service in relation to funding for the Lower East Side Tenement Museum in New York City.)
The latest filing shows that Mr. Madoff’s lobbying interests include market regulation, and specifically, the consolidation of certain regulatory functions.
It is not clear what Mr. Madoff’s position was on the topic. But any attempt by Mr. Madoff to shape the future of financial regulation could raise eyebrows now that the S.E.C. is under fire for failing to identify and shut down Mr. Madoff’s alleged fraud.

2008-12-16 00:00:00,2008-12-17 00:00:00,A Shopping Nexus Outside Washington Plots a Future as an Urban Center,"TYSONS CORNER, Va. —  This intersection in Fairfax County is a mecca for shoppers: it is the Washington region’s largest retail center, with 5.9 million square feet of shopping, and it includes the country’s 10th-largest mall. It is also due for a major makeover — after the sinking economy rebounds.In October, the Fairfax County Board of Supervisors accepted the recommendations of a 36-member task force that had labored for three years on a plan to turn this traffic-clogged maze of malls and office parks into an urban center that has more housing and is less dependent on cars. This month, the supervisors said they would move quickly in 2009 to pass regulations allowing for greater density, consistent with the long-range plan for Tysons.The plan has been widely applauded as a forward-thinking blueprint to convert this “edge city,” 13 miles from downtown Washington, into the epitome of “smart growth” by 2050. The area is ultimately envisioned as having high-rise apartments adjoining four new rail transit stations built along an extension of the Metro system, shuttle buses, a pedestrian-friendly street grid, urban parks and outdoor plazas.The plan aims to be a guideline to be followed over decades, which is fortunate, because it was being completed just as the economy took a sharp downturn.

Macerich, a national shopping center company based in Santa Monica, Calif., now owns the 300-shop Tysons Corner Center, the original mall here.

But it is not clear how soon this will happen. “Our plans are really tied to market demands,” said John E. Harrison, the vice president for development at Tysons.

Robert Gibbs's heady Washington rise was certified on a humid day in June when a procession of media and political fancies gathered in tribute to Tim Russert, the ""Meet the Press"" host who died of a heart attack several days earlier. The memorial service was a sweet, solemn and star-struck occasion that, as these events often do, yielded a neat snapshot of the Celebrity Washington food chain — who was up, who was down, who was winning the week.In a smiling stampede of congratulations, mourners were wearing out the red-carpeted aisles of the Kennedy Center to get to Gibbs, a journeyman campaign flack who had latched onto Barack Obama's Senate race four years earlier and has been his chief spokesman ever since. By now a senior adviser to Obama, Gibbs was here, along with Obama's chief strategist and message guru, David Axelrod, to represent the soon-to-be Democratic nominee.""The new It Guys,"" declared Anne Schroeder Mullins, a gossip columnist for Politico.com, noting the shameless run on Gibbs and Axelrod. ""I bet they're being inundated with people trying to book Barack on their shows.""The paradox of this scene was that the Obama campaign's communications strategy was predicated in part on an aggressive indifference to this insider set. Staff members were encouraged to ignore new Web sites like The Page, written by Time's Mark Halperin, and Politico, both of which had gained instant cachet among the Washington smarty-pants set. ""If Politico and Halperin say we're winning, we're losing,"" Obama's campaign manager, David Plouffe, would repeat mantralike around headquarters. He said his least favorite words in the English language were, ""I saw someone on cable say this. . . .""

The memorial service was a sweet, solemn and star-struck occasion that, as these events often do, yielded a neat snapshot of the Celebrity Washington food chain — who was up, who was down, who was winning the week.In a smiling stampede of congratulations, mourners were wearing out the red-carpeted aisles of the Kennedy Center to get to Gibbs, a journeyman campaign flack who had latched onto Barack Obama’s Senate race four years earlier and has been his chief spokesman ever since. By now a senior adviser to Obama, Gibbs was here, along with Obama’s chief strategist and message guru, David Axelrod, to represent the soon-to-be Democratic nominee.“The new It guys,” declared Anne Schroeder Mullins, a gossip columnist for Politico.com, noting the shameless run on Gibbs and Axelrod. “I bet they’re being inundated with people trying to book Barack on their shows.”The paradox of this scene was that the Obama campaign’s communications strategy was predicated in part on an aggressive indifference to this insider set. Staff members were encouraged to ignore new Web sites like The Page, written by Time’s Mark Halperin, and Politico, both of which had gained instant cachet among the Washington smarty-pants set. “If Politico and Halperin say we’re winning, we’re losing,” Obama’s campaign manager, David Plouffe, would repeat mantralike around headquarters. He said his least favorite words in the English language were, “I saw someone on cable say this. . . .”

The campaign bragged that Obama never even visited with the editorial board of The Washington Post — a decision that would have been unheard of for any serious candidate in a previous presidential cycle. “You could go to Cedar Rapids and Waterloo and understand that people aren’t reading The Washington Post,” Gibbs told me last month in Chicago.

The long end of the Treasury market rallied yesterday after the Federal Reserve announced its sixth and largest interest rate increase of the year, easing traders' fears of inflation.By late in the day, the 30-year bond was up 8/32 , to a price of 9327/32 , for a yield of 8.05 percent, down from 8.07 percent on Monday. Despite the rise in the long end of the Treasury market, prices in shorter maturities were mixed.The central bank raised short-term rates three-quarters of a percent, a quarter-point more than many had predicted. Expectations were running high as the Federal Open Market Committee met to determine monetary policy for the months ahead.While investors and dealers were expecting a rise of at least 50 basis points in the discount and Federal funds rates, they were hoping for something a little more aggressive -- and got it. The Fed lifted the discount rate that it charges banks for loans to 4.75 percent and the Federal funds rate that banks charge each other for money, usually overnight, to 5.5 percent.

 November 16, 1994, Page 00001Buy Reprints The New York Times Archives
Determined to prevent strong economic growth from feeding inflation, the Federal Reserve raised short-term interest rates today by the largest amount since 1981 and left open the possibility of further increases. Banks followed by raising the rates they charge for loans.The increases are likely to show up immediately in the rates charged millions of Americans on everything from home equity loans to credit cards to small-business loans. Already, interest rates on 30-year mortgages that were available at slightly more than 7 percent at the start of the year have risen to 9.05 percent.While rising rates are intended to slow economic growth, the Federal Reserve's five previous increases, which began in February, have had mixed results. Some industries, like auto making, that depend on customers who need loans have had robust sales, while others, like home building, have begun to slow. Critics of the Federal Reserve say that interest rate changes take up to 18 months to show results and that the previous increases may yet do so.The central bank today raised by three-quarters of a percentage point each of two short-term interest rates that it controls. Stocks, bonds and the dollar bounced up and down in value following the Federal Reserve's action but closed with little change.

The decision by the Federal Reserve came five hours after it reported that American factories operated at 84.9 percent of capacity in October, the highest level in nearly 15 years. When factories are working at top speed, production bottlenecks often occur and can lead to inflation as companies bid up the prices of scarce materials and skilled workers.

WASHINGTON, Sept. 18 — The Federal Reserve rolled out its most powerful interest rate weapon on Tuesday in a bid to stop the turmoil in housing and financial markets from bringing down the overall economy.But even as stock markets soared in a thunderous rally, the Fed carefully stopped short of implying any commitment to reduce rates even more in the months ahead. Indeed, policy makers cautioned that they still have lingering worries about inflation  — a concern that would weigh against stimulating the economy further with cheaper money.In reducing its benchmark interest rate by an unusually large one-half percentage point, to 4.75 percent from 5.25 percent, the central bank made it clear that policy makers viewed the turbulence and disruptions of the past couple of months as too dangerous to ignore.The reaction in stock markets was ecstatic: the Dow Jones industrial average jumped 200 points almost instantly and ended the day up 335 points, or 2.51 percent, at 13,739.39.

1999-05-18 00:00:00,1999-05-19 00:00:00,Text of Statement by Fed,"Following is the text of a statement released by the Federal Reserve yesterday after the Federal Open Market Committee said it had left interest rates unchanged but had adopted a stance to raise borrowing costs in the future:While the F.O.M.C. did not take action today to alter the stance of monetary policy, the committee was concerned about the potential for a buildup of inflationary imbalances that could undermine the favorable performance of the economy and therefore adopted a directive that is tilted toward the possibility of a firming in the stance of monetary policy.Trend increases in costs and core prices have generally remained quite subdued. But domestic financial markets have recovered and foreign economic prospects have improved since the easing of monetary policy last fall.Against the background of already-tight domestic labor markets and ongoing strength in demand in excess of productivity gains, the committee recognizes the need to be alert to developments over coming months that might indicate that financial conditions may no longer be consistent with containing inflation.

Instead, it said it was now leaning toward imposing higher rates.The shift was subtle, but it signaled a clear change in the Federal Reserve's outlook from last fall, when it made three reductions in interest rates in response to the global financial crisis.In a statement, the Fed said it was ''concerned about the potential for a buildup of inflationary imbalances that could undermine the favorable performance of the economy.''

1999-05-18 00:00:00,1999-05-19 00:00:00,The Fed Edges Toward Action,"The Federal Reserve's decision yesterday to leave interest rates unchanged but to warn that it was thinking of raising them in the future reaffirms how unsure the policy makers are about the state of the economy.The Fed cut rates three times late last year when it believed that the financial panic following the Russian default would slow American growth  and might bring on a world recession. In retrospect the Fed seems to have overreacted, although the  cuts appeared prudent at the time. Now, with the United States' economy growing far more rapidly than expected, a world recession seemingly unlikely and with some signs of a rebirth of inflation, a modest increase in rates could easily be justified.That the Fed did not dictate such an increase, but instead announced a ''bias'' in favor of raising rates in the future, probably reflects a continued argument within the Fed's open market committee about the extent to which inflation is a threat. Some believe that thanks to increases in productivity brought on by computers, the economy is now able to grow much faster than in the past without any appreciable threat of inflation. But it is also possible that inflation has been held down by overseas weakness that is now reversing. The Fed should be vigilant about inflation, and may rightly conclude next month that a rate increase is wise.

But the blue-chip average subsequently regained much of that loss and closed at 10,836.95, a drop of 16.52 points.Elsewhere in the stock market, declines in oil stocks and regional telephone companies helped push the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index down 6.17 points, or half a percent, to 1,333.32. The Nasdaq composite index fell 3.48 points, to 2,558.36. But the Russell 2000 index of small-company stocks rose 1.10, or 0.25 percent, to 442.45.

Order those alluring bottles of Rochioli pinot noir or Screaming Eagle cabernet sauvignon you see on the Web, and you could wind up with a felony charge -- if you live in the wrong state and if anyone can figure out how to enforce the new legislation.It could be that the campaigns, financed mostly by wholesalers who fear the loss of business, will fizzle out. But they could succeed, and some fear that if they do, the choice of wines will be severely constricted for almost all wine drinkers.Michael Aaron, chairman of Sherry-Lehmann in Manhattan, one of the country's largest wine retailers, argues that attempts to tighten the rules for shipments across state lines will lead to the disruption of shipments within states, even package store deliveries.

But the Fed's warning about its possible next move -- in the form of a formal tilt toward a tighter monetary policy -- nonetheless jolted Wall Street and suggested that financial markets would remain jittery in coming weeks in anticipation of new data about the momentum of the economy.The Dow Jones industrial average, which had been up over 100 points just before the Fed's announcement, plummeted immediately and was down around 125 points before rebounding. It closed at 10,400.59, down 0.64 point on the day. Bond prices tumbled, sending longer-term interest rates higher.In holding rates steady for now but putting investors on notice that a rate increase could be in the offing, the Fed was trying to strike a policy balance that acknowledged both the warning signals of inflation being generated by the robust economy and the almost total lack of actual inflation outside of surging oil prices.

If the increasingly tight labor market pushes wages higher and forces companies to raise prices for their goods and services, the inflation rate could rise, they warned.The tightening bias suggests the panel could opt to raise its target on federal funds, the overnight interbank loan rate, at its next meeting, scheduled for Nov. 16, but the central bank has said it would make as much credit available as necessary late in the year to quell fears surrounding the Year 2000 computer problem.Markets reacted negatively.

yield on the 30-year issue to 6.15 percent from 6.09 late Monday.Harvinder Kalirai, senior economist at the IDEAglobal.com economics consultancy, said he thought the Fed should be pushing rates higher. The economy is expanding at roughly a 4 percent annual rate, and this is about 1 percentage point faster than it can stand without igniting inflation, he said. Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve Board chairman, has suggested that, with productivity rising at about 2 percent a year and the population growing by 1 percent, a 3 percent growth rate is the natural pace for the economy.Some economists say productivity is growing faster than measured by traditional indicators, which do not take into account changes in the composition of the economy. Mr. Kalirai noted, however, that the U.S. unemployment rate has dropped to 4.2 percent from more than 7 percent earlier this decade, and he said the declining level is mathematical proof that productivity does not account for all the economic growth.

In a related action, the board of governors approved a 25-basis-point reduction in the discount rate, to 3.25 percent. Today's action by the F.O.M.C. brings the decline in the target federal funds rate since the beginning of the year to 275 basis points.The patterns evident in recent months -- declining profitability and business capital spending, weak expansion of consumption, and slowing growth abroad -- continue to weigh on the economy. The associated easing of pressures on labor and product markets are expected to keep inflation contained.Although continuing favorable trends bolster long-term prospects for productivity growth and the economy, the committee continues to believe that against the background of its long-run goals of price stability and sustainable economic growth and of the information currently available, the risks are weighted mainly toward conditions that may generate economic weakness in the foreseeable future.In taking the discount rate action, the Federal Reserve Board approved requests submitted by the boards of directors of the Federal Reserve Banks of Boston, New York, Philadelphia, Atlanta, Chicago, Dallas and San Francisco.

However, labor markets have softened further and financial markets remain under considerable stress. Tight credit conditions, the ongoing housing contraction and elevated energy prices are likely to weigh on economic growth over the next few quarters. Over time, the substantial easing of monetary policy, combined with ongoing measures to foster market liquidity, should help to promote moderate economic growth.Inflation has been high, spurred by the earlier increases in the prices of energy and some other commodities, and some indicators of inflation expectations have been elevated. The committee expects inflation to moderate later this year and next year, but the inflation outlook remains highly uncertain.Although downside risks to growth remain, the upside risks to inflation are also of significant concern to the committee. The committee will continue to monitor economic and financial developments and will act as needed to promote sustainable economic growth and price stability.Voting for the F.O.M.C. monetary policy action were Ben S. Bernanke, chairman; Timothy F. Geithner, vice chairman; Elizabeth A. Duke; Donald L. Kohn; Randall S. Kroszner; Frederic S. Mishkin; Sandra Pianalto; Charles I. Plosser; Gary H. Stern; and Kevin M. Warsh. Voting against was Richard W. Fisher, who preferred an increase in the target for the federal funds rate at this meeting.

Prices of Treasury securities posted only modest advances yesterday, despite another big drop in oil prices.''Oil is down over $2 a barrel, but the long end of the market feels like it has sort of run into a wall,'' one trader of government bonds said early in the session.Oil prices slid by another $1 later in the day, and closed at $33.95 a barrel, down $3.14 on the day.Even with the drop in oil prices, some market participants said that interest rates, which have fallen steeply in recent days, were ripe for a period of consolidation or even a slight rise.

Faced with a revolt in his party's Congressional ranks and wariness around the country, President Bush appealed on television tonight for public support of the budget compromise he and Congressional leaders struck last weekend. He predicted ''economic chaos if we fail to reduce the deficit.''In a show of bipartisanship that verged on coalition Government, the President was followed with a broadcast by Senator George J. Mitchell of Maine, the Democratic leader. He urged support for the President ''because the nation is more important than partisan differences.'' [Transcripts of the Bush and Mitchell speeches appear on page D28.]  Mr. Mitchell was preaching to the converted for the most part. Despite considerable opposition among liberals, a majority of Congressional Democrats appear to support the agreement.Tough Task for BushBut Mr. Bush has the more difficult task of swaying enough dissident Republicans to win enactment of the plan.The President said that neither he nor anyone else was completely satisfied with the compromise, but he said it was ''the best agreement that can be legislated now.''

Elevated energy prices and hurricane-related disruptions in economic activity have temporarily depressed output and employment. However, monetary policy accommodation, coupled with robust underlying growth in productivity, is providing ongoing support to economic activity that will likely be augmented by planned rebuilding in the hurricane-affected areas. The cumulative rise in energy and other costs has the potential to add to inflation pressures; however, core inflation has been relatively low in recent months and longer-term inflation expectations remain contained.The committee perceives that with appropriate monetary policy action, the upside and downside risks to the attainment of both sustainable growth and price stability should be kept roughly equal. With underlying inflation expected to be contained, the committee believes that policy accommodation can be removed at a pace that is likely to be measured. Nonetheless, the committee will respond to changes in economic prospects as needed to fulfill its obligation to maintain price stability.Voting for the F.O.M.C. monetary policy action were: Alan Greenspan, chairman; Timothy F. Geithner, vice chairman; Susan S. Bies; Roger W. Ferguson Jr.; Richard W. Fisher; Donald L. Kohn; Michael H. Moskow; Mark W. Olson; Anthony M. Santomero; and Gary H. Stern.In a related action, the board of governors unanimously approved a 25-basis-point increase in the discount rate, to 5 percent.

In a related action, the board of governors approved a 50 basis point reduction in the discount rate to 3/4  percent.The committee continues to believe that an accommodative stance of monetary policy, coupled with still-robust underlying growth in productivity, is providing important ongoing support to economic activity. However, incoming economic data have tended to confirm that greater uncertainty, in part attributable to heightened geopolitical risks, is currently inhibiting spending, production and employment. Inflation and inflation expectations remain well contained.In these circumstances, the committee believes that today's additional monetary easing should prove helpful as the economy works its way through this current soft spot. With this action, the committee believes that, against the background of its long-run goals of price stability and sustainable economic growth and of the information currently available, the risks are balanced with respect to the prospects for both goals in the foreseeable future.Voting for the F.O.M.C. monetary policy action were Alan Greenspan, chairman; William J.

Hollings, the South Carolina Democrat, as chairman of the Senate Commerce Committee.Not only does the commerce committee oversee the Federal Communications Commission, but it is also where most telecommunications legislation originates in the Senate.For the Bell companies, which dominate local markets for voice and data communications, Mr. Hollings has been their chief antagonist on Capitol Hill for at least a decade, skeptical that the companies are truly open to competition. Mr. McCain, by contrast, has appeared to broadly embrace deregulation.Mr. McCain has also been perhaps the biggest Congressional advocate of Michael K. Powell, the F.C.C. chairman.

Immediately after the rate cut of half a percentage point, stocks rallied then fell, and then reversed course again and climbed higher, as positive interpretations of the Fed rate cut won out, for now.At the close, the Dow Jones industrial average was up 92.74 points, or 1.1 percent, to 8,771.01. After the Fed announcement, the Dow made a 209-point swing, down to 8,590.19 and up to 8,800. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index climbed 8.37 points, or 0.9 percent, to close at 923.76. The Nasdaq composite index rose 17.82 points, or 1.3 percent, to 1,418.99.Despite a four-week rally and the Fed rate cut, all three gauges are still below the peaks they reached during the summer rally, which ended in late August as the overall market plunged to a five-and-a-half-year low in the second week of October.

The step was intended to stimulate business investment and consumer spending by lowering borrowing costs.But the Fed also hinted that it does not plan to cut rates again when it next meets in five weeks, reflecting a view at the central bank that rates are now low enough and that it is in any case running out of room to reduce them much further.Economists said the United States would now have to rely increasingly on stimulative fiscal policy -- some combination of tax cuts and increased government spending -- to give the economy a boost if it does not bounce back soon.

He listed the association's top goals as expanded tax cuts, a new law governing terrorism insurance, a prescription drug policy for the elderly and a resolution of asbestos-related lawsuits that have hurt the stock prices of manufacturers and prompted numerous companies to seek protection in bankruptcy court.Other business leaders and executives, when asked what they most hoped the new Republican majorities in both House and Senate would be able to accomplish for American business, cited the swift passage of terrorism insurance rules, a lessening of environmental regulations and a bankruptcy law that will make it more difficult for people to escape their debts.Many also foresaw a more receptive climate for new limits on medical malpractice lawsuits and punitive damages awards.

2002-11-06 00:00:00,2002-11-07 00:00:00,Pitt's Timing Throws S.E.C. Into Reverse,"The resignation of Harvey L. Pitt from the Securities and Exchange Commission will set back by months the efforts of the agency to clean up Wall Street, provide vigorous oversight of the accounting profession and impose tougher regulations on company directors, government officials and corporate law experts said today.Even before Mr. Pitt's announcement on Tuesday evening that he would step down as the commission's chairman, the agency faced difficult challenges. It has suffered huge morale problems and high turnover among its more experienced staff, whose pay was lower than that of officials from other federal agencies. And although its mission was enlarged substantially this summer when Congress adopted the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, authorizing a 77 percent increase in its budget, the financing has remained in doubt because the White House has wavered over its commitment for such a large increase.Moreover, Mr. Pitt's choice to head the new accounting oversight board, William H. Webster, has said he is reconsidering whether to head that board in light of the disclosure that he headed the audit committee of a virtually insolvent company facing accusations of fraud. Should Mr. Webster step down, as some top officials today predicted, the vacancy would not be filled until after the commission gets a new permanent chairman, a process that will take months.''The agenda of the Securities and Exchange Commission is in shambles right now,'' said Donald C. Langevoort of Georgetown University, a former commission official who is an authority on securities and corporate law. ''Simply responding to the demands of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the corporate scandals was a massive management task. Now the commission has to go through a new search for leadership, and the accounting board probably will, too. This has to be a great setback.''

Financial markets have been volatile in recent weeks, credit conditions have become tighter for some households and businesses and the housing correction is ongoing. Nevertheless, the economy seems likely to continue to expand at a moderate pace over coming quarters, supported by solid growth in employment and incomes and a robust global economy.Readings on core inflation have improved modestly in recent months. However, a sustained moderation in inflation pressures has yet to be convincingly demonstrated. Moreover, the high level of resource utilization has the potential to sustain those pressures.Although the downside risks to growth have increased somewhat, the committee’s predominant policy concern remains the risk that inflation will fail to moderate as expected. Future policy adjustments will depend on the outlook for both inflation and economic growth, as implied by incoming information.Voting for the F.O.M.C. monetary policy action were Ben S.

WASHINGTON, Aug. 7 — The Federal Reserve kept its key interest rate unchanged on Tuesday and signaled that it still expected to avoid cutting short-term rates despite the recent tumult in credit markets and on Wall Street. The Fed suggested that it would change course only if economic conditions deteriorate badly in the weeks and months ahead.In a statement announcing that the overnight lending rate it controls  would remain unchanged at 5.25 percent, the Fed’s policy-setting Federal Open Market Committee did not drift significantly from its core message that inflation remains a greater risk to the economy than recession.The central bank, however, softened its tone slightly by giving some recognition to worsening conditions in financial markets, by adding a new phrase to its statement saying that the risk of an economic downturn has “increased somewhat.”“The Fed threw the markets a bone, commenting on recent market volatility and tighter credit conditions,” Steven A. Wood of Insight Economics wrote in a commentary. “However, they gave no hint that they would act anytime soon.”

On Wall Street, traders had difficulty sorting out the Fed’s message and by the end of the day still seemed convinced that the Fed was keeping the door open to a rate cut later this year. After falling sharply minutes after the statement was released around 2:15 p.m., stocks later rebounded, finishing trading modestly higher. The Standard & Poor’s 500 stock index gained 0.6 percent and the Dow Jones industrial average added almost 36 points to close at 13,504.30.

DEKALB, Ill. — While much of the nation worries about a slumping real estate market, people in Midwestern farm country are experiencing exactly the opposite. Take, for instance, the farm here — nearly 80 acres of corn and soybeans off a gravel road in a universe of corn and soybeans — that sold for $10,000 an acre at auction this spring, a price that astonished even the auctioneer.“If they had seen that day, they would have never believed it,” Penny Layman said of her sister and brother-in-law, who paid $32,000 for the entire spread in 1962 and whose deaths led to the sale.Skyrocketing farmland prices, particularly in states like Illinois, Iowa and Nebraska, giddy with the promise of corn-based ethanol, are stirring new optimism among established farmers. But for younger farmers, already rare in this graying profession, and for small farmers with dreams of expanding and grabbing a piece of the ethanol craze, the news is oddly grim. The higher prices feel out of reach.“It’s extremely frustrating,” said Paul Burrs, who farms about 400 acres near Dixon, Ill., and says he regularly bids on new farmland in the hopes of renting it. Mostly, he said, he loses out to higher bidders. “I crunch the numbers and go as high as I can. But then that’s it. There’s nothing more I can do.”

2009-03-18 00:00:00,2009-03-19 00:00:00,Fed to Buy $1 Trillion in Securities to Aid Economy,"The Federal Reserve sharply stepped up its efforts to bolster the economy on Wednesday, announcing that it would pump an extra $1 trillion into the financial system by purchasing Treasury bonds and mortgage securities.
Having already reduced the key interest rate it controls nearly to zero, the central bank has increasingly turned to alternatives like buying securities as a way of getting more dollars into the economy, a tactic that amounts to creating vast new sums of money out of thin air. But the moves on Wednesday were its biggest yet, almost doubling all of the Fed’s measures in the last year, The New York Times’s Edmund L. Andrews reports.
The action makes the Fed a buyer of long-term government bonds rather than the short-term debt that it typically buys and sells to help control the money supply.
The idea was to encourage more economic activity by lowering interest rates, including those on home loans, and to help the financial system as it struggles under the crushing weight of bad loans and poor investments.
Investors responded with surprise and enthusiasm. The Dow Jones industrial average, which had been down about 50 points just before the announcement, jumped immediately and ended the day up almost 91 points at 7,486.58. Yields on long-term Treasury bonds dropped markedly, and analysts predicted that interest rates on fixed-rate mortgages would soon drop below 5 percent.
But there were also clear indications that the Fed was taking risks that could dilute the value of the dollar and set the stage for future inflation. Gold prices rose $26.60 an ounce, hitting $942, a sign of declining confidence in the dollar. The dollar, which had been losing value in recent weeks to the euro and the yen, dropped sharply again on Wednesday.
In its announcement, the central bank said that the United States remained in a severe recession and listed its continuing woes, from job losses and lost housing wealth to falling exports as a result of the worldwide economic slowdown.
“In these circumstances, the Federal Reserve will employ all available tools to promote economic recovery and to preserve price stability,” the central bank said.
As expected, policy makers decided to keep the Fed’s benchmark interest rate on overnight loans in a range between zero and 0.25 percent.
But to the surprise of investors and analysts, the committee said it had decided to purchase an additional $750 billion worth of government-guaranteed mortgage-backed securities on top of the $500 billion that the Fed is already in the process of buying.
In addition, the Fed said it would buy up to $300 billion worth of longer-term Treasury securities over the next six months. That would tend to push down longer-term interest rates on all types of loans.
All these measures would come in addition to what has already been an unprecedented expansion of lending by the Fed. The central bank also said it would probably expand the scope of a new program to finance consumer and business lending, which gets under way this week.
In effect, the central bank has been lending money to a wider and wider array of borrowers, and it has financed that lending by using its authority to create new money at will.
Since last September, the Fed’s lending programs have roughly doubled the size of its balance sheet, to about $1.8 trillion, from $900 billion. The actions announced on Wednesday are likely to expand that to well over $3 trillion over the next year.
Despite a trickle of encouraging data in the last few weeks, Fed officials were clearly still worried and in no mood to cut back on their emergency efforts.
Fed policy makers sharply reduced their economic forecasts in January, predicting that the economy would continue to experience steep contractions for the first half of 2009, that unemployment could approach 9 percent by the end of the year and that there was at least a small risk of a drop in consumer prices like those that Japan experienced for nearly a decade.
The Fed rarely buys long-term government bonds. The last occasion was nearly 50 years ago under different economic circumstances when it tried to reduce long-term interest rates while allowing short term rates to rise.
Ben S. Bernanke, the Fed chairman, has been extremely cautious in recent weeks about predicting an end to the recession, saying that he hoped to see the start of a recovery later this year but warning that unemployment, a lagging indicator, would probably keep climbing until some time in 2010.
In contrast to several recent Fed decisions, with the presidents of some regional Fed banks dissenting, the decision at Wednesday’s meeting of the 10 members of the Federal Open Market Committee, the central bank’s policy making group, was unanimous.
Jan Hatzius, chief economist at Goldman Sachs, told The Times the Fed had adopted a “kitchen sink” strategy of throwing everything it had to jolt the economy out of its downward spiral.
But while Mr. Hatzius applauded the decision, he cautioned that the central bank could not solve the economy’s problems by expanding cheap money.
“Even if the Fed could make interest rates negative, that wouldn’t necessarily help,” Mr. Hatzius told The Times. “We’re in a deep recession mainly because the private sector, for a variety of reasons, has decided to save a lot more. You can have a zero interest rate, but if you just offer more money on top of the money that is already available, it doesn’t do that much.”
Fed officials have been wrestling for months with the fact that lenders remain unwilling to lend and borrowers are unwilling or unable to borrow. Even though the Fed has been creating money at the fastest rate in its history, much of that money has remained dormant.
The Fed’s action is an expansion of its effort to bypass the private banking system and act as a lender in its own right.
The Fed and the Treasury are starting a joint venture this week called the Consumer and Business Lending Initiative in their latest effort to thaw the still-frozen credit markets. The program will start out with $200 billion in financing for consumer loans, small-business loans and some corporate purposes.
Fed officials have said they hope to expand the program next month, possibly to include the huge market for commercial mortgages, and both the Fed and Treasury hope the program will eventually provide up to $1 trillion in total financing.

Stock market investors now seem to believe a recovery will begin by the middle of next year.Despite some hesitation after the announcement of the half-point reduction, share prices ended the day with a solid rally -- making it the most enthusiastic reaction of the year for any of the cuts that have come at regularly scheduled meetings of the central bank's policy making Federal Open Market Committee.The cut leaves the rate on overnight loans between banks at 2 percent, the lowest since 1961.The three major market averages, the Dow Jones industrial average, the Standard & Poor's 500 and the Nasdaq composite index, ended the day up 1.5 percent or more. They had been mixed to down after the first five expected moves this year, but rose, albeit not as strongly as yesterday, after the last move, on Oct. 2.Lower interest rates are expected to stimulate the economy by making it less expensive for individuals and businesses to borrow money. One rate the Fed directly controls is now down more than two-thirds from where it began the year. That is about the same amount as rates fell before recent recessions ended.

In part, yesterday's market advance reflected more mystery than usual surrounding the Fed meeting. While all Fed forecasters expected a cut, they were split between factions that expected a quarter-point cut -- or 25 basis points -- and those that expected the cut to be twice as much.

However, considerable uncertainty persists about the extent and timing of the expected pickup in production and employment owing in part to the emergence of heightened geopolitical risks.Consequently, the committee believes that for the foreseeable future, against the background of its long-run goals of price stability and sustainable economic growth and of the information currently available, the risks are weighted mainly toward conditions that may generate economic weakness.Voting for the F.O.M.C. monetary policy action were: Alan Greenspan, chairman; William J. McDonough, vice chairman; Ben S. Bernanke; Susan S. Bies; Roger W. Ferguson Jr.; Jerry L. Jordan; Donald L. Kohn; Mark W. Olson; Anthony M. Santomero, and Gary H. Stern.Voting against the action were: Edward M. Gramlich and Robert D. McTeer Jr.Governor Gramlich and President McTeer preferred a reduction in the target for the federal funds rate.

They wanted to reduce it.The dissent, from Edward Gramlich, a Fed governor, and Robert McTeer, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas, was read both negatively and positively by investors, as was evident in the gyrations in the market after the 2:15 p.m. announcement. But by the end of the session, it appeared that the negative interpretation was holding sway for now.The Dow dropped 189.02 points, or 2.4 percent, to 7,683.13, its lowest close since October 1998, while the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index fell 14.41 points, or 1.7 percent, to 819.29. The Nasdaq composite index, which eked out small gains earlier in the day, slipped 2.76 points, or 0.2 percent, to 1,182.17, a six-year low.

But it was a clear indication that Fed officials, like economists generally, are divided over how to deal with the fears of further weakness in the economy and the uncertainty created by the prospect of war with Iraq. [Page C1.]It was the first time since 1998 that two members of the Fed's policy-setting Open Market Committee simultaneously broke ranks with Alan Greenspan, the chairman. While there is no indication that Mr. Greenspan's leadership or stature are at risk -- he left for Britain after the meeting to receive an honorary knighthood from Queen Elizabeth II on Thursday -- the dissents highlighted the unease in Washington and the markets about whether the economy is at risk of stalling again.The vote left investors and analysts uncertain about the Fed's next step. It disappointed some investors, who had hoped the Fed would address the swoon in stock prices, declining consumer confidence and reluctance on the part of businesses to expand and invest.

But the willingness of two Fed members to call for lower rates today suggested to analysts that a rate cut would be on the agenda at the next Fed meeting, on Nov. 6, the day after Congressional elections, when any move the central bank might make would have fewer political implications. If economic indicators point to further weakness, many predicted, the Fed is likely to lower rates at that meeting.

2005-03-22 00:00:00,2005-03-23 00:00:00,Text of the Fed Statement on Interest Rates,"Following is the text of a statement released by the Federal Reserve yesterday after the Fed's monetary policy panel, the Federal Open Market Committee, decided to raise its benchmark interest rates a quarter point:The Federal Open Market Committee decided today to raise its target for the federal funds rate by 25 basis points, to 23/4 percent.The committee believes that, even after this action, the stance of monetary policy remains accommodative and, coupled with robust underlying growth in productivity, is providing ongoing support to economic activity. Output evidently continues to grow at a solid pace despite the rise in energy prices, and labor market conditions continue to improve gradually. Though longer-term inflation expectations remain well contained, pressures on inflation have picked up in recent months and pricing power is more evident. The rise in energy prices, however, has not notably fed through to core consumer prices.The committee perceives that, with appropriate monetary policy action, the upside and downside risks to the attainment of both sustainable growth and price stability should be kept roughly equal. With underlying inflation expected to be contained, the committee believes that policy accommodation can be removed at a pace that is likely to be measured. Nonetheless, the committee will respond to changes in economic prospects as needed to fulfill its obligation to maintain price stability.Voting for the F.O.M.C. monetary policy action were Alan Greenspan, chairman; Timothy F. Geithner, vice chairman; Ben S. Bernanke; Susan S. Bies; Roger W. Ferguson Jr.; Edward M. Gramlich; Jack Guynn; Donald L. Kohn; Michael H. Moskow; Mark W. Olson; Anthony M. Santomero; and Gary H. Stern.In a related action, the board of governors unanimously approved a 25-basis-point increase in the discount rate, to 33/4 percent. In taking this action, the board approved the requests submitted by the boards of directors of the Federal Reserve Banks of Boston, New York, Philadelphia, Cleveland, Richmond, Atlanta, Chicago, St. Louis, Minneapolis and San Francisco.

It restated its intention to keep raising them at a ""measured"" pace in the months ahead.But in a departure from previous declarations, the central bank said there were rising inflationary pressures beyond those tied directly to the recent jumps in oil prices.""Though longer-term inflation expectations remain well contained, pressures on inflation have picked up in recent months and pricing power is more evident,"" the policy-making Federal Open Market Committee said in a statement.

The Fed also changed its assessment of risks to the economy. Last month, it said the risks to inflation and growth were ""roughly equal."" On Tuesday, it said the risks ""should be kept roughly equal,"" but said its outlook was dependent on ""appropriate monetary policy action.""

The Dow Jones industrial average, off 2.9 percent for the year, and the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index, off 3.3 percent for the year, are both within striking distance of the 2005 lows they reached in January.""As long as energy prices remain elevated, they will keep a level of fear in the market,"" said Jack Caffrey, equity strategist at J.P.

2009-08-12 00:00:00,2009-08-13 00:00:00,Text of Fed Statement on Funds Target Rate,"Following is the text of the Federal Reserve’s statement on Wednesday announcing it was holding its base federal funds target rate at a record low between zero and 0.25 percent:Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in June suggests that economic activity is leveling out. Conditions in financial markets have improved further in recent weeks. Household spending has continued to show signs of stabilizing but remains constrained by ongoing job losses, sluggish income growth, lower housing wealth and tight credit. Businesses are still cutting back on fixed investment and staffing but are making progress in bringing inventory stocks into better alignment with sales. Although economic activity is likely to remain weak for a time, the committee continues to anticipate that policy actions to stabilize financial markets and institutions, fiscal and monetary stimulus, and market forces will contribute to a gradual resumption of sustainable economic growth in a context of price stability.The prices of energy and other commodities have risen of late. However, substantial resource slack is likely to dampen cost pressures, and the committee expects that inflation will remain subdued for some time.In these circumstances, the Federal Reserve will employ all available tools to promote economic recovery and to preserve price stability. The committee will maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to  1/4 percent and continues to anticipate that economic conditions are likely to warrant exceptionally low levels of the federal funds rate for an extended period. As previously announced, to provide support to mortgage lending and housing markets and to improve overall conditions in private credit markets, the Federal Reserve will purchase a total of up to $1.25 trillion of agency mortgage-backed securities and up to $200 billion of agency debt by the end of the year. In addition, the Federal Reserve is in the process of buying $300 billion of Treasury securities. To promote a smooth transition in markets as these purchases of Treasury securities are completed, the committee has decided to gradually slow the pace of these transactions and anticipates that the full amount will be purchased by the end of October. The committee will continue to evaluate the timing and overall amounts of its purchases of securities in light of the evolving economic outlook and conditions in financial markets. The Federal Reserve is monitoring the size and composition of its balance sheet and will make adjustments to its credit and liquidity programs as warranted.Voting for the F.O.M.C. monetary policy action were: Ben S. Bernanke, chairman; William C. Dudley, vice chairman; Elizabeth A. Duke; Charles L. Evans; Donald L. Kohn; Jeffrey M. Lacker; Dennis P. Lockhart; Daniel K. Tarullo; Kevin M. Warsh; and Janet L.

The policy-making arm of the Federal Reserve pointedly kept the central bank out of the impasse between the White House and Congress at a time the economic outlook was uncertain anyway.The committee adjourned leaving the federal funds rate unchanged at 5percent. It meets next on Dec. 19, when Wall Street expects consumers to have clarified the outlook for the economy by their Christmas buying patterns and the political impasse to have ended with a plan to eventually eliminate the federal budget deficit.""The major negative in the economy is the budget imbroglio,"" said Allen Sinai, chief economist for Lehman Brothers Inc. ""The economy is on the soft side at the moment, but if the consumer revives during the Christmas season under the impetus of lower prices, that will keep the economy from caving in the last quarter of the year, and then I would not expect the Fed to ease in December.""On Wednesday, the Bureau of Labor Statistics said the consumer price index rose 0.3 percent in October, the largest rise in five months. Even with the latest figure, inflation for the past 12 months is running at 2.8 percent.The Fed's own index of industrial production fell 0.3 percent in October, the first decline since April, when it fell 0.6 percent in an inventory correction after last winter's gains.

Treasury prices were little changed yesterday as the Federal Reserve left interest rates unchanged.While the outcome of the Fed's policy-committee meeting was expected, it did  hold down prices by turning the market's attention back to the impasse on the Federal budget and debt limit, as well as to the next Federal Open Market Committee policy meeting.In terms of the Fed easing, the question is now whether they will ease at the Dec. 19 F.O.M.C. meeting,"" said Carl Palash, chief economist at MCM Money Watch in New York, a market research and analysis firm.The price of the 30-year bond slipped 1/32 , to 10727/32 , leaving its yield  unchanged at 6.29 percent.Treasury prices were also weighed down by a report on consumer prices for October that was above expectations. The Labor Department said its Consumer Price Index rose three-tenths of 1 percent. Analysts had expected an increase of two-tenths of 1 percent. The core rate, which excludes the volatile categories of food and energy prices, also rose three-tenths of 1 percent for the month.

In addition, four rounds of computer-guided ""buy"" orders in advance  of tomorrow's double-witching options expiration helped push the stock market upward late in the day.Robert H.

Despite mounting evidence of some economic slowing, the Federal Reserve decided today against lowering interest rates, which would have made borrowing less costly at the start of the holiday shopping season.Analysts generally attributed the decision to the Federal Government's stalemated budget negotiations and to the absence of compelling evidence that the economy needs to be spurred, though it is less robust than during the summer.It looks like they're waiting until some of the uncertainty over fiscal policy and the economy is cleared up,"" said James F.

However, the pace of economic expansion will likely slow in the near term, partly reflecting the intensification of the housing correction. Today’s action, combined with the policy action taken in September, should help forestall some of the adverse effects on the broader economy that might otherwise arise from the disruptions in financial markets and promote moderate growth over time.Readings on core inflation have improved modestly this year, but recent increases in energy and commodity prices, among other factors, may put renewed upward pressure on inflation. In this context, the committee judges that some inflation risks remain, and it will continue to monitor inflation developments carefully.The committee judges that, after this action, the upside risks to inflation roughly balance the downside risks to growth. The committee will continue to assess the effects of financial and other developments on economic prospects and will act as needed to foster price stability and sustainable economic growth.Voting for the F.O.M.C. monetary policy action were: Ben S.

Prices of Treasury securities were mixed in light trading yesterday, as longer-dated issues outperformed short-term notes and bills for the second consecutive session.Prices of all securities weakened during overnight trading overseas, as market participants took some profits. But the modest declines were erased later, buttressed by a report on April housing activity that showed continued softness in that sector of the economy. Analysts also said traders were encouraged by a drop in commodity prices.''There is definite demand for Treasury securities, especially after they dip to lower price levels,'' said William V. Sullivan Jr., a senior vice president at Dean Witter Reynolds. Overnight Funds Rate DipsHopes that the Federal Reserve Board might ease monetary policy arose in the afternoon, as the overnight Federal funds rate dipped a bit below the 9 3/4 percent to 9 7/8 percent range it has occupied for the last two months. The funds rate fell as low as 9 5/8 percent during the afternoon before bouncing back to a late quote of 9 11/16 percent.

Growth in consumer spending has slowed and labor markets have softened. Financial markets remain under considerable stress, and the tightening of credit conditions and the deepening of the housing contraction are likely to weigh on economic growth over the next few quarters.Inflation has been elevated, and some indicators of inflation expectations have risen. The committee expects inflation to moderate in coming quarters, reflecting a projected leveling-out of energy and other commodity prices and an easing of pressures on resource utilization. Still, uncertainty about the inflation outlook has increased. It will be necessary to continue to monitor inflation developments carefully.Today’s policy action, combined with those taken earlier, including measures to foster market liquidity, should help to promote moderate growth over time and to mitigate the risks to economic activity.

2008-03-18 00:00:00,2008-03-19 00:00:00,UNITED STATES: Fed forecasting,"UNITED STATES: Fed forecastingThe US Federal Reserve yesterday cut its benchmark interest rate by 75 basis points. The Fed has dramatically reduced interest rates in its efforts to stimulate the US economy, even in the context of an inflationary environment. It has also started to make publicly available distributions of Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) members' forecasts of inflation, unemployment and GDP growth out to three years. This raises the question of whether the FOMC has become an inflation targeter -- and to what extent it will be able to achieve its objectives.The FOMC's summary statistics will be made available four times a year. The first such release accompanied the minutes of the October 2007 FOMC meeting. This is significant for several reasons:Better guidance? The FOMC is providing better guidance to markets in terms of possible macroeconomic outcomes. Whether this is useful depends on whether or not the FOMC is a better forecaster than private agents:•It is known that the Federal Reserve Board staff's Greenbook forecasts outperform private forecasts. Yet the Greenbook is released publicly with a five-year delay. On the other hand, FOMC forecasts are released in a timely manner.•Recent research has shown that Greenbook forecasts are superior to FOMC forecasts. It is thus not clear that FOMC forecasts will provide the best guidance about the macroeconomy.Policy clarity. Fed actions presumably will become easier to anticipate as FOMC members decide on the policy path based on their forecasts of macroeconomic developments. As those forecasts are now known, financial markets can have a better understanding of what FOMC members think they are facing.

Communication compromise. The debate on FOMC communication strategy will leave centre stage for a while. More frequent and longer-term FOMC forecasts are among the recommendations of a committee on FOMC communications chaired by Federal Reserve Vice-Chairman Donald Kohn:•Kohn was known to be against an explicit Fed inflation target. However, last September he said that he was ""relatively more persuaded that inflation targeting helps reduce the variance of inflation expectations.""

•Publishing long-term forecasts is thus a compromise between announcing an inflation target and not providing any more information than under the Greenspan chairmanship.Forecasting behaviour? Most importantly, FOMC long-term inflation forecasts are fundamentally different from private sector forecasts:•Monetary policy usually affects inflation with a lag of three to four quarters, therefore inflation forecasts at horizons longer than this in part are forecasts of Fed behaviour.

WASHINGTON — The Federal Reserve reduced short-term interest rates for the sixth time in six months on Tuesday, capping an extraordinary series of measures it has taken to stabilize financial markets. The cut was smaller than investors had been expecting, though, and exposed some signs of a split among policy makers.The central bank lowered its federal funds rate — the rate it charges banks for overnight loans —  by three-quarters of a percentage point, to 2.25 percent, and left the door open to additional rate cuts in the months ahead.Though it was one of the biggest one-day rate cuts in decades, investors had been betting heavily that the Fed would cut its benchmark rate a full percentage point in response to strong evidence that a recession has begun and to the deepening crisis on Wall Street.But two members of the Fed’s policy-making committee dissented, saying they favored an even smaller rate cut, and the policy group as a whole expressed new worries about inflation — a possible argument against aggressive rate cuts.

2000-05-16 00:00:00,2000-05-17 00:00:00,Statement by Fed Panel,"Following is the text of the statement by the Federal Open Market Committee, the Federal Reserve's monetary policy panel, after its decision yesterday to raise short-term interest rates:The Federal Open Market Committee voted today to raise its target for the federal funds rate by 50 basis points to 6 1/2 percent. In a related action, the board of governors approved a 50 basis point increase in the discount rate to 6 percent.Increases in demand have remained in excess of even the rapid pace of productivity-driven gains in potential supply, exerting continued pressure on resources. The committee is concerned that this disparity in the growth of demand and potential supply will continue, which could foster inflationary imbalances that would undermine the economy's outstanding performance.Against the background of its long-term goals of price stability and sustainable economic growth and of the information already available, the committee believes the risks are weighted mainly toward conditions that may generate heightened inflation pressures in the foreseeable future.In taking the discount rate action, the Federal Reserve Board approved requests submitted by the boards of directors of the Federal Reserve Banks of Boston, Cleveland, Richmond and San Francisco. The discount rate is the rate charged depository institutions when they borrow short-term adjustment credit from their district Federal Reserve Banks.

2000-05-16 00:00:00,2000-05-17 00:00:00,THE MARKETS: Market Place; The Fed Administers Dose No. 6 of Its Sedative for the Economy,"Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, still believes that his medicine -- higher interest rates -- will reduce the economy's feverish growth. But it appears that the medicine is much weaker than he thought just a year ago, and that much higher doses will be needed to have the desired effect.Last June, when the Federal Reserve's Open Market Committee raised interest rates for the first of what has now become six times, the committee's minutes reflected a general expectation of ''appreciable moderation in the trend'' of economic growth in the months ahead.At that time, a divided Fed decided not to signal that there would be future interest rate increases. This was despite warnings by some members that the lack of such a signal could be interpreted as meaning that no further raises in rates were likely. In fact, that exact interpretation took hold as financial markets rallied on the news.Since June, the economy has behaved in a way that few if any would have expected. The boom has continued, and economic growth has accelerated. Housing starts, industrial production and inflation are up, while unemployment is down.

Yesterday, when the Fed announced its sixth rate increase -- and the first in that series to bolster the federal funds rate target by half a percentage point, not the usual quarter-point rise -- it went out of its way to warn that it was still worried about inflation, and to hint that more increases would come unless and until the economy began to cool.

With the forces restraining the economy starting to diminish, and with the long-term prospects for productivity growth remaining favorable and monetary policy accommodative, the outlook for economic recovery has become more promising.The degree of any strength in business capital and household spending, however, is still uncertain. Hence, the committee continues to believe that, against the background of its long-run goals of price stability and sustainable economic growth and of the information currently available, the risks are weighted mainly toward conditions that may generate economic weakness in the foreseeable future.

Carl McCall's office said yesterday. Last year, the fund lost $58 million in the collapse of Enron . The losses represent a small fraction of the $112 billion fund, which is widely diversified. But the campaign of Andrew M. Cuomo, Mr. McCall's rival for the Democratic nomination, has raised questions about Mr. McCall's management of the fund, pointing to recent losses. The fund has lost $15 billion over the last two years, a period in which most investors suffered in a weak market.Richard Pérez-Peña (NYT)18 INTEL SCIENCE FINALISTSEighteen high school students from the region, including 15 from New York State, were among the 40 finalists named yesterday in the Intel Science Talent Search.

Ms. Lowey, a Democrat who represents most of the county, plans a formal announcement today. The National Association of Counties released a survey on Tuesday in which 90 percent of the county governments questioned said they were unprepared to handle biological or chemical attacks.(AP)MANHATTAN: FIRE DAMAGES 2 BUILDINGSA four-alarm fire caused by a fallen candle displaced several families and damaged two Upper Manhattan apartment buildings early yesterday morning, a Fire Department official said. Four firefighters suffered minor injuries, and a resident with chest pains was taken to the hospital. Heat from the fire, which started about 3 a.m., roused Efrain Pizarro, 35, an off-duty firefighter who lives on the second floor of the building, at 117 East 101st Street. Mr. Pizarro ""went around the building and got everyone out,"" said Firefighter Louis Giaconelli, a department spokesman. The fire took about an hour to control and was ruled accidental.

Nevertheless, the economy seems likely to expand at a moderate pace over coming quarters.Core inflation remains somewhat elevated. Although inflation pressures seem likely to moderate over time, the high level of resource utilization has the potential to sustain those pressures.In these circumstances, the committee’s predominant policy concern remains the risk that inflation will fail to moderate as expected. Future policy adjustments will depend on the evolution of the outlook for both inflation and economic growth, as implied by incoming information.Voting for the F.O.M.C. monetary policy action were Ben S. Bernanke, chairman; Timothy F. Geithner, vice chairman; Thomas M. Hoenig; Donald L. Kohn; Randall S. Kroszner; Cathy E. Minehan; Frederic S. Mishkin; Michael H. Moskow; William Poole and Kevin M.

When Anya Bailey developed an eating disorder after her 12th birthday, her mother took her to a psychiatrist at the University of Minnesota who prescribed a powerful antipsychotic drug called Risperdal.Created for schizophrenia, Risperdal is not approved to treat eating disorders, but increased appetite is a common side effect and doctors may prescribe drugs as they see fit. Anya gained weight but within two years developed a crippling knot in her back. She now receives regular injections of Botox to unclench her back muscles. She often awakens crying in pain.Isabella Bailey, Anya’s mother, said she had no idea that children might be especially susceptible to Risperdal’s side effects. Nor did she know that Risperdal and similar medicines were not approved at the time to treat children, or that medical trials often cited to justify the use of such drugs had as few as eight children taking the drug by the end.Just as surprising, Ms. Bailey said, was learning that the university psychiatrist who supervised Anya’s care received more than $7,000 from 2003 to 2004 from Johnson & Johnson, Risperdal’s maker, in return for lectures about one of the company’s drugs.

Among the states that participated in the strategy session last week, he said, were Florida, Illinois, Minnesota and New York.

The Fed's last move was on Jan. 31, 1996, when it reduced its Federal funds target rate, its overnight loan rate for banks, to 5.25 percent from 5.5 percent, and its discount rate for loans to financial institutions to 5 percent from 5.25 percent.Because the Fed's decision today not to raise rates had been widely anticipated for weeks in the financial markets, it was not a powerful enough dose of good news to stop a technology-led swoon in stock prices. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 86.58 points, to 6,746.90.Since last summer the Fed's official policy has been a ''bias'' toward  tightening, a way of signaling that it will raise rates at the first compelling evidence that inflation might be taking root. Economists said they expected that the Fed kept the policy in place today, although it would not disclose its decision until after the next meeting of its policy-making body on March 25.

By keeping rates unchanged, the Fed is once again waiting for further evidence of whether growth will slow sufficiently to keep wages from spiking up and setting off an upward spiral in inflation. Despite the economy's torrid 4.7 percent growth rate in the fourth quarter, wage increases have remained muted and there is almost no sign of rising inflation.

The yield, which moves in the opposite direction, dropped to 5.85 percent, from 5.86 percent on Tuesday.The Federal Open Market Committee, at its first meeting of the year, kept the Federal funds rate at 5.50 percent, where the short-term benchmark rate has remained for almost a year.What was not disclosed at the end of the two-day meeting is whether committee members have shifted to a neutral stance from their previous position of maintaining a bias toward raising rates. But given the prevailing evidence of benign inflation and the expected economic slowdown due to Asia's financial crisis, bond market analysts said such a change would not surprise them.

Gov. Mario M. Cuomo and legislative leaders reached a compromise Wednesday that would allow New York City to build a much disputed garbage incinerator in the Brooklyn Navy Yard. But in doing so, they imposed new hurdles that could slow the project or make it more expensive.The agreement, which will partly exempt the incinerator from strict air-pollution regulations, left both its proponents and critics claiming victory.The compromise came late Wednesday afternoon, as the Legislature rushed to close an extended 1993 session. In a flurry of activity, dozens of bills that had languished in what has been a slow and largely unproductive year came under last-minute consideration. New Hurdles for CityLater Wednesday, negotiators for Mr. Cuomo, Assembly Speaker Saul Weprin, a Queens Democrat, and Senate Majority Leader Ralph J. Marino, an Oyster Bay Republican, were trying to wrap up several major bills before daybreak today, when the lawmakers were hoping to adjourn until the fall.

1997-08-19 00:00:00,1997-08-20 00:00:00,FEDERAL RESERVE LETS RATES STAND,"The Federal Reserve voted today to leave interest rates unchanged, continuing a remarkable economic experiment in which the central bank has kept interest rates low despite shrinking unemployment and unusually strong economic growth.Today's meeting of the Fed's policy-making committee was the third consecutive time that the central bank has passed up a chance to raise short-term interest rates. The last increase in the key short-term rate that the Fed controls came in March, a quarter-point rise, to 5.50 percent.The Fed's action today was no surprise. A wide variety of recent economic measurements have shown that inflation remains at barely noticeable levels, below an annual rate of 2 percent in the first half of the year. That is the lowest inflation rate since the early 1960's, and wholesale prices have declined this year, the first time that has happened in more than four decades.But the Federal Reserve's job is to anticipate economic trends and to act on such assumptions months in advance. So its decision today to hold its fire may only spur arguments over whether it is missing signs that wages and prices will increase toward the end of this year or in the beginning of 1998.

In a related action, the board of governors approved a 50-basis-point reduction in the discount rate, to 2 percent.The terrorist attacks have significantly heightened uncertainty in an economy that was already weak. Business and household spending as a consequence are being further damped. Nonetheless, the long-term prospects for productivity growth and the economy remain favorable and should become evident once the unusual forces restraining demand abate.The committee continues to believe that against the background of its long-run goals of price stability and sustainable economic growth and of the information currently available, the risks are weighted mainly toward conditions that may generate economic weakness in the foreseeable future.In taking the discount rate action, the Federal Reserve Board approved requests submitted by the boards of directors of the Federal Reserve Banks of Boston, New York, Cleveland, Richmond, Atlanta, St. Louis, Kansas City and San Francisco.
