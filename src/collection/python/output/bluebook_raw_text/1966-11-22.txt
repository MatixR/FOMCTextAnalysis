MONEY MARKET AND RESERVE RELATIONSHIPS

Recent developments

Money market conditions tightened in the first half of November,

despite a shallower level of net borrowed reserves. Net borrowed reserves

averaged about $230 million in the two latest statement weeks, as compared

with $340 million in the previous two weeks. Member bank borrowings edged

up over the past four weeks, but at the same time excess reserves moved to

a substantially higher level.

In the first half of November, Federal funds traded more fre-

quently at 6 per cent, and reached a new high effective rate of 6½ per cent

on one day early in the month. Dealer borrowing costs at New York City

banks rose and generally held within a new high range, including a rate of

6-7/8 per cent on new loans. Tightening in these markets was communicated

to the Treasury bill market, with the 3-month issue moving up some 25 basis

points from its late October low to 5.46 per cent in the most recent weekly

auction. Bond yields also have risen in recent weeks, mainly in reaction

to large actual and prospective additions to the corporate and municipal

calendars and to rumors of a possible offering of FNMA participation

certificates later in the year.

Most recently, there has been some easing in money market

conditions, especially in bill rates. The sharp decline in bill rates

has reflected exceptionally strong bill demand from the public and

reduced dealer holdings of short-term bills.

CONFIDENTIAL (FR) - 2 - November 18, 1966

The taut atmosphere in the central money market that obtained

until the last few days was partly related to a sharp deterioration in

the basic reserve positions of major money market banks, notably those in

New York. Recently major money market banks have again increased their

efforts to tap the Euro-dollar market for funds. In the four weeks ending

November 9, the net inflows of such funds totaled about $750 million,

almost as much as the record July inflow. However,in the succeeding week a

significant reflow, possibly associated with beginning of year-end window

dressing abroad, has occurred.

The reasons for the surge in borrowing abroad in October and early

November are not exactly clear, but it was probably related to the higher

cost of Federal funds recently, and to current and prospective problems of

replacing maturing CD's. The increase in foreign borrowing -- as well as

the recent tightening in money market conditions -- is also related to the

limited supply of reserve funds made available to banks through open market

operations and perhaps to reluctance to borrow from the Federal Reserve.

Final figures for October indicate that nonborrowed reserves declined at

a 7 per cent annual rate and total reserves at a 10 per cent rate in that

month. Such reserves have declined markedly since mid-summer, and as a

result they have now increased at rates of only 0.2 and 1.5 per cent,

respectively, since the beginning of the year. Indications are that the

flow of reserve funds to banks was less restrictive in the first half of

November than in October, with nonborrowed reserves rising considerably

more than seasonally.



CONFIDENTIAL (FR) - 3 - November 18, 1966

The decline in deposits supported by reserves in October was

reflected in rates of decline of almost 6.5 per cent in the money supply

and nearly 2.5 per cent in time deposits. With part of these declines

offset by increases in U.S. Government deposits, total member bank deposits

fell at a 3.5 per cent rate, the third successive month of decline. The

decline in bank credit in October (on an average daily basis) was somewhat

less than indicated by total deposits; borrowing from abroad would provide

a 1 percentage point offset to this decline.

Prospective developments

Money market conditions and marginal reserve levels, as they

have developed so far in November, appear consistent with about a 3 per

cent rate of decline in total member bank deposits for the month on average.

The large borrowing from abroad that developed in late October and continued

into early November would, however, largely offset this decline in terms

of bank credit effects unless year-end window dressing reflows continue.

Money supply in November is projected to increase at less than

a 1 per cent rate, a smaller increase than the 2-3 per cent rate projected

for that month in the previous blue book. This weaker money supply

performance seems mainly attributable to a smaller growth in loans than

was anticipated, including business loans, security loans, and loans to

finance companies. Time deposits at all commercial banks are still

projected to rise slightly for the month, while U.S. Government deposits

are expected to show a somewhat greater decline than anticipated three

weeks ago.



CONFIDENTIAL (FR) - 4 - November 18, 1966

Government deposits are expected to show an even larger decline

in December (seasonally adjusted), despite the $1.2 billion bill strip

financing to be paid on November 25 and a comparable amount of tax bills

assumed to be paid around mid-December. The Government deposit decline

reflects mainly our projections of Federal cash payments, which we expect

to run several hundred million dollars above a year ago throughout the

month. The decline in Government deposits is likely to be associated with

a marked resurgence in money supply growth, unless greater than seasonal

loan repayments extinguish deposits.

With Treasury deposits in tax and loan accounts reaching low

levels before mid-December, it is possible that the Treasury balance at

the Federal Reserve will be drawn to near zero and that the Treasury may

have to borrow directly from the System. Depending on their timing, such

developments could reduce the amount of reserves (currently estimated at

about $1 billion) that would have to be supplied by the System through

open market transactions with dealers between now and the first week of

December, or they could necessitate offsetting open market sales.

These possibilities suggest that some greater than usual

seasonal pressures on bill rates might develop in forthcoming weeks.

Dealer positions in longer term bills are fairly sizable at present,

and they may be augmented in current and prospective bill financings.

On the other hand, the relatively low dealer position in short-term bills

and the possibility of sustained bill demand as a result of CD run-offs

and of enlarged capital market issues may provide some offset. All in all,



CONFIDENTIAL (FR) - 5 - November 18, 1966

the 3-month bill may fluctuate in a 5.25-5.50 per cent range over the

next few weeks if net borrowed reserves remain in the $200-300 million

range.

So long as the bill rate remains near the lower end of this range,

the CD run-off in December might be held down to the order of $600 million

or so and this probably would result in a slight further decline in total

member bank deposits. On the other hand, if the 3-month bill rises

toward the upper part of the 5.25-5.50 range, CD's will come under more

pressure and the run-off in December could approach the September-October

dimension of $1.2 billion per month.

It might well be necessary, however, to move net borrowed

reserves to a shallower level than has prevailed in the past two weeks

in order to keep bill rates from rising much above current levels. Under

such conditions, the Federal funds rate would be likely to drop to a

level averaging closer to 5 per cent, dealer financing costs should

decline further, and dealers would find it more comfortable to finance

their inventories -- not only of bills but also of coupon issues.

These developments would also tend to moderate rate pressures in long-

term markets, as expectations of monetary easing took hold.

It is doubtful that even these money market and net reserve

conditions, however, would result in any appreciable expansion in bank

credit between now and year-end. While the outlook is quite conjectural

at this early date -- given the uncertainties about defense spending and

about prospects for a more restrictive fiscal policy -- it looks at



CONFIDENTIAL (FR) - 6 - November 18, 1966

the moment as if encouragement of a moderate bank credit expansion in

December in, say, the 2-4 per cent annual rate range, would require a 3-

month bill rate moving down close to 5 per cent and a substantially more

comfortable net reserve position for banks, perhaps on the order of zero.
