1  The effective federal funds rate averaged about 1 percent over the inter-
meeting period.  The Desk expanded the System’s outright holdings of securities by
$6 billion, with purchases of $1.1 billion of Treasury bills from foreign official
customers and $4.9 billion of Treasury coupon securities in the market, $470 million
of which were inflation-indexed securities.  The volume of outstanding long-term RPs
increased $1 billion, to $15 billion.

MONETARY POLICY ALTERNATIVES

Recent Developments

(1) Although the Committee’s decision at its January meeting to leave the

target federal funds rate at 1 percent had been widely anticipated by financial market

participants, the substitution of the “can be patient” clause for the “considerable

period” phrase in the announcement elicited an appreciable market reaction. 

Investors apparently perceived the wording change as a precursor of policy tightening

and brought forward the expected onset of firming from the fall to the summer

(Chart 1).  That sentiment did not persist:  The Chairman’s monetary policy testimony

and weaker-than-expected data on nonfarm payroll employment for January and,

especially, February seemed to reassure investors that policy tightening was some way

off.  Implied federal funds rates fell as much as 55 basis points, on net, over the

intermeeting period and now indicate that a full 25 basis points of tightening is not

expected until around year-end.  According to a recent survey by the Trading Desk,

none of the twenty-three primary dealers expect a change in the funds rate target at

this meeting, and about two-fifths anticipate firming to be deferred until next year.1

(2) Movements in nominal Treasury yields during the intermeeting period

tracked changes in policy expectations, with intermediate- and long-term Treasury

yields falling about 20 to 35 basis points on net.  Market participants continued to

speculate that heavy purchases of Treasury securities by foreign official institutions

were holding down these yields, but, as discussed in the box entitled “Foreign Official

Holdings of U.S. Treasury Securities,” such effects are difficult to quantify.  Late in

the period, the shortening duration of mortgages as prepayment risks picked up led to

Foreign Official Holdings of U.S. Treasury Securities

Foreign official holdings of U.S. Treasury securities have increased
rapidly in recent years,           

             
  .   Treasury securities held in custody for foreign official

institutions at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York have expanded more
than $275 billion since mid-2002, to about $900 billion–or about one-quarter
of all outstanding marketable Treasury securities (Chart).  Market participants
have been interpreting the elevated level of indirect bidding at auctions as
evidence of increased participation by these institutions.

Some market participants have argued that purchases by foreign official
institutions have depressed Treasury yields.  While the run-up in foreign
official holdings coincided with declines in Treasury yields, it is difficult to
quantify the effects of these purchases.  One might presume that the purchases
would have some impact because they have been quite large–amounting to
about one-third of net Treasury issuance since 2002–and have been made by
entities that generally do not substitute among alternative instruments.  That
said, the considerable size and liquidity of the Treasury market should tend to
limit any price consequences.  Moreover, some of these institutions have
concentrated their purchases in shorter-term securities, where more private
assets are available to other investors as substitutes and where prices are more
strongly anchored by monetary policy expectations.  In that regard, swap
spreads have generally narrowed, on balance, since mid-2002, in contrast to the
widening that would be expected if foreign official purchases were shifting the
overall balance of demand toward Treasury securities.

hedging flows that may also have contributed to the downdraft in yields.  Yields on

inflation-indexed Treasury securities declined roughly in line with their nominal

counterparts over the intermeeting period, leaving inflation compensation little

changed.  Yields on high-grade corporate securities followed those on comparable

Treasury securities (Chart 2).  In contrast, spreads on speculative-grade corporate

bonds, particularly at the lowest quality levels, climbed 20 to 120 basis points, as

investors apparently reassessed the riskiness of weaker firms in the wake of soft

economic data releases.  Also probably indicative of concerns about the economy–and 

renewed worries about terrorism more recently–was the 3 to 8 percent declines in

major equity indexes.  These share price declines were posted even as analysts

continued to revise up their earnings forecasts, implying a widening of the spread of

the forward-looking earnings-price ratio for the S&P 500 over the real long-term

Treasury yield, and were associated with an uptick in forward-looking measures of

price volatility.

(3) The foreign exchange value of the dollar against other major currencies 

varied widely over the intermeeting period (Chart 3).  The dollar declined, on net, until

the middle of February, but subsequently rebounded to end the period up almost

3 percent.  On balance, the dollar rose about 5 percent versus the yen, 2½ percent

versus the euro, and 1½ percent versus the Canadian dollar and the British pound. 

Japanese authorities made frequent and large intervention purchases of

dollars–including during periods when the dollar was rising–which may have bolstered

the dollar’s performance against the yen.2  Factors supporting the dollar against

European currencies are harder to identify, but remarks by some euro-area leaders

calling for monetary policy easing by the ECB may have contributed to a change in

sentiment.  Despite this talk, the ECB held policy steady throughout the period.  The

Bank of England tightened policy 25 basis points in early February, citing concerns

about rising house prices, and the Bank of Canada cut its policy rate 25 basis points in

early March as inflation there dipped further below its target.  Stock prices in most

foreign industrial countries rose modestly over much of the period, but erased those

gains today in the wake of the act of terrorism in Madrid.  Yields on long-term

government bonds generally declined–albeit slightly less than those on comparable

U.S. Treasury securities.  Amid further signs of gathering economic strength in Japan,

share prices rose, and long-term yields were about unchanged.

(4) The dollar rose slightly against an index of currencies of our other

important trading partners.  The Bank of Mexico tightened policy in February, its first

firming in nearly a year.  The Mexican peso traded in a narrow range and declined

about 1 percent on net vis-a-vis the dollar over the intermeeting period.  Brazil’s

EMBI+ spread widened 130 basis points, to about 5½ percentage points, and

Brazilian share prices dropped sharply, as prospects for the government’s reform

program worsened in the face of a corruption scandal.  Asian stock markets recorded

mixed performances amid concerns about the possible adverse effects of avian flu,

but sentiment about the region remained positive overall as economic activity

continued to be buoyant.  

(5) Debt of the domestic nonfinancial sectors appears to have accelerated of

late and is anticipated to rise at an 8 percent pace in the first quarter.  Although

businesses remain flush with funds in the aggregate, they have stepped up their

borrowing both in financial markets and from banks (Chart 4).  For the nonfinancial

business sector as a whole, debt is estimated to be expanding at a 5 percent rate this

quarter, a bit faster than in the fourth quarter.  In the household sector, debt is on

track to grow at a 9 percent rate in the first quarter.  Consumer credit growth

registered a substantial pickup in January from the slow pace at the end of last year,

and low interest rates and higher house prices have supported mortgage debt growth. 

Federal debt is projected to expand at a nearly 13 percent rate this quarter.

(6) After four consecutive months of decline, M2 edged up in January and

expanded at a 10¼ percent rate in February.  The depressing effect of the earlier

drop-off in mortgage refinancing has apparently waned so that the ongoing robust

growth of nominal income is now showing through to M2 growth.

Policy Alternatives

(7)  Economic data released over the intermeeting period, especially readings

on the labor market, fell short of staff expectations, and the projection of GDP growth

over the first half of this year has been marked down about ½ percentage point relative

to that in the January Greenbook.  Still, accommodative monetary policy and robust

productivity gains are expected to support output growth later this year and next,

leaving the projection little changed over that period.  In this Greenbook as in the

previous one, the staff assumes that the Committee will begin to tighten policy in 2005,

raising the target federal funds rate to 2 percent by the end of that year.  Stock prices

are anticipated to appreciate from current levels at a rate that provides investors with

risk-adjusted returns comparable to those on fixed-income instruments.  Longer-term

Treasury yields increase gradually over the forecast period, but corporate yields are

expected to hold steady as the improvement in the economic outlook trims risk

spreads.  The dollar is again assumed to depreciate gradually, albeit starting from its

current higher level.  The downward revision to economic growth forecasted over the

first half of this year implies less headway in reducing resource slack.  Although the

output gap is cut by more than half over the next two years, it follows a track about 

½ percentage point deeper than that in the last Greenbook and ends 2005 at around 

¾ percent.  The output gap puts downward pressure on inflation over the forecast

horizon, offsetting upward pressures from higher oil and non-oil import prices.  On

net, core PCE inflation is projected to hold steady near 1 percent this year and next. 

As compared with the forecasts of the Board members and Bank presidents prepared

for the January meeting, the staff anticipates that real GDP will grow at the top end of

policymakers’ central tendency of 4½ to 5 percent for 2004 and that inflation will

come in at the lower end of the 1 to 1¼ percent central tendency.  

(8) At its last meeting, the Committee instructed the staff to include a more

complete analysis in the Bluebook of possible wording choices for the policy

announcement (see box entitled “Some General Issues Concerning Statement

Language”).  Given current economic circumstances and the Committee’s January

policy announcement, the staff viewed a change in the federal funds rate at this  



6

Some General Issues Concerning Statement Language

As is evident in the chart below, the words of the FOMC’s statements are important:  The
overall tone and content of FOMC statements can elicit significant immediate market
reactions and sometimes may color the way market participants respond to subsequent
incoming news and events.  But while “words matter” in FOMC communications,
statement language should not be viewed as an independent instrument of monetary policy. 
Presumably, the statement influences markets because participants believe that it conveys
information that bears directly or indirectly on potential future policy actions.  Thus, at least
over the longer run, the importance of statement language depends on its connection with
observed policy actions.

The likely market reaction to an FOMC statement is hard to judge.  When the policy rate is
changed, one can forecast the market reaction by using surveys and interest rate futures to
measure ex-ante market expectations.  When only the wording of the announcement is
changed, predicting the market reaction is much more problematic.  There is no simple way
to map alternative wording in FOMC statements into basis-point equivalents to arrive at
the analogue of a policy rate change.  And even if this were possible, one would still need to
know the language that the market expects.  These caveats notwithstanding, the discussion
in this Bluebook does hazard speculations about likely market reactions to alternative
FOMC statements; these represent the staff’s best guesses of the likely market reactions,
but the confidence intervals are quite wide.

3 As economic circumstances change over time, the alternatives presented in
future Bluebooks will generally include analyses of potential changes in the stance of
policy as well as in the proposed wording of the associated statements.  

meeting as sufficiently unlikely that this Bluebook presents three draft FOMC

statements associated with an unchanged funds rate.  These alternatives–A, B, and C in

Table 1–are differentiated solely by their characterizations of the economy in the

rationale paragraph and in the balance-of-risks assessment.3

Alternative B

(9) Although economic data over the intermeeting period have generally run 

on the soft side of expectations, the Committee might still believe that, with financial

conditions registering only a small net change, the economy is positioned to attain

sustainable economic growth with measures of core inflation remaining close to levels

that many members have characterized as effective price stability.  While the

Committee may be disappointed that economic slack now seems likely to persist at a

higher level than anticipated in January, it might also judge that additional policy ease

would likely have its most stimulative effects when the economy was already close to

its potential.  The case for inaction may be compelling even if members harbor some

doubts about the outlook.  On the one hand, were capital spending to expand more

slowly than in the staff forecast, the alternative simulation in the Greenbook tracing

out the effects of lingering caution on the part of business executives would suggest

that overall GDP growth would not be materially impaired.  On the other hand, if the

Committee believed that pressures on resources might build relatively quickly, the

potential costs of a policy error associated with an unchanged policy stance might still

be judged to be less worrisome than the costs that could be associated with tightening

policy at this time.  While the current degree of policy accommodation cannot be

sustained in the long run, market participants are not likely to view retention of the

current stance of policy as a reason to mark up inflation expectations, given persisting

resource slack and rapid productivity growth. 

(10) In these circumstances, the Committee might choose to retain the January

FOMC statement essentially in its entirety, with only minor revisions similar to those

shown in Alternative B.  Given the incoming data, the Committee might wish to

acknowledge that the pace of new hiring has been “disappointing” but note that other

indicators point to “continued” improvement in the labor market.  Also, the Committee

might want to state that “evidence . . .indicates that output is continuing to expand briskly.”  If

the Committee’s sense of the economic risks has not changed greatly since the January

meeting, the wording of the January balance-of-risks assessment would seem

appropriate at this meeting.  Market participants would likely read such a statement as

confirming that the Committee’s economic and policy outlook is basically unchanged,

and any market reaction to the statement would probably be small.

Alternative C

(11) In contrast, the Committee may have become more confident, in view of

continued brisk spending growth and gains in manufacturing output, that the

expansion has become self-sustaining.  To be sure, news about the labor market has

been disappointing, but this may point to continued strong gains in productivity. 

Indicators generally suggest that aggregate demand is holding up quite well.  The recent

strength of capital spending has been particularly noteworthy, perhaps offering

increasingly concrete evidence that the pervasive gloom about business prospects

evinced by corporate executives over much of the last two years is lifting.  Against that

backdrop, the Committee also might be more wary about the risk that inflation

pressures could begin to emerge despite the current output gap.  Indeed, rising oil and

commodity prices might be cited as hints of inflation pressures.  As in the alternative

simulation presented in the Greenbook, a significant pickup in inflation expectations

would pull real interest rates below their already-low levels and gradually feed into

actual inflation.  However, even if the Committee viewed these arguments as

compelling, it might see some benefit in deferring tightening to a time when markets

were better prepared for such action.

(12) Given this assessment, the Committee might wish to issue a statement

structured like that in Alternative C.  The Committee could convey some sense of

increased wariness about inflation pressures in the final sentence of the rationale

paragraph by noting simply that “To date, increases in core consumer prices have been muted and



9

inflation expectations remain contained,” eliminating the forward-looking phrase “and are

expected to remain low” that appeared in the January statement.  This tone could be

reinforced by modest revisions in the balance-of-risks assessment.  For example, the

Committee could indicate a slight change in its inflation outlook by stating that “the

probability of a rise in inflation about equals that of an unwelcome decline in inflation.”  Lastly,

while the Committee may not be prepared at this meeting to dispense with references

to “patience,” it might wish to add a sentence that hints that its patience is not

unlimited.  This could be accomplished with an insertion so that the revised passage

read, “The Committee recognizes that the stance of monetary policy has been quite accommodative for

some time.  Nonetheless, with inflation low and resource use slack, the Committee believes that it can

still be patient in removing its policy accommodation.”  Market participants would be quick to

notice these revisions and, in all likelihood, would interpret the changes as further steps

aimed at clearing the way for an eventual return of the target federal funds rate to a

more neutral setting.  Interest rates likely would move up on that reading, resulting in a

concomitant dip in stock prices, but the retention of some reference to patience would

likely diminish the odds of an outsized market reaction.

(13) The Committee might view the jury as still out as to whether the

expansion has become self-sustaining at the current setting of policy.  Indeed,

members might regard the continued sluggishness in employment as a sign that

businesses similarly have yet to reach a judgment on that score.  And with fiscal

impetus expected to wane, there may be some concern that weak employment growth

could begin to weigh on consumer confidence and spending, eventually calling for an

easing of policy.  Such concern might be all the more acute if the Committee viewed a

stable nominal funds rate in the face of downward revisions to many measures of the

equilibrium federal funds rate (Chart 5) as an effective tightening of policy.  The

Committee would be particularly uncomfortable with this development if the

prevailing inflation rate were viewed to be already on the low side of its preferred

inflation cushion.  While the Committee might see some benefit to an easier stance of

policy, it might stay its hand at this meeting because of the offsetting risk that currently

benign inflation expectations could respond in an adverse manner if its already

considerable policy accommodation were augmented.

(14) With this view, the Committee might wish to issue a statement structured

like that shown in Alternative A.  The Committee could convey a sense of its concerns

through a somewhat less sanguine assessment of the labor market in the rationale

paragraph.  The third sentence could drop the reference to other indicators pointing to

improvement in labor markets and state simply that “New hiring has been disappointing.” 

Adding a clause to this sentence suggesting that “. . .and resource utilization generally appears

likely to remain somewhat below levels consistent with the economy operating at its productive potential

for some time” would underscore the Committee’s concern about economic slack.  The

Committee’s assessment could be amplified still more by modest revisions to its

characterizations of the balance of risks.  For example, the Committee might note that

“the probability, though minor, of an unwelcome fall in inflation has diminished in recent months but

likely exceeds that of a rise in inflation.”  Interest rates would probably move a bit lower

following an announcement of this sort.  Equity prices might be buoyed somewhat if

the statement was read primarily as reaffirming the FOMC’s resolve to foster

sustainable output growth at a pace sufficient to eliminate economic slack.  The rise in

stock prices could be damped or even reversed, however, if investors took the

statement as implying higher odds that the vigor of economic growth could wane over

coming quarters.  

Money and Debt Forecast

(15) Stronger money growth of late has led the staff to nudge up its forecast

for M2 growth this year about ½ percentage point, to 5 percent, relative to that in the

January Greenbook.  Still, households are expected to continue tilting the composition

of their portfolios toward capital market instruments at the expense of monetary

assets, pushing up M2 velocity about 1 percent for the year.  The staff forecast for total

domestic nonfinancial debt growth in 2004 has also been marked up by about 

½ percentage point.  For the corporate sector, the staff’s projections of profits and

internal funds for this year have been trimmed.  Faced with less ample internal funds 

and also heavier funding needs associated with mergers and acquisitions and equity



11

paydowns, businesses are expected to tap credit markets more intensively.

Nonfinancial business debt growth is now projected at 5½ percent this year, up about

¾ percentage point since the January Greenbook.  Although household debt is

expected to decelerate over the forecast horizon, the forecast for household borrowing

has also been revised up significantly since the last round, primarily on a much stronger

outlook for home price appreciation and the attendant impetus to mortgage

borrowing.  The outlook for federal borrowing is about the same as in the last round. 

A sizable fiscal deficit implies growth in federal debt at about a 12¼ percent pace this

year.  Federal debt growth is projected to slow in 2005 with the anticipated expiration

of investment tax incentives at the end of this year and as tax receipts pick up as the

economy expands.  On balance, total domestic nonfinancial debt growth–projected at

8 percent in 2004 and 7 percent in 2005–exceeds that of nominal GDP in each year by

about 2 percentage points.

Directive and Balance-of-Risks Language

(16) Should the Committee wish to follow the same procedure as at the

January meeting, it could vote on the directive and on the language of the assessment

of risks.  Draft language with a range of options for the assessment of risks consistent

with those described in Table 1 is provided below.

(1) Directive Wording

The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and financial conditions

that will foster price stability and promote sustainable growth in output.  To further its

long-run objectives, the Committee in the immediate future seeks conditions in reserve

markets consistent with maintaining/INCREASING/REDUCING the federal funds

rate at/TO an average of around _______ 1 percent.



12

(2) Risk Assessments

(A)  The Committee perceives that the upside and downside risks to the

attainment of sustainable growth for the next few quarters are roughly

equal.  The probability, though minor, of an unwelcome fall in inflation

has diminished in recent months but likely exceeds that of a rise in

inflation.  With inflation quite low and resource use slack, the Committee

believes that it can be patient in removing its policy accommodation.

(B)  The Committee perceives that the upside and downside risks to the

attainment of sustainable growth for the next few quarters are roughly

equal.  The probability of an unwelcome fall in inflation has diminished in

recent months and now appears almost equal to that of a rise in inflation. 

With inflation quite low and resource use slack, the Committee believes

that it can be patient in removing its policy accommodation.

(C)  The Committee perceives that the upside and downside risks to the

attainment of sustainable growth for the next few quarters are roughly

equal.  The probability of a rise in inflation about equals that of an

unwelcome decline in inflation.  The Committee recognizes that the

stance of monetary policy has been quite accommodative for some time. 

Nonetheless, with inflation low and resource use slack, the Committee

believes that it can still be patient in removing its policy accommodation.
