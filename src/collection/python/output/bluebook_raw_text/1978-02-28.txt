The attached document represents the most complete and accurate version 
available based on original copies culled from the files of the FOMC Secretariat at the 
Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System.  This electronic document was 
created through a comprehensive digitization process which included identifying the best-
preserved paper copies, scanning those copies,1 and then making the scanned versions 
text-searchable.2  Though a stringent quality assurance process was employed, some 
imperfections may remain. 
 

Please note that this document may contain occasional gaps in the text.  These

1 In some cases, original copies needed to be photocopied before being scanned into electronic format.  All 
scanned images were deskewed (to remove the effects of printer- and scanner-introduced tilting) and lightly 
cleaned (to remove dark spots caused by staple holes, hole punches, and other blemishes caused after initial 
printing). 
2 A two-step process was used.  An advanced optimal character recognition computer program (OCR) first 
created electronic text from the document image.  Where the OCR results were inconclusive, staff checked

Recent Developments

(1) M-1 increased at a 7-1/4 per cent annual rate in January,

but it appears to be declining at a 1/2 per cent rate in February. Thus,

growth over January and February combined is projected at around a 3-1/2

per cent annual rate, in the lower half of the FOMC's range. M-2 appears

to be expanding at a 6-1/2 per cent annual rate over the January-February

period, close to the mid-point of its range. Renewed expansion in savings

and small denomination time deposits at banks and a continued rise in

large denomination time deposits included in M-2 helped to maintain growth

in this aggregate in January.1/ At thrift institutions, on the other hand,

1/ Much of the January growth in savings and small denomination time
deposits at banks occurred early in the month, and appears to reflect
inadequate seasonal adjustment for interest crediting. After early
January, such flows were considerably weaker.



deposit inflows slowed further in January and seem to be continuing

at a reduced pace in February. Over January and February, nonborrowed

reserves are expected to increase at a 17 per cent annual rate,

largely reflecting the surge in demand deposits around the turn of the

year and a rise in excess reserves possibly associated with difficulties

in reserve management due to severe weather.

(2) With incoming data indicating that the monetary aggregates

were growing at rates well within the Committee's ranges, the Account Manage-

ment has continued to seek a Federal funds rate of around 6¾ per cent

since the January FOMC meeting. Under these circumstances, short-term

interest rates generally have changed little on balance since mid-January

despite relatively strong short-term credit demands. The Treasury

has begun to raise new cash in its weekly auctions of 3- and 6-month

bills, and short-term borrowing by businesses continued sizable

in recent weeks. Bank loans to businesses accelerated substantially

in January and early February, more than offsetting a decline in commercial

paper issuance by nonfinancial corporations.

(4) In long-term credit markets, public bond offerings by

corporations over the intermeeting period were modest, and rates on

corporate bonds have changed little on balance since mid-January. At

the same time, municipal bond yields have fallen somewhat, as demands

for tax-exempt securities have continued to be quite strong. Mortgage

interest rates in both primary and secondary markets, on the other hand,

have edged upward further, reflecting pressures on fund availability

resulting from the slowing of deposit inflows to thrift institutions.



(5) Yields on Treasury coupon securities also have risen

slightly since mid-January. Both the Treasury and Federally-sponsored

agencies have been substantial net borrowers over this period. The

Federal Home Loan Bank System, for example, raised $1.4 billion of new

cash in conjunction with its February refinancing, to meet a growing

demand for advances from member institutions. The Treasury borrowed

about $6 billion of cash through regular issues of 2- and 4-year notes

since the last FOMC meeting, and obtained an additional $2 billion in

its regular mid-quarter refunding of $5 billion of maturing issues.1/

Noncompetitive tenders in the refunding auctions came to $2 billion,

about $1 billion above the total in the November refunding. In the

weeks following the auctions, the new issues have traded below their

average auction prices.

(6) The table on the following page shows (in terms of

percentage annual rates of change) related monetary and financial flows

over various time periods.

1/ In that refinancing, the Treasury sold $2¾ billion of 39-month
notes at an average yield of 7.59 per cent, $3 billion of 7-year,
8 per cent notes at an average yield of 7.88 per cent, and $1
billion of reopened 27-year 8¼ per cent bonds at an average yield
of 8.23 per cent.

Prospective developments

(7) Shown below for Committee consideration are three

alternative longer-run growth ranges for the monetary aggregates

over the QIV '77-QIV '78 period, along with the ranges currently

in place.

Alt. A Alt. B Alt. C Current

M-1 4 to 7 4 to 6½ 4 to 6 4 to 6½

M-2 7 to 9½ 6½ to 9 6 to 8½ 6½ to 9

M-3 7½ to 10 7 to 9½ 6½ to 9 8 to 10½

Bank credit 8 to 11 7½ to 10½ 7 to 10 7 to 10

(8) Alternative B continues the ranges for M-1 and M-2

that were adopted by the Committee in October for the QIII '77-QIII '78

period. Alternatives A and C represent, respectively, somewhat more and

somewhat less expansive policy alternatives. Under all three

alternatives, the M-3 growth range is projected to be lower than

the current range for this aggregate. Since around year end, net

inflows of deposits to thrift institutions have persisted at a rate

considerably lower than previously anticipated, and, as a result, the

staff has reduced its projections of such inflows over the year ahead.

(9) Each of the alternatives presupposes an upward adjustment

in deposit ceiling rates at banks and thrift institutions of 50 basis

points on small-denomination time deposits; the adjustments in ceiling

rates are assumed to occur in April under alternative C, in May under

B, and in June under A. Without such adjustments, the increase in



market rates thought necessary to restrain M-1 growth to the mid-point

of the indicated ranges would lead to growth in M-2 and M-3 near

the lower ends of the ranges shown.1/

(10) The table below provides perspective on the relation-

ship among growth rates proposed for the QIV '77 to QIV '78 period

and the implied growth rates for more extended periods ending in

2/
QIV '78. It shows, for instance, that growth in M-1 at around the

5¼ per cent mid-point of the proposed alternative B range would lead

to a 5.6 per cent annual rate of expansion over the 15-month period

starting with QIII '77 and to a 6.3 per cent annual rate of growth

over the 18-month period beginning with QII '77--in both cases within

the current FOMC range but above the mid-point. The higher growth

rates over these longer periods reflect the sizable overshoot in

M-1 growth in the third quarter of last year and the more moderate

overshoot in the fourth quarter. M-1 growth at around the 5 per cent

mid-point of the proposed alternative C range would nearly compensate

for the slight fourth quarter overshoot but not for the larger third

quarter overshoot.

1/ AppendixIII shows projections of the interest-bearing components
of M-2 and M-3, as well as for the aggregates themselves, with
and without an adjustment in ceiling rates.

2/ Implied growth rates for even more extended periods are included
in the growth triangles in Appendix IV.

-10-

(12) A Federal funds rate centered on the recently prevailing

level of 6-3/4 per cent, as contemplated under alternative B, is likely

to be associated with M-1 growth over February-March in a 1 to 6 per cent

annual rate range. The February weakness in M-l, following several months

of strong growth, is thought by the staff to be transitory. Money growth

in March is expected to rebound to a little over a 7 per cent annual rate--

mainly because of the increase in transactions demands associated with the

projected strengthening of economic activity following the recent weather-

induced slowdown. The expected rebound in M-1 also reflects in some

degree projections indicating that the volume of tax refunds to individuals

will be large relative to other recent years.

(13) The February-March growth rate of M-1 shown under alterna-

tive B implies a first quarter expansion of about 4-3/4 per cent, annual

rate, well within the Committee's 4 to 6-1/2 per cent longer-run range.

However, the staff anticipates that further increases in market interest

rates will be required in order to constrain M-1 growth over the one-

year QIV '77 - QIV '78 period to the mid-point of that range. Even

though the staff has reduced its projection of economic growth this year,

nominal GNP is still expected to increase at an 11-1/4 per cent rate over

the QIV '77 - QIV '78 period, leading to relatively strong money demand.

In addition, the restraining impact on money demand from the relatively

sharp 1-3/4 percentage point increase in short-term interest rates that

took place between the spring and fall of last year will be exhausted

relatively soon; since October short-rates have risen only about another



-11-

1/4 percentage point. Even assuming some further moderate downward shift

in money demand relative to income, the Federal funds rate would probably

have to begin rising again in April and reach 8 per cent by fall in order

to constrain M-1 growth for the QIV '77-QIV '78 period to the mid-point

of the 4 to 6-1/2 per cent alternative B range.1/

(14) Growth in M-2 over the February-March period is likely

to be in a 4-1/2 to 8-1/2 per cent annual rate range under alternative B.

With market yields above the ceiling rates on savings deposits and all

maturities of small denomination time deposits at commercial banks,

inflows of such deposits are likely to remain modest in February-March.

However, growth in large denomination time deposits included in M-2 are

expected to continue to offset slow growth of deposits subject to Regu-

lation Q ceiling as banks aggressively seek funds to finance credit

demands.

(15) At thrift institutions the relatively attractive yields

available in the market for shorter-term investments have slowed total

deposit inflows so far in 1978, although ceiling rates on the longest-

term deposits are still somewhat above those on market instruments.

With no further increase in short-term interest rates, growth in deposits

at thrift institutions can be expected to remain modest in the near-term.

Consequently, S&L's are likely to limit their new commitment activity

and also--in financing takedowns of their record level of outstanding

commitments--to reduce their own liquidity and further increase borrowing

1/ See Appendix I. The implied increases in the velocity of M-1 and M-2
over 1978 are shown in Appendix II.



-12-

from FHL Banks. Although thrift deposit inflows are expected to rise

from their depressed first quarter pace if ceiling rates are raised in

the spring (as we are assuming), inflows will probably remain considerably

below the strong pace of expansion of 1977.

(16) With the Federal funds rate remaining near its present

6-3/4 per cent level, as envisioned under alternative B, interest rates

generally are likely to fluctuate within a relatively narrow range over

the intermeeting period. A little upward rate pressure might develop in

short-term credit markets; the Treasury is expected to raise $10 billion

of new money in the bill market prior to the March and April tax dates,

and depository institutions are likely to continue liquidating shorter-

term Treasury issues to meet loan demands. However, intermediate- and

long-term market rates might decline a bit in the weeks immediately ahead.

Treasury demands in these maturity ranges are not likely to be unusually

large. In addition, the pace of new offerings by corporations and State

and local governments is expected to remain moderate, while the institu-

tional demand for bonds is likely to continue to be quite strong. Both

primary and secondary mortgage rates will probably continue to be under

upward pressure, given the slowing of deposit growth at the thrift

institutions.

(17) Over the longer-run both short- and long-term interest

rates are likely to rise. Given the strength that is projected in

economic activity, rate pressures may become evident in spring and summer

as a result of expanding private credit demands and Federal Reserve efforts



-13-

to restrain money growth. Further increases in short- and intermediate-

term rates will be accompanied by reduced liquid asset holdings of

depository institutions, by increased commercial bank offerings of

large denomination time deposits, and by stepped up borrowing demands

of Federal housing agencies. The increases in short- and intermediate-

term rates will probably be transmitted to some extent to long-term

markets. However, as in 1977, such increases will be limited by the

continued high cash flows of insurance companies and pension funds.

(18) Under alternative C the Federal funds rate would rise

over the intermeeting period to the mid-point of a 7 to 7-1/2 per cent

range, and the February-March annual rate of growth of M-1 and M-2 would

likely be in 1/2 to 5-1/2 and 4 to 8 per cent annual rate ranges, respec-

tively. The 3-month Treasury bill rate would probably rise to about 7

per cent by mid-March, with commensurate adjustments in other short rates.

Member bank borrowings could be expected to rise sharply once again,

increasing pressures for a discount rate increase. At the same time,

the rise in short-term interest rates associated with this alternative

would tend to strengthen the dollar on international exchange markets.

(19) The tightening of money market conditions contemplated

under alternative C would further slow the net inflow of deposits sub-

ject to rate ceilings in the weeks immediately ahead and thus would

increase the need for an adjustment in deposit ceiling rates. Lending

policies of banks and thrift institutions would become more restrictive.

There would be increased pressure on Government support programs in the



-14-

mortgage area. The Home Loan Bank System would be expected to turn more

and more to the market to raise cash to support advances to savings and

loan associations, and mortgage bankers would increase takedowns of

existing FNMA commitments while also aggressively seeking new commit-

ments. In such an environment, the increase in short-term rates would

probably be rather promptly transmitted to the intermediate- and long-

term sectors of the market, where Government security dealers still have

a long position of moderate size in Treasury coupon issues.

(20) The near-term increase in interest rates under alterna-

tive C would work toward a reduction in growth of the aggregates over

the longer run. However, given the projected strength of money demand,

a further increase in interest rates would be required in order to limit

M-1 expansion to the mid-point of the 4 to 6 per cent alternative C range

over the QIV '77-QIV '78 period. The staff would expect the funds rate

under this alternative to average 7-3/4 per cent in the second quarter

and to rise to 8-1/4 per cent by fall.

(21) Alternative A involves a reduction in the Federal funds

rate over the intermeeting period to the 6-1/2 per cent mid-point of a

6 to 6-1/2 per cent range. Such an action would be accompanied by a

reversal of the early January rise in short-term interest rates. Long-

term rates, on the other hand, might not retrace all of their recent

increases if, as appears likely at the moment, market participants con-

cluded that the decline in short-term rates was likely to be temporary.

Meanwhile, the dollar would probably tend to soften in international

exchange markets.



-15-

(22) The approach of alternative A appears most consistent

with a monetary policy that encourages more rapid growth in the monetary

aggregates over the longer-run than under either alternatives B or C.

Nevertheless, given the strength projected for economic activity, the

near-term decline in the funds rate under A would probably soon have to

be reversed to restrain growth in the aggregates to rates consistent

with the mid-points of longer-run ranges for alternative A. The funds

rate would have to begin rising again in the second quarter and might

reach a high for the year of about 7-3/4 per cent by fall.



-16-

Directive language

(23) Given below are alternatives for the operational

paragraphs of the directive. The first formulation places main

emphasis on near-term rates of growth in monetary aggregates. The

second formulation, like the directive adopted at the last meeting,

places main emphasis on money market conditions; it shows--in strike-

through form--the specifications adopted at the last meeting. As

suggested below, the particular language needed in the opening lines

of the money market formulation would depend on the specific conditions

sought; the three alternatives shown--calling, respectively, for

somewhat easier, prevailing, and somewhat firmer money market condi-

tions--are intended to be associated with the specifications discussed

in the preceding section under alternatives A, B, and C.

"Monetary Aggregates" Formulation

The Committee seeks to encourage near-term rates of growth

in M-1 and M-2 on a path believed to be reasonably consistent

with the longer-run ranges for monetary aggregates cited in the

preceding paragraph. Specifically, at present, it expects the

annual growth rates over the February-March period to be within

the ranges of ____ to ____ per cent for M-1 and ____ to ____

per cent for M-2. In the judgment of the Committee such growth

rates are likely to be associated with a weekly-average Federal

funds rate of about ____ per cent. If, giving approximately

equal weight to M-1 and M-2, it appears that growth rates over



-17-

the 2-month period will deviate significantly from the mid-points

of the indicated ranges, the operational objective for the

Federal funds rate shall be modified in an orderly fashion within

a range for ____ to ____ per cent. In the conduct of day-to-day

operations, account shall be taken of emerging financial market

conditions, including the unsettled conditions in foreign exchange

markets.

If it appears during the period before the next meeting that

the operating constraints specified above are proving to be

significantly inconsistent, the Manager is promptly to notify the

Chairman who will then decide whether the situation calls for

supplementary instructions from the Committee.

"Money Market" Formulation

At this time, the Committee seeks to maintain about the

prevailing money market conditions (OR TO ACHIEVE SOMEWHAT EASIER

OR SOMEWHAT FIRMER MONEY MARKET CONDITIONS) during the period

immediately ahead, provided that monetary aggregates appear to

be growing at approximately the rates currently expected, which

are believed to be on a path reasonably consistent with the

longer-run ranges for monetary aggregates cited in the preceding

paragraph. Specifically, the Committee seeks to maintain the

weekly-average Federal funds rate at about [DEL: the current level]

____ per cent, so long as M-1 and M-2 appear to be growing over

the [DEL: January-February] FEBRUARY-MARCH period at annual rates within



-18-

ranges of [DEL: 2½ to 7½] ____ TO ____ per cent and [DEL: 5-to-9] ____ TO

____ per cent, respectively. If giving approximately equal

weight to M-1 and M-2, it appears that growth rates over the

2-month period are approaching or moving beyond the limits of

the indicated ranges, the operational objective for the weekly-

average Federal funds rate shall be modified in an orderly

fashion within a range of [DEL: 6½ 10 7] ____ TO ____ per cent. In

the conduct of day-to-day operations, account shall be taken

of emerging financial market conditions, including the unsettled

conditions in foreign exchange markets.

If it appears during the period before the next meeting that

the operating constraints specified above are proving to be

significantly inconsistent, the Manager is promptly to notify

the Chairman who will then decide whether the situation calls

for supplementary instructions from the Committee.
