MONETARY POLICY ALTERNATIVES  

Recent Developments 

Summary 

(1) After showing some signs of improvement in late September and October, 

conditions in financial markets worsened over the intermeeting period.  Despite 

economic data releases that were on balance only slightly weaker than expected, 

Treasury yields and the expected path for the federal funds rate fell sharply amid 

reports of sizable losses at several large financial institutions and increased concerns 

over the economic outlook.  Short-term Treasury instruments benefited from flight-

to-quality flows as investors reduced their exposure to risky assets.  Heightened 

worries about counterparty risk, as well as the effects of balance sheet constraints and  

liquidity pressures, affected interbank funding markets and commercial paper markets, 

where spreads over risk-free rates rose to levels that were, in some cases, higher than 

those seen in August.  Strains in those markets were no doubt exacerbated by 

concerns related to year-end pressures.  In longer-term corporate markets, both 

investment- and speculative-grade credit spreads widened considerably; issuance 

slowed but remained strong.  Equity prices declined, on net, with financial stocks 

especially hard hit.  In housing finance, subprime mortgage markets stayed virtually 

shut and spreads on jumbo loans apparently widened a good bit further.  Spreads on 

conforming products also increased, following reports of sizable losses and 

consequent reduced capital ratios at the housing GSEs.   

Monetary Policy Expectations and Treasury Yields 

(2)  The FOMC’s decision at its October meeting to reduce the target federal 

funds rate by 25 basis points to 4½ percent was largely expected by market 



   

participants, although the assessment that upside risks to inflation balanced the 

downside risks to growth was not fully anticipated and apparently led investors to 

revise up slightly the expected path for policy.1  The release of the FOMC minutes, 

including the summary of economic projections, elicited only a modest market 

reaction.  Similarly, data releases—which apparently came in, on balance, only slightly 

weaker than investors expected—left policy expectations little changed on net.  

However, concerns about the potential adverse effects on credit availability and 

economic growth of sizable losses at large financial institutions and of financial 

market strains in general pushed the expected path of policy down substantially.  

Market participants have priced in a total of about 150 basis points of policy easing by 

early 2009 (Chart 1), about 80 basis points more than at the time of the October 

meeting.  Judging from quotes on federal funds target binary options, investors are 

virtually certain of a rate cut at the upcoming FOMC meeting, and assign about 

60 percent probability to a quarter-point cut and 35 percent probability to a half-point 

easing.  Respondents to the Desk’s recent survey of primary dealers also anticipated 

easing, but placed lower odds on a 50 basis point cut than suggested by market 

                                           
1 The effective federal funds rate averaged 4.50 percent over the intermeeting period, but the 
rate was again more volatile than usual.  The intraday standard deviation over the period 
averaged 25 basis points, significantly higher than was typical before August, and the root 
mean squared deviation of the daily effective rate from the target was likewise elevated.  U.S. 
branches and agencies of foreign banks continued to exhibit fairly strong demand for federal 
funds, especially in the morning.  Once these institutions locked in their daily funding, 
federal funds tended to trade lower to varying degrees over the afternoon.  As a 
consequence, judging the appropriate amount of reserves to provide to the market was more 
difficult than usual.  Over the period, the volume of long-term RPs increased by $8 billion 
dollars to $20 billion, reflecting an $8 billion 43-day repurchase agreement that was 
conducted on November 28 and crosses year-end.  The Desk announced that the operation 
was the first of several intended to help satisfy term funding needs and that the Desk 
planned to provide sufficient liquidity to resist upward pressure on the funds rate around 
year-end.  The Desk did not purchase any securities outright, but on December 6 redeemed 
$5 billion in Treasury bills and boosted the level of short-term repos outstanding.  This shift 
was designed to provide greater flexibility to reduce the level of balances in the event of 
significant borrowing from the discount window.

quotes.  Most respondents predicted that the Committee will put more emphasis on 

downside risks to growth than in the October statement.  In addition, some dealers 

expect that the spread of the primary credit rate over the target funds rate will be 

narrowed.  Uncertainty about the path for policy increased slightly, on net, from its 

already high levels, and the option-implied distribution of the federal funds rate six 

months ahead retained a substantial skew to the downside. 

(3) Yields on two-year nominal Treasury securities fell about 80 basis points, on 

net, over the intermeeting period, about in line with the revision to policy 

expectations.  Ten-year Treasury yields dropped about 30 basis points.  The 

steepening of the yield curve owed mostly to sharply lower short- and intermediate-

term forward rates, consistent with investors’ apparently more pessimistic outlook for 

economic growth.  TIPS yields fell by less than their nominal counterparts, implying 

modest declines in inflation compensation at both the five-year and longer horizons.   

Money Markets 

(4) After showing signs of improvement between the September and October 

FOMC meetings, conditions in money markets subsequently worsened, with the 

deterioration reflected partly in large premiums for funding over year-end.  (See box 

“Flight-to-Quality Flows and Year-end Pressures.”)  Large financial institutions 

reported an additional $35 billion in losses over the intermeeting period, and investors 

appear concerned that even more writedowns may be forthcoming.  Term bank 

funding markets came under considerable pressure, and spreads of term libor and 

federal funds rates over those on comparable-maturity overnight index swaps widened 

sharply and now exceed their September peaks.  Conditions in European interbank 

money markets also deteriorated over the intermeeting period, as term spreads 

expanded by about 30 basis points in euro markets and in sterling markets.  In the 

United States, outstanding asset-backed commercial paper (ABCP) continued to

-  
Flight-to-Quality Flows and Year-end Pressures  

Substantial actual and anticipated losses at financial firms increased 
pressures on institutions’ liquidity and balance sheet capacity and 
boosted investors’ concerns about counterparty credit risk over the 
intermeeting period.  These developments contributed to renewed 
flight-to-quality flows and, in money markets, generated year-end 
pressures which have largely been absent in recent years.  Investors 
have apparently shifted their demand toward safe securities such as 
Treasury bills and away from risky assets such as uncollateralized 
loans to banks.  Despite an increased supply of bills in November, 
bill yields have declined sharply over recent weeks amid heavy 
inflows to money market mutual funds that hold only Treasury and 
agency securities.  The spread of the three-month overnight indexed 
swap (OIS) rate over the comparable-maturity Treasury bill yield―a 
plausible proxy for safe-haven demands―climbed about 50 basis 
points over the intermeeting period, though it remained below the 
peak reached in August.  Meanwhile, the spread of three-month libor 
over the corresponding OIS rate―a measure of term premiums in 
short-term funding markets―widened about 60 basis points to its 
highest level during the recent period of financial market turmoil.  
Some tiering was evident in uncollateralized funding markets:  
Domestic and large European institutions were able to borrow at 
rates close to the libor fixing, but smaller European institutions faced 
a substantial premium.  

While forward rates suggest that concerns about counterparty credit 
risk are expected to persist well into next year, market stress is 
particularly acute in rates that span the turn of the year.  The one-
week forward Treasury bill yield that encompasses the year-turn has 
fallen to around 1 percent, apparently reflecting financial institutions’ 
desire to show more of the safest assets on their year-end books.  
Markets expect the provision of liquidity by the Desk to be generous 
over year-end:  A comparison of futures on the effective federal 
funds rate to quotes on target funds rate options implies that 
investors expect federal funds to trade about 100 basis points below 
the target on the last day of the year.  Nevertheless, pressures on 
banks’ balance sheets and concerns about liquidity and counterparty 
credit risk have made financial institutions reluctant to lend over 
year-end and have fueled precautionary demand for such funding.  
As a result, the spread of one-month libor over the corresponding 
OIS rate jumped nearly 50 basis points as the maturity date on a one-
month deposit crossed into the new year.  The implied premium for 
funding on the last day of the year is about 700 basis points at an 
annual rate―a level that is extremely high by the standards of recent 
years, though still a little below that reached in the runup to Y2K.  
One-month libor is now 24 basis points above the primary credit 
rate, yet term borrowing at the discount window remains limited, 
likely owing in part to perceived stigma of using the primary credit 
facility.  Significant year-end pressures can be observed in the 
commercial paper market as well.

contract in November (Chart 2), and spreads of ABCP yields over those on 

comparable unsecured CP widened considerably.  In the unsecured sector, spreads on 

lower-rated thirty-day paper also increased substantially, particularly as the term 

extended over year-end, but overnight spreads widened only modestly.  The shares of 

unsecured CP and ABCP issued over year-end are about in line with their year-ago 

levels.  The outstanding amount of European asset-backed commercial paper 

declined, as some money market funds reportedly scaled back holdings of ABCP in 

advance of year-end.   

(5) Money market mutual funds experienced heavy inflows over the 

intermeeting period, reflecting in part safe-haven demands.  Inflows were directed 

primarily toward funds that invest only in Treasury and agency obligations, 

contributing to a sharp fall in Treasury bill rates.  Similarly, strong demand for 

Treasury collateral drove the overnight Treasury general collateral repo rate well 

below the federal funds rate.  Lending from the SOMA securities portfolio has 

increased in recent weeks, and the Desk relaxed some limits on the securities lending 

program in response to the reduced liquidity in Treasury markets.2 

Capital Markets 

(6) Yields on investment-grade corporate bonds edged up over the intermeeting 

period, while those on speculative-grade bonds increased appreciably.  As a result, 

spreads on both investment- and speculative-grade bonds over comparable-maturity 

Treasury securities rose markedly and are now at their highest levels in several years.  

                                           
2 On November 26, the Desk announced some modest, temporary changes to the Securities 
Lending Program.  Individual dealers are now limited to 25 percent of the total amount of 
any particular security available for borrowing with a maximum of $750 million per issue, up 
from 20 percent and $500 million, respectively; the supply available for borrowing has been 
increased from 65 to 90 percent of the SOMA’s holdings of an individual issue; and all 
securities with maturity greater than six days are eligible for borrowing versus the previous 
limit of securities maturing in greater than thirteen days.

The higher spreads appear to reflect both a reassessment of the credit quality of 

nonfinancial corporations, perhaps induced by concerns about prospects for the 

economic expansion, and an increase in investors’ risk aversion.  Bond issuance 

slowed in November but remained strong.  In the leveraged loan market, the pipeline 

of underwritten loans awaiting syndication diminished early in the period but is still 

substantial.  Secondary market bid prices for leveraged loans dropped significantly in 

November and are now below their levels in early August.  An index of credit default 

swaps on leveraged syndicated loans (the LCDX) rose about 40 basis points, on net, 

over the intermeeting period.  Broad-based equity indexes were volatile and ended the 

period down 1½ to 2 percent.  Financial stocks were especially hard hit, dropping 

about 5 percent.  The spread between the twelve-month forward trend-earnings-price 

ratio for S&P 500 firms and a real long-run Treasury yield—a rough measure of the 

equity premium—widened, consistent with investors pulling back from risk.  Option-

implied volatility on the S&P 500 remained elevated, at times rising back to near its 

August peaks.  Yield ratios for the municipal bonds moved up sharply on investor 

concerns about the financial health of bond insurers and possibly the fiscal outlooks 

for state and local governments. 

(7) Credit availability for jumbo-mortgage borrowers continued to be tight, and 

the spread between the offer rates on prime jumbo fixed-rate mortgages and 

comparable conforming loans rose from already high levels.  Rates on conforming 

mortgages fell, although not as much as yields on comparable-maturity Treasury 

securities, implying a widening of spreads.  Issuance of residential mortgage-backed 

securities (RMBS) backed by nonconforming loans continued to fall, while issuance of 

those backed by conforming mortgages was robust.  Secondary markets for non-

agency RMBS remained largely inactive.  ABX spreads for most tranches widened 

further for most of the intermeeting period, as investor confidence in subprime 

RMBS and associated credit ratings continued to wane.  However, ABX spreads 

Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) 8 of 43



   

dropped sharply late in the period amid reports that a plan to freeze rates on some 

subprime mortgages was close to agreement.  Spreads on agency MBS rose sharply 

after Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac announced large third-quarter losses, raising 

concerns about their ability to offer refinancing options to some subprime borrowers.  

Subsequently, these spreads retraced a substantial part of the increase.  (See box 

“Recent Developments at Housing Intermediaries.”)   

Market Functioning 

(8) In addition to the short-term funding impairments noted earlier, trading 

conditions were strained in a range of markets over the intermeeting period.  

Functioning in the Treasury bill market was notably impaired at times, and bid-asked 

spreads on bills generally remained very wide.  Bid-asked spreads widened 

substantially less for Treasury coupon securities, and while investors were willing to 

pay significant premiums to hold on-the-run securities, overall liquidity remained 

ample in that market.  Liquidity was somewhat diminished in corporate markets:  

Trading volumes declined significantly in November, a proxy for bid-asked spreads 

on corporate bonds widened, and trades appeared to have a larger-than-normal 

impact on prices.  Bid-asked spreads for leveraged syndicated loans rose quite sharply 

over the intermeeting period but remained below the peaks reached in early August.  

Judging from the abnormally wide range of quotes submitted by various dealers for 

the same reference entities, liquidity and price discovery were also impaired in CDS 

markets, especially for financial institutions.  The subprime RMBS market remained 

shut with virtually no trading taking place.  Strains were also evident at times in the 

market for agency MBS, where bid-asked spreads widened noticeably following the 

reports of large losses by the housing GSEs before retracing part of that move more 

recently.  That market may also have been affected by year-end pressures as some 

investors are reportedly reluctant to hold mortgage products in their portfolios at the 

Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) 9 of 43



  
Recent Developments at Housing Intermediaries 

Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac reported third-quarter losses of $1.4 billion and $2 billion, 
respectively, over the intermeeting period, reflecting in part an increase in actual and projected 
credit losses on the mortgages they guarantee or hold.  On the news, credit default swap (CDS) 
spreads on the two agencies spiked and spreads on Fannie’s and Freddie’s MBS also rose 
sharply, albeit against a backdrop of heavy issuance.  Both CDS and MBS spreads later retraced 
a substantial portion of their increases as market sentiment was improved, in part, by news that 
Freddie Mac was able to raise $6 billion in fresh capital and reports of an industry agreement to 
delay by several years the reset of interest rates on certain subprime mortgages.  Fannie Mae also 
began the process of raising capital this week, and investor interest was reportedly high.  While it 
is improbable that all of the recent increase in MBS spreads will be passed on to borrowers, 
particularly because part of the increase may prove transitory, conforming borrowers may face 
higher spreads of mortgage rates over Treasuries in the future than in recent years.  Potentially 
adding further to the cost of mortgage credit is the fact that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac have 
increased the fees they charge to guarantee mortgages pooled into agency MBS.  That rise likely 
reflects waning competition from other securitizers as well as increased actual and projected 
credit losses.  The GSEs also appear to have imposed sizable additional fees on a variety of 
riskier loans, such as those with loan-to-value ratios greater than 70 percent extended to 
borrowers with lower credit scores.   

Other large mortgage lenders were subject to even stronger market pressures over the 
intermeeting period.  For example, CDS spreads on Countrywide Financial Corporation spiked 
to very high levels—near 1000 basis points—as investors became concerned about the ability of 
the thrift to fund its operations and about its overall solvency.  Countrywide had borrowed in 
excess of $50 billion from the Federal Home Loan Bank of Atlanta by the end of the third 
quarter, putting it close to the limit of 50 percent of borrower assets beyond which Home Loan 
Banks are typically very reluctant to lend to their members.  CDS and debt spreads on the Home 
Loan Banks also spiked, as investors reportedly became uncomfortable with the concentration 
of their lending to a few large borrowers (especially Countrywide and Washington Mutual).  A 
higher cost of Home Loan Bank debt has the potential to translate into higher funding costs for 
their borrowers.

close of their fiscal year.  The FX swap market remained strained; bid-asked spreads 

continued to be larger than usual, the average size of trades diminished, and the 

capacity for market-making was impaired as some major market makers dropped out. 

Foreign Developments 

(9) Concerns about financial fragility and its potential impacts on economic 

growth appeared to affect many foreign financial markets during the intermeeting 

period.  Headline stock price indexes dropped 3 to 5 percent in Europe, Canada, and 

Japan, on net, with financial stocks registering especially large declines in many cases 

(Chart 3).  Stock prices also fell sharply in many emerging market economies; in China 

share prices dropped more than 15 percent, reacting in part to reports that additional 

steps may be taken to cool the domestic economy.  Consistent with a pullback by 

investors from risky positions, yields on long-term government securities in industrial 

countries fell 10 to 40 basis points, while EMBI+ spreads on sovereign bonds of 

major emerging market economies widened noticeably.  The trade-weighted foreign 

exchange value of the dollar against major currencies moved up about 1¼ percent, on 

balance, over the intermeeting period.3  The dollar rose more than 6½ percent against 

the Canadian dollar on signs of slower growth in Canada; on December 4, the Bank 

of Canada announced a 25 basis point cut in its target for the overnight interest rate, 

citing lower inflation and concerns that effects on Canada from the U.S. sub-prime 

crisis will last longer than previously thought.  The dollar gained about 2½ percent 

versus the pound; late in the period, the Bank of England also lowered its target 

policy rate 25 basis points.  In contrast, the dollar declined 3¾ percent and 

1¼ percent against the yen and euro, respectively, while rising more than 6 percent 

versus the Australian dollar, as carry trade positions were reported to have been 

unwound in reaction to heightened financial uncertainties.  The index of the dollar’s

value versus currencies of other important trading partners was about unchanged over 

the period.  

Debt and Money 

(10) Domestic nonfinancial sector debt is estimated to be increasing at an annual 

rate of about 7 percent in the current quarter, almost 2 percentage points less than in 

the third quarter (Chart 4).  The growth of nonfinancial business debt has slowed a bit 

but remains strong on robust bond issuance and a small rebound in commercial 

paper.  Growth in C&I lending also remained rapid, as some previously committed 

large syndicated loan deals reportedly were taken onto banks’ balance sheets.  

Household mortgage debt growth is expected to slow this quarter, reflecting the 

weakness in home prices, declining home sales, and tighter credit conditions for some 

borrowers.  Consumer credit appears to be expanding at a moderate pace this quarter. 

(11) M2 advanced at an annual rate of about 5 percent in November.  While 

liquid deposits continued to grow slowly, heightened demand for safety and liquidity 

appears to have boosted retail money market mutual funds.  Small time deposits 

continued to expand, evidently owing in part to high rates offered by some depository 

institutions to attract retail deposits.  Currency was about flat in November, probably 

owing at least in part to an ongoing shift by some overseas investors from holding 

dollars to holding other currencies.

Economic Outlook through 2009 

(12) In response to more restrictive financial conditions, higher oil prices, and 

weaker-than-expected economic data, the staff has marked down its outlook for the 

growth of aggregate demand and lowered its assumption for the path of the federal 

funds rate.  The Committee is now assumed to reduce the target rate 25 basis points 

at the December meeting and then another 25 basis points to 4 percent in the middle 

of 2009, leaving the federal funds rate 75 basis points lower at the end of the forecast 

period than in the October Greenbook.  Even so, the staff expects longer-term 

Treasury yields to reverse much of their recent declines as investors’ expectations for 

sharper reductions in the federal funds rate move into alignment with the staff’s 

assumption for monetary policy.  As usual, stock prices are anticipated to rise at a 

6½ percent annual rate.  The real foreign exchange value of the dollar is assumed to 

depreciate about 1½ percent per year.  The price of crude oil is expected to decline 

gradually but remain above the path in the October Greenbook.  Against this 

backdrop, the pace of economic expansion is projected to slow from about 

2½ percent in the second half of 2007 to 1 percent over the first half of 2008 as the 

housing correction deepens, growth of consumer spending slows further, and 

business spending decelerates.  Thereafter, real GDP growth gradually picks up, 

returning to around the rate of potential GDP growth in 2009, as the decline in 

residential investment abates and the drag on spending from tighter credit conditions 

and higher energy prices wanes.  The unemployment rate edges up through the 

forecast period to 5 percent, a little above the staff’s 4¾ percent estimate of the 

NAIRU.  Boosted by the rise in oil prices in recent months, total PCE inflation climbs 

to nearly a 3½ percent rate in the current quarter but then drops to 2 percent next 

year and to about 1¾ percent in 2009 as oil prices edge down.  Core PCE inflation, 

which is projected to run about 2¼ percent in the current quarter and 2 percent for 

Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) 15 of 43



   

2007 as a whole, inches down to just below 2 percent in 2009 as pressures on 

resources ease and energy pass-through effects diminish. 

Update on Medium-Term Strategies  

(13) This section provides an update of the materials on medium-term strategies 

for monetary policy that were presented in the October Bluebook.  As shown in 

Chart 5, the Greenbook-consistent measure of short-run r*—the value that would 

close the output gap over the next twelve quarters—has shifted down nearly ¾ of a 

percentage point and now stands at about 2.2 percent, roughly 40 basis points below 

our estimate of the current real federal funds rate.  This revision reflects the extent to 

which less favorable financial conditions and higher oil prices than previously 

expected are projected to restrain aggregate demand over the next three years.  The 

three model-based estimates of short-run r* range from about 1½ to 2½ percent, an 

interval that is essentially unchanged from October.4  

(14) Chart 6 depicts optimal control simulations of the FRB/US model using  

the staff’s extension of the Greenbook forecast beyond 2009.5  In these simulations, 

policymakers place equal weights on keeping core PCE inflation close to a specified 

goal, on keeping unemployment close to the long-run NAIRU, and on avoiding 

changes in the nominal federal funds rate.6  For an inflation goal of 1½ percent  

(the left-hand set of charts), the optimal path of the funds rate averages a little less 
                                           
4 The FRB/US model estimate of short-run r* has been revised downward by about 
¾ percentage point, reflecting the model’s projection that some of the near-term weakness 
in aggregate demand will persist over the next few years.   
5 This extension incorporates the same medium-term assumptions used to generate the 
illustrative extension discussed in the October Bluebook. The characteristics of the extension 
are described in the memo to the Committee by Robert Tetlow, “The Extended Greenbook 
Forecast,” December 5, 2007. 
6  In conducting these simulations, policymakers and participants in financial markets are 
assumed to understand fully the forces shaping the economic outlook (as summarized by the 
extended Greenbook projection), whereas households and firms form their expectations 
using more limited information.

than 4¾ percent through the end of 2009 before declining gradually to a plateau of 

about 3¾ percent.  With an inflation goal of 2 percent (the right-hand set of charts),  

the optimal funds rate declines to 3¾ percent by the end of 2009 and then—as the 

effects of the current financial strains continue to unwind—gradually rises  

to 4¼ percent by the end of 2012.  Compared with the October Bluebook, these 

prescriptions are 50 to 75 basis points lower for the period to the end of 2009, 

reflecting the same factors that account for the shift in the Greenbook-consistent  

r* measure.  With either inflation goal, over the next couple of years the path of the 

unemployment rate is slightly higher than that shown in the last Bluebook and the 

path for core inflation is about ¼ percentage point higher than in October, reflecting 

in part the transitory effects of higher oil prices.  

(15) As shown in Chart 7, the outcome-based monetary policy rule prescribes a 

funds rate path that declines to 4 percent by the middle of next year and remains 

between 4 and 4½ percent throughout the forecast period, about 25 to 75 basis points 

lower than in the October Bluebook.  According to financial market quotes, investors 

anticipate that the funds rate will decline to 3¼ percent by the end of 2008 and then 

rise to about 4 percent by the end of 2012.  Compared with the previous Bluebook, 

the 70 percent confidence interval for the funds rate path is a notch lower at the end 

of 2012, suggesting a modest decline in the market’s assessment of the equilibrium 

real interest rate over the medium run, and is down as much as 50 basis points over 

the next two years.  The near-term prescriptions from the simple policy rules 

proposed by Taylor (1993, 1999) are little changed since the October Bluebook.  The 

first-difference rule—which does not require estimates of the levels of the output gap 

or the equilibrium real interest rate—generates a flat funds rate path if the inflation 

goal is 1½ percent or a 30 basis point cut by mid-2008 if the inflation goal is  

2 percent.

Short-Run Policy Alternatives 

(16) This Bluebook presents three policy alternatives for the Committee’s 

consideration, summarized in Table 1.  Alternative A lowers the target federal funds 

rate 50 basis points to 4 percent, Alternative B lowers the target 25 basis points to 

4¼ percent, and Alternative C leaves the target unchanged at 4½ percent.  In the 

rationale paragraph, all three alternatives suggest that economic growth is slowing, 

reflecting the intensification of the housing correction.  (The characterization of the 

economic situation will need to be reviewed in light of the employment report for 

November, which will be released on December 7, the day after the publication of 

this Bluebook.)  Each of the alternatives references the recent softness in indicators of 

business and consumer spending and acknowledges that strains in financial markets 

have increased since the last FOMC meeting.  The alternatives also note that the 

stance of monetary policy should promote moderate growth over time, but 

Alternatives A and C point to increased downside risks to growth.  In light of the 

leveling out of non-energy commodity prices over the intermeeting period, each 

alternative suggests that “elevated” energy and commodity prices, along with other 

factors, may put upward pressure on inflation, instead of referring to “recent increases 

in energy and commodity prices.”  The alternatives differ regarding assessments of 

risks to growth and inflation.  Alternative A characterizes the downside risks to 

growth as roughly balancing the upside risks to inflation, repeating the assessment of 

risks from the October statement.  Alternative B avoids an explicit assessment of the 

balance of risks and instead states that recent developments have increased the 

uncertainty regarding the outlook.  Alternative C concludes that the risks to growth 

are the predominant policy concern and notes that “future policy adjustments will 

depend on the outlook for both inflation and economic growth, as implied by 

incoming information.”  As usual, the Committee could combine language from 

different alternatives.

2. Economic growth was solid in the 
third quarter, and strains in financial 
markets have eased somewhat on 
balance.  However, the pace of 
economic expansion will likely slow 
in the near term, partly reflecting the 
intensification of the housing 
correction.  Today’s action, 
combined with the policy action 
taken in September, should help 
forestall some of the adverse effects 
on the broader economy that might 
otherwise arise from the disruptions 
in financial markets and promote 
moderate growth over time. 

Incoming information suggests that the 
housing correction has intensified and 
that growth in business and consumer 
spending is softening.  Moreover, strains 
in financial markets have increased in 
recent weeks.  Overall, the outlook for 
the economy has weakened somewhat, 
and downside risks to growth have 
increased.  Today’s action, combined 
with the policy actions taken earlier, 
should help promote moderate growth 
over time.

As the Committee had anticipated, 
economic growth appears to be slowing, 
partly reflecting the intensification of the 
housing correction.  Although strains in 
financial markets have increased in 
recent weeks and now pose greater 
downside risks to growth, the monetary 
policy actions taken earlier are expected 
to help promote moderate growth over 
time. 

Rationale 

3. Readings on core inflation have 
improved modestly this year, but 
recent increases in energy and 
commodity prices, among other 
factors, may put renewed upward 
pressure on inflation.  In this 
context, the Committee judges that 
some inflation risks remain, and it 
will continue to monitor inflation 
developments carefully.

Assessment 
of Risk 

4. The Committee judges that, after 
this action, the upside risks to 
inflation roughly balance the 
downside risks to growth.  The 
Committee will continue to assess 
the effects of financial and other 
developments on economic 
prospects and will act as needed to 
foster price stability and sustainable 
economic growth.

developments on economic prospects 
and will act as needed to foster price 
stability and sustainable economic 
growth. 

Recent developments, including the 
deterioration in financial market 
conditions, have increased the 
uncertainty surrounding the outlook for 
economic growth and inflation.  The 
Committee will continue to assess the 
effects of financial and other 
developments on economic prospects 
and will act as needed to foster price 
stability and sustainable economic 
growth. 

The Committee views the downside 
risks to growth as the predominant 
policy concern.  Future policy 
adjustments will depend on the outlook 
for both inflation and economic growth, 
as implied by incoming information. 

 

Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) 22 of 43



   

(17)  If the Committee judges that tighter financial conditions, higher oil prices, 

and soft incoming data point to a weaker economic outlook than previously 

anticipated, then it may deem a more accommodative stance of policy to be 

appropriate and ease policy 25 basis points, as in Alternative B.  The real federal 

funds rate is nearly half a percentage point above its downwardly revised Greenbook-

consistent equilibrium value and a touch above the upper end of the range of model-

based estimates (Chart 5), suggesting that a reduction in the target funds rate may be 

required to keep output near its potential.  Several policy rules (Chart 7) also suggest 

that further policy easing would be appropriate.  Moreover, members might be 

concerned about the risk of possible further deterioration in financial conditions, 

particularly in the run-up to year-end, or about the potential for significant spillovers 

from the housing sector to the broader economy.  If so, they may judge that a policy 

easing at this meeting might help insure against such developments.  At the same 

time, the Committee may believe that the risks to inflation associated with a 25 basis 

point reduction in the target federal funds rate are modest, given recent readings on 

core inflation and the current outlook for prices.   

(18) After noting that “economic growth is slowing” and that “strains in 

financial markets have increased,” the statement for Alternative B suggests that the 

25 basis point reduction in the target funds rate, together with the two previous policy 

actions, is likely to help promote moderate growth over time.  The statement notes 

the modest improvement in core inflation this year but indicates that “some inflation 

risks remain.”  Rather than provide an explicit assessment of the balance of risks, the 

statement concludes that uncertainty around the outlook for growth and inflation has 

increased and that the Committee will “continue to assess the effects of financial and 

other developments” and act as needed to foster its dual objectives. 

(19)   Market participants appear to place about two-thirds odds on a 25 basis 

point reduction in the target at this meeting, with most of the remaining probability 

Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) 23 of 43



   

assigned to a 50 basis point move.  As a result, short-term interest rates would likely 

rise modestly in response to Alternative B.  However, judging from the Desk’s survey 

of dealers, the statement under Alternative B would likely be read as broadly 

consistent with market expectations for additional policy easing.  Consequently, 

longer-term interest rates, equity prices, and the foreign exchange value of the dollar 

probably would be little changed. 

(20) If the Committee views the renewed deterioration in financial markets and 

the sharper contraction in the housing sector as presenting a particularly severe threat 

to the economic expansion, it might want to lower the target funds rate 50 basis 

points, as in Alternative A.  A 50 basis point reduction in the federal funds rate 

would put the real funds rate close to the Greenbook-consistent measure of its 

equilibrium value (Chart 5) and thus, under the baseline projection, would be 

consistent with output returning to its potential in the medium term.  A reduction of 

this size would also be broadly compatible with the optimal policy simulations with a 

2 percent inflation objective (Chart 6) and some of the simple policy rules with that 

goal (Chart 7).  Moreover, given the deterioration in term funding markets and 

increased concerns about balance sheet capacity and counterparty credit risk, the 

Committee might worry about the potential for substantial additional tightening of 

banks’ lending terms and standards, particularly if it viewed the arrangement of swap 

lines with foreign central banks and implementation of a Term Auction Facility as 

unlikely to provide significant relief to funding markets.  Members might also see 

incoming evidence of a deepening contraction in the housing sector, as well as the 

apparent softening in business and consumer spending, as presenting unacceptably 

large downside risks to overall economic activity.  By contrast, incoming core inflation 

data have continued to be moderate, and the Committee may see the inflation 

outlook, and the associated risks, as essentially unchanged.  In these circumstances, 

members might conclude that the weaker modal outlook for growth and significantly 

Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) 24 of 43



   

increased downside risks warrant a 50 basis point policy move at this meeting.  

Members may believe that the Committee would be able to reverse the easing quickly 

if appropriate. 

(21) The draft statement for Alternative A begins with a reference to the further 

intensification of the housing correction and recent weakening in business and 

consumer expenditures, and it also mentions increased strains in financial markets.  It 

then notes that the outlook for economic growth has weakened somewhat and, unlike 

Alternative B, adds that the downside risks to growth have increased.  But as in the 

other alternatives, the statement suggests that the easing in policy should help foster 

moderate expansion over time.  The paragraph regarding inflation is little changed 

from October.  The risk assessment would indicate that the 50 basis point easing 

brings the risks to inflation and growth roughly into balance.  But if the Committee 

believes that, even after such a move, recent developments in financial markets have 

increased the uncertainty around the outlook for growth and inflation to such an 

extent that an assessment is not meaningful, it may wish instead to employ the risk 

assessment language used in Alternative B. 

(22) Investors attach significant odds to both a 50 basis point easing and a  

25 basis point reduction in the target funds rate at this meeting, and so the larger 

move would push very short-term interest rates lower.  However, while the magnitude 

of the surprise with respect to the target funds rate would be similar to that 

experienced in September, the assessment that the risks to growth and inflation are 

balanced, which differs notably from the language in the September statement, might 

temper the reaction in rates further out the term structure.  Indeed, if investors find 

that assessment somewhat persuasive, intermediate- and longer-term interest rates 

might increase as market participants revised up their outlook for the economy.  The 

equity market might rally modestly in reaction to lower interest rates and an improved 

Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) 25 of 43



   

outlook for earnings, and the foreign exchange value of the dollar could even firm a 

bit if market participants revised up their outlook for the U.S. economy. 

(23) If the Committee judges that the current stance of policy is likely to foster 

sustainable growth and acceptable inflation over time, then it might be inclined to 

choose Alternative C.  Members might read the incoming macroeconomic data as 

broadly consistent with the outlook underlying its October policy decision, including 

the expectation for a period of relatively slow growth late this year and early next year.  

Conditions in short-term funding markets have deteriorated notably over the 

intermeeting period and credit has tightened further for some households and 

businesses, increasing the downside risks to growth.  However, the Committee might 

feel that the adverse effects of such developments are likely to be limited and that its 

earlier easing actions—and perhaps arrangement of swap lines with foreign central 

banks and implementation of a Term Auction Facility—provide ample insurance.  

Moreover, members may be concerned that the unsettled state of financial markets 

may make it difficult for Committee to quickly reverse further policy easing, even if 

the prospects for economic growth improve.  And, although core inflation has stayed 

moderate and the baseline outlook for inflation may be viewed as acceptable, 

members may view elevated oil and other commodity prices and a weaker dollar as 

posing large enough upside risks to inflation to make an immediate reduction in the 

target funds rate problematic.  Under these circumstances, the Committee might see 

maintenance of the current stance of policy for now as appropriate but judge that 

downside risks to growth have become the dominant concern.  Such an approach 

would leave the Committee well placed to see whether financial market strains 

diminish significantly after year-end and to accumulate additional information on the 

outlook for growth and inflation before deciding whether further policy easing should 

be implemented. 

Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) 26 of 43



   

(24) The proposed statement for Alternative C acknowledges that economic 

growth appears to be slowing but indicates explicitly that the softening is broadly in 

line with what the Committee had anticipated.  It then notes the increase in financial 

market strains and acknowledges that they pose greater downside risk to growth, but 

suggests that the monetary policy easing already in place is likely to promote moderate 

expansion over time.  The wording on inflation closely follows the October 

statement.  The draft statement then suggests that downside risks to growth are the 

predominant concern and concludes with the language used in the August and earlier 

statements that “future policy adjustments will depend on the outlook for both 

inflation and economic growth, as implied by incoming information.” 

(25) Market participants would be very surprised if the Committee kept the 

target at 4½ percent at this meeting.  Despite the assessment that downside risks to 

growth predominate, the absence of action at this meeting and the overall tone of the 

policy statement would likely suggest to investors that the Committee does not expect 

to lower rates to the extent currently implied by money market futures quotes, so 

short-term interest rates would increase notably on the announcement.  However, the 

rise in longer-term rates might be tempered if investors revised down their outlook 

for economic activity and inflation.  The foreign exchange value of the dollar would 

likely appreciate somewhat with the backup in interest rates.  Equity prices probably 

would fall. 

Money and Debt Forecasts 

(26) Under the Greenbook projection, M2 is forecast to grow at about a 

5½ percent rate on average in the current quarter, down about ¼ percentage point 

from the previous forecast, reflecting in part weaker nominal GDP in the fourth 

quarter.  Over 2008, M2 is projected to expand at about a 4½ percent pace, a bit 

above the rate of growth of nominal GDP and slightly faster than the forecast in the

October Bluebook.  The upward revision reflects lower opportunity costs, given the 

reduction in the federal funds rate assumed in this Greenbook, as well as somewhat 

greater demand for monetary assets in view of the turbulence in financial markets.  

M2 is expected to continue to advance at around 4½ percent pace in 2009, a bit above 

nominal GDP growth, supported by the additional policy easing assumed in that year. 

(27)   After having expanded at an annual rate of 7½ percent in the first half of 

the year, domestic nonfinancial debt is expected to increase at about an 8 percent pace 

in the second half of 2007 before slowing sharply to a 4¾ percent rate in 2008 and 

2009.  The deceleration in total nonfinancial sector debt reflects a projected slowdown 

in borrowing across all major sectors except the federal government.  The staff 

expects household debt growth to fall to 6 percent at an annual rate in the second half 

of this year and to 3½ percent in 2008 and to 3¼ percent in 2009, which would be the 

slowest annual rate of growth in real terms since 1991.  The slowdown reflects a 

moderation in mortgage debt in response to declining home prices and a reduction in 

home sales.  Consumer credit is expected to advance at a modest pace.  Nonfinancial 

business debt, which expanded robustly in the third quarter, is projected to decelerate 

somewhat over the forecast period, as the demand for funds to finance LBOs and 

share repurchases continues to abate.

Appendix A: Measures of the Equilibrium Real Rate 
 

The equilibrium real rate is the real federal funds rate that, if maintained, would be projected to return output 
to its potential level over time.  The short-run equilibrium rate is defined as the rate that would close the 
output gap in twelve quarters given the corresponding model’s projection of the economy.  The medium-run 
concept is the value of the real federal funds rate projected to keep output at potential in seven years, under 
the assumption that monetary policy acts to bring actual and potential output into line in the short run and 
then keeps them equal thereafter.  The TIPS-based factor model measure provides an estimate of market 
expectations for the real federal funds rate seven years ahead.  
 
The actual real federal funds rate is constructed as the difference between the nominal rate and realized 
inflation, where the nominal rate is measured as the quarterly average of the observed federal funds rate, and 
realized inflation is given by the log difference between the core PCE price index and its lagged value four 
quarters earlier.  For the current quarter, the nominal rate is specified as the target federal funds rate on the 
Bluebook publication date.  For the current quarter and the previous quarter, the inflation rate is computed 
using the staff’s estimate of the core PCE price index. 
 
Confidence intervals reflect uncertainties about model specification, coefficients, and the level of potential 
output.  The final column of the table indicates the values published in the previous Bluebook. 
  

Measure Description 
Single-equation 

Model  
The measure of the equilibrium real rate in the single-equation model is based on an 
estimated aggregate-demand relationship between the current value of the output gap and its 
lagged values as well as the lagged values of the real federal funds rate. 

Small Structural 
Model 

The small-scale model of the economy consists of equations for five variables: the output 
gap, the equity premium, the federal budget surplus, the trend growth rate of output, and the 
real bond yield. 

Large Model 
(FRB/US) 

Estimates of the equilibrium real rate using FRB/US—the staff’s large-scale econometric 
model of the U.S. economy—depend on a very broad array of economic factors, some of 
which take the form of projected values of the model’s exogenous variables. 

Greenbook-
consistent  

The FRB/US model is used in conjunction with an extended version of the Greenbook 
forecast to derive a Greenbook-consistent measure.  FRB/US is first add-factored so that its 
simulation matches the extended Greenbook forecast, and then a second simulation is run off 
this baseline to determine the value of the real federal funds rate that closes the output gap. 

TIPS-based 
Factor Model 

Yields on TIPS (Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities) reflect investors’ expectations of the 
future path of real interest rates, but also include term and liquidity premiums.  The TIPS-
based measure of the equilibrium real rate is constructed using the seven-year-ahead 
instantaneous real forward rate derived from TIPS yields as of the Bluebook publication date.  
This forward rate is adjusted to remove estimates of the term and liquidity premiums based 
on a three-factor arbitrage-free term-structure model applied to TIPS yields, nominal yields, 
and inflation.  Because TIPS indexation is based on the total CPI, this measure is also 
adjusted for the medium-term difference—projected at 40 basis points—between total CPI 
inflation and core PCE inflation.

Appendix B: Analysis of Policy Paths and Confidence Intervals 
 

Rule Specifications:  For the following rules, it denotes the federal funds rate for quarter t, while  
the explanatory variables include the staff’s projection of trailing four-quarter core PCE inflation (πt), inflation 
two and three quarters ahead (πt+2|t and πt+3|t), the output gap in the current period and one quarter ahead 
( *t ty y−  and *1| 1|t t t ty y+ +− ), and the three-quarter-ahead forecast of annual average GDP growth relative to 
potential ( 4 4 *3| 3|t t t ty y+ +Δ − Δ ), and *π  denotes an assumed value of policymakers’ long-run inflation 
objective.  The outcome-based and forecast-based rules were estimated using real-time data over the sample 
1988:1-2006:4; each specification was chosen using the Bayesian information criterion. Each rule incorporates 
a 75 basis point shift in the intercept, specified as a sequence of 25 basis point increments during the first 
three quarters of 1998.  The first two simple rules were proposed by Taylor (1993, 1999), while the third is a 
variant of the Taylor (1999) rule—introduced in the August Bluebook—with a higher value of r*.  The 
prescriptions of the first-difference rule do not depend on assumptions regarding r* or the level of the output 
gap; see Orphanides (2003). 
 

Outcome-based rule it =  1.20it-1–0.39it-2+0.19[1.17  + 1.73 πt  + 3.66( *t ty y− )  – 2.72( *1 1t ty y− −− )] 

Forecast-based rule it =  1.18it-1–0.38it-2+0.20[0.98 +1.72 πt+2|t+2.29( *1| 1|t t t ty y+ +− )–1.37( *1 1t ty y− −− )] 

Taylor (1993) rule it = 2 + πt + 0.5(πt – *π ) + 0.5( *t ty y− ) 

Taylor (1999) rule it = 2 + πt + 0.5(πt – *π ) + ( *t ty y− ) 

Taylor (1999) rule     
with higher r* 

it = 2.75 + πt + 0.5(πt – *π ) + ( *t ty y− )  

First-difference rule it = it-1 + 0.5(πt+3|t – *π ) + 0.5( 4 4 *3| 3|t t t ty y+ +Δ − Δ ) 
 
FRB/US Model Simulations:  Prescriptions from the two empirical rules are computed using dynamic simulations of 
the FRB/US model, implemented as though the rule were followed starting at this FOMC meeting.  The dotted line 
labeled “Previous Bluebook” is based on the current specification of the policy rule, applied to the previous Greenbook 
projection.  Confidence intervals are based on stochastic simulations of the FRB/US model with shocks drawn from the 
estimated residuals over 1986-2005.  
Information from Financial Markets:  The expected funds rate path is based on forward rate agreements, and the 
confidence intervals for this path are constructed using prices of interest rate caps. 
Near-Term Prescriptions of Simple Policy Rules:  These prescriptions are calculated using Greenbook projections 
for inflation and the output gap. Because the first-difference rule involves the lagged funds rate, the value labeled 
“Previous Bluebook” for the current quarter is computed using the actual value of the lagged funds rate, and the one-
quarter-ahead prescriptions are based on this rule’s prescription for the current quarter.

Inflation Indicator Based on M2

Note: P* is defined to equal M2 times V* divided by potential GDP. V*, or long-run velocity, is estimated
using average velocity over the 1959:Q1-to-1989:Q4 period and then, after a break, over the interval from
1993:Q1 to the present. For the forecast period, P* is based on the staff M2 forecast and P is simulated using a
short-run dynamic model relating P to P*. Blue areas indicate periods in which P* is notably less than P.
Gray areas denote the projection period.
