MONEY MARKET AND RESERVE RELATIONSHIPS

Recent developments

(1) Preliminary estimates indicate that growth in the adjusted

bank credit proxy for both March and the first quarter was in line with

annual rates regarded as desirable at the time of the last Committee

meeting. While the money supply and time deposits appear to have grown

somewhat more rapidly than projected over the period as a whole, for a

time between meetings the emerging weekly evidence suggested that these

aggregates were falling short of the earlier blue book figures. However,

in the final--Easter--week of March, the preliminary data indicate that

a very large bulge in private demand deposits developed, This reflected

for the most part technical factors affecting cash items and related to

the 4-day holiday week-end abroad and perhaps also the postal strike and

the air traffic slowdown.

(2) Time deposits in March showed their first major monthly

increase on average in over a year, as had been projected. The size of

the increase was a little larger than anticipated, due in large measure

to steeper than forecast declines in short-term market rates. While a

build-up of foreign official CD's continued to account for a sizable part

of the March growth in total time accounts, the pick-up in flows to

consumer-type time and savings accounts--first evident in February--strength-

ened further during March. Also, as Treasury bill yields dropped below

CD rate ceilings, sales of CD's to domestic holders began to develop.

(3) Despite the generally strengthened deposit flows, growth

in the adjusted bank credit proxy for March was about as projected in the

last blue book. In addition to a modest short-fall in U.S. Government

deposits as compared with estimates, the main factors offsetting greater

deposit gains were larger cut-backs than forecast in Euro-dollar borrowing

and slower than estimated growth in bank-related commercial paper. From

the end of February to the end of March, Euro-dollar borrowings of major

banks were reduced by more than $1 billion, while other nondeposit sources

of funds, after their growth slowed in the early weeks of March, showed a

net contraction of $160 million in the week ending March 25 (the latest

for which data are available).

(4) Treasury bill yields have dropped 20 to 50 basis points on

balance from the levels prevailing at the time of the last Committee meeting,



and other short-term rates have dropped commensurately. For a brief

period about ten days ago, bill yields reached substantially lower

levels. This temporary further decline reflected actions by dealers

to build up inventories and sizable seasonal demands for bills--arising

from the pay-off of maturing tax bills, from bank window dressing, and

from the Cook County property tax date--coming at a time when official

statements and emerging financial statistics both seemed to be confirming

market expectations that monetary policy had become less restrictive. Since

late March, bill yields have backed up, with the 3-month issue most recently

bid at about 6.35 per cent, as dealer bill positions expanded sharply to

more than $4 billion and in partial reflection of a normal seasonal

reversal in yields.

(5) Money market conditions on balance have been somewhat

more comfortable over the last four weeks than in the prior inter-

meeting period. Early in the period the Desk sought to achieve eas-

ier conditions that would help to offset the observed shortfall in

the monetary aggregates relative to expectations, but more recently

money market conditions have been permitted to firm up a little

again, partly under the pressure of dealer financing needs. Over

the inter-meeting weeks as a whole, the effective Federal funds rate

averaged close to 7-3/4 per cent, compared to an average of about

8-3/4 per cent in the preceding 4-week period, and dealer financing

costs declined to an average of around 8-3/8 per cent in New York.

Net borrowed reserves have fluctuated in a fairly wide $675-$900

million range. Excluding the most recent week, when bank uncertain-

ties about reserve positions and preparation for the quarterly

statement data increased bank use of the discount window, member

bank borrowings have averaged about $875 million.

Prospective developments

(7) If the Committee wishes to continue on the policy course

adopted at the March meeting, it may want to renew the second paragraph

of the directive issued then, with the addition of a reference to the

Treasury financing, as follows (alternative A):

To implement this policy, the Committee desires to see

moderate growth in money and bank credit over the months ahead.

System open market operations until the next meeting of the

Committee shall be conducted with a view to maintaining money

market conditions consistent with that objective, TAKING

ACCOUNT OF THE FORTHCOMING TREASURY FINANCING.

The path given below for monetary aggregates could be considered as

consistent with the directive (data shown are seasonally adjusted

monthly average levels in billions of dollars). It should be stressed

that while we have specified point estimates,variations around these

individual estimates are likely and should be acceptable, provided they

are not cumulative in one direction.

(8) The money supply bulge at the end of March is likely

to be followed by rather sharp declines in the money supply over the

next few weeks--a development somewhat similar to last January.

After this adjustment from the end-of-March bulge, the money supply

path turns upward and the average level for June is somewhat greater

than in the previous blue book, but with the annual rate of increase

a somewhat slower 2-1/2 per cent because of the inflated March

average level. For the adjusted credit proxy, the June average level

is about the same as in the previous blue book.

(9) A weekly pattern spanning the inter-meeting period

consistent with the monthly path of monetary aggregates noted above

is shown below (in billions of dollars, seasonally adjusted), although

it must be recognized, of course, that a weekly pattern is subject to

even more random fluctuation than monthly figures.

-8-

The weekly pattern shown here would lead to an average annual rate of

increase from March to April of about 4 per cent for the money supply,

8 per cent for the adjusted proxy, and 20 per cent for time deposits

(reflecting in large part strength at the end of March). A rather

sizable drop in U.S. Government deposits is anticipated in April, and

an even larger drop is likely to develop in May. This does not allow for

the earlier timing of the Federal pay raise, and if the Treasury balance

for this or other reasons tends to drop too low, the Treasury may come

in for cash borrowing before the second quarter ends, a possibility not

allowed for in our projections.

(10) This aggregate pattern for the weeks ahead may require a

Federal funds rate fluctuating in a 7-9 per cent range. Rates may have

to move to the upper end of the range if short-term interest rates begin

to stimulate more rapid growth in time deposits and particularly the

adjusted bank credit proxy than is desired. Net borrowed reserves may

fluctuate in a $650 million--$l.1 billion range, with member bank

borrowings in a $750 million to $1.2 billion range.

(11) The growth path shown for time deposits, both weekly and

over the months ahead, assumes that-the 3-month Treasury bill rate will

remain generally withing a 6-1/8--6-5/8 per cent range, and that there

will be no significant further decline in other short-term rates. A

bill rate in that range would appear to be consistent with some slowing

of growth in time deposits from the very rapid $800 million per

week pace of the latter half of March, which if it were to continue,

would lead to an even larger rate of time deposit growth



than the l1 per cent shown above for the second quarter. In April,

growth in time deposits is expected to slow somewhat as the month

progresses, largely as a result of less active CD issuance by banks,

as explained below. In May, payment for the large AT&T bond offer-

ing may also slow down time deposit inflows. Moreover, the stimulus

from widespread advertising by banks of the new higher ceiling

rates on consumer-type time deposits is likely to diminish as time

goes on.

(12) Consistent with growth in the adjusted bank credit

proxy held to about a 4-1/2 per cent, annual rate, over the second

quarter, net growth in large CD's and nondeposit sources of funds

are estimated to be around $150 million per week. As banks obtain

time deposits in relatively sizable volume, they are not likely to

add to, and may make further repayments of, relatively high cost

Euro-dollar and commercial paper borrowings. We have not, however,

assumed further significant net repayment of such funds, partly

because the greater strength now projected for GNP may sustain

credit demand. Even so, growth in the adjusted bank credit proxy

continues quite moderate, largely as a result of a substantial drop

in U.S. Government deposits over the quarter as a large Federal

cash surplus is utilized to retire debt.

(13) To keep expansion of banks' money market liabilities

within the dimensions of the preceding paragraph might require a 3-

month bill rate in the upper half of the 6-1/8--6-5/8 per cent range



-10-

mentioned earlier, unless the Committee wishes to permit somewhat

greater growth in bank credit. As seasonal downward pressures on

bill rates develop as the quarter progresses, this may mean that

the Desk would have to supply less reserves than would otherwise

be the case, thus exerting upward pressure on money market rates.

There is the possibility that such pressures would lead to a

reversal of market expectations that could back up interest rates

on a broader scale.

(14) Long-term interest rates over the next few weeks

are not expected to decline much, if at all, in any event. The

corporate calendar remains large, and, with short-term interest

rates remaining around current levels, there is little reason to

anticipate that investor expectations of credit easing will induce

them to become more willing buyers of long-term debt instruments.

Moreover, the Treasury at the end of April will be announcing a

refunding of almost $5 billion of publicly-held maturing coupon

issues, and if market conditions warrant might also include a pre-

refunding of about $5-1/2 billion of publicly-held August maturities.

Alternative path

(15) If the Committee desires to see somewhat more

growth in money and bank credit over the months ahead, it may wish

to consider the following directive language (alternative E);



-11-

To implement this policy, the Committee desires to see

SOMEWHAT MORE moderate growth in money and bank credit over

the months ahead THAN SOUGHT AT THE PRECEDING MEETING. System

open market operations until the next meeting of the Committee

shall be conducted with a view to maintaining money market

conditions consistent with that objective, TAKING ACCOUNT OF THE

FORTHCOMING TREASURY FINANCING.

The following path of the monetary aggregates might be taken to be con-

sistent with this directive.

Most of the additional expansive effect on the aggregates from this path de-

velops after April. It is assumed that Desk operations supply more reserves



-12-

than under the previous alternative as April progresses, and that

Treasury bill rates drop in the latter part of the month to around

6-1/8 per cent or below as the market comes to sense a further

easing in monetary policy at a time when short-term rates may be

tending to decline somewhat for seasonal reasons.

(16) A weekly pattern over the next several weeks con-

sistent with this alternative path is shown below.

Adjusted Money Time Total

April 29 308.2 202.1 198.8 28.2

May 6 308.3 202.3 199.4 28.4

p/ Preliminary.

With this pattern, the annual rate of increase in April, on average,

for the adjusted proxy would be around 10 per cent; for the money

supply 4 per cent; and for time deposits 22 per cent. It is assumed

that banks would use part of the deposit funds obtained to reduce

other borrowings.

(17) Under this alternative, money market conditions in April

would, on the whole, be somewhat less firm than under the first

alternative. The Federal funds rate might drop below 7 per cent at



-13-

times, and generally would not rise much above 8 per cents Member bank

borrowings would generally remain under $900 million, and perhaps

decline to as little as $60O million. Net borrowed reserves would

probably fluctuate in a $500-$800 million range.

(18) Long-term interest rates may decline for a time as a

result both of the initial impact on expectations of such an easing

in policy and the enhanced ability of banks to acquire securities.

However, it is possible that before the end of the second quarter,

interest rates could begin to rise again. Such an outcome would be

particularly likely if there were indications of further easing

fiscal restraints, with a consequent intensification of inflationary

expectations and increased anticipatory borrowing.
