STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL (FR) CLASS II FOMC

MONETARY POLICY ALTERNATIVES

PREPARED FOR THE FEDERAL OPEN MARKET COMMITTEE
BY THE STAFF OF THE BOARD OF GOVERNORS OF THE FEDERAL RESERVE SYSTEM



Strictly Confidential (F.R.) June 23, 2000
Class II -- FOMC

MONETARY POLICY ALTERNATIVES

Recent Developments

(1) Market participants did not fully anticipate the FOMC's decision at its May

meeting to raise the target funds rate by 50 basis points and retain a statement judging the

balance of risks as weighted toward conditions that might generate higher inflation. 1

Accordingly, investors marked up their expectations a little for the path of the funds rate

immediately following the announcement, and bond and stock prices generally edged down.

Over the next couple of weeks, concerns about the potential need for aggressive policy

tightening and its possible repercussions on future earnings growth and economic activity

appeared to contribute to a sharp sell-off in the equity market and a widening of risk spreads

on corporate bonds. However, later in the period, investors read a string of economic data

releases as signaling a moderation in the growth of economic activity and relatively well-

contained cost and price pressures, and they concluded that the Federal Reserve probably

would be able to hold inflation in check without much additional policy firming.

(2) On balance, expectations for the trajectory of the funds rate have been revised

down significantly over the intermeeting period, with current readings from futures markets

suggesting that market participants, on average, do not expect a tightening at this meeting

1. Federal funds traded close to 6-1/2 percent over the intermeeting period. To address
longer-term reserve needs, the Desk purchased $4.1 billion of Treasury coupon securities
for the SOMA portfolio and increased the outstanding quantity of long-term RPs by about
$6 billion. (The final table in this bluebook, entitled "Changes in System Holdings of
Securities," has been modified to show net changes in long-term RPs.)

and anticipate at most another quarter-point firming in coming months. This revised

outlook for policy was accompanied by a reduction in uncertainty and a fairly broad-based

easing in financial conditions, on net, over the period (Chart 1). The implied volatilities

derived from options on interest rate and equity index futures contracts all moved down over

the period, suggesting an appreciable decline in market uncertainty. Treasury coupon yields

fell between 10 and 40 basis points, and, consistent with the change in monetary policy

expectations, the declines were associated with especially large revisions to nearer-term

forward rates.2 The ten-year inflation-indexed Treasury yield dropped about half as much as

the nominal ten-year Treasury yield, suggesting declines in both longer-term real interest rates

and investors' required compensation for inflation. Thirty-year fixed-rate mortgage rates fell

about in line with the decline in comparable Treasury yields, as did most investment-grade

bond yields. Junk bond yields, however, were down only a touch, with rising defaults adding

to investors' concerns about credit risk going forward. Lower interest rates helped support

equity prices; most broad stock price indexes were little changed, although the Nasdaq

recovered from its sharp sell-off early in the period to post a 6-1/2 percent gain. By

contrast, regional and money center bank stocks fell considerably on worries about rising

loan losses and shrinking underwriting income.

(3) Declines in U.S. interest rates, together with greater confidence of investors in

the expansion of economic activity in major foreign industrial countries, contributed to a

2. Spreads of "benchmark" agency yields over comparable Treasuries narrowed over the
period, partly reflecting a growing sense among investors that chances had faded for any
legislative changes that would affect the status of government-sponsored enterprises.

2-1/4 percent depreciation on net of the dollar's value against a basket of major currencies

since the May FOMC meeting. Notable among the changes in the components of the

major currencies index was a 2-1/2 percent drop in the dollar's value vis-a-vis the euro,

abetted no doubt by the European Central Bank's decision to hike its policy rate 1/2

percentage point on June 8, a quarter point more than had been built into market prices.

While the Bank of Japan kept its policy rate at zero, officials hinted frequently that some

tightening was in the offing, and the dollar lost about 4-1/2 percent of its value against the

yen on balance. Even so, Japanese longer-term yields were little changed.

U.S. monetary

authorities did not intervene.

(4) Concerns about a few emerging market countries have cropped up in recent

weeks and appear mostly responsible for the modest appreciation of the dollar against an

index of the currencies of our other important trading partners. Recent polls suggest the

presidential race in Mexico is too close to call, heightening nervousness on the part of some

investors about the potential for unsettled political and economic conditions after the

election. On net, the dollar has gained 4-1/4 percent against the peso. Social unrest in

Indonesia and a pickup in piracy in the Phillippines depressed their currencies and added to

the risk premiums on their foreign debt. In contrast, yield spreads on Brazilian dollar-

denominated debt over U.S. Treasury securities declined and the real appreciated 2 percent

on favorable inflation news that allowed the central bank to ease policy late in the



4

intermeeting period. On net, average yield spreads of emerging market debt over U.S.

Treasury securities narrowed over the intermeeting period.

(5) Changes in financial conditions have affected funding patterns in recent

months, but overall private credit flows have remained substantial. Through April and much

of May, tight conditions in long-term capital markets prompted businesses to rely more

heavily on bank loans and commercial paper, but more recently bond issuance has picked up,

even among junk bond issuers. Borrowing by businesses has been supported by strength in

investment spending relative to internal funds and by substantial net retirements of equities.

In the household sector, based on fragmentary data, the pace of borrowing is estimated to

have slowed a little recently, consistent with the projected slight decline in nominal spending

on consumer durables and housing in the current quarter. Federal debt continues on a steep

downward trend, with unexpectedly large tax receipts contributing to a huge paydown in the

current quarter. Looking over a longer period, from the fourth quarter of last year to May,

total domestic nonfinancial debt expanded at a 5-1/2 percent rate (Chart 2), well short of the

projected growth in nominal GDP over the first half of the year.3 Over the same period,

federal debt is estimated to have contracted at a 6-1/2 percent pace while nonfederal debt

has expanded at an 8-3/4 percent rate.

(6) M2 fell in May as this year's unusually large tax payments cleared, but it has

rebounded in June. Growth over both months likely has been held down by rising money

3. In May, total domestic nonfinancial debt was a little above the midpoint of its 3-to-7
percent annual range.

market interest rates and the associated increase in the opportunity cost of M2. Over the

first half of the year, M2 velocity is estimated to have risen at about a 1-1/4 percent rate,

roughly consistent with the pace that would be expected based on the historical relationship

between M2 velocity and opportunity cost. Nonetheless, boosted by rapid growth in

nominal income, M2 is estimated to have expanded at a 5-1/2 percent rate from the fourth

quarter of 1999 to June of this year.4 M3 growth over the same period is currently estimated

at about a 9 percent rate, buoyed by the strong growth of depository credit.5 The gap

between the growth rates of M3 and M2 so far this year is well above the historical average,

but it is consistent with patterns observed during past episodes of brisk depository credit

growth and rising interest rates.

4. This expansion places M2 in June somewhat above its 1-to-5 percent annual range.

5. M3 in June significantly exceeds its 2-to-6 percent annual range.

Longer-Term Strategies

(7) This section examines some of the implications of the path for the economy

presented in the Greenbook for subsequent developments and considers alternative longer-

run policy strategies. It also discusses the effects of alternative possibilities for the NAIRU

and for domestic and foreign productivity growth.

(8) The analysis is built around an extension of the staffs judgmental outlook

presented in the Greenbook. The extension is constructed using the FRB/US model, while

preserving the key qualitative characteristics of the economy embodied in the judgmental

forecast. With regard to fiscal policy, the federal budget is assumed to remain in surplus,

although by less than recently, and government saving declines from a peak of about 2

percent of GDP at the end of 2001 to close to 1 percent by the end of 2010. On the

international side, foreign economies are expected to grow in real terms at about the same

rate as the United States.6 At current exchange rates, the U.S. current account deficit would

tend to widen further as a share of GDP because of the larger income elasticity of U.S.

imports relative to U.S. exports. The associated rapid rise in dollar assets in global

portfolios puts downward pressure on the foreign exchange value of the dollar, whose rate

of decline picks up from a 3 percent pace over the Greenbook interval to a 5 percent rate

6. In the baseline, foreign countries participate only in a limited way in the productivity
boom that has characterized the U.S. economy recently. The implications of a faster rise in
trend productivity abroad are examined in paragraph 15 below.



8

thereafter. This more rapid depreciation stabilizes the current account deficit at about 6

percent of GDP in the latter half of the decade.

(9) The dollar's decline has implications for the supply side assumptions in the

baseline. In particular, because of its persistent upward effect on inflation, the steeper fall of

the dollar means that the NAIRU rises from 5-1/4 percent in the Greenbook to about

5-1/2 percent in the period beyond. Potential output growth tapers off from 4-1/4 percent

over the next several years to just under 4 percent near the end of the period, as a slowdown

in the torrid pace of computer and communications equipment accumulation reduces the

rate of capital deepening.

(10) In recent years, the long-run equilibrium real federal funds rate--the rate that

would eventually bring aggregate demand into line with the economy's long-run potential--

has risen, as the effect of accelerating productivity has more than offset that of rising

government saving. The policy firming over the past year and a half has lifted the real

federal funds rate--defined as the federal funds rate less the four-quarter change in the core

PCE price index--to the neighborhood of its higher long-run equilibrium value as estimated

in FRB/US. Keeping the real federal funds rate near its equilibrium level would ultimately

raise the unemployment rate to the NAIRU. However, owing to the current imbalance

between demand and potential supply as seen by the Greenbook and the model, inflation

would stabilize at a much higher level than the Committee would likely find acceptable. The

baseline scenario delivers better inflation performance by raising the real federal funds rate

above its equilibrium level for a time, pushing the unemployment rate more promptly



9

towards the long-run NAIRU. As a result, core PCE inflation stabilizes at a 3 percent rate

by the middle of the decade. To achieve this outcome, the Committee must tighten about 1

percentage point in real terms--about 1-3/4 percentage points on the nominal funds rate--

before allowing the real funds rate to drop to its long-run equilibrium value. The process is

begun by taking the actions assumed in the Greenbook and continues with roughly an

additional percentage point of firming in the years immediately following.

(11) To keep inflation at about its current level of 2 percent, as in the stable

inflation scenario shown by the ball and chain lines in Chart 3, the Committee must

tighten policy enough to put some slack in the economy--that is, to raise the unemployment

rate above the NAIRU for a time. To keep inflation from accelerating significantly given

the pressure already in train from the unusually tight labor markets, increases in the real

federal funds rate must be larger and more prompt than in the baseline scenario, totaling

nearly 1-1/2 percentage points by early next year.7 Inflation is held down in the initial

phases of this tightening by a stronger dollar and then by the effects of slower growth and

reduced pressures on resources. Achieving price stability, shown by the dotted lines,

requires even higher interest rates to create more slack in labor markets for a longer period

7. The federal funds rate in this scenario is set according to the prescriptions of a Taylor-
type interest rate rule with an inflation target of 2 percent and an aggressive inflation-fighting
coefficient on inflation deviations from target of 0.85. In the original Taylor rule, the funds
rate depended on a coefficient of 0.5 on the deviation of inflation from its target, the
inflation gap. Such a coefficient on the inflation gap is too small for the rule to achieve the
long-run objectives of stable inflation or price stability within the ten-year horizon. The
weight on the output gap is 0.5, the same as in the original Taylor rule.

of time. Still, economic activity continues to expand, albeit at a modest pace. Credibility for

the new, lower inflation target builds gradually, helping to hold down output losses over

time.

(12) The three alternative paths depicted in Chart 3 show the predictions for key

variables assuming that the model is properly specified, its parameter values are correct, the

data are measured without error, and no shocks will hit the economy in the future. Of

course, none of these conditions holds in practice, rendering forecasts quite uncertain.

Unfortunately, it would be very difficult to quantify the combined effect of these sources of

uncertainty. A sense of the magnitude of some of the uncertainties attendant in model

simulations can be obtained by examining the behavior of key variables when the model is

hit by many different sequences of shocks of the same magnitude as its historical residuals.

Using the resulting distribution of simulated outcomes, one can trace out confidence bands,

which indicate how likely it is to observe an outcome that would lie within this range of the

forecasted value.8

(13) Chart 4 displays approximately 70 percent confidence bands--plus or minus

one standard deviation of the shocks--for unemployment, inflation, and the nominal and real

8. Although these confidence bands do not explicitly take into account specification,
parameter, or data uncertainty, one can argue that the magnitude and correlations of the
historical residuals of the FRB/US model equations that were used as shocks are related to
possible misspecifications of the model or to measurement error. For example, if the
NAIRU identified within the model is not the true NAIRU, this misspecification would
show up in the historical model residuals. But omissions arising from specification,
parameter, or data uncertainty are generally likely to impart bias to the forecasts so that the
bands, even when they are about the right width, may be placed in the wrong location
around the forecast.

funds rates in the baseline scenario. In this exercise, as shocks accumulate and drive

inflation away from target or output away from potential, policy in the form of the modified

Taylor rule responds by moving interest rates to limit fluctuations in output and inflation

that would ensue if policy were left on hold. The bands eventually become fairly wide,

about 2-1/2 percentage points for core inflation and about 3-1/2 percentage points for the

unemployment rate. In the long-run, the width of the bands should reflect the historical

degree of variation in those variables and, for this reason, Chart 4 includes the last two

decades of data, which is the period over which the residuals were drawn.

(14) Because one of the key uncertainties in the forecast is the behavior of

productivity in the United States, Chart 5 considers the possibility of both faster and slower

productivity growth. In the former case (ball-and-chain lines), trend productivity growth

gradually increases an additional percentage point, so that the growth of potential output is

5-1/4 percent by the middle of 2003 and 1 percentage point above baseline thereafter. The

further pickup in productivity implies improved income prospects that boost aggregate

demand, keeping the unemployment rate below 4 percent for another three years, despite

rising real interest rates. Improved productivity growth facilitates cost containment, initially

countering incipient inflation pressures. However, unlike the situation in the second half of

the 1990s, this scenario is not accompanied by a fiscal contraction or foreign developments

that help to mitigate inflation pressures. Moreover, the unemployment rate is currently at a

much lower level. Consequently, it takes only about two years for inflation to accelerate

sharply. The improvement in productivity further raises the equilibrium real interest rate.

Ultimately, a policy tightening of 1-3/4 percentage points in real terms is necessary in order

to stabilize inflation at a 3 percent rate. In the slower productivity scenario (dotted lines),

the fall in trend growth puts downward pressure on aggregate demand, in part through a

major correction in the stock market, and leads to a rapid increase in the unemployment

rate, which rises beyond the NAIRU within two years. At the same time, inflation moves

rapidly above the 3 percent baseline target rate. Nominal rates stay close to baseline for

several years owing to the offsetting effects of higher unemployment and higher inflation.

When the unemployment rate exceeds the natural rate, inflation slows and interest rates

decline.

(15) To the extent that the U.S. productivity improvements in the second half of

the 1990s were due to innovations in information technology and their productivity-

enhancing application to other sectors, it seems likely that other industrial countries will

eventually experience similar developments. Chart 6 depicts a scenario in which labor

productivity growth in several developed countries rises gradually beginning in early 2002,

eventually stabilizing at 1 percentage point above baseline by early 2004. The simulation is

conducted in the FRB/Global version of the staffs model, which incorporates a more

detailed treatment of the foreign sector. As a result of the productivity shock in these

countries, output in U.S. export markets, on average, grows about 1/2 percentage point per

year faster than in the baseline scenario. The rise in foreign output increases demand for

U.S. exports, inducing a slight fall in the U.S. unemployment rate and an edging higher of

consumer price inflation by 2010 compared to the baseline. The real federal funds rate rises

about 1 percentage point, reflecting the combined effects of the rise in the inflation and

output gaps and the perceived increase in the equilibrium real rate. Since foreign real

interest rates, on balance, are increased by a larger amount than U.S. real rates in response to

the shock, the real exchange value of the dollar declines slightly relative to baseline. The

depreciation reinforces the effect of faster foreign growth in contributing to a nearly 1-1/2

percentage points improvement in the U.S. current account deficit as a share of GDP.

(16) Inflation has increased only modestly in the last few years, even in the face of

a sharp run-up in energy prices and a remarkably low level of unemployment. The baseline

scenario interprets this performance as a manifestation of fortuitous shocks temporarily

offsetting strong underlying inflation pressure. An alternative explanation is that the

NAIRU has been substantially lower than the staff estimate in the Greenbook. Chart 7

shows the implications of assuming that the NAIRU has been, and will continue to be,

1 percentage point below the staff estimate. Even in this case, inflation pressures are at

hand, but less so than in the baseline because the level of potential output is higher. The

nominal funds rate rises gradually for nearly three years. However, the level of the funds

rate stays about 1/2 percentage point below baseline for most of the decade. Moreover, the

real funds rate is essentially flat for the first few years and rises only slightly thereafter.

Short-Run Policy Alternatives

(17) In the staffs view, data on economic activity, spending, and prices, although a

tad softer of late than anticipated, have not signaled a fundamental shift in the forces at work

in the U.S. economy. The economy is expected to continue producing appreciably beyond

the level of its potential, fueling an acceleration in core prices that is augmented by a

projected depreciation of the dollar. Accordingly, the staff again assumes in the Greenbook

that policymakers will raise the federal funds rate to 7-1/4 percent by the end of this year.

This policy firming, which is greater than expected by market participants, contributes to a

substantial rise in private long-term interest rates and keeps broad equity indexes in their

recent ranges. These financial conditions help hold growth of real GDP a bit below that of

its potential over the next year and a half and leave the unemployment rate near its current

reading--well below the staffs estimate of its sustainable level. The persistence of these labor

market pressures, along with the pass through of the recent surge in the price of oil and

further increases in non-oil import prices, is expected to push core PCE inflation from 1-1/2

percent over the last four quarters to 2-1/4 percent in 2001 and higher thereafter.

(18) If the Committee is not sure that inflation pressures will intensify going

forward, then it might want to consider leaving the stance of monetary policy unchanged at

this meeting, as under alternative B. Economic growth in the second quarter appears to

have slowed to a rate roughly consistent with its potential even though the full effects of the

earlier rise in interest rates and flattening of equity prices have not yet worked their way

through the pipeline. Moreover, as noted, market participants have interpreted the incoming



15

data as suggesting that very little further tightening might be necessary to contain inflation.

In these circumstances, the Committee might wish to wait for more evidence on the likely

extent of the slowdown in aggregate demand before taking further action. In addition, the

Committee may be less convinced than the staff that the economy is producing beyond the

level of its potential. Recent data are giving conflicting signals about the acceleration of labor

compensation, and, in any case, the growth of structural productivity has picked up. In view

of the resulting uncertainty regarding unit labor costs, the Committee may have significant

doubts that an upswing of inflation is in train. Judging by survey evidence, longer-term

inflation expectations have not been particularly sensitive to short-run fluctuations in

measured inflation. As a result, the Committee might anticipate that those expectations will

not rise much in the near term, even if the incoming data tend to confirm the staffs forecast,

and might view the costs of waiting for additional information as rather low.

(19) Market participants fully expect the Federal Reserve to stay its hand at this

meeting and repeat the warning that the risks are tilted toward inflation. Thus, financial

market prices probably would not respond initially to a Committee decision that conforms to

those expectations. However, the subsequent accumulation of information over the

intermeeting period that is consistent with the Greenbook forecast is likely to suggest more

inflation pressure than now foreseen by market participants. Bond and equity prices would

be expected to fall as investors came to anticipate additional Federal Reserve tightening.

(20) If the Committee is instead concerned that the odds of rising inflation are still

elevated, as in the staff forecast, a further firming of policy of 25 basis points at this meeting



16

could be warranted, as under alternative C. Indications of slower expansion are still

tentative, the level of resource utilization remains quite high, and some of the earlier financial

restraint has been unwound by the recent rally in bond and equity markets. In this

environment, the Committee may want more assurance that growth in aggregate demand will

not rebound than is provided by the likely additional effects of previous tightening actions.

The argument for tightening would be even more compelling if the Committee believed that

the growth of aggregate demand has to be restrained to substantially below the pace of

potential output for a while to lessen the intensity of resource use. Accelerating productivity

has held down the growth in unit labor costs, and thereby has helped to restrain inflation for

some time. However, its depressing effect on inflation may be running its course, as intense

competitive pressures in labor markets allow real compensation to catch up to the higher

level of productivity. If so, the unemployment rate consistent with stable inflation would be

rising, even if productivity is continuing to accelerate.

(21) Market participants would be surprised by the 25 basis point tightening of

alternative C. Short-term interest rates would rise immediately by almost 1/4 percentage

point. Especially if the Committee were to retain its existing statement about the balance of

risks, some increase in intermediate- and long-term yields also could be anticipated. The

dollar probably would firm some on foreign exchange markets, while stock prices likely

would decline. An announcement of balanced risks, by contrast, could well be taken by the

public as a signal that the Committee believes it may be finished tightening. Although the

rate hike would move forward in time the tightening that markets have essentially priced in, a



17

statement of balanced risks could prompt a rally in capital markets as market participants

mark down the odds they place on aggressive further tightening.

(22) In the Greenbook forecast, the debt of domestic nonfinancial sectors grows at

a 4-1/4 percent rate from May to December. Over this period, the contraction in federal

debt is expected to pick up to a 9 percent annual rate. The expansion of nonfederal debt is

anticipated to slow somewhat, to a 7-1/2 percent pace, but still to exceed the growth of

nominal spending. Business debt growth is projected to edge lower, but this moderation is

limited by a widening in the financing gap, as heavy capital expenditures increasingly outstrip

internal funds, and by continued substantial net equity retirements associated with brisk

merger-and-acquisition activity. For households, mortgage and consumer credit borrowing is

likely to edge down in light of the moderation in the growth of spending on housing and

consumer durables. The anticipated slowdown in the economic expansion and upturn in

business credit problems should induce lenders to tighten terms somewhat, but not by

enough to affect borrowing significantly. Over 2001, nonfederal debt is projected to grow

7-1/2 percent, which, combined with a forecasted paydown of federal debt of 8-1/2 percent,

implies that overall domestic nonfinancial debt will advance 4-1/2 percent next year, down a

bit from this year's 5 percent increase.

(23) The marked slowing of nominal GDP growth in the second half of 2000 in

the staff forecast, and the effects of past and projected policy tightenings on the spread

between market and deposit interest rates should prompt a moderation in M2 growth from

the average pace over the first half of the year. M2 is expected to expand at a 4-1/4 percent



18

rate over the June-to-December period, bringing growth over the four quarters of this year

to 5 percent. With short-term interest rates increasing, M2 velocity is projected to rise 1-1/2

percent this year, about in line with the estimate of the staffs standard M2 demand model

(Chart 8). Over the second half of the year, M3 growth slows appreciably as depository

credit decelerates and the effects of higher interest rates damp the growth of institutional

money funds. M3 should advance at the relatively moderate pace of about 6 percent over

the next six months, placing its four-quarter growth for 2000 as a whole at 7-3/4 percent.

(24) With short-term market interest rates flat next year in the staff forecast, the

opportunity cost of holding M2 assets should about level off. Still, the lagged effect of the

previous widening of opportunity cost boosts M2 velocity 1/2 percent in 2001. Despite the

smaller rise in velocity next year, M2 remains on a 5 percent growth pace owing to the

weaker growth of nominal income. In this environment, the need for financing by

depositories lessens, and M3 growth is expected to moderate to 6-1/2 percent. M3 velocity

falls 1 percent next year, slightly faster than its average rate of decline over the last four

decades.

Directive and Balance of Risks Language

(25) Presented below for the members' consideration is draft wording for (1) the

directive and (2) the "balance of risks" sentence to be included in the press release issued

after the meeting (not part of the directive).

(1) Directive Wording

The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and financial

conditions that will foster price stability and promote sustainable growth in output.

To further its long-run objectives, the Committee in the immediate future seeks

conditions in reserve markets consistent with MAINTAINING/increasing/

DECREASING the federal funds rate AT/to an average of around ___ [DEL: 6-1/2]

percent.

(2) "Balance of Risks" Sentence

Against the background of its long-run goals of price stability and sustainable

economic growth and of the information currently available, the Committee believes

that the risks are [balanced with respect to prospects for both goals] [weighted

mainly toward conditions that may generate heightened inflation pressures]

[weighted mainly toward conditions that may generate economic weakness] in the

foreseeable future.

NOTE: Numbers in parentheses are actual growth rates as reported at end of policy period in the February Monetary Policy
Report to Congress. Subsequent revisions to historical data (not reflected above) have altered growth rates by up to a few
tenths of a percentage point.

n.s. -- not specified.
Footnotes on following page



1. Targets are for bank credit until 1983; from 1983 onward targets are for domestic nonfinancial sector debt.

2. The figures shown reflect target and actual growth of M1-B in 1980 and shift-adjusted M1-B in 1981. M1-B was
relabelled M1 in January 1982. The targeted growth for M1-A was 3-1/2 to 6 percent in 1980 (actual growth was 5.0
percent); in 1981 targeted growth for shift-adjustedM 1-A was 3 to 5-1/2 percent (actual growth was 1.3 percent).

3. When these ranges were set, shifts into other checkable deposits in 1980 were expected to have only a limited effect
on growth of M1-A and M1-B. As the year progressed, however, banks offered other checkable deposits more actively,
and more funds than expected were directed to these accounts. Such shifts are estimated to have decreased M1-A growth
and increased M1-B growth each by at least 1/2 percentage point more than had been anticipated.

4. Adjusted for the effects of shifts out of demand deposits and savings deposits. At the February FOMC meeting, the
target ranges for observed M1-A and M1-B in 1981 on an unadjusted basis, expected to be consistent with the adjusted
ranges, were -(4-1/2) to -2 and 6 to 8-1/2 percent, respectively. Actual M1-B growth (not shift adjusted) was 5.0 percent.

5. Adjusted for shifts of assets from domestic banking offices to International Banking Facilities.

6. Range for bank credit is annualized growth from the December 1981 - January 1982 average level through the fourth
quarter of 1982.

7. Base period, adopted at the July 1983 FOMC meeting, is 1983 QII. At the February 1983 meeting, the FOMC had
adopted a 1982 QIV to 1983 QIV target range for M1 of 4 to 8 percent.

8. Base period is the February-March 1983 average.

9. Base period, adopted at the July 1985 FOMC meeting, is 1985 QII. At the February 1983 meeting, the FOMC had
adopted a 1984 QIV to 1985 QIV target range for M1 of 4 to 7 percent.

10. No range for M1 has been specified since the February 1987 FOMC meeting because of uncertainties about its
underlying relationship to the behavior of the economy and its sensitivity to economic and financial circumstances.

11. At the February 1990 meeting, the FOMC specified a range of 2-1/2 to 6-1/2 percent. This range was lowered to 1 to
5 percent at the July 1990 meeting.

12. At the February 1993 meeting, the FOMC specified a range of 2 to 6 percent for M2, 1/2 to 4-1/2 percent for M3, and
4-1/2 to 8-1/2 percent for domestic nonfinancial debt. These ranges were lowered to 1 to 5 percent for M2, 0 to 4 percent
for M3, and 4 to 8 percent for domestic nonfinancial debt at the July 1993 meeting.

13. At the February 1995 FOMC meeting, the FOMC specified a range of 0 to 4 percent. This range was raised to 2 to 6
percent at the July 1995 meeting.

14. Growth rates in parentheses for the monetary aggregates are from 1999 QIV to June 2000 and for nonfinancial debt
are from 1999 QIV to May 2000.
