of Governors of the Federal Reserve System.  This electronic document was created 
through a comprehensive digitization process which included identifying the best-
preserved paper copies, scanning those copies,1 and then making the scanned 
versions text-searchable.2   Though a stringent quality assurance process was 
employed, some imperfections may remain.

Recent developments

(1) Following an increase in M1 at a 7.3 per cent annual rate

in June, growth in July now appears likely to be at a rate a little

over 5 per cent. M1 growth for the June-July target period thus is

estimated at about 6¼ per cent, well within the range of tolerance

set by the Committee at its last meeting. M2 growth is also expected

to decelerate between June and July, with the June growth rate at 9½ per

cent and the July projection at about 7 per cent. The 2-month growth

rate is expected to be about 8¼ per cent, a little below the top of the

range of tolerance. RPD growth, on the other hand, is projected at

about a 15 per cent rate for the 2-month target period, above the top

of its range of tolerance, as CD growth was stronger than expected.

1/ Range shown is that set at the June 18 meeting of the Committee. In
a telephone conference on July 5, the Committee agreed that for
the time being the Desk should not press hard to reduce the funds
rate, which had averaged 13.55 per cent in latest statement week, in
view of the likelihood that the high level was primarily a consequence
of technical factors which might well prove temporary. Subsequently,
a majority of members concurred in the Chairman's recommendation of
July 10 that System operations be undertaken promptly to reduce the
average funds rate to 13 per cent, on the understanding that the rate
would be permitted to decline to the neighborhood of 12 per cent should
money market factors work in that direction.

(2) Growth in the bank credit proxy over June and July is

expected to average close to 10 per cent, a less rapid expansion than in

other recent months. Business loan expansion, while weak in early June,

spurted from mid-June to early July, particularly at large banks. An

important share of this borrowing reflects a shift of financing demands

to banks that would ordinarily have been met in the commercial paper market



-3-

or by the issuance of corporate securities. Some firms that lack the

highest credit rating have been prevented from tapping the commercial

paper market because of investor unwillingness to buy their paper. In the

market for corporate and municipal securities a number of issues--especially

by public utilities--were canceled due to rapidly rising interest rates

and reluctance on the part of underwriters to make bids in the atmosphere

of rate uncertainty. In this environment, there has been some market

discussion of possible capital controls, which may have also contributed

to recent borrowing at banks.

(3) In June deposit growth at nonbank thrift institutions

(including interest credited) strengthened to a seasonally adjusted

annual rate of 7½ per cent from the depressed April-May level. This

improvement is probably temporary; partial data for early July indicate

large outflows at both New York savings banks and large California S&L's

following the mid-year interest crediting.

(4) Most short- and long-term interest rates have risen

sharply since the last meeting of the Committee. In the short-term

area commercial paper, CD's, and bankers' acceptances increased by

around 1 percentage point to levels ranging from 12¾-12¾ per cent in

the 3-month area. Bank prime rates generally have been increased to

12 per cent, but this level is low relative to currently prevailing

short-term rates. In contrast, short-term Treasury bill rates have

declined somewhat on balance, for three main reasons: the prime quality

characteristic of bills, active demands from foreign and small investors,

and recent large seasonal debt repayment by the Treasury. Corporate



-4-

and municipal bond yields have increased by about 90 basis points since

mid-June; even larger increases in these rates were forestalled by

cancelations and withdrawals of new issues. Treasury bond rates were

subject to much less upward pressure. As rates have adjusted upwards,

the ability of a number of borrowers with less than the highest quality

credit ratings to obtain funds in accustomed financial markets has been

impaired--including some industrial and real estate commercial paper

issuers, utilities, and bank holding companies. In addition, a few

regional commercial banks are experiencing problems in rolling over CD's,

especially in the national market, and some banks are reported to be

having difficulty placing their acceptances. Thus, yield spreads

representing risk differentials have widened markedly.

(5) During the first statement week following the June Committee

meeting the Federal funds rate edged up slightly to 11.97 per cent.

Thereafter, the funds rate jumped to record highs, averaging 13.55 per

cent in the week of July 3 and 13.34 per cent in the week of July 10. The

rise in the funds rate was influenced by churning around the mid-year

statement date and the July 4 holiday, uncertainties in both domestic and

international financial markets, the increasingly sensitive state of

CD and commercial paper markets, and perhaps a desire on the part of

lenders to obtain a risk premium on some of their placements. In this

environment, banks became more cautious in managing their money

positions, and some city banks--despite the high cost of Federal funds--

apparently wanted to stay out of the discount window in order to

establish a clean record in the case of future borrowing needs should

liquidity pressures grow still more intense. The reluctance of banks to

borrow at the window became evident in the week ending July 10, when member



-5-

bank borrowing, other than emergency borrowing, declined to a level of

$1.3 billion despite the record Federal funds rate. Excess reserves in

early July also were somewhat higher than they have been recently,

although this was in large part influenced by statement date window-

dressing.

(6) At the time of the telephone conference of the FOMC on

July 5, chances seemed good that the funds rate would recede with a

continuation of normal reserve-supplying operations. On the basis of

the discussion at that meeting, the Desk continued to resist the high

Federal funds rate without injecting an unusually large amount of reserves.

Subsequently, however, the funds rate remained well above 13 per cent,

and a majority of the members concurred in the Chairman's recommendation

of July 10 that System operations be undertaken promptly with a view

to reducing the average funds rate to 13 per cent, on the understanding

that the rate would be permitted to decline to the neighborhood of 12

per cent should money market factors work in that direction. Despite

large reserve-supplying operations, the funds rate remained about, 13½ per

cent on Thursday and Friday, but if reserve projections turn out to be

right it should decline somewhat after the weekend.

(7) The table on the next page shows (in percentage annual

rates of change) selected monetary and financial flows over various recent

time periods. Appendix table III compares money supply growth rates

computed on a quarterly-average basis with those computed on a last-month-

of-quarter basis. Projected figures on the two bases are shown in

appendix table IV for the three alternatives presented in the next section.

(9) Of the alternatives presented, alternative B represents

continuation of the longer-run target path for M1 adopted at the last

Committee meeting. In that alternative, the annual growth rate for the

second half of 1974 is 5½ per cent. This is slightly above the 5¼ per

cent rate adopted at the last meeting simply because the June level for

M1 turned out to be slightly lower than estimated at that time; the level

set for December is unchanged from the previous meeting.

(10) The specifications of alternative B would contemplate a

Federal funds rate in an 11-13 per cent range between now and the next

Committee meeting, and M1 growth for July-August in a 4-6 per cent annual

rate range. The funds rate centers on 12 per cent, which would represent

an easing from the money market conditions prevailing over the past two

weeks. Such a funds rate would probably lead to some relaxation in

pressures on short- and long-term markets, partly because investors and

borrowers would come to believe that monetary policy was a little less

restrictive than had appeared to be the case in the most recent weeks.

Any drop in market rates is likely to be modest in size and short-lived,

however, given the inflationary environment, continued strong credit

demands, and the forthcoming Treasury, Federal Financing Bank, and Agency

financings (both to raise cash and to refund maturing issues). Large

demands for U.S. securities by foreign official accounts, of course, could

modify this rate outlook appreciably in particular market sectors.

(11) On July 31, the Treasury will announce the terms on which

it will refund $4.4 billion of publicly held securities maturing in mid-

August. A modest amount of new cash may also be raised in early August,

and looking ahead to September, the Treasury will probably have to raise

about $3 billion of additional new cash. Private credit demands are also

expected to be substantial in both short- and long-term markets. With

markets increasingly cautious--and yield spreads between low and high

quality issues widening further--a sizable part of the market demand

may be diverted to banks as less than prime grade borrowers are forced

to fall back on credit lines. Thus, pressures on banks are likely to

remain intense.

(12) The ability of banks to finance additional loan demands

is expected to be relatively limited, though. With growth in demand

deposits and consumer-type time deposits constrained, banks will be



-9-

under pressure to issue new CD's. However, except for the prime names,

market receptivity to CD's is in some question. In general, the recent

concern with liquidity exposure, on the part of both banks and investors,

will probably reduce the pace at which new CD's will be offered. As a

result, bank credit growth under alternative B is projected at around an

8½ per cent annual rate over the third quarter, substantially less than

in the first half of the year. This rate of expansion would probably mean

that banks will have to cut back sharply on acquisitions of securities,

particularly municipal and Federal agency issues. Thus, interest rates

in intermediate and longer-term markets would likely come under renewed

upward pressure as time goes on. The bank prime loan rate would probably

also rise somewhat further.

(13) Under alternative B pressures on thrift institutions would

be expected to be somewhat greater than during the second quarter. Growth

in deposits at mutuals and savings and loan associations is expected to

drop slightly to about a 3½ per cent annual rate, making no allowance for

Citicorp and similar issues--the timing, terms, and volume of which are

still unknown. Rough estimates based on the terms originally announced

suggested that about half the funds for the $850 million Citicorp issue

would come out of thrift institutions, about a quarter out of banks, and

a quarter from other market instruments. For a one-month period, this

would represent a reduction in deposits at thrift institutions by 1½ per

cent at an annual rate and in consumer-type time deposits at banks by

¾ per cent at an annual rate.



-10-

(13) Alternatives A and C specify faster and slower rates of

growth in monetary aggregates, respectively, than alternative B.

Alternative C contemplates little change from the Federal funds rate

that has come to prevail in recent weeks, and this would be expected to

lead to a slowing in the growth rate of M1 to around 4 per cent over the

second half of this year. The market is currently in process of adjusting

to a funds rate in the 13 per cent area, although the process of

adjustment does not appear to be complete. Under this alternative,

interest rates would likely rise further in the weeks immediately ahead,

and would rise by more than under alternative B over the longer run.

Between now and the next Committee meeting, the 3-month commercial paper

rate might move up to the 13 per cent area, the CD rate would adjust

upward, and upward pressures on the prime loan rate would be very strong

given these still higher market rates. Inflows to thrift institutions

would be further curtailed, and the mortgage market--apart from Govern-

ment support--would come under even greater constraint than at present.

(14) Under alternative A--which contemplates M1 growth at

a 7 per cent annual rate over the second half of the year--the Federal

funds rate would be expected to decline to around 11 per cent between

now and the next Committee meeting, probably stimulating a fairly marked

decline of interest rates over a broad maturity spectrum. Interest

rate declines would be intensified in the short run as market attitudes

with respect to monetary policy shift and as Government security dealers

begin to cover short positions. However, given the size of prospective

borrowing demands and the concern over inflation, rate declines would



-11-

not be likely to cumulate. For example, recently postponed municipal and

corporate offerings would probably be re-offered shortly under the circum-

stances, and this would tend to moderate downward rate pressures. The

position of banks and thrift institutions would ease under this alternative,

though remaining on the tight side as compared with historical experience,

since an 11 per cent Federal funds rate implies a structure of market

rates still quite attractive relative to present Regulation Q ceilings.

(15) The possibility of a credit crunch in financial markets

cannot be ignored, especially under alternative C. Such a development

could be triggered by a series of failures of financial or industrial

concerns, here or abroad. This could lead to sharply higher rates and a

drying up of credit flows in markets where there is perceived to be

heightened credit risk and to lower rates in safe markets, such as the

Treasury securities market. Many borrowers would not be able to obtain

credit, and some bank and other institutional lenders would not be able

to tap their usual sources of funds. Under the circumstances, remedial

action by the System would be expected, either through the market or

through the discount window. As a result, whatever specifications are

adopted by the Committee would very likely have to be superseded, at

least temporarily, by other operating criteria. It should be recognized

in any event that the various specifications presented are more uncertain

than usual since the situation in financial markets and the economy is

unprecedented in the postwar period.



-12-

Proposed directive language

(16) Presented below are three alternative formulations

for the operational paragraph of the directive, which are intended

to correspond to the similarly lettered policy alternatives discussed

in the preceding section. For all three alternatives, it is proposed

to include a reference to Treasury financing because the regular August

refunding will be announced on July 31.

Alternative A

To implement this policy, while taking account of THE

FORTHCOMING TREASURY REFUNDING AND OF developments in domestic

and international financial markets, the Committee seeks to

[DEL: maintain about the prevailing restrictive] ACHIEVE BANK RESERVE

AND money market conditions [DEL: provided that] CONSISTENT WITH

GROWTH IN the monetary aggregates AT ABOUT THE RATES PREVAILING

OVER RECENT MONTHS [DEL: appear to be growing at rates within the

specified ranges of tolerance].

Alternative B

To implement this policy, while taking account of THE

FORTHCOMING TREASURY REFUNDING AND OF developments in domestic

and international financial markets, the Committee seeks to

[DEL: maintain the prevailing restrictive] ACHIEVE BANK RESERVE

AND money market conditions [DEL: provided that the] THAT WOULD

MODERATE GROWTH IN monetary aggregates OVER THE MONTHS AHEAD

[DEL: appear to be growing at rates within the specified ranges of

tolerance].



-13-

Alternative C

To implement this policy, while taking account of THE

FORTHCOMING TREASURY REFUNDING AND OF developments in domestic

and international financial markets, the Committee seeks to

[DEL: maintain about the prevailing restrictive] ACHIEVE BANK RESERVE

AND money market conditions [DEL: provided that the] THAT WOULD SLOW

APPRECIABLY THE GROWTH IN monetary aggregates OVER THE MONTHS

AHEAD [DEL: appear to be growing at rates within the specified ranges

of tolerance].

(17) In the event that the Committee again wishes to couch

the operational paragraph of the directive in terms of prevailing money

market conditions, the specifications of alternative C might be associated

with the language used in the directive adopted at the last meeting--

namely, that ". . .the Committee seeks to maintain about the prevailing

restrictive money market conditions, provided that the monetary aggregates

appear to be growing at rates within the specified ranges of tolerance."
