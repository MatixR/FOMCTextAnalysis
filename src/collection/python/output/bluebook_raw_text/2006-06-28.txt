MONETARY POLICY ALTERNATIVES 

Recent Developments 

(1) Although the decision at the May 10 FOMC meeting to raise the target 

federal funds rate 25 basis points to 5 percent was widely expected, the indication in 

the accompanying statement that “some further policy firming may yet be needed” 

reportedly prompted financial market participants to raise their near-term policy 

expectations slightly that afternoon.1  Over the intermeeting period, data releases on 

economic activity generally came in soft relative to expectations, while readings on 

inflation surprised to the upside, apparently leaving investors less optimistic about 

prospects for growth and more concerned about inflation.  Those inflation concerns 

seemed to be assuaged by the release of the FOMC minutes and speeches by several 

Federal Reserve policymakers.  The expected federal funds rate at the end of 2007 

rose about 25 basis points (Chart 1).  As judged from federal funds futures quotes and 

the Desk’s survey of primary dealers, market participants appear virtually certain that 

the FOMC will hike the target funds rate 25 basis points at its upcoming meeting, and 

place high odds on another such increase at the August meeting (see the box 

“Probabilities of Alternative Trajectories of Monetary Policy”).  The expected policy 

path currently peaks near 5½ percent toward the end of this year and then slopes 

down gradually thereafter.  Policy uncertainty, as measured by volatilities implied by 

Eurodollar options, remained low over the intermeeting period, as did the implied 

volatility of longer-term Treasury rates.  

                                           
1 The effective federal funds rate averaged near its intended level over most of the 
intermeeting period, but this morning federal funds are trading a few basis points above the 
target in anticipation of tightening at next Thursday’s meeting.  During the period, the Desk 
purchased $7.5 billion of Treasury coupon securities in the market.  The volume of 
outstanding long-term RPs declined $4 billion, to $11 billion.

Probabilities of Alternative Trajectories of Monetary Policy 
 
On the assumption that at each of its next two meetings the Committee will choose either to 
leave the target federal funds rate unchanged or to increase it by 25 basis points, there are 
four possible near-term paths for monetary policy.  Quotes on federal funds futures and 
options can be used to solve for the implied probabilities of each of these possible paths.  
The time series of these probabilities since just before the last FOMC meeting are shown in 
the chart below.   
 
Around the time of the May FOMC meeting, market participants apparently placed better-
than-even odds on the target federal funds rate being left unchanged at both the June and 
August meetings.  However, the probability of this outcome subsequently fell substantially, 
especially following the Chairman’s comments at the International Monetary Conference, 
and it is now close to zero.  Early in the intermeeting period, investors had viewed a pause in 
June followed by a rate hike in August as possible, but the assessed chance of that outcome 
has dwindled to zero.  The odds of a rate hike in June followed by a pause in August rose 
over most of the intermeeting period, and now stand a bit below 40 percent.  The 
probability of rate hikes at both the June and August meetings has climbed, especially 
following the release of May CPI data, and is now over 60 percent.

(2) Nominal Treasury yields showed mixed changes, on balance, over the 

intermeeting period:  Two-year yields rose about 25 basis points, consistent with the 

increase in near-term policy expectations.  However, forward rates at maturities of 

five years and beyond were little changed, leaving ten-year coupon yields up only 

about 10 basis points.  Inflation compensation calculated from yields on nominal and 

indexed Treasury securities fell about 10 basis points across the maturity spectrum.  

This drop, which was consistent with a decline in some survey measures of inflation 

expectations and reversed most of the increase posted earlier in the spring, appears to 

have been a reaction to statements by Federal Reserve officials suggesting a 

willingness to tighten policy in order to contain inflation risks, as well as to soft 

readings on economic activity and perhaps also to lower commodity prices.       

(3) The expectation of less robust economic performance and more substantial 

near-term monetary policy tightening apparently led investors to mark down their 

longer-term outlook for corporate earnings and, perhaps, to require more 

compensation for risk.  Major stock price indexes fell 5 to 9 percent over the 

intermeeting period, and a rough measure of the equity premium—the gap between 

the twelve-month forward trend earnings-price ratio and the real perpetuity Treasury 

yield—widened somewhat (Chart 2).  Actual and options-implied volatilities on 

equities jumped over the intermeeting period, in contrast to implied volatilities of 

interest rates.  Spreads over Treasuries on investment-grade corporate bonds rose 

about 15 basis points, and those on speculative-grade issues rose around 35 basis 

points, but both stayed narrow by the standards of recent years.  Broad measures of 

corporate credit quality generally continued to be favorable over the intermeeting 

period, and expected year-ahead defaults remained very low.  

(4) Investors’ confidence in the strength of the global expansion also flagged 

during the intermeeting period, a shift that was associated with substantial fluctuations 

in financial markets around the world.  Share prices in many industrial countries

recorded net declines of 6 to 11 percent (Chart 3).  Yields on long-term government 

securities were little changed on net in most major industrial countries, but in Japan 

they dropped 15 basis points.  The foreign exchange value of the dollar varied 

modestly over the period, declining in late May in reaction to the release of softer-

than-expected U.S. economic data but more than recouping that loss this month in 

response to changes in relative returns associated partly with expressions of the 

FOMC’s resolve against inflationary pressures.  BOJ authorities re-emphasized that 

any rise in policy rates will be gradual, and the dollar rose 5 percent versus the yen.  

Against the euro, the dollar gained about 1¾ percent over the period, as market 

participants interpreted ECB officials’ statements associated with the 25 basis point 

tightening in June as consistent with a slightly lower path for policy going forward 

than had been anticipated.  The dollar appreciated 1½ percent against the Canadian 

dollar.  On balance, the trade-weighted exchange value of the dollar against major 

foreign currencies rose about 2¼ percent over the intermeeting period.2 

(5) The cooling in equity markets in industrial countries was accompanied by a 

more pronounced chill in many emerging markets.  Brazilian and Mexican stock 

prices fell 17 percent over the period, and their EMBI+ spreads widened about 30 to 

40 basis points.  The dollar gained almost 9 percent against the real and about 

5 percent against the peso.  Stock prices in many Asian emerging markets also 

declined sharply during the period.  The dollar gained 2 to 7 percent against currencies 

of Asian countries with flexible exchange rates.  Central banks in a large number of 

emerging market economies firmed policy during the period, in some cases by 

substantially more than markets had expected.  Overall, the dollar rose 2¾ percent 

against an index of currencies of our other important trading partners.

(6) Growth of the debt of domestic nonfinancial businesses is estimated to 

have slowed a little in the second quarter to an 8½ percent annual rate (Chart 4).  This 

deceleration largely reflected some moderation in cash-financed mergers from the 

extraordinary first-quarter pace.  Commercial paper issuance has been weak so far in 

the current quarter, but growth of business loans has remained brisk.  Net issuance of 

corporate bonds has continued to be solid.  In the household sector, debt growth this 

quarter appears to have dropped below the double-digit rate that has prevailed for 

some time, as further increases in mortgage rates, the softening in housing activity, 

and a more moderate pace of house price appreciation have tempered the volume of 

mortgage borrowing.  Consumer credit has remained tepid in the current quarter.  In 

the federal sector, higher-than-anticipated tax payments have reduced the Treasury’s 

borrowing needs.  Overall, domestic nonfinancial sector debt is estimated to have 

decelerated notably to a 6¼ percent rate in the second quarter. 

(7) M2 growth in the second quarter, at 2¾ percent, has been weak, as nominal 

income growth has apparently slowed and the lagged cumulative effects of increases 

in opportunity costs have continued to sap M2 demand.  Liquid deposits have 

remained particularly soft, as rates on these instruments adjust only slowly to rising 

short-term rates.  Overall, M2 velocity is estimated to have increased at an annual rate 

of about 3 percent in the second quarter.

Economic Outlook 

(8) The staff’s reading of incoming data over the intermeeting period implies a 

less favorable starting point for the Greenbook forecast, with real GDP growth 

notably lower in the current quarter and inflation higher.  In particular, the bulge in 

core inflation is expected to be a bit larger and to last longer than in the May 

projection.  The staff forecast is now predicated on the federal funds rate moving up 

to 5¼ percent in June and staying there over the next one-and-one-half years, up 

¼ percentage point from the previous Greenbook.  The assumed policy path keeps 

longer-term Treasury yields at around current levels over the forecast period.  In the 

staff outlook, stock prices again rise at about a 6½ percent annual rate, but from a 

level that is 7 percent lower than in May, and the foreign exchange value of the dollar 

is again assumed to decline 2 percent per year, albeit from a somewhat higher point.  

In line with futures quotes, the price of WTI crude oil rises $2.50 by the end of this 

year and then is little changed in 2007, a path $4 to $6 lower than in the last forecast.  

Against this backdrop, the staff projects real GDP to increase at a 2¾ percent pace 

over the next six quarters, somewhat slower than in the May Greenbook.  With 

output expanding more slowly than its potential, the unemployment rate rises to 

5¼ percent by the end of the forecast horizon, a little above the staff’s estimate of the 

NAIRU.  This slack offsets only part of the impetus from the upside surprises in 

recent inflation releases, and the staff has increased its forecast of total and core PCE 

inflation to 2½ percent in 2006 and 2¼ percent in 2007.

Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) Page 10 of 41



Longer-Run Scenarios 

(9) Longer-run aspects of monetary policy strategies—including the selection of 

an inflation goal and the relative weight placed on different stabilization objectives—

can be informed by simulations of the FRB/US model.  This analysis starts by 

constructing an illustrative extension of the current Greenbook projection through 

2012, in which the natural rate of unemployment is assumed to hold steady at 

5 percent and the equilibrium real funds rate has a medium-run value of about 

2¾ percent.  The optimal policy balances three objectives:  keeping core PCE 

inflation close to a long-run goal; keeping unemployment close to its natural rate; and 

avoiding abrupt changes in the federal funds rate.3  The optimal path of the funds rate 

is determined in part by the weights assigned to these three policy objectives as well as 

by the goal for long-run inflation; it also depends importantly on the characteristics of 

the extended outlook and the structure of the FRB/US model.  In this analysis, 

policymakers and participants in financial markets, including those in the equity, bond, 

and foreign exchange markets, are assumed to understand fully the forces shaping the 

economic outlook, whereas households and firms are assumed to form their 

expectations using more limited information.     

(10) To get a sense of the recent evolution of the economic outlook, the first set 

of simulations, shown in Chart 5, compares the policy that best accomplishes the 

assumed objectives and macroeconomic outcomes implied by the current outlook 

(solid lines) with those implied by the extended outlook at the time of the January 

Bluebook (dashed lines).  In each of these simulations, policymakers are assumed to 

have a long-run inflation goal of 1½ percent and to place equal weights on the three 
                                           
3 Specifically, policy aims to minimize the weighted sum of squared deviations in four-
quarter average core PCE inflation from a long-run goal, squared deviations in 
unemployment from its natural rate, and squared changes in the federal funds rate (all 
measured in percent).  For further information regarding the specification and characteristics 
of optimal policy in the FRB/US model, see the memo to the Committee, “Optimal-Control 
Monetary Policies” by Michael Kiley, Thomas Laubach, and Robert Tetlow, June 20, 2006.

stabilization objectives.4  As shown in the upper-left panel, the current outlook 

implies a funds rate path that peaks a bit above 5½ percent in mid-2007 and then 

declines gradually to about 4½ percent by 2010.  This policy keeps the five-year real 

Treasury rate (upper-right panel) above its equilibrium value, thereby helping to 

restrain aggregate demand and pushing the unemployment rate (center panel) nearly 

½ percentage point above its natural rate later in the decade.  Although core PCE 

inflation (bottom panel) exhibits a near-term bulge related to transitory effects of the 

increase in energy prices, the persistent mild economic slack subsequently causes 

inflation to decline very slowly towards the long-run goal of 1½ percent.  Chart 5 also 

illustrates the implications of recent unfavorable price developments, with the implied 

funds rate path through the end of next year having shifted up about a percentage 

point since January.  Furthermore, because the staff sees recent inflation surprises as 

only partly transitory, the medium-run policy tradeoff is less favorable now:  In these 

simulations, both the unemployment rate and core inflation beyond 2007 are higher 

than in the January outlook.   

(11) The next set of simulations, shown in Chart 6, explores the implications of 

alternative long-run inflation goals. The solid lines replicate those of Chart 5, in which 

policymakers have an inflation goal of 1½ percent, while the dashed lines depict an 

alternative in which policy pursues an inflation goal of 2 percent.  Both paths are 

computed using the current Greenbook projection and put equal weight on the three 

policy objectives.  Under a 2 percent goal, the funds rate remains near 5 percent 

throughout the remainder of the decade.  This flat trajectory largely reflects the extent 

to which core inflation is already close to the specified goal of 2 percent, looking 

beyond the transitory effects of recent energy price increases.  Accordingly, the stance 

of policy is set to keep the unemployment rate near its natural rate.   

                                           
4 In conducting this analysis, the January Greenbook projection is extended using the same 
set of procedures employed for the current Greenbook extension.

(12) Chart 7 depicts the consequences of alternative choices regarding the 

relative weights assigned to the three policy objectives.  The solid lines replicate those 

of Chart 5, in which policymakers have an inflation goal of 1½ percent and place 

equal weights on the objectives.  A potentially unattractive implication of this 

specification is that attainment of the inflation objective is a long time coming, with 

actual inflation at the end of the decade still nearly ½ percentage point above the goal.  

The alternative scenario (dashed lines) depicts the outcome when policymakers place 

greater emphasis on the inflation objective, perhaps because of concerns—not 

explicitly considered in the model—that a persistent deviation of inflation from its 

goal could damage the Federal Reserve’s credibility.5  In this case, the federal funds 

rate climbs more steeply to 6 percent by the end of next year.  This policy generates 

higher real interest rates that damp real activity more than under the baseline policy; as 

a result, the unemployment rate rises above 5½ percent late next year and remains 

above that level through 2010.  With this additional economic slack, actual inflation 

exhibits a more distinct downward trajectory and approaches the long-run goal by the 

end of the decade.  

                                           
5 In particular, the weight on unemployment gaps was lowered from 1.0 to 0.05, while the 
weights on the inflation objective and changes in the funds rate were maintained at 1.0.

Short-Run Policy Alternatives 

(13) This Bluebook presents three alternatives for the Committee’s 

consideration, summarized by the draft statements in Table 1.  Under Alternative A, 

the Committee would leave the federal funds rate unchanged at this meeting and 

indicate that it would likely stay its hand for at least one more meeting before deciding 

whether further tightening was necessary.  Under Alternative B, the Committee would 

tighten 25 basis points and signal that an additional tightening in August was possible.  

Alternative C combines a 50 basis point increase in the target with a statement 

suggesting that additional firming was likely.   

(14) If the Committee finds the staff forecast both probable and as desirable as 

can be achieved in current circumstances, it may choose to tighten policy 25 basis 

points at this meeting, as in Alternative B.  A 25 basis point firming would raise the 

real federal funds rate somewhat above most of the staff’s estimates of the 

equilibrium federal funds rate (Chart 8), a moderately restraining stance of policy that 

might be viewed as appropriate given the worsening of the inflation outlook.  Such a 

firming might also be seen as necessary to contain the risk that the near-term bulge in 

inflation could become entrenched in expectations.  In that regard, members might be 

heartened by the fact that the building market expectation of additional policy firming 

in recent weeks was associated with some apparent decline in inflation expectations—

progress that they might be loathe to surrender by surprising investors with an easier-

than-anticipated policy action.  The current configuration of asset prices, however, 

might be judged as embedding too great a likelihood of policy tightening at the 

August meeting.  If so, the Committee would presumably seek to craft its statement to 

convey an assessment that an additional move in August was possible but perhaps not 

as likely as currently anticipated in financial markets.   

(15) Under Alternative B, the rationale paragraph could indicate that economic 

growth appears to be moderating.  The Committee could list the developments adding

2.  Economic growth has been quite 
strong so far this year.  The Committee 
sees growth as likely to moderate to a 
more sustainable pace, partly reflecting a 
gradual cooling of the housing market 
and the lagged effects of increases in 
interest rates and energy prices. 

Recent indicators suggest that 
economic growth is moderating 
considerably from its quite strong pace 
earlier this year. 

Recent indicators suggest that 
economic growth is moderating from 
its quite strong pace earlier this year. 

Recent indicators suggest that 
economic growth is moderating 
from its quite strong pace earlier 
this year, but the level of resource 
utilization remains relatively high.   

Rationale 

3.  As yet, the run-up in the prices of 
energy and other commodities appears 
to have had only a modest effect on core 
inflation, ongoing productivity gains 
have helped to hold the growth of unit 
labor costs in check, and inflation 
expectations remain contained.  Still, 
possible increases in resource utilization, 
in combination with the elevated prices 
of energy and other commodities, have 
the potential to add to inflation 
pressures. 

The Committee views the pickup in 
core inflation this spring as 
unwelcome but likely to be transitory.  
Ongoing productivity gains, anchored 
inflation expectations, and moderate 
economic growth should reduce 
inflation in coming quarters. 

Readings on core inflation have been 
elevated in recent months.  Ongoing 
productivity gains have held down the 
rise in unit labor costs, and inflation 
expectations remain contained.  
However, the high levels of resource 
utilization and of the prices of energy 
and other commodities have the 
potential to sustain inflation pressures.   

Ongoing productivity gains and 
contained inflation expectations 
should restrain inflation going 
forward.  However, recent readings 
on core inflation have been 
elevated, which the Committee 
views as unwelcome. 

4.  The Committee judges that some 
further policy firming may yet be needed 
to address inflation risks but emphasizes 
that the extent and timing of any such 
firming will depend importantly on the 
evolution of the economic outlook as 
implied by incoming information. 

The Committee judges that the risks to 
the attainment of price stability remain 
tilted to the upside but recognizes that 
the moderation in the growth of 
aggregate demand, along with other 
forces, should work to contain 
inflation going forward.  While the 
Committee judges that some further 
policy firming may yet be needed to 
address inflation risks, considerable 
uncertainty attends the outlook, 
making it prudent to await the 
accumulation of additional 
information. 

Although the moderation in the 
growth of aggregate demand should 
help to contain inflation pressures, the 
Committee judges that the risks to the 
attainment of price stability remain 
tilted to the upside.  The extent and 
timing of any further policy action will 
depend importantly on the evolution 
of the economic outlook as implied by 
incoming information.   

In order to foster price stability and 
sustainable economic growth, the 
Committee seeks a medium-term 
decline in core inflation from its 
recent elevated levels.  The 
Committee judges that some further 
policy firming may yet be needed to 
accomplish this outcome.  The 
extent and timing of any such 
firming will depend importantly on 
the evolution of the economic 
outlook as implied by incoming 
information.

Equilibrium Real Rate Chart: Explanatory Notes 
The equilibrium real rate is the real federal funds rate that, if maintained, would be projected to return output to its 
potential level over time.  For the first three measures listed below, the short-run equilibrium rate is defined as the 
rate that would close the output gap in twelve quarters given the corresponding model’s projection of the 
economy.  For the first two measures, the medium-run concept is the value of the real federal funds rate projected 
to keep output at potential in seven years under the assumption that monetary policy acts to bring actual and 
potential output into line in the short run and then keeps them equal thereafter.  The TIPS-based factor model 
measure provides an estimate of market expectations for the real federal funds rate seven years ahead.  The actual 
real federal funds rate is constructed as the difference between the nominal rate and realized inflation, where the 
nominal rate is measured as the quarterly average of the observed federal funds rate, and realized inflation is 
given by the log difference between the staff’s estimate of the core PCE price index and its lagged value four 
quarters earlier.  For the current quarter, the nominal rate is specified as the target federal funds rate on the 
Bluebook publication date.   

Measure Description 

Single-equation 
Model  

The measure of the equilibrium real rate in the single-equation model is based on an 
estimated aggregate-demand relationship between the current value of the output gap and 
its lagged values as well as the lagged values of the real federal funds rate.  In light of this 
model’s simple structure, the short-run measure of the equilibrium real rate depends only 
on the recent position of output relative to potential, and the medium-run measure is 
virtually constant. 

Small Structural 
Model 

The small-scale model of the economy consists of equations for five variables: the output 
gap, the equity premium, the federal budget surplus, the trend growth rate of output, and 
the real bond yield.  Unlike the estimates from the single-equation model, values of the 
equilibrium real rate also depend directly on conditions associated with output growth, 
fiscal policy, and capital markets. 

Large Model 
(FRB/US) 

Estimates of the equilibrium real rate using FRB/US—the staff’s large-scale econometric 
model of the U.S. economy—depend on a very broad array of economic factors, some of 
which take the form of projected values of the model’s exogenous variables.  These 
projections make use of several simple forecasting rules which are appropriate for the 
three-year horizon relevant for the short-run concept but are less sensible over longer 
horizons.  Thus, we report only the short-run measure for the FRB/US model. 

Greenbook-
consistent  

Measures of the equilibrium real rate cannot be directly obtained from the Greenbook 
forecast, because the Greenbook is not based on a formal model.  Rather, we use the 
FRB/US model in conjunction with an extended version of the Greenbook forecast to 
derive a Greenbook-consistent measure.  FRB/US is first add-factored so that its 
simulation matches the extended Greenbook forecast, and then a second simulation is run 
off this baseline to determine the value of the real federal funds rate that closes the output 
gap.  The medium-run concept of the equilibrium real rate is not computed because it 
requires a relatively long extension of the Greenbook forecast. 

TIPS-based 
Factor Model 

Yields on TIPS (Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities) reflect investors’ expectations of 
the future path of real interest rates, but also include term and liquidity premiums.  The 
TIPS-based measure of the equilibrium real rate is constructed using the seven-year-ahead 
instantaneous real forward rate derived from TIPS yields as of the Bluebook publication 
date.  This forward rate is adjusted to remove estimates of the term and liquidity 
premiums based on a three-factor arbitrage-free term-structure model applied to TIPS 
yields, nominal yields, and inflation.  Because TIPS indexation is based on the total CPI, 
this measure is also adjusted for the medium-term difference—projected at 40 basis 
points—between total CPI inflation and core PCE inflation. 

 

Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) Page 20 of 41



to inflation pressure, including taut resource markets and elevated oil and commodity 

prices, and acknowledge the recent pickup in core inflation.  The rationale could also 

note the forces acting to reduce inflation pressures, such as the subdued increases in 

unit labor costs and the continued containment of inflation expectations.  To indicate 

that further tightening was possible but not certain, the assessment of risk could note 

that, while forces that should restrain inflation were at work, the risks to inflation 

continued to be on the upside.  The Committee could again note that any further 

policy action will depend on the evolution of the economic outlook.  

(16) Market participants are somewhat more confident that the Committee will 

tighten at its August meeting than the wording of Alternative B suggests.  As a result, 

investors would trim back their near-term policy expectations, and short-term interest 

rates would probably decline slightly.  The policy surprise might add to expected 

volatility, as market participants became a little less sure of the predictability of the 

Committee’s behavior.  The downward revision to expectations would tend to lower 

longer-term yields, but some of that decline might be offset by a backup in term 

premiums.  Stock prices would likely rally some, and downward pressure on the 

foreign exchange value of the dollar could emerge. 

(17) The Committee might instead desire a more forceful policy response to the 

deterioration in the inflation outlook and find some appeal in the 50 basis point 

tightening of Alternative C.  Although measures of inflation expectations have edged 

lower on balance in recent weeks, they have risen since earlier this year, potentially 

adding momentum to actual inflation.  Moreover, resource utilization appears to be 

relatively high, and some policymakers have noted that inflation is already above a 

range they see as consistent with price stability.  In these circumstances, the 

Committee might be concerned by the risk that the recently higher readings on 

inflation could get embedded in inflation expectations along the lines of the “rising 

inflation expectations” alternative simulation in the Greenbook.  The Committee may 

Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) Page 21 of 41



also favor a more sizable move now so as to make more rapid progress toward 

moving inflation lower.  In the alternative policy simulation presented earlier, the 

pursuit of a 1½ percent inflation target requires additional tightening in the near term, 

especially so if inflation deviations receive a higher relative weight in the FOMC’s 

objective function.  If policymakers believed that additional firming, beyond a 50 basis 

point policy move at this meeting, probably would be necessary, they may find it 

appropriate to indicate a fairly high likelihood that further tightening was in train.  

Such an indication may be particularly appealing if firmer financial conditions were 

judged to be desirable to make satisfactory progress toward the Committee’s 

objectives.   

(18) The rationale paragraph under Alternative C could place more emphasis on 

the recent unwelcome pickup in inflation while noting that productivity gains and 

contained inflation expectations are restraining inflation.  To signal that further 

tightening is likely, the risk assessment could indicate that additional policy action may 

be needed to reduce core inflation to a more desirable level.  So that the Committee 

would not become locked into additional tightening even if there were additional 

elevated monthly readings on core inflation, the assessment could specify that the 

reduction in core inflation was sought in the medium term and repeat that the extent 

and timing of firming would depend on the evolution of the economic outlook.       

(19) The announcement of Alternative C would lead market participants to 

revise upward their outlook for the path for policy, and short- and intermediate-term 

interest rates would rise as a result.  Longer-term interest rates could also rise, 

especially if investors concluded that the FOMC was much more worried about 

underlying inflation than previously thought.  Stock prices would fall substantially, and 

the foreign exchange value of the dollar would increase. 

(20) If, in contrast, the Committee is particularly concerned by the soft tone to 

the incoming data on spending, it might feel that the best course of action at this 

Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) Page 22 of 41



meeting would be to leave the stance of policy unchanged, as in Alternative A.  With 

news on spending and prices pointing in different directions, the Committee could 

combine such a policy move with statement language implying that policy would likely 

be on hold in the near term to await additional information, although policy firming 

was likely at some point down the road.  Leaving policy unchanged at the current 

meeting would be consistent with the prescriptions from a number of simple and 

estimated policy rules (Charts 9 and 10).  Indeed, most of those rules call for an easier 

policy than currently priced into financial markets, suggesting that the level of the 

federal funds rate may have already been brought up enough to prevent an 

unsustainable spurt in economic growth.  Staff estimates of equilibrium real interest 

rates indicate that cumulative tightening to date has effectively removed policy 

accommodation.  Given the lags in policy, the easing of pressures on resources 

expected to result from this prior tightening, together with the anticipated flattening 

out of energy prices, may be seen as likely to be sufficient to point inflation down 

toward an acceptable range.  Moreover, the Committee may see significant downside 

risk to the outlook if it views the recent marked declines of indicators of housing 

activity as possible harbingers of a prolonged and sizable reduction in housing 

construction and household spending along the lines of the “housing slump” 

Greenbook scenario. 

(21)  To explain a choice to leave policy unchanged, the rationale paragraph 

could emphasize the considerable slowdown in economic activity.  That slowing, 

anchored inflation expectations, and subdued advances in labor costs could be cited 

as reasons why the recently elevated readings on core inflation, while unwelcome, 

should prove transitory.  The risk assessment could reflect the Committee’s concerns 

by indicating downside risks to growth and upside risks to inflation, which would 

justify a pause in policy to await additional information bearing on the outlook.

Policy Rule Charts: Explanatory Notes 
 

For the rules described below, it denotes the federal funds rate for quarter t, while the explanatory 
variables include the staff’s estimate of trailing four-quarter core PCE inflation (πt), its forecasts  
of inflation two and three quarters ahead (πt+2|t and πt+3|t), its assessment of the current output gap 
( *t ty y− ), its one-quarter-ahead forecast of the output gap ( *1| 1|t t t ty y+ +− ), its three-quarter-ahead 
forecast of annual average GDP growth relative to potential ( 4 4 *3| 3|t t t ty y+ +Δ − Δ ), and the assumed value 
of policymakers’ long-run inflation objective ( *π ).    
Rule prescriptions are computed using dynamic simulations of the FRB/US model, implemented as 
though the rule is followed starting at this FOMC meeting.  This quarter’s prescription is a weighted 
average of the actual value of the federal funds rate thus far this quarter and the value obtained from the 
FRB/US model simulations using the timing of this meeting within the quarter to determine the weights.  
Finally, for the forecast-based rule and the first-difference rule, it should be noted that prescriptions near 
the end of the Greenbook horizon also depend on an extension of the Greenbook baseline forecast. 
  
Estimated Policy Rules:  Estimation is performed using real-time quarterly data taken from the 
Greenbook and staff memoranda closest to the middle of each quarter.  The specific lag structure of the 
outcome-based rule is chosen according to the Bayesian information criterion over the sample period 
starting from 1988Q1.  The forecast-based rule differs from the outcome-based rule in that it also 
permits staff forecasts of inflation and the output gap to be among the explanatory variables.  
Confidence intervals, shown only for the outcome-based rule, are based on stochastic simulations of the 
FRB/US model, where the shocks are randomly drawn from the set of model equations residuals for the 
period 1986-2004.  The following table indicates the specification of each rule and its root mean squared 
error (RMSE) over the sample 1993:1-2005:4.

(22) Markets would be surprised, to say the least, if the Committee left the stance 

of policy unchanged, and short-term interest rates would drop.  Longer-term interest 

rates could rise if market participants concluded that the FOMC was willing to 

tolerate a higher level of inflation over time than had previously been thought and so 

marked up inflation compensation.  The foreign exchange value of the dollar would 

probably fall.  Stock prices likely would rise, given the lower real interest rates.   

Money and Debt Forecasts 

(23) Under the Greenbook forecast, M2 is expected to expand just 4 percent in 

2006, reflecting the moderate growth in nominal income and the restraining effects of 

past policy tightenings (Table 2).  With short-term interest rates unchanged after the 

June meeting, opportunity costs gradually level out, and M2 growth picks up to 

5 percent in 2007, matching the growth in nominal income. 

(24) Growth of domestic nonfinancial sector debt is projected to drop from 

9½ percent last year to 8 percent in 2006 and 6½ percent in 2007.  The slowdown 

reflects the contours of the staff outlook for nominal GDP and, in the near term, a 

reduction in federal debt growth owing to the surprisingly strong tax receipts this 

spring.  In addition, merger and acquisition activity is expected to moderate next year, 

contributing to a decline in business borrowing.  Moreover, past increases in home 

mortgage rates and the projected deceleration of home prices restrain household debt 

growth over the forecast horizon.

Directive and Balance of  Risks Statement 

(25) Draft language for the directive and draft risk assessments identical to those 

presented in Table 1 are provided below. 

Directive Wording 
The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and financial 

conditions that will foster price stability and promote sustainable growth 

in output.  To further its long-run objectives, the Committee in the 

immediate future seeks conditions in reserve markets consistent with 

MAINTAINING/increasing/REDUCING the federal funds rate 

AT/to an average of around ________________ 5 percent. 

Risk Assessments  

A. The Committee judges that the risks to the attainment of price stability 

remain tilted to the upside but recognizes that the moderation in the 

growth of aggregate demand, along with other forces, should work to 

contain inflation going forward.  While the Committee judges that some 

further policy firming may yet be needed to address inflation risks, 

considerable uncertainty attends the outlook, making it prudent to await 

the accumulation of additional information. 

B. Although the moderation in the growth of aggregate demand should 

help to contain inflation pressures, the Committee judges that the risks 

to the attainment of price stability remain tilted to the upside.  The 

extent and timing of any further policy action will depend importantly 

on the evolution of the economic outlook as implied by incoming 

information.  In any event, the Committee will respond to changes in 

economic prospects as needed to support the attainment of sustainable 

economic growth and price stability. 

Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) Page 29 of 41



C. In order to foster price stability and sustainable economic growth, the 

Committee seeks a medium-term decline in core inflation from its recent 

elevated levels.  The Committee judges that some further policy firming 

may yet be needed to accomplish this outcome.  The extent and timing 

of any such firming will depend importantly on the evolution of the 

economic outlook as implied by incoming information.

Inflation Indicator Based on M2

Note: P* is defined to equal M2 times V* divided by potential GDP. V*, or long-run velocity, is estimated
using average velocity over the 1959:Q1-to-1989:Q4 period and then, after a break, over the interval from
1993:Q1 to the present. For the forecast period, P* is based on the staff M2 forecast and P is simulated using a
short-run dynamic model relating P to P*. Blue areas indicate periods in which P* is notably less than P.
Gray areas denote the projection period.
