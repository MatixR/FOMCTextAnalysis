MONETARY POLICY ALTERNATIVES 

Recent Developments1 

(1) Investors had anticipated the FOMC’s decision at its March meeting to raise 

the target federal funds rate 25 basis points, to 4¾ percent, but the retention of the 

language that “some further policy firming may be needed” evidently led them to 

mark up somewhat their expected path for the federal funds rate.2  Subsequently, 

speeches by Federal Reserve officials, the release of the minutes of the March FOMC 

meeting, and the Chairman's testimony before the Joint Economic Committee were 

generally taken to suggest that the FOMC was more likely than had previously been 

thought to leave policy unchanged after one more move.  Money market futures rates 

rose in response to key data releases that were read as indicating greater global 

economic strength and higher inflation pressures than had been expected.  On net, 

federal funds futures rates for the end of this year and beyond increased 25 to 35 basis 

points, and the expected policy path currently peaks at about 5.2 percent toward the 

end of this year before sloping down gradually over 2007 (Chart 1).  Option-implied 

uncertainty about the path for money market rates edged up but remains low in its 

historical range.  The Desk survey and futures quotes suggest that investors are 

virtually certain of a 25 basis point increase in the target funds rate at the May FOMC 

meeting and see a roughly one-in-three chance of a like-sized move in June.   

(2) Over the intermeeting period, yields on two- and ten-year nominal Treasury 

securities rose 25 and 45 basis points, respectively.  The ten-year rate, at 5.23 percent, 
                                           
1 Financial market quotes are as of the close of business on Thursday, May 4. 
2 The effective federal funds rate averaged 4.79 percent over the intermeeting period.  In the 
last few days, the funds rate traded on the firm side despite a sizable provision of reserves by 
the Desk, as reserve managers at banks once again anticipated policy firming by the 
Committee.  The Desk purchased $1.1 billion of Treasury coupon securities in the market.  
The volume of outstanding long-term RPs increased $1 billion, to $15 billion.

is now above its level just prior to the onset of the current round of policy tightening.  

A rise in distant-horizon forward rates, possibly owing to a modest rebound in term 

premiums, accounted importantly for this movement in yields (see box entitled “The 

Recent Rise in Distant-Horizon Forward Rates and Term Premiums”).  Yields on 

TIPS rose less than those on comparable-maturity nominal Treasury securities.  The 

15 basis point climb in near-term inflation compensation can largely be attributed to 

the rise in energy prices.  In contrast, with survey measures of long-run inflation 

expectations unchanged to 20 basis points higher, the 20 basis point increase in five-

to-ten-year forward inflation compensation appears to reflect both expectations of 

higher inflation and an increase in the inflation risk premium. 

(3) Major stock price indexes were up a bit over the intermeeting period, as 

positive first-quarter earnings reports more than offset the negative effects of higher 

energy prices and interest rates (Chart 2).  The implied volatility of equity prices 

remained near historical lows.  With the rise in long-term real Treasury yields, the 

equity premium is estimated to have narrowed a bit, though it remains slightly above 

its average level of the past two decades.  Measures of the credit quality of 

nonfinancial firms remained solid, supported by gains in earnings and by strong and 

liquid balance sheets.  Spreads of yields on investment-grade bonds over those on 

comparable-maturity Treasury securities were about unchanged, while spreads on 

speculative-grade bonds declined. 

(4) The trade-weighted exchange value of the dollar against major foreign 

currencies fell 4¾ percent on balance over the intermeeting period (Chart 3).  The 

dollar’s decline came amid fairly widespread signs of stronger global growth that 

boosted investors’ expectations of further monetary policy tightening abroad.  

Increased focus in public debate on risks posed by the large U.S. external imbalance 

also appeared to erode investor support for the dollar.  The dollar dropped 

3¼ percent versus the yen, about 4¾ percent versus the euro, and nearly 5½ percent

The Recent Rise in Distant-Horizon Forward Rates and Term Premiums 
 
In the Treasury market, the nine-to-ten-year-ahead nominal forward rate climbed 60 basis 
points over the intermeeting period, while the comparable indexed forward rate from TIPS 
rose about 35 basis points.  Thus, distant-horizon forward inflation compensation increased 
about 25 basis points.  Judging from the staff’s arbitrage-free term structure model, the ten-
year instantaneous forward nominal term premium—which includes compensation for 
inflation risk—moved up notably over the intermeeting period (lower left panel).  
Nonetheless, the estimated term premium remains well below its historical average and is 
nearly a percentage point below its level at the beginning of the current tightening cycle.   
 
The recent rise in distant-horizon forward rates appears to be a global phenomenon, with 
such rates posting substantial increases in other major industrialized countries (lower right 
panel).  The correlation between these foreign and domestic forward rates has been 
particularly high over the last two years, suggesting that their movements owe predominantly 
to international factors.  However, over the intermeeting period, forward rates have risen 
more in the United States than in foreign countries, and inflation compensation has moved 
up more in U.S. markets than in other countries, perhaps in part as a result of the recent 
depreciation of the dollar and concerns that more is in store. 
 
The reasons for the apparent backup in U.S. term premiums of late are hard to ascertain, but 
may include heightened inflation concerns, some waning of foreign demand for Treasury 
securities that has been evident in recent auctions and in custody holdings at the Federal 
Reserve Bank of New York, and investors’ reassessment of the appropriate pricing of 
interest-rate risk.

versus the Canadian dollar.  The Canadian currency, and those of several other smaller 

commodity exporters, appeared to be boosted by the sharply higher prices of oil and 

some other key primary products.  On April 25, the Bank of Canada raised its policy 

rate 25 basis points and signaled that further policy tightening was likely.  On May 3, 

the Reserve Bank of Australia also raised its policy rate 25 basis points.  Yields on 

long-term government securities in major foreign industrial countries moved up 25 to 

30 basis points on balance, somewhat less than increases in comparable U.S. yields 

over the period.  Based on returns on inflation-indexed securities, the advances in 

nominal yields abroad appear to owe mostly to higher real yields.  Stock prices in 

foreign industrial countries recorded gains of 1 to 3 percent. 

(5) The dollar fell about 1¼ percent against an index of currencies of our other 

important trading partners.  

 
3  Upward pressure on Asian currencies 

may have been accentuated by the G-7 statement calling for “greater exchange rate 

flexibility…in emerging economies with large current account surpluses, especially 

China.”  Although Chinese authorities allowed only a slight appreciation of the yuan 

over the period, they did announce some changes in foreign exchange regulations; 

they also raised their benchmark lending rate 27 basis points and issued guidance on 

lending to certain sectors intended to slow investment growth.  Central banks in 

Brazil and Mexico cut their policy rates again, but the Bank of Mexico added that it 

saw no room for further easing for the foreseeable future.  Both countries continued 

to benefit from favorable financial conditions:  EMBI+ spreads narrowed, and stock

prices recorded increases close to 10 percent.  The Brazilian real strengthened 

substantially, while the Mexican peso was about unchanged versus the dollar over the 

period. 

(6) Domestic nonfinancial sector debt is estimated to have grown at a 

9¼ percent annual rate in the first quarter, down only slightly from the brisk pace in 

2005 (Chart 4).  Business sector debt appears to have expanded at an 8¾ percent rate, 

supported by robust net issuance of U.S. corporate bonds and a double-digit 

expansion of business loans at commercial banks.  Results from the latest Senior Loan 

Officer Opinion Survey indicate that banks eased standards and terms for C&I loans 

further.  In the household sector, consumer credit has continued to expand slowly.  

Although only limited data are currently available, growth of household mortgage 

debt is projected to have moderated somewhat in the first quarter against a backdrop 

of higher mortgage interest rates, some signs of a deceleration in house prices, and 

reports in the Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey indicating lower demand for 

residential mortgage loans.  Federal debt is estimated to have expanded at nearly a 13 

percent rate in the first quarter, a pace roughly in line with first-quarter growth a year 

earlier.   

(7) M2 advanced at a 6½ percent pace during the first quarter, somewhat below 

the growth rate of nominal GDP, and expanded moderately in April.  This recent 

growth has been due importantly to increases in small time deposits, which have been 

buoyed by favorable offering rates.

Economic Outlook 

(8) The sharp run-up in energy prices over the intermeeting period, together 

with somewhat larger-than-expected increases in core consumer prices, led the staff to 

boost its inflation outlook for the near term.  News on output and spending also came 

in above staff expectations, but little of this additional strength is expected to persist 

in the forecast.  In view of the intensification of inflation pressures, the staff forecast 

now assumes that the Committee will leave the funds rate at 5 percent after this 

meeting rather than easing slightly next year, as was the case in the March Greenbook.  

In the current forecast, longer-term Treasury yields edge lower as market expectations 

for monetary policy come into alignment with the staff assumption, equity prices rise 

at a rate sufficient to produce risk-adjusted returns about equal to those on fixed-

income instruments, and house price appreciation slows substantially.  The real 

foreign exchange value of the dollar against a broad basket of currencies is assumed to 

decline at an average rate of a little over 2 percent over the forecast period.  In line 

with futures quotes, the staff forecasts that the price of West Texas intermediate 

crude oil will be around $75 per barrel over the projection period, roughly $11 per 

barrel higher than in the last forecast.  Against this backdrop, the staff projects that 

real GDP will expand 3¾ percent in 2006 and 3 percent in 2007, close to the March 

Greenbook projection.  With output growing a bit less quickly than potential next 

year, the unemployment rate is expected to creep up to 5 percent, the staff’s estimate 

of the NAIRU.  Core PCE inflation is now expected to be 2¼ percent this year, 

slightly above the March forecast, but to edge down to 2 percent next year as energy 

prices flatten out.  Total PCE prices are seen as rising about 2½ percent and 2 percent 

in 2006 and 2007, respectively. 

Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) Page 10 of 41



Longer-Run Scenarios 

(9) Simulations of the FRB/US model provide a longer-term perspective that 

could help inform the Committee’s near-term policy choice.  To that end, staff 

extended the basic features of the Greenbook outlook through 2010.  In that 

extension, monetary policy adjusts to hold core PCE inflation at about 2 percent.  In 

the absence of any significant supply shocks or changes in expectations, the 

unemployment rate remains near the 5 percent staff estimate of the NAIRU.  The 

associated medium-run value of the equilibrium real funds rate is about 2¾ percent, 

which implies a modest step-down in the nominal funds rate to roughly 4¾ percent 

after 2007.  With this as the baseline, the model can be used to simulate the effects of 

alternative assumptions for monetary policy over the next few years.  In these 

simulations, participants in financial markets—including those in the equity, bond, 

and foreign exchange markets—are assumed to understand fully the forces shaping 

the economic outlook, whereas households and firms are assumed to form their 

expectations using more limited information.   

(10) To shed light on the implications of ending the process of policy firming,  

the first simulation considers a policy trajectory in which the federal funds rate is held 

constant at its current level through 2010 rather than being raised to 5 percent as in 

the Greenbook.  The policy path beyond 2010 is set using the aggressive Taylor rule 

as described below in the explanatory notes for policy rules.  As shown in the upper 

left panel of Chart 5, the funds rate path in this alternative scenario (the dashed line) is 

a bit lower than under the extended baseline (the solid line) over the next two years 

and a bit higher thereafter.  Under the assumption that this policy path is fully 

anticipated by financial market participants, the alternative scenario produces a slightly 

lower trajectory for longer-term real interest rates over the next two years relative to 

the baseline.  This in turn generates a modestly lower path for the unemployment rate

during 2007 and 2008 and slightly higher core inflation through the remainder of the 

decade.  

(11) Because policy paths that merely hold inflation around its current rate might 

not be viewed as acceptable by the Committee, the next set of simulations examines 

policies that would generate a more rapid decline in core inflation toward an inflation 

objective of 1½ percent.  In these simulations, the funds rate reaches 5¾ percent later 

this year and remains at that rate through at least mid-2008 (Chart 6).  Two different 

scenarios illustrate the role of inflation expectations in determining the 

macroeconomic effects of the additional policy tightening.  In one, long-term inflation 

expectations respond only sluggishly to inflation outcomes (the dashed lines); in the 

other, expectations are assumed to converge to the 1½ percent target by late 2008, as 

might be the case if the public became convinced that the Committee had that 

inflation goal (the dotted lines).  In the first scenario, making significant progress in 

reducing inflation involves holding the funds rate at 5¾ percent through the end of 

2008 and then cutting it to 4¼ percent over the course of 2009.  Under these 

conditions, the unemployment rate rises steadily to about 5½ percent over the next 

two years and does not start to return to the NAIRU until late in the decade; this slack 

helps generate a slow decline in core inflation.  In the second scenario, the more rapid 

adjustment of long-run inflation expectations brings about a more rapid decline in 

actual inflation with less slack in economic activity.  As a result, policymakers can 

begin cutting the funds rate noticeably earlier, and because investors fully anticipate 

the timing of the future policy easing, nominal and real yields on longer-term bonds 

rise somewhat less than in the first scenario.

Short-Run Policy Alternatives 

(12) This Bluebook presents three alternatives for the Committee’s 

consideration, summarized by the draft statements in Table 1.  Under Alternative A, 

the Committee leaves the federal funds rate unchanged at this meeting.  It also 

indicates a best guess that, if any adjustment to the stance of policy subsequently 

proved necessary, it likely would be upward.  Under Alternative B, the target for the 

federal funds rate is raised another 25 basis points at this meeting, and the risk 

assessment suggests that the Committee may pause in June.  Under Alternative C, the 

target for the funds rate is raised 50 basis points and the risks are described as 

balanced without mention of additional policy action.  All three alternatives provide a 

fuller description of the rationale for policy action and some forward-looking 

language about the economic outlook.   

(13) If the Committee believes that the outcome projected by the staff in the 

Greenbook forecast is both likely and best balances the Federal Reserve’s dual 

objectives, then it may wish to couple another 25 basis point firming at this meeting 

with a risk assessment that hints that the tightening cycle may be coming to a close, as 

in Alternative B.  A quarter-point move at this meeting would bring the cumulative 

tightening since June 2004 to 4 percentage points.  While a portion of that rise has 

been offset by higher inflation, real short-term interest rates have been boosted 

appreciably as well, from below zero to around 2¾ percent as measured using trailing 

core PCE inflation as a proxy for expected inflation.  The real federal funds rate has 

been lifted to around the middle of the range of model-based estimates of its short-

run equilibrium (Chart 7) and to a level about equal to the equilibrium rate implicit in 

the Greenbook projection.  Members may also view the recent backup in longer-term 

rates as augmenting the financial restraint imposed by higher short-term interest rates.  

Indeed, under the staff forecast, the maintenance of the nominal funds rate at 

5 percent through 2007 would foster financial conditions that would slow output

2. The slowing of the growth of 
real GDP in the fourth quarter of 
2005 seems largely to have 
reflected temporary or special 
factors. Economic growth has 
rebounded strongly in the current 
quarter but appears likely to 
moderate to a more sustainable 
pace. 

Economic growth rebounded to nearly a 
5 percent annual rate in the first quarter.  The 
Committee sees growth as likely to moderate 
to a sustainable pace, partly reflecting a 
gradual cooling of the housing market, other 
lagged responses to previous rate increases, 
and the effects of energy price increases.

Rationale 

3. As yet, the run-up in the prices 
of energy and other commodities 
appears to have had only a 
modest effect on core inflation, 
ongoing productivity gains have 
helped to hold the growth of unit 
labor costs in check, and inflation 
expectations remain contained. 
Still, possible increases in 
resource utilization, in 
combination with the elevated 
prices of energy and other 
commodities, have the potential 
to add to inflation pressures.

well contained.  Still, possible increases in

4. The Committee judges that 
some further policy firming may 
be needed to keep the risks to 
the attainment of both 
sustainable economic growth and 
price stability roughly in balance.  

Against this backdrop, the Committee 
preferred to await additional information 
about economic developments before taking 
any further action.  The Committee sees the 
risks to its price stability objective as slightly 
to the upside and judges it more likely that its 
next policy action will be a tightening rather 
than an easing.   

To keep the risks to the attainment of 
both sustainable economic growth and 
price stability roughly in balance, some 
further policy firming may be needed.  
The Committee judges that any 
additional firming is likely to be modest.  
However, the extent and timing of any 
such firming will depend importantly on 
the evolution of the economic outlook as 
implied by incoming information. 

The Committee judges that, with this 
action, the risks to the attainment of 
both sustainable economic growth and 
price stability are roughly in balance.

Equilibrium Real Rate Chart: Explanatory Notes 
The equilibrium real rate is the real federal funds rate that, if maintained, would be projected to return output to its 
potential level over time.  For the first three measures listed below, the short-run equilibrium rate is defined as the 
rate that would close the output gap in twelve quarters given the corresponding model’s projection of the 
economy.  For the first two measures, the medium-run concept is the value of the real federal funds rate projected 
to keep output at potential in seven years under the assumption that monetary policy acts to bring actual and 
potential output into line in the short run and then keeps them equal thereafter.  The TIPS-based factor model 
measure provides an estimate of market expectations for the real federal funds rate seven years ahead.  The actual 
real federal funds rate is constructed as the difference between the nominal rate and realized inflation, where the 
nominal rate is measured as the quarterly average of the observed federal funds rate, and realized inflation is 
given by the log difference between the staff’s estimate of the core PCE price index and its lagged value four 
quarters earlier.  For the current quarter, the nominal rate is specified as the target federal funds rate on the 
Bluebook publication date.   

Measure Description 

Single-equation 
Model  

The measure of the equilibrium real rate in the single-equation model is based on an 
estimated aggregate-demand relationship between the current value of the output gap and 
its lagged values as well as the lagged values of the real federal funds rate.  In light of this 
model’s simple structure, the short-run measure of the equilibrium real rate depends only 
on the recent position of output relative to potential, and the medium-run measure is 
virtually constant. 

Small Structural 
Model 

The small-scale model of the economy consists of equations for five variables: the output 
gap, the equity premium, the federal budget surplus, the trend growth rate of output, and 
the real bond yield.  Unlike the estimates from the single-equation model, values of the 
equilibrium real rate also depend directly on conditions associated with output growth, 
fiscal policy, and capital markets. 

Large Model 
(FRB/US) 

Estimates of the equilibrium real rate using FRB/US—the staff’s large-scale econometric 
model of the U.S. economy—depend on a very broad array of economic factors, some of 
which take the form of projected values of the model’s exogenous variables.  These 
projections make use of several simple forecasting rules which are appropriate for the 
three-year horizon relevant for the short-run concept but are less sensible over longer 
horizons.  Thus, we report only the short-run measure for the FRB/US model. 

Greenbook-
consistent  

Measures of the equilibrium real rate cannot be directly obtained from the Greenbook 
forecast, because the Greenbook is not based on a formal model.  Rather, we use the 
FRB/US model in conjunction with an extended version of the Greenbook forecast to 
derive a Greenbook-consistent measure.  FRB/US is first add-factored so that its 
simulation matches the extended Greenbook forecast, and then a second simulation is run 
off this baseline to determine the value of the real federal funds rate that closes the output 
gap.  The medium-run concept of the equilibrium real rate is not computed because it 
requires a relatively long extension of the Greenbook forecast. 

TIPS-based 
Factor Model 

Yields on TIPS (Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities) reflect investors’ expectations of 
the future path of real interest rates, but also include term and liquidity premiums.  The 
TIPS-based measure of the equilibrium real rate is constructed using the seven-year-ahead 
instantaneous real forward rate derived from TIPS yields as of the Bluebook publication 
date.  This forward rate is adjusted to remove estimates of the term and liquidity 
premiums based on a three-factor arbitrage-free term-structure model applied to TIPS 
yields, nominal yields, and inflation.  Because TIPS indexation is based on the total CPI, 
this measure is also adjusted for the medium-term difference—projected at 40 basis 
points—between total CPI inflation and core PCE inflation. 

 

Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) Page 18 of 41



growth to a pace a little below that of its potential, slightly easing pressures on 

resources and promoting a modest downward tilt in core inflation to rates below 

2 percent late in the forecast period and beyond.  Even if the Committee is not 

convinced that output growth would slow to this extent if the funds rate were 

maintained at 5 percent, it might nonetheless believe that the stance of policy is not 

far from neutral.  If so, a pause in policy firming before long would be unlikely to 

jeopardize the Committee’s price stability objective and might be appropriate to allow 

a better assessment at a later date of the cumulative effects of its policy actions. 

(14) Under Alternative B, the rationale paragraph could indicate that spending is 

likely to slow because of a cooling of the housing market and the restraint imparted by 

increases in energy prices and interest rates.  The Committee could repeat its analysis 

in the March statement of recent factors affecting inflation, but then acknowledge that 

a slight rise in inflation expectations could also add to inflation pressures.  To treat its 

dual objectives symmetrically, row 3 includes the Committee’s expectation that core 

inflation will remain contained, just as there is forward-looking language on economic 

growth in the previous row.  In view of the additional quarter-point firming that 

would be implemented under this alternative, the risk assessment might be softened a 

little relative to that released after the last meeting by adding “The Committee judges 

that any additional firming is likely to be modest” and adopting some of the language 

of the Chairman’s recent testimony:  “the extent and timing of any such firming will 

depend importantly on the evolution of the economic outlook as implied by incoming 

information.”  Inclusion of the reference to “timing” is intended to suggest that 

additional firming would not necessarily take place at the June meeting.  If the 

Committee saw only a small probability that it would act again in June, it could tune 

the message by replacing the second sentence of row 4 with “The Committee judges 

that additional firming, if any, is likely to be modest.”  In either case, the dependency 

Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) Page 19 of 41



of future policy actions on data could be underscored by essentially reiterating the 

final sentence from the March announcement.  

(15) Investors seem sure of a 25 basis point hike in the federal funds rate at this 

meeting and see only about a one-in-three chance of a similar move in June.  The 

statement accompanying Alternative B would likely maintain or slightly increase these 

odds.  Market interest rates could back up a few basis points, and downward pressure 

on the dollar might be reduced a bit, at least for a time, and equity prices could 

decline. 

(16) The sizable rise over the intermeeting period in long-term nominal interest 

rates (which apparently included a significant pickup in compensation for expected 

inflation), the weakening of the exchange value of the dollar, and the rise in some 

survey measures of inflation expectations could be read by members as evidence of an 

erosion in the public’s confidence in the Committee’s commitment to price stability.  

If so, the combination of a half-point action at this meeting and the words presented 

in Alternative C might be appealing.  With energy prices having risen sharply further 

in recent weeks, the Committee could be concerned that elevated energy and 

commodity prices and relatively high levels of resource utilization may begin to leave a 

more distinct imprint on core inflation and inflation expectations.  Moreover, 

members may believe that core inflation currently is already at or above the upper end 

of an acceptable range, inclining them to foster a steeper downward trajectory in 

inflation than that forecast in the Greenbook.  In that regard, the alternative 

simulation provided earlier suggests that the nominal federal funds rate would need to 

reach 5¾ percent by year-end to foster a 1½ percent inflation goal over the next few 

years.   

(17) The rationale portion of the policy statement associated with Alternative C 

could temper the expectation of a moderation in growth with the observation that 

“data confirming a slowing in growth have been sparse.”  As in March, the inflation 

Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) Page 20 of 41



paragraph could cite limited energy-price pass-through and productivity gains as 

having helped to hold inflation in check, but would not indicate that the Committee 

expected core inflation to remain contained.  Reasserting that “inflation expectations 

are contained” might be problematic, and, as in Alternative B, rising inflation 

expectations could be cited as a factor that could add to inflation pressures.  In light 

of the size of the policy move, the Committee might want to declare that the risks to 

its dual objectives are balanced.   

(18) The policy action and statement associated with Alternative C would catch 

market participants unawares.  Real bond yields could jump up noticeably; the rise in 

nominal yields would be somewhat less if inflation expectations declined—but that 

would depend on the extent to which investors took the action as an assertion of the 

Committee’s anti-inflation resolve.  The recent tendency toward weakness in the 

foreign exchange value of the dollar would likely be checked, and stock prices would 

decline.  Given the size of the policy surprise, volatility, both actual and implied, could 

rise. 

(19) The likely reaction in financial markets, which could be sizable, to a 50 basis 

point increase in the target for the federal funds rate might diminish the appeal of 

Alternative C for the Committee.  But some of the rationale language of this 

alternative could be used to stiffen the policy statement announcing a quarter-point 

increase and thus make it more likely that financial markets would build in high odds 

of a like-sized action in June.  For instance, the Committee could combine the 

rationale paragraphs of Alternative C with the risk assessment of Alternative B.  To 

make it more likely that market participants price in an additional move, the 

Committee could strike the sentence characterizing additional firming as likely to be 

“modest” in row 4 of Alternative B.  This might be favored if the Committee was 

impressed by the resilience of aggregate demand in the face of the substantial increase 

in energy prices and concerned that the momentum of spending could push the level 

Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) Page 21 of 41



of output well above the economy’s potential.  Indeed, if the Committee harbored a 

suspicion that economic slack had already been more than eliminated, it might see 

increased inflation pressures as a palpable risk.  In that vein, members might read the 

most recent figures on new and existing home sales as suggesting that the housing 

market, while off its peak, is not cooling quickly enough to provide much assurance 

that overall economic growth is in the process of slowing to potential.  In that regard, 

the “domestic boom” alternative simulation in the Greenbook, which puts the funds 

rate at 6¼ percent by year-end 2007, may strike some members as an uncomfortably 

plausible outcome.      

(20) In contrast, the Committee may believe that further policy tightening at this 

meeting is not necessary or desirable and that, at least for now, maintaining the 

current stance of policy is appropriate, as in Alternative A.  As noted previously, the 

cumulative firming of policy to date has been significant, and the real federal funds 

rate is now well within the range of model-based estimates of its equilibrium value.  In 

these circumstances, the Committee may wish to pause to obtain more information 

that would be useful in assessing whether further action will be necessary.  Put 

differently, policy accommodation now appears to have been eliminated, and, with 

core inflation remaining contained—and perhaps believed likely to edge lower over 

time—despite sharp increases in energy and commodity prices, the Committee may 

not feel a need to move from a roughly neutral posture to a restrictive stance.  That is 

the message of the simulation presented earlier:  If the equilibrium real rate is in the 

neighborhood of 2¾ percent, a 2 percent inflation goal could be achieved by holding 

the nominal funds rate at 4¾ percent.  Indeed, estimated monetary policy rules imply 

that the existing stance of policy is about appropriate or even a little firmer than 

would be predicted by past Committee behavior (Chart 8).  Model simulations using a 

number of simple policy rules also suggest that further tightening may not be required 

at this time (Chart 9).  And even if members believe that further tightening could

Policy Rule Charts: Explanatory Notes 
 

For the rules described below, it denotes the federal funds rate for quarter t, while the explanatory 
variables include the staff’s estimate of trailing four-quarter core PCE inflation (πt), its forecasts  
of inflation two and three quarters ahead (πt+2|t and πt+3|t), its assessment of the current output gap 
( *t ty y− ), its one-quarter-ahead forecast of the output gap ( *1| 1|t t t ty y+ +− ), its three-quarter-ahead 
forecast of annual average GDP growth relative to potential ( 4 4 *3| 3|t t t ty y+ +Δ − Δ ), and the assumed value 
of policymakers’ long-run inflation objective ( *π ).    
Rule prescriptions are computed using dynamic simulations of the FRB/US model, implemented as 
though the rule is followed starting at this FOMC meeting.  This quarter’s prescription is a weighted 
average of the actual value of the federal funds rate thus far this quarter and the value obtained from the 
FRB/US model simulations using the timing of this meeting within the quarter to determine the weights.  
Finally, for the forecast-based rule and the first-difference rule, it should be noted that prescriptions near 
the end of the Greenbook horizon also depend on an extension of the Greenbook baseline forecast. 
  
Estimated Policy Rules:  Estimation is performed using real-time quarterly data taken from the 
Greenbook and staff memoranda closest to the middle of each quarter.  The specific lag structure of the 
outcome-based rule is chosen according to the Bayesian information criterion over the sample period 
starting from 1988Q1.  The forecast-based rule differs from the outcome-based rule in that it also 
permits staff forecasts of inflation and the output gap to be among the explanatory variables.  
Confidence intervals, shown only for the outcome-based rule, are based on stochastic simulations of the 
FRB/US model, where the shocks are randomly drawn from the set of model equations residuals for the 
period 1986-2004.  The following table indicates the specification of each rule and its root mean squared 
error (RMSE) over the sample 1993:1-2005:4.

eventually prove necessary to address upside risks to inflation, they may see no 

urgency to implement such restraint.  Such an assessment might be importantly 

influenced by members’ regional knowledge of the housing situation.  With national 

data, particularly survey information, pointing to some cooling, the Committee may 

put some weight on the “housing slump” alternative simulation in the Greenbook, 

which suggests that if significant confidence effects accompany a drop in housing 

values, then considerably easier monetary policy would be warranted. 

(21) The rationale section of the Committee’s statement associated with 

Alternative A could begin like that in Alternative B but soften the characterization of 

the outlook for growth to “likely to moderate to a sustainable pace.”  It could use 

essentially the same paragraph discussing inflation as that for Alternative B, but retain 

the assertion that “inflation expectations remain contained” and emphasize the 

expectation that core inflation will remain “well contained.”  The risk assessment 

might be revised considerably from that employed at recent meetings.  In particular, it 

could indicate that “Against this backdrop, the Committee preferred to await 

additional information about economic developments before taking any further 

action.  The Committee sees the risks to its price stability objective as slightly to the 

upside and judges it more likely that its next policy action will be a tightening rather 

than an easing.”  To accommodate those changes, the final sentence of the risk 

assessment might be modified slightly to read “In any event, the Committee will 

respond to changes in the economic outlook, as implied by incoming information, as 

needed to foster its objectives of sustainable economic growth and price stability.”   

(22) Both the absence of policy action and the statement associated with 

Alternative A would come as a considerable surprise to market participants.  Short-

term market rates would probably drop by about 25 basis points as market 

participants removed all but a small probability of near-term policy firming.  The 

effect on bond yields would depend in part on whether inflation expectations were 

Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) Page 26 of 41



adversely affected by the lack of tightening at this meeting and the suggestion that 

policy could be on hold for some time.  If inflation expectations were unperturbed, 

bond yields most likely would decline, stock markets rally, and the foreign exchange 

value of the dollar weaken. 

Money and Debt Forecasts 

(23) Under the Greenbook forecast, M2 growth is projected to expand 5 percent 

this year, restrained by a further increase in the opportunity cost of holding M2.  As a 

result, M2 velocity would rise about 1½ percent, after increases of 1½ and 2½ percent 

in 2004 and 2005, respectively.  Next year, M2 growth is forecast at 5½ percent, in 

line with the expansion in nominal GDP, as opportunity costs are expected to be 

about unchanged on balance following the leveling off of short-term market interest 

rates. 

(24) Domestic nonfinancial sector debt growth is expected to slow to 

7¼ percent this year from last year’s 9½ percent increase.  Household debt growth is 

likely to fall off fairly sharply, reflecting a deceleration in mortgage debt, but at 

8 percent is nonetheless projected to remain relatively brisk.  Business sector debt is 

seen as expanding 7½ percent, only a little lower than last year’s pace, with the 

proceeds of a considerable portion of the borrowing slated to finance equity 

retirement.  Despite the widening of the federal budget deficit, federal debt growth 

slows to 6¾ percent in 2006.  Next year, overall debt growth is projected to drop 

further, reflecting a noticeable slowdown in the nonfederal components.

Directive and Balance of  Risks Statement 

(25) Draft language for the directive and draft risk assessments identical to those 

presented in Table 1 are provided below. 

Directive Wording 

The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and financial 

conditions that will foster price stability and promote sustainable growth 

in output.  To further its long-run objectives, the Committee in the 

immediate future seeks conditions in reserve markets consistent with 

MAINTAINING/increasing/REDUCING the federal funds rate 

AT/to an average of around ____________ 4¾percent.   

Risk Assessments  

A.    Against this backdrop, the Committee preferred to await additional 

information about economic developments before taking any 

further action.  The Committee sees the risks to its price stability 

objective as slightly to the upside and judges it more likely that its 

next policy action will be a tightening rather than an easing.  In any 

event, the Committee will respond to changes in the economic 

outlook, as implied by incoming information, as needed to foster its 

objectives of sustainable economic growth and price stability.   

B.    To keep the risks to the attainment of both sustainable economic 

growth and price stability roughly in balance, some further policy 

firming may be needed.  The Committee judges that any additional 

firming is likely to be modest.  However, the extent and timing of 

any such firming will depend importantly on the evolution of the 

economic outlook as implied by incoming information.  In any 

Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) Page 29 of 41



event, the Committee will respond to changes in economic 

prospects as needed to support the attainment of its objectives. 

C.    The Committee judges that, with this action, the risks to the attainment 

of both sustainable economic growth and price stability are roughly in 

balance.  In any event, the Committee will respond to changes in 

economic prospects as needed to foster these objectives.

Inflation Indicator Based on M2

Note: P* is defined to equal M2 times V* divided by potential GDP. V*, or long-run velocity, is estimated
using average velocity over the 1959:Q1-to-1989:Q4 period and then, after a break, over the interval from
1993:Q1 to the present. For the forecast period, P* is based on the staff M2 forecast and P is simulated using a
short-run dynamic model relating P to P*. Blue areas indicate periods in which P* is notably less than P.
