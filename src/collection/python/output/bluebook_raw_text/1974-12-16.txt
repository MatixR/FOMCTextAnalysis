MONETARY AGGREGATES AND
MONEY MARKET CONDITIONS

Recent developments

(1) M1 grew at about a 7 per cent annual rate in November,

and data for early December suggest that the growth rate in prospect

for November and December combined is about 6½ per cent. This would

be at the low end of the Committee's two-month range of tolerance. In

the case of M2 , the estimate for November and December combined shows a

growth rate of about 8½ per cent, somewhat above the low end of the range

of tolerance, as growth in consumer-type time and savings deposits at

banks has been strong. Bank credit expansion, as measured by the proxy,

has been modest. The outstanding volume of large CD's dropped in

November, but growth picked up in early December, partly in anticipation

of forthcoming maturities around the tax date.

(2) Evidence that the monetary aggregates were expanding at

annual rates near the low ends of the Committee's ranges of tolerance

became available shortly after the November FOMC meeting. The Desk

moved to a less restrictive reserve management posture, expecting the

Federal funds rate to move down to around 9¼ per cent from the 9-3/8--

9-1/2 per cent area. During the statement week ending November 27,

however, the funds rate averaged 9.46 per cent as banks elected to hold

a very large amount of excess reserves over the Thanksgiving holiday.

In early December, the funds rate finally eased, averaging about 9 per

cent in the week ending December 4. With growth in the monetary aggregates

continuing near the low ends of the Committee's ranges of tolerance, and

with the discount rate reduced from 8 to 7¾ per cent on December 6, the

Desk has most recently been aiming at a Federal funds rate around 8¾ per

cent or a little below.

(3) Shifts in bank demands for excess reserves and borrowings

have complicated the task of monetary management in recent weeks. Member

bank borrowing at Reserve Banks rose to an average of about $1.4 billion

in the two statement weeks ending December 4, which bracketed the Thanksgiving

holiday. Excess reserves were large in both weeks, averaging about $500

million. In the statement week just ended, member bank borrowings

declined to an average of only $647 million and excess reserves were

negative, in part because banks had sizable carry-over reserve surpluses

from the previous week.



-3-

(4) Because market participants had widely anticipated a further

easing of money market conditions following the November Committee meeting,

the initial tendency for the Federal funds rate to level off at around 9½

per cent was reflected in a snap-back of short- and long-term market rates.

When the Federal funds rate resumed its decline, most other market rates

also began to move down again; the December 6 cut in the discount rate,

to 7¾ per cent, accelerated this process. Recently, rates on Treasury and Federal

agency securities have dropped below the levels prevailing at the time of

the last Committee meeting. but yields on private market instruments remain

somewhat higher, and those on municipal issues have continued to rise.

Weakness in the municipal sector has reflected the continuing lack of

demand from key investor groups.

(5) Savings flows to non-bank thrift institutions--like those

to banks--strengthened further in November and early December. At the

S and L's, November growth was around an 8½ per cent seasonally adjusted

annual rate and at the savings banks it was around 6½ per cent. At both

types of institutions the November performance was nearly as favorable

as in the same month a year ago, and roughly the same pattern of flows

appears to be continuing in early December. The combination of improved

savings flows and a limited supply of mortgages available for immediate

delivery has resulted in declining mortgage rates throughout the inter-

meeting period.

(6) The table on the following page shows (in percentage annual

rates of change) selected monetary and financial flows over various

recent time periods. Appendix table IV compares money supply growth rates

Prospective developments

(7) Summarized below for Committee consideration are four

alternative sets of specifications for key monetary variables (with more

detailed data shown in the table on page 6a. The length of

the period to which the longer-run growth rates of the aggregates

apply (November '74-June '75) has been kept the same as in recent blue

books, but the period has been shifted forward to encompass the two

quarters ahead. Since money supply data for December are still based

mainly on projections, November has been taken as the base month and thus

the period is actually seven months. (In recent blue books August

had been used as the base for longer-run growth rates, which had

encompassed the fourth quarter of 1974 and the first quarter of 1975).

shows the relationship to this path (extended to June) of the longer-run

growth rates for M1 contained in the four alternatives shown above.

(9) The 5½ per cent growth rate in M1 from November forward,

under alternative D, appears to be consistent with prevailing money

market conditions, as typified by a Federal funds rate around 8¾ per

cent. Under this alternative M1 may be expected to grow in a 4¼-6¼ per

cent annual rate range in the two month December-January period. This

alternative does not contemplate making up for recent shortfalls in M1

growth.

(10) Alternatives C and B involve growth rates of M1 of 6

and 6½ per cent, respectively, through the first half of next year.

Under alternative B the level of M1 by June is the same as that obtained

by extending the 5¾ per cent August-March growth path to June. This

alternative is consistent with the basic chart show projection, which

assumes the same catch-up in M1 growth and also assumes continuation of

the 5 per cent basic M1 growth path throughout the chart show projection

period (to mid-1976). Under alternative C, the catch-up period would

extend into the fall.

(11) Because of the further weakening in GNP growth, pro-

jected by the staff, some further decline in interest rates over the

next few months now appears to be required to achieve the monetary

aggregate objectives of either alternatives C or B. Between now and the

next Committee meeting, alternative C would appear to entail a Federal

funds rate of around 8-3/8 per cent, and alternative B around 8 per cent--

the mid-points of the ranges shown in paragraph (7). M1 growth in the

December-January period under both alternatives may be on the low side



-8-

of longer-run growth rates, but growth would be expected to increase

somewhat later on as a result of the lagged impact on money demand of

the further interest rate declines.

(12) Alternative A encompasses a higher 7¼ per cent annual rate

of growth in M1 between now and mid-year. The Federal funds rate under

this alternative would be likely to drop to the 7¼-7½ per cent area by

mid-January. The implications for economic activity and prices of moving

on to such a growth path for M1 will be analyzed in the chart show.

(13) Although demands in credit markets are in process of

moderation, they remain fairly strong in particular market sectors.

Corporate demands for long-term funds still appear to be quite substantial,

and business short-term borrowing may be sustained temporarily by involuntary

inventory accumulation. In the municipal market, demands also remain

sizable, while institutional investor interest appears to be very limited.

Moreover, larger than seasonal borrowing by the Treasury can be expected

during the winter. Against this background, it would appear that further

declines in interest rates over the next few weeks may be limited in the

absence of a noticeable further decline in the Federal funds rate, and

interest rates could back up some.

(14) A drop in the funds rate to aroung 8-3/8 per cent would

probably forestall tendencies for interest rates to back up, and would

likely lead to a modest renewal of rate declines. A drop in the funds

rate to around 8 per cent would have an appreciable downward effect on

short-term market rates, would trigger further declines in bank prime

loan rates, and would more noticeably ease long-term market conditions.



-9-

Market expectations of a further decline in the discount rate might

begin to develop, but they would become much more pronounced if the

funds rate were to drop as much as is implied under alternative A.

(14) Net inflows of time and savings deposits (other than

money market CD's) at banks are likely to continue to be relatively strong

under each of the alternatives presented, with growth highest, of course,

under the easiest alternative. The position of thrift institutions

probably also will continue to improve, even under alternative D.

However, it would probably require a further decline in market interest

rates, and an accompanying more rapid inflow of savings funds,to ensure

a significant liberalization in mortgage loan commitment policies by

thrift institutions.

(15) Banks are likely to moderate offerings of large CD's

in the period ahead, given the expected availability of funds from other

sources, reduced loan demands, and continued conservative bank invest-

ment and lending policies. Offerings could remain on the strong side,

however, until year-end if banks attempt to show a lengthening in their

liability structure in their December 31 statement by reducing reliance

on Federal funds. Should market interest rates begin to drop sharply,

banks might well step up CD offerings in order to acquire securities

in anticipation of capital gains.



-10-

Proposed directive

(16) Presented below are four alternative formulations for

the operational paragraph of the directive, which are intended to

correspond to the similarly lettered policy alternatives discussed in

the preceding section.

Alternative A

To implement this policy, while taking account of

developments in domestic and international financial markets,

the Committee seeks to achieve bank reserve and money market

conditions consistent with MORE RAPID [DEL: moderate] growth in monetary

aggregates over the months ahead.

Alternative B

To implement this policy, while taking account of

developments in domestic and international financial markets,

the Committee seeks to achieve bank reserve and money market

conditions consistent with SOMEWHAT MORE RAPID [DEL: moderate] growth

in monetary aggregates over the months ahead.

Alternative C

To implement this policy, while taking account of

developments in domestic and international financial markets,

the Committee seeks to achieve bank reserve and money market

conditions consistent with moderate growth in monetary aggregates

over the months ahead.



-11-

Alternative D

To implement this policy, while taking account of develop-

ments in domestic and international financial markets, the

Committee seeks to achieve bank reserve and money market

conditions consistent with RELATIVELY SLOW [DEL: moderate] growth in

monetary aggregates over the months ahead.

NOTE: Government security dealer trading positions are on a commitment basis. Trading positions, which exclude Treasury bills financed by repurchase agree-

ments maturing in 16 days or more, are indicators of dealer holdings available for sale over the near-term. Other security dealer positions are debt

issues still in syndicate, excluding trading positions. The basic reserve deficit is excess reserves less borrowing at Federal Reserve less net Federal

funds purchases. Weekly data are daily averages for statement weeks, except for corporate and municipal issues in syndicate which are Friday figures.

* STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL

** Monthly averages for excess reserves and borrowings are weighted averages of statement week figures.
