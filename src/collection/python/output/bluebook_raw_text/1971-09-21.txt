MONEY MARKET CONDITIONS

Recent developments

(1) Growth in M1 slowed sharply in August, both in relation

to the rapid expansion actually experienced in July and in relation to

the increase projected for August at the time of the last Committee

meeting. Growth of M2 and the adjusted credit proxy also fell short of

projections in August. Data for the first two weeks in September--with

the second week still partly estimated--indicate that rates of expansion

for the two money supply aggregates have continued to fall substantially

short of expectations, whereas the proxy has moved somewhat above path.

(2) The slower August growth in M1 and M2 largely reflected a

substantial weakness in private demand deposits at reserve city banks

which may well have been associated in part with dollar outflows through

foreign exchange transactions. (This conclusion is supported by the demand

deposit ownership survey for August, which showed a sharp drop in that

month in business demand balances.) With a major portion of the resultant

dollar accumulations by foreign central banks being invested in special

U.S. Treasury securities (which increased by $5.3 billion in August), U.S.

Government deposits expanded, offsetting much of the slowdown in private

demand deposits.

(3) Immediately following the last FOMC meeting, Desk operations

were directed toward attaining money market conditions that included a

Federal funds rate in the neighborhood of 5-1/2--5-5/8 per cent. In early

September, incoming deposit data showed that actual growth in key aggre-

gates was falling short of projections, and the Desk became somewhat more

accommodative in reserve provision. Unusual pressures developed in the

money market during the Labor Day week, however, resulting from cautious

bank reserve management over the 3-day week-end and possibly related to

augmented Federal fund demands related to interest arbitrage between the

domestic and Euro-dollar markets. Despite sizable reserve supplying

operations on the part of the Desk, the average Federal funds rate was

about 5-3/4 per cent in the Labor Day week. Most recently, with the

aggregates showing further weakness, the Federal funds rate has dropped,

and the Desk is now aiming at a rate in a 5-1/4--5-1/2 per cent range.

(4) Over the past three statement weeks, the Desk has supplied

more nonborrowed reserves than were indicated by the reserve paths



consistent with the monetary aggregate targets adopted at the last meeting,

as shown in the table on the next page. This occurred despite a slight

reduction in required reserves on balance. With the greater provision in

nonborrowed reserves, member banks' net borrowed reserve position was less

taut than projected--with excess reserves somewhat higher than projected

and borrowings at the discount window considerably lower. Total reserves

turned out to be somewhat above path on balance. Compared to a reserve

path adjusted for the unanticipated reductions in reserves required against

U.S. Government deposits (as shown by the numbers in parentheses in the

table), the attained levels of total and nonborrowed reserves are even

higher relative to path.

(5) In securities markets, the initial exuberance following

announcement of the new economic program faded somewhat in early

September. Treasury bill rates, wnich had previously declined sharply as

a result of neavy foreign official demands, reversed course in early

September as foreign demands abated and as earlier market expectations of

an easing in tne Federal funds rate failed to materialize. Most recently,

as the money market has turned more comfortable, bill rates have stabilized

with the latest bid on the 3-month bill a little under 4-3/4 per cent. Note

and bond yields rose after early September, partly reflecting the develop-

ment of a wait-and-see attitude among investors regarding phase II of the

President's economic program. The adjustment was largest in the corporate

bond sector where a build-up in the forward calendar of new issues and an

overhang of dealer inventories created by over-aggressive pricing of earlier

President at his press conference on Thursday which were taken to

Prospective developments

(7) Financial relationships are still bedevilled by uncertainties

related to how the new economic program will evolve; in particular, concern

focuses on phase II of wage-price policies and the outcome of international

negotiations on foreign exchange rates and related matters. A disappointing

follow-through for phase II would probably reverse the recent improvement in

market and public psychology and lead to substantial upward pressures on

interest rates. We have assumed, however, a generally effective follow-

through. In the international sphere the timing of the return-flow of the

sizable speculative outflow of dollar funds is a major uncertainty. We have

assumed no significant return at least between now and year-end.

(8) Two alternative sets of operating specifications for Committee

consideration are summarized in the text table below. The specifications in

the first column can be drawn upon for the policy directives A or B, as

explained in the section on possible directive language beginning on page 12.

The table on the next page shows monthly paths for the spectrum of monetary

aggregates, while two tables attached at the end of the text contain weekly

paths for the monetary aggregates and more detail on aggregate reserves

thought to be consistent with the two paths.

(9) As compared with the first seven months of the year, the

growth in M1 is expected to continue at a sharply reduced rate between

now and year-end--particularly if money market conditions do not ease

significantly from around prevailing levels--as the lagged effects on

domestic cash demands of earlier higher short-term interest rates take

hold and as precautionary demands for cash are reduced further in the

wake of the President's program. Under alternative A--which contemplates

a Federal funds rate in a 5--5-5/8 per cent range--the annual rate of growth

in M1 is likely to be only about one or two per cent in September and around

3-1/2 per cent for the fourth quarter. A somewhat more rapid growth rate is

currently anticipated from September to October mainly in consequence of an

expected drop in U.S. Government deposits from their unusually high mid-

September level. Under alternative C, money supply growth would be expected

to be a little more rapid in the fourth quarter than under alternative A.

In the first quarter of next year, growth in M1 would be expected to be

more rapid under either alternative, as transactions demands for cash--which

would rise along with projected nominal GNP growth in the fourth quarter

-- strengthen further. The pick-up could be quite modest under alternative

A, however, while under alternative C the cumulative impact of lower interest

rates could lead to a return to growth rates of around 6 per cent or so.

(10) With respect to interest rates, if the Federal funds rate
range

stays in a 5-1/4--5-1/2 per cent bill rates might back up somewhat further

over the next several weeks and exert upward pressure on other short-term



-10-

rates. This would be especially likely if the Treasury decides--as we have

assumed it will--to anticipate some of its later cash needs by adding about

$3--$4 billion to the bill supply in October. On the other hand some partly

offsetting downward pressure on bill rates might be generated if the Treasury

were to contemplate, as an alternative or a supplement, a financing strategy

which involved considerable debt lengthening. Long-term interest rates are

likely to be very sensitive to the trend of market expectations as to the

effectiveness of phase II policies. Over the near-term, the heavy volume

of new corporate issues, particularly if accompanied by sizable Treasury

debt lengthening operations, could exert some upward rate pressures.

(11) An appreciable decline in the Federal funds rates--for

example, consistently into a 5--5-1/4 per cent range or lower--would con-

firm market hopes that the recent weakness in money supply will be followed

by an easing in money market conditions. Both long- and short-term rates

would be expected to decline under those circumstances, with declines quite

marked if and as the Federal funds rate moves down to trade consistently

below 5 per cent.

(12) Growth in time and savings deposits other than large CD's

is expected to accelerate from recent low rates to about a 9-1/2 per cent

annual rate in September, given experience in the first two weeks of the

month, but, under alternative A, to drop back to a 7-1/2 per cent rate in

the fourth quarter. The lower growth rate is anticipated in view of

strengthened consumer spending and the liklihood that market interest



- 11-

rates will not drop enough to provide much in the way of incentive for

savers to add sharply to time deposit funds. A somewhat more rapid growth

in such deposits would be anticipated under alternative C, given the marked

decline in market interest rates that would be expected.

(13) Under any of the alternatives presented, funds available to

banks from U.S. Government deposits, private demand deposits, and time

deposits other than large CD's taken together are likely to grow much less

rapidly on balance in September and the fourth quarter than they had in the

spring and summer. As a result, banks may be led to bid actively for large

CD's should business and other loan demands be strong, as would be expected

if economic recovery proceeds at the accelerated rate indicated in the staff

GNP projection. Under alternative A, the adjusted bank credit proxy is

expected to grow at an 8 per cent annual rate in September and 4-1/2 per

cent in the fourth quarter. Under alternative C, the growth rate in the

bank credit proxy in the fourth quarter is expected to be around 6-1/2 per

cent, as banks in a period of declining interest rates add to investments

for purposes of obtaining high yields or capital gains.



-12-

Possible directive language

(14) Alternative A. This language is proposed for possible use

if the Committee decides to seek, or permit, the growth rates for the

aggregates over the months ahead discussed earlier in connection with

alternative A, including rates for M 1 of 1-1/2 and 3-1/2 per cent in

September and the fourth quarter, respectively. The money market and

reserve conditions believed likely to be consistent with such growth rates

are noted in paragraph (8).

"To implement this policy, the Committee seeks to

achieve [DEL: more] moderate growth in monetary and credit

aggregates over the months ahead. System open market

operations until the next meeting of the Committee shall

be conducted with a view to achieving bank reserve and

money market conditions consistent with that objective."

This language differs from that of the directive adopted at the August 24

meeting only in the deletion of the word "more" from the phrase "to

achieve more moderate growth . . ." It is assumed that the Committee would

not want to continue to call for 'more moderate growth" in light of the

August experience, when M 1 and M 2 grew at rates of about 3 and 5 per cent,

respectively.

(15) Alternative B. The language of B differs from that of A

in two respects. First, the words "over the months ahead" are omitted

following the reference to growth in the aggregates. This modification



-13-

is proposed for consideration if the Committee does not wish to accept as

aggregate targets the comparatively low growth rates of alternative A for

a period longer than the weeks immediately ahead. Secondly, a clause

reading "taking account of developments in capital markets" is added at

the end of the first sentence. This change is suggested for consideration

if the Committee decides to instruct the Manager to give considerable

weight to the objective of avoiding excessive pressures in capital markets,

recognizing that this might require some adaptation in reserve supplying

operations. Either of these modifications might, of course, be made without

the other.

"To implement this policy, the Committee seeks to

achieve [DEL: more] moderate growth in monetary and credit

aggregates [DEL: over the months ahead], TAKING ACCOUNT OF

DEVELOPMENTS IN CAPITAL MARKETS. System open market

operations until the next meeting of the Committee shall

be conducted with a view to achieving bank reserve and money

market conditions consistent with that objective."

(16) Alternative C. This language is proposed for possible

use if the Committee decides to seek somewhat more rapid growth rates

in the aggregates than called for under alternative A. The money market

and reserve conditions believed likely to prove consistent with those

growth rates are noted in paragraph (8).

"To implement this policy, the Committee seeks to

PROMOTE [DEL: achieve more] moderate growth in monetary and credit



-14-

aggregates over the months ahead. System open market opera-

tions until the next meeting of the Committee shall be con-

ducted with a view to achieving bank reserve and money market

conditions consistent with that objective."

This directive does not include the phrase "taking account of developments

in capital markets" since the prompt and substantial easing of the money

market contemplated is likely to minimize the risk of adverse capital

market developments, particularly in a period when the monetary aggregates

are weak.
