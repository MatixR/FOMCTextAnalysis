1 The effective federal funds rate averaged 1.04 percent over the intermeeting period. 
The widespread power outage that began on August 14 caused significant dislocations to the
distribution of reserves.  Discount window borrowing on the first day of the outage rose to
its highest level since the days following the September 11 terrorist attacks, but federal funds
still traded briefly above the primary credit rate for the first time since the introduction of the
new lending programs on January 9.  The Desk purchased $1.2 billion of Treasury bills from
foreign official institutions and $1.4 billion of Treasury coupon securities in the market.  The
outstanding amount of long-term RPs increased $5 billion to $18 billion.

MONETARY POLICY ALTERNATIVES

Recent Developments

(1) The FOMC’s decision to leave its target for the federal funds rate and 

assessment of risks unchanged at the August meeting was widely anticipated, but rates

on money market futures for the second half of next year moved 5 to 10 basis points

lower as market participants apparently took particular note of the statement that

“policy accommodation can be maintained for a considerable period.”1  Over

subsequent weeks, economic data releases pointed to a substantial strengthening in

aggregate demand, and these futures rates moved appreciably higher.  In recent days,

however, those increases were more than reversed when upwardly revised

productivity data, continued weakness in employment, and comments by Federal

Reserve officials strengthened market participants’ conviction that the stance of policy

would be left unchanged for some time.  On net over the intermeeting period, near-

term interest rate futures were about unchanged and suggest that investors anticipate

that the intended federal funds rate will be held at 1 percent through the middle of

next year.  Further out the curve, futures rates declined as much as 30 basis points and

now imply an expectation of about 2½ percentage points of tightening from mid-2004

to end-2005 (Chart 1).

2 Trading conditions in fixed-income markets had largely returned to normal by mid-
August, although fails-to-deliver, while down considerably in recent weeks, remain elevated
on certain securities.  The volatility of longer-term yields over the intermeeting period
seemed to owe in part to variations in mortgage-related hedging demands.  As one example,
the announcement by Fannie Mae in mid-August that the duration of its assets exceeded the
duration of its liabilities by more than market participants had expected was accompanied by
sizable increases in Treasury and swap yields, likely reflecting investors’ expectations that the
agency’s efforts to rebalance its holdings would limit demand for longer-dated instruments.

          .  The  Desk did

not intervene during the period for the accounts of the System or the Treasury.

(2) Intermediate and longer-term interest rates were volatile over the period,

but, on net, the flattening of the near-term path of policy expectations was associated

with declines in Treasury coupon yields of 5 to 10 basis points.2  The yield on ten-year

Treasury indexed debt fell the same amount as its nominal counterpart, implying that

inflation compensation held steady, as did survey measures of longer-term inflation

expectations.  In the corporate bond market, yields on most investment-grade

securities moved in line with those on Treasury securities, but investors’ more

optimistic economic outlook reportedly contributed to a substantial decline in

speculative-grade yields (Chart 2).  Broad stock price indexes rose 3½ to 4½ percent,

boosted by the improved economic growth prospects and the associated upwardly

revised earnings expectations. 

(3) The trade-weighted value of the dollar against major foreign currencies

changed little on balance over the intermeeting period, as depreciation of around 1

percent against the yen and the Canadian dollar was offset by appreciation against

most European currencies.  The yen rallied in reaction to the release of stronger-than-

expected data for Japanese GDP.  Further upward pressure on the yen later in the

period prompted heavy and repeated intervention in foreign exchange markets by

Japanese authorities.3  The Canadian dollar firmed despite a reduction of 25 basis

points in the Bank of Canada’s target for the overnight rate, in part because the

statement accompanying the policy action signaled a more optimistic outlook for the

economy than had been expected.  Incoming European data, although not as strong

as in the United States, were also read as indicating a brighter economic outlook.  The

generally more positive sentiment about global recovery helped push stock prices and

bond yields higher in most industrial countries.  Japanese equities rose 10¼ percent

and euro-area share prices increased 4½ percent.  Ten-year government bond yields

moved up 20 basis points in the euro area but surged 60 basis points in Japan, putting

the bellwether JGB yield 105 basis points above its low in June.

(4) The dollar posted little net change against the currencies of other

important trading partners over the intermeeting period.  Financial market conditions

in emerging Asian economies mostly improved in response to a stronger global

economic outlook and to accumulating evidence of a strong rebound in many of the

economies that had earlier been afflicted by SARS.  Stock prices increased between

7 and 14 percent in Thailand, Taiwan, Korea, Hong Kong, and Indonesia; bond

spreads edged a bit lower; and currencies were generally up somewhat or little

changed against the dollar.  Latin American markets were mixed.  The Mexican peso

depreciated 2½ percent against the dollar, as falling inflation and concerns about

economic growth fostered expectations that the Bank of Mexico will ease monetary

policy in the near term.  Mexican stock prices moved higher, and debt spreads

changed little.  In contrast, optimism about political and economic prospects in Brazil

boosted local markets.  The real appreciated 3 percent against the dollar, Brazilian

equity prices gained about 20 percent, and Brazil’s EMBI+ spread declined 130 basis

points. 

(5) The backup in interest rates earlier this summer has tended to restrain

borrowing by domestic businesses and households (Chart 3).  With spending on fixed

capital still subdued, inventories apparently running off, and profits strengthening,

credit demands of nonfinancial firms remain modest.  The debt of nonfinancial

businesses is on track to grow at a 3½ percent rate in the third quarter.  While this rate

is only half that posted in the second quarter, that earlier performance had been

boosted by borrowing by many firms beyond immediate funding needs to take

advantage of the lowest bond yields in decades.  Bond issuance slowed abruptly in July

and August, and changes in shorter-term business credit were mixed, with commercial

paper edging up and C&I loans posting further declines.  As rates on residential

mortgages rose, homeowners rushed to file applications for refinancing in early

August, but the pace of such activity subsequently plunged.  Mortgage debt growth

was still buoyed by the earlier strength in refinancing applications, and overall

household debt is expected to grow at a 9 percent rate in the third quarter.  Federal

debt is estimated to be expanding at a 13 percent pace in the current quarter, bringing

the growth of domestic nonfinancial sector debt to a 7½ percent annual rate.

(6)  M2 advanced at an 8 percent rate in August, somewhat slower than in

July, perhaps partly reflecting the recent recovery in equity markets as well as a waning

of the impetus from past declines in opportunity costs.  This deceleration occurred

despite the support of a number of temporary factors.  First, the high level of

mortgage refinancings buoyed liquid deposits as funds to be delivered to security

holders were parked for a time in escrow accounts.  Second, the power blackout at

mid-month prevented some banks from shifting funds out of demand deposits,

swelling balances for a few days.  And lastly, some portion of child tax credit refund

checks, mailed beginning in late July, were likely left at least temporarily in liquid

assets.



5

Policy Alternatives

(7)  The data released over the intermeeting period on spending and

productivity surpassed expectations, leading the staff both to strengthen the

Greenbook forecast for real GDP growth and to widen somewhat its estimate of the

output gap in recent years and going forward.  The Greenbook forecast continues to

be predicated on the assumption that the FOMC holds the federal funds rate at

1 percent through the first half of 2005 before firming policy a bit.  Longer-term

interest rates are expected to decline modestly next year as investors gradually

recognize that the Federal Reserve will not tighten monetary policy as soon or as

much as is currently built into the yield curve.  Equity prices again are projected to rise

over time, albeit from a higher base than in the August Greenbook, providing

investors with risk-adjusted returns in line with those on fixed-income instruments. 

The foreign exchange value of the dollar, once again, edges lower.  With financial

conditions, fiscal policy, and accelerator dynamics supportive of economic expansion,

real GDP growth is projected to rise to a 4½ percent rate over the second half of

2003 and to 5 percent in 2004.  In 2005, a shift in fiscal policy from considerable

stimulus to slight restraint contributes to a moderation of growth to about 4 percent, a

little above the estimated rate of expansion of potential output.  This performance of

real output is expected to pull the civilian unemployment rate down to about

5¼ percent by the end of the projection period.  Because economic slack persists over

the forecast interval, underlying inflation slips lower, with core PCE inflation edging

below 1 percent in 2005. 

(8) Although significant uncertainties about the outlook remain, the tenor of

recent spending data presumably has bolstered Committee members’ confidence that

the economic expansion now under way will be sufficient to reduce the risk of an

unwelcome decline in inflation.  If so, the Committee might elect to leave the stance



6

of policy unchanged at this meeting.   Indeed, the Committee might find both

plausible and attractive the Greenbook projection that inflation remains fairly stable at

around 1 percent, which may be seen as consistent with a working definition of price

stability.  Alternatively, the Committee might be concerned about risks that inflation

could move higher either because it sees the current stance of policy as likely to foster

a more substantial pickup in spending or because it views the outlook for structural

productivity or for the sustainable level of resource utilization as less favorable than

does the staff.  Financial market quotes, which appear to be conditioned on an

expectation of no further policy easing and some unwinding of current policy

accommodation next year, might be read as indicating that investors expect the output

gap to close rapidly.  In these circumstances, the Committee might feel most

comfortable assessing incoming data to determine whether further adjustments in fact

will be necessary to return aggregate production to its potential at an acceptable pace.

(9) Should the Committee, by contrast, find the Greenbook assessment

plausible but wish to make more rapid progress against economic slack or harbor

concerns that 1 percent inflation is already too low, it might choose to ease policy by

25 basis points at this meeting.  The Committee might be especially troubled that

persistence of the already-protracted sluggishness in the labor market could

undermine household confidence and spending and call into question the

sustainability of the expansion.  Although further easing would affect the economy

only with a lag, such action would almost certainly help to boost aggregate demand

and employment next year.  Along those lines, a policy easing might be warranted to

bring the actual real federal funds rate closer to, or even below, the lower end of the

estimated range of its equilibrium values, as it was in late 2001 and much of 2002

(Chart 4).  Even if the pace of output growth forecast in the Greenbook were seen

not only as most likely but also as generally acceptable, the Committee might view the

cost of erring on the side of policy accommodation as small at this time given that

inflation is low and inflation expectations are well anchored.  If Committee members

viewed the prevailing inflation rate as already close to the lower end of their preferred

range, somewhat stronger economic expansion than in the staff forecast might even

be seen as desirable to limit the risk of disinflation and possibly even to foster a higher

inflation rate.

Policy Announcement, Directive, and Assessment of Risks

(10) Independent of the decision on the stance of policy at this meeting, the

announcement will, as usual, be scrutinized closely by market participants for

implications about the future course of policy.  If the Committee decides to leave the

stance of policy unchanged, it presumably will want to note the encouraging flow of

incoming data over the intermeeting period, including the indications of a

strengthening of final demands—particularly those for capital goods—as well as

continued impressive productivity growth.  In contrast, should the Committee elect to

ease policy, it might point particularly to the ongoing sluggishness in labor market

performance, strong productivity, and the potential implications of those factors for

further disinflation.

(11) The Committee’s discussion of its communications policy that is

scheduled for Monday evening might affect how it structures its assessment of risks. 

However, rather than prejudge the outcome of that session, it is assumed in this

Bluebook that the current form of the risk assessment is retained, at least for this

meeting.  The next three paragraphs discuss possible adjustments to the assessment

within the current framework.

(12) Even though the Greenbook output forecast has been revised up and 

data now seem to point fairly convincingly to a strengthening path of economic

activity, the Committee might still judge that the “. . . risks to the attainment of sustainable



8

economic growth over the next several quarters are balanced.”  In view of the upward revision

to estimated growth of potential GDP, a considerable output gap remains likely for a

time.  If the Committee views the phrase “sustainable economic growth” as consistent

with above-trend expansion over the next several quarters as that gap is closed rather

than denoting the economy’s potential growth rate, then it may regard the odds of an

undershooting or overshooting of its growth objective as about balanced.  In contrast,

if sustainable economic growth were read as meaning the rate of expansion of

potential output, the Committee might be inclined to indicate that the risks were tilted

to the upside.  However, if the Committee reached that conclusion, it may want to

make clear in the announcement that even if growth above potential were realized,

policy tightening would not automatically be triggered in the near future. 

(13) If the Committee still attached a significant probability to pronounced

downward pressures on prices—a judgment that would tend to be reinforced by the

current very low rate of inflation and the likelihood that considerable slack will

persist—especially given the recent evidence of continued robust productivity

growth—and saw such an outcome as especially costly, it might continue to indicate

that “. . . the probability, though minor, of an unwelcome fall in inflation exceeds that of a rise in

inflation from its already low level.”  The Committee would presumably opt to state that

the risks to its outlook for inflation over the next several quarters are balanced only if

it saw the evident strengthening of aggregate demand in recent weeks as putting

sufficient pressures on resources to have greatly reduced the chances of an

unwelcome substantial fall in inflation.

(14) If the Committee were to decide to retain the judgments that it reached

in August regarding the risks on output and inflation individually, it would seem to

follow logically that the overall assessment again would be that the downside risks to

inflation were likely to predominate for the foreseeable future.  However, the



9

Committee might decide to alter its assessment of the output or inflation risks in view

of the economic data and financial developments over the intermeeting period.  The

simplest situation would occur if the Committee concludes that the risks to inflation,

as well as the risks to growth, are now balanced.  In that case, the overall risks

presumably would be seen as balanced.  If, instead, the Committee determined not

only that the risks to inflation were now balanced but the risks to output had shifted

to the upside, then the overall risks would seem to be to the upside.  But if the

Committee concluded that the risks to inflation remained to the downside, even as the

risks to sustainable growth had moved to the upside, the bottom-line assessment

would be more complicated.  Its decision on the overall balance—skewed to the

upside, balanced, or skewed to the downside—would depend on its views both of the

relative probabilities and of the economic costs attached to the various outcomes.  In

any case, regardless of the Federal Reserve’s intentions regarding the meaning of the

risk assessment, a shift would likely be interpreted by investors as providing

information about the next change in the stance of policy.

(15) Another issue for Committee consideration at this meeting relates to the

indication in the announcement following the August meeting that “In these

circumstances, the Committee believes that policy accommodation can be maintained for a considerable

period.”  The combination of developments over the intermeeting period—especially

the juxtaposition of an apparent strengthening of aggregate demand with a seeming

further acceleration in productivity that had the net effect of widening somewhat the

staff’s projection of the output gap—might be viewed as warranting the reiteration of

such a statement.  However, the Committee might not be convinced that recent

trends in productivity are likely to persist, and thus it may see a good possibility that

policy will need to be firmed sooner than assumed in the Greenbook forecast, perhaps

along the lines indicated by futures rates.  The Committee presumably will want to



10

remove the statement from the announcement in advance of any policy tightening. 

However, dropping it at this point would likely prompt an adverse reaction in

financial markets, including not the least a backup in interest rates.  An alternative

approach would be to condition the statement on economic developments.  For

example, the Committee could indicate that “. . . policy accommodation likely can be

maintained for the considerable period that the Committee expects will be required to

achieve satisfactory economic performance.”  Rates could back up some even in this

case if investors read the language as an effort by the Committee to take a step back

from what had been regarded as an implicit commitment to hold the target rate at

1 percent for a lengthy period.

(16) Should the Committee wish to follow the same procedure as in August,

it could vote on the directive and on language providing guidance to the drafters of

the announcement regarding the risk assessment.  Draft language with a range of

options is provided below. 

(1) Directive Wording

The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and

financial conditions that will foster price stability and promote

sustainable growth in output.  To further its long-run objectives, the

Committee in the immediate future seeks conditions in reserve markets

funds rate at/TO an average of around ___ 1 percent.

Market Reaction

(17) Market participants uniformly expect no change in the stance of

monetary policy at this meeting, and only a few anticipate an alteration in the

assessment of risks.  Accordingly, a statement that the target federal funds rate was

being left at 1 percent, that the risks to sustainable growth were balanced, that the

probability of a fall in inflation still exceeded that of a rise, and that on balance this

risk to inflation remained the dominant concern of the Committee would likely

provoke little market reaction.  Coupling an unchanged stance of policy with an

assessment either that the risks to growth were now tilted to the upside or that the

risks to inflation were now balanced could prompt an appreciable rise in market

interest rates if that assessment led investors to conclude that a tightening was not far

off. 

(18) A decision to ease policy at this meeting would catch investors

completely unawares.  Short-term interest rates would likely fall by about the same

amount as the reduction in the federal funds rate.  Intermediate-term rates should also

decline, but the effect on long-term yields is less certain.  Nominal bond rates could

tend to rise if investors took the move as additional evidence that the Federal Reserve

was purposefully adopting policies to bring about higher inflation.  In this case, the

foreign exchange value of the dollar would most likely decline, but the effect on equity



12

prices is unclear.  If, however, market participants thought instead that the move was

intended to combat economic conditions that were weaker than they had previously

appreciated, bond yields, the exchange value of the dollar, and equity prices all would

be likely to decline.

Monetary and Credit Aggregates

(19) Growth in M2 is projected to decelerate in coming months under the

assumptions of the Greenbook forecast.  With a flat funds rate, the effects of past

monetary policy easings in buoying M2 are expected to ebb.  In addition, the sharp

drop-off in mortgage refinancing activity should show through to a slowing in the

growth of liquid deposits.  As a result, M2 growth averages about 4 percent from

August through December, bringing growth for 2003 to around 7½ percent. 

Projected growth in this aggregate during 2004, at 5½ percent, remains a bit below

expansion of nominal income, as opportunity costs are about flat and as the boost to

liquid deposits associated with mortgage refinancings abates further.  Thus, the

four-year slide in M2 velocity is forecast to come to an end next year.  M2 growth

then slows further in 2005 as the advance in nominal income moderates and

short-term interest rates begin to edge higher.

(20) The growth of domestic nonfinancial sector debt is also projected to

decrease in coming months.  The falloff importantly reflects a deceleration in

household debt, as a decline in mortgage borrowing is only partly offset by a pickup in

consumer credit.  In 2004 and 2005, household borrowing continues significantly

below its recent pace, but remains a little above the rate of expansion of nominal

GDP.  Despite somewhat stronger business investment, borrowing by firms remains

relatively sluggish over the next several months, as the financing gap stays relatively

narrow because of a further improvement in profits.  However, business debt

accelerates somewhat over the next two years as capital expenditures pick up and



13

growth in profits lags.  Overall domestic nonfinancial sector debt is projected to

expand 8¼ percent in 2003 and then to slow to 7 percent and 6 percent in 2004 and

2005, respectively.
