MONETARY POLICY ALTERNATIVES

Recent Developments

(1) Reserve conditions have remained unchanged since the last

Committee meeting. Because of settlement day pressures, the federal

funds rate averaged a little above its expected level of 3 percent and

adjustment plus seasonal borrowing a little above its allowance.

Rates on Treasury securities registered relatively small mixed changes

over the intermeeting period, with bill rates essentially unchanged and

bond yields falling.2  Economic activity was stronger than expected,

but the more robust economy along with the tenor of the new Administra-

tion's appointments and statements were seen as lowering the odds on

outsized fiscal stimulus. The flattening of the Treasury yield curve

may have been partly a response to actual and potential shifting of

relative supplies: bill auction sizes increased over recent weeks, and

there was talk in the incoming Administration of shortening the

maturity structure of Treasury debt issues. Long-term forward rates

embedded in the Treasury yield curve fell to their lowest levels in

nearly three years, and investors also may have been encouraged by

discussions of long-term deficit reduction and by prospects for sus-

tained low inflation. Rates rose sharply on one-month private paper as

that maturity came to span the year-end. However, expected rates over

the year-end holiday weekend have fallen recently, contributing to a

drop of 20 to 45 basis points in private short-term rates beyond the

one-month maturity. The declines are greatest for bank obligations,

1. The borrowing allowance was reduced by $25 million to $50 mil-
lion late in the intermeeting period because of the usual decline in
seasonal borrowing.

2. Interest and exchange rates in this bluebook have been updated
through noon, December 18.



perhaps reflecting reduced concerns about possible banking problems,

partly as bank earnings exceeded expectations. Bank stock prices

outperformed broad stock market indexes, which were themselves boosted

to record highs by the prospects for a stronger economy and decreases

in bond yields. Private long-term rates also dropped 10 to 20 basis

points late in the period, except for rates for weaker credits which

remained unchanged.

(2) The dollar's weighted-average exchange value has declined

slightly on balance since the November FOMC meeting. Foreign short-

term interest rates rose while long-term rates declined a few basis

points on average over the period. Although new economic data indi-

cated that both the West German and the Japanese economies are in

recession, markets seem to have postponed or reduced expectations of

near-term monetary easing, owing in part to statements by the central

banks of those countries. Small dollar depreciations against the mark,

the yen, and several other currencies were about offset by a 15 percent

appreciation against the Swedish krona, which was cut loose from its

ECU peg after a second round of extremely heavy selling pressures. The

pressures then spread episodically to other European currencies, cul-

minating in the floating of the Norwegian krone; tensions within the

ERM persisted through the end of the intermeeting period, but at a

somewhat reduced intensity.

The Desk did not intervene in currency markets over the inter-

meeting period.

(3) Growth rates of M2 and M3 appear likely to come in a

little below below their respective 3-1/2 and 1 percent paths specified

for September to December at the last FOMC meeting. In November, M2



decelerated to a 3-1/2 percent annual growth rate, and weekly data for

the first half of December indicate significant further slowing this

month. A deceleration had been expected, owing primarily to the waning

effects of special factors.3 Abstracting from those effects, the

underlying growth in M2 was apparently quite weak, and less than ex-

pected, despite an upward revision to estimated nominal income growth.

M1 growth has slowed especially sharply in recent weeks, accounted for

in part by weakness in demand deposits.4 Some of this deceleration

may reflect smaller contributions to growth from mortgage refinancing,

and it may be that demand deposits, and NOW accounts as well, were

reacting to the runup in short-term interest rates over October and

November. The nontransactions component of M2 continued to decline.

Small time deposits again fell substantially, with a portion of the

funds apparently captured by savings deposits, which expanded rapidly.

M3 accelerated to a 1-3/4 percent growth rate in November, as the

runoff of large time deposits and institutional money funds slowed

substantially. Branches and agencies of foreign banks increased CD

issuance, perhaps anticipating year-end needs, but appear likely to

rely more heavily on borrowing from overseas offices as the year end

approaches. Early December data indicate a likely decline in M3 for

this month.

3. The effects of the boost to NOW accounts from a reclassifica-
tion of large time deposits ended in November. Mort-
gage refinancings and associated effects on deposits were expected to
add nearly 1 percentage point less to growth in November and December
than in October. It now appears that the contribution of mortgage
refinancing to growth has dropped off faster than we had projected,
but from a much higher level in October.

4. Reflecting the deceleration of transaction deposits, growth of
required and total reserves slowed to the still rapid rates of about
22 and 21 percent, respectively, in November. Primarily because of a
lower rate of currency growth, the monetary base grew at an 8-3/4
percent rate for the month.



(4) M2 and M3 should finish the year about 1/4 and 1/2 per-

centage point, respectively, below the lower bounds of their target

ranges. The velocity of M2 is projected to rise 3-1/4 percent this

year, including a 5-1/4 percent (annual rate) increase in the third

quarter--despite further declines in market rates and the influence of

special factors, such as mortgage refinancing, that boosted money and

held down velocity. Banks and thrifts, rebuilding capital positions,

promptly reduced deposit rates as short-term market rates fell, and a

steepening yield curve as well as the stickiness of bank loan rates

induced shifts out of M2 deposits. The experimental staff M2 model,

which employs a variety of rates affecting household portfolio choices

and shows a rise in overall opportunity costs this year, predicts a

3 percent increase in velocity. M3 velocity has been boosted in part

by greatly increased reliance by banks and thrifts on capital and other

nondeposit sources of funds not included in M3.

(5) Domestic nonfinancial debt posted a paltry 2-3/4 percent

growth rate in October owing to a temporary dropoff in federal borrow-

ing, before picking up in November. Although borrowing by nonfederal

sectors appears to be strengthening a little, some of the recent pickup

may have been the result of efforts to fund year-end needs in advance.

At banks, business loans expanded at a more robust 5-1/4 percent pace

in November. While part of this increase reflected a shift from the

commercial paper market by one large firm that was downgraded, commer-

cial paper still posted a strong gain in November. Corporations not

only obtained early funding of year-end positions but reduced their

reliance on long-term debt markets after the backup in bond yields in

October and November. Overall, business borrowing seems to be increas-

ing slightly, after decreasing in the second and third quarters. While



equity issuance also has declined, the recent stock market rally has

led to a buildup of the new issue calendar. Bank loans to consumers

remained weak in November, even after adjusting for securitizations,

and although revolving credit posted a third monthly gain in October,

total consumer credit, including noninstallment loans, turned down

after being flat or rising slightly the previous several months. Real

estate loans at banks grew modestly again in November. Residential

mortgage growth had not kept pace with indicators of housing activity

through the third quarter, but some boost may be expected in the fourth

quarter with the record level of refinancings and rising home sales

with concomitant opportunities for increasing mortgage sizes. Since

October, however, a steep decline is evident in indexes of new mortgage

applications for home purchases and especially for refinancing. Over-

all, the debt aggregate appears likely to finish the year at about the

4-1/2 percent lower bound of its monitoring range, with federal debt up

10-3/4 percent and nonfederal 2-1/2 percent. Debt-to-income ratios

have fallen slightly for both households and business; debt-service

burdens have declined much more substantially as obligations are rolled

over at prevailing lower interest rates.

Policy Alternatives

(6) Three alternatives are presented below for consideration

by the Committee. Under alternative B, federal funds would continue to

trade around 3 percent, in association with the allowance for adjustment

and seasonal borrowing remaining at $50 million. (Seasonal borrowing

ordinarily would be expected to edge down in January, but with such

borrowing already at a very low level of about $20 million, little

change is likely over the intermeeting period.) Alternative A incor-

porates a 1/2 percentage point reduction in the federal funds rate.

Such a reduction could be accomplished through open market operations--

by lowering the borrowing allowance by $25 million--pushing the federal

funds rate below the discount rate. The lower funds rate also could be

achieved by reducing the discount rate by 1/2 percentage point and

leaving the borrowing allowance unchanged. The latter approach would be

in line with the Committee's usual procedure, as it would not involve

moving the intended federal funds rate below the discount rate. The 1/2

percentage point increase in the federal funds rate of alternative C

could be implemented by raising the borrowing allowance by $25 million.

(7) In view of the stronger tone of economic data in recent

weeks, market participants seem to be anticipating a firming in the

stance of monetary policy some time next year, but likely not between

now and the early February FOMC meeting. With an unchanged federal

funds rate under alternative B, other private short-term rates will

decline over the intermeeting period as remaining year-end pressures

unwind. Apart from year-end effects, rates along the maturity spectrum

might tend to drift lower should developments unfold as in the staff

forecast; in these circumstances, expectations of substantial policy



tightening in 1993 are likely to fade, albeit slowly, as inflation re-

mains subdued and the pace of expansion stays moderate. Intermediate-

and longer-term rates may be importantly influenced by new proposals on

fiscal policy. Markets apparently are anticipating some modest fiscal

stimulus, but there is considerable uncertainty about the size of any

short-term package and the scope and credibility of proposals for

longer-term deficit reduction. Interest rates could also be affected by

discussions of other policy measures apparently being considered by the

new Administration, which also have not been assumed in the staff fore-

cast. For example, efforts to increase bank lending by relaxing regula-

tions, intended to ease the cost and availability of credit to borrowers

dependent on banks, might boost some market interest rates if such a

relaxation were seen as having a significant impact on spending and as

shifting bank portfolios toward loans and away from government

securities. Proposals to put greater emphasis on shorter maturities in

Treasury debt management, while motivated primarily by possible saving

in federal interest expense, may flatten the yield curve a little.

(8) The 1/2 percentage point decline in the federal funds rate

under alternative A would be passed through fully to other short-term

interest rates. The three-month Treasury bill rate would drop into the

2-3/4 percent area, or a bit below, and the prime rate would be reduced

to 5-1/2 percent. Market expectations about the trajectory of interest

rates over the next few months would be marked down, but anticipations

that the easing move might need to be reversed before much time had

passed--especially in the context of possible fiscal stimulus--would

limit declines in longer-term rates. The foreign exchange value of the

dollar could drop noticeably, although in present circumstances, foreign



central banks might ease their own policies somewhat sooner than they

are likely to otherwise, muting the dollar's decline.

(9) Although many market participants have come to the view

that monetary policy easing has run its course for the current economic

cycle, none appears to expect a tightening to be implemented in the near

term, as in alternative C. Consequently, short-term Treasury rates

would jump by the full 50 basis point increase in the federal funds

rate. Private rates could increase a bit more, as market participants

built in higher risk premiums in response to the greater odds that the

economic expansion could slow. The increase in long-term yields,

however, would be held down by the enhanced credibility of the Federal

Reserve's price stability objective, and the yield curve should flatten

somewhat. The foreign exchange value of the dollar would likely rise

considerably.

(10) Projected growth of the monetary aggregates under the

three alternatives for the interval from November to March is shown in

the table below. (Additional data appear in the detailed table and

charts on the following pages.) Growth of M2 and M3 in coming months is

expected to remain damped relative to that of nominal income under all

of the alternatives. The forces that have been restraining money demand

over the past two years should abate only a little in the near term.

With the yield curve steep and the cost of consumer credit high relative

to deposit rates, households are likely to steer funds into capital

market instruments, such as bond and stock mutual funds, and to use

deposit balances to reduce debt burdens further. Credit flows will

continue to be diverted from the depository sector. Nonfinancial busi-

nesses, while showing a renewed interest in shorter-term credit as

inventory financing needs rise, are expected to continue to rely heavily



-10-

on the capital markets in view of the attractive levels of bond rates

and stock prices. Restraints on banks' supply of credit are expected to

ease, but only gradually, in response to improvements in the financial

condition of banks and as the outlook for the economy brightens. With

their balance sheets highly liquid, banks are likely to remain unaggres-

sive in bidding for retail deposits and managed liabilities. Overall

demands for credit by nonfederal sectors are expected to remain damped

relative to income. Federal borrowing, however, should remain brisk.

Under any of the alternatives, overall nonfinancial debt is expected to

expand at about a 5-1/2 percent rate from the fourth quarter through

March, in the lower half of its provisional 4-1/2 to 8-1/2 percent moni-

toring range, and below the pace of nominal GDP.

(11) The 1-1/2 percent M2 growth projected for the November-

tive B represents a considerable slowing from the pace of recent months.

This projected deceleration largely reflects the reversal of the net

impact of certain special factors that have boosted M2 recently, includ-

ing heavy mortgage refinancing activity. The slowing in growth also is

due to the additional reductions in rates on liquid deposits, catching

up to previous declines in market interest rates. 5 On a quarterly

average basis, M2 would grow at only about a 1-1/2 percent rate in the

first quarter, well below the staff projection for nominal income

growth, and velocity would extend its recent increases--at a projected

4-1/4 percent annual rate. By March, M2 would have expanded at a 1-3/4

percent pace from its fourth-quarter base, leaving the aggregate below

its tentative 2-1/2 to 6-1/2 percent range.

(12) M3 is expected to be unchanged on balance over the

November-to-March period under the reserve market conditions of alterna-

tive B, as a decline that appears to be in train in December offsets

sluggish growth over the following three months. Restraint on balance-

sheet growth by depository institutions and slack demands for loans at

banks and thrifts will continue to stunt the growth of this aggregate.

Around year-end, certain bank liabilities, including large time depos-

its, could decline noticeably, as banks seek to minimize deposit in-

surance charges and capital requirements, but such maneuvers in them-

selves should have little effect on growth over the November-to-March

period. M3 growth would be about 3/4 percentage point below its tenta-

tive 1 to 5 percent target range in March.

(13) The lower interest rates of alternative A would boost M2

growth well into 1993, putting this aggregate near the lower end of the

current provisional range by March. This alternative would also improve

5. M1 is projected to grow at a 5-3/4 percent pace from November
to March under alternative B. With currency growing at a 7-1/4 per-
cent rate, and total reserves at a 7 percent pace, the monetary base
is projected to grow at a 7 percent rate over the period.



-13-

the odds that growth of the aggregates in 1993 would be within the pro-

visional target ranges later in the year as the lower interest and ex-

change rates boosted income relative to the staff forecast. Much of the

higher money growth over coming months relative to alternative B would

reflect stronger expansion of M1. Compensating balances would increase

further, and NOW accounts would rise more quickly. However, deposi-

tories are likely again to be fairly prompt in adjusting liquid deposit

rates, limiting the impact of the policy easing on the monetary aggre-

gates. Bank credit is unlikely to respond very strongly to lower rates,

and additional needs for funds would be met from core deposits. With

issuance of managed liabilities weak, growth in M3 would be boosted only

slightly as compared with alternative B, and that aggregate would remain

below its provisional target range in March.

(14) M2 is projected to expand at only a 1 percent rate from

November-to-March under alternative C and M3 would decline at a 1/4

percent rate. M1 growth would be limited to 4 percent over November-to-

March by the higher opportunity costs of demand deposits and NOW ac-

counts under this alternative. Losses on capital market instruments as

long-term rates rise could limit flows into bond and stock mutual funds,

cushioning the restraining effect on M2 and M3. Still, M2 would be just

1-1/4 percent above its fourth-quarter base by March.

Directive Language

(15) Draft language for the operational paragraph, including

the usual options and updating, is presented below. No Committee mem-

bers expressed a desire to discuss the language relating to the factors

to be taken into account when considering intermeeting adjustments.

future, the Committee seeks to DECREASE SOMEWHAT/main-

tain/INCREASE SOMEWHAT the existing degree of pressure on

reserve positions. In the context of the Committee's

long-run objectives for price stability and sustainable
