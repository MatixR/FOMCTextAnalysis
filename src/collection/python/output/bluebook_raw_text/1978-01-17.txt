Prefatory Note 

 
 

The attached document represents the most complete and accurate version 
available based on original copies culled from the files of the FOMC Secretariat at the 
Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System.  This electronic document was 
created through a comprehensive digitization process which included identifying the best-
preserved paper copies, scanning those copies,1 and then making the scanned versions 
text-searchable.2  Though a stringent quality assurance process was employed, some 
imperfections may remain. 
 

Please note that this document may contain occasional gaps in the text.  These 
gaps are the result of a redaction process that removed information obtained on a 
confidential basis.  All redacted passages are exempt from disclosure under applicable 
provisions of the Freedom of Information Act.    

 

                                                 
1 In some cases, original copies needed to be photocopied before being scanned into electronic format.  All 
scanned images were deskewed (to remove the effects of printer- and scanner-introduced tilting) and lightly 
cleaned (to remove dark spots caused by staple holes, hole punches, and other blemishes caused after initial 
printing). 
2 A two-step process was used.  An advanced optimal character recognition computer program (OCR) first 
created electronic text from the document image.  Where the OCR results were inconclusive, staff checked 
and corrected the text as necessary.   Please note that the numbers and text in charts and tables were not 
reliably recognized by the OCR process and were not checked or corrected by staff.

Recent developments

(1) M-1 increased at about an 8 per cent annual rate in

December, and incoming data suggest that growth over December and

January will be at about a 7¼ per cent rate, in the upper half of the

FOMC's range. M-2 appears to be increasing at a 6¼ per cent annual

rate over the December-January period, near the lower end of its range.

As in November, all of the increase in the interest-bearing component

of M-2 occurred in large denomination time deposits. Flows into

savings and consumer-type time deposits remained weak, apparently

reflecting the continued diversion of funds from these deposits to

higher yielding market instruments. Deposit flows at thrift institu-

tions moderated slightly further in December from November's reduced

rate. Commercial bank credit is estimated to have remained about

unchanged in December, on a last-Wednesday-of-the-month basis; over

the fourth quarter as a whole, bank credit growth was quite strong.

(2) Total reserves are projected to be increasing at about a

14 per cent annual rate over December and January, reflecting the pick-

up in growth of demand deposits and continued strong expansion in large

denomination time deposits. Growth in nonborrowed reserves is expected

to be even more rapid over this period, as member bank borrowing has

declined from its November level.

(3) With the monetary aggregates apparently expanding at

rates well within the ranges specified by the FOMC, the Account Management

continued to aim for a Federal funds rate of around 6½ per cent in the

last weeks of December and first week of January. However, reflecting

technical factors,including usual window-dressing pressures around year-end

Federal funds generally traded at rates above this level. On January

6, the Board approved an increase in the discount rate from 6 to 6½

per cent. On that day, the FOMC also concurred in the Chairman's

recommendation to raise the Federal funds rate range to 6½ to 7 per

cent and to instruct the Account Manager to raise the funds rate to

around 6¾ over the next few days.

(4) Short-term market interest rates changed little during

late December and early January, though longer-term rates moved up

somewhat. After the discount rate was raised and the System increased

its Federal funds rate target, however, Treasury bill rates increased

sharply and, on balance, are up 35 to 45 basis points for the inter-

meeting period. At the same time, private short-term rates have

increased more modestly. Yields on longer-term market securities have



-3-

risen to 10 to 35 basis points since the last Committee meeting, while

rates in the primary mortgage market edged higher.

Prospective developments

(6) Shown below for Committee consideration are three

alternative sets of longer-run growth ranges for the monetary aggre-

gates applicable to the QIV '77-QIV '78 period.

Alt. A Alt. B Alt. C

M-1 4 to 7 4 to 6 4 to 6

M-2 7 to 9 6 to 9 6 to 8

M-3 8 to 11 8 to 10 7 to 10

Bank credit 7 to 10 7 to 10 6 to 9

(7) Alternative B encompasses the ranges for all of the

aggregates adopted by the Committee in October for the QIII '77-

QIII '78 period. The ranges for M-2 and M-3 now assume an upward

adjustment of one-half percentage point in ceiling rates on small

denomination time deposits in the first half of the year. Without

such an adjustment, the increase in market interest rates thought

necessary to restrain M-1 growth to the mid-point of its indicated

range would--given associated projections for time deposit flows into

banks and thrift institutions--lead to growth in M-2 and M-3 at rates

near or below the lower ends of the ranges shown.1 / Alternatives A

and C represent, respectively, somewhat more and somewhat less expansive

1/ Without an adjustment in deposit ceiling rates, the ranges for M-2
and M-3 for the QIV '77-QIV '78 period consistent with a 4 to 6
per cent growth in M-1 would be 5 to 8 and 6 to 9 per cent,
respectively. Projections of the interest-bearing components of
M-2 and M-3, with and without an adjustment in ceiling rates, are
shown in Appendix V. (Should the Committee wished to retain the
existing M-2 and M-3 ranges without an adjustment in deposit ceil-
ing rates, the staff believes that consistency would require an M-1
range of 5 to 8 per cent and associated lower short-term market

rates.)



policy alternatives; both also assume the upward adjustment in ceiling

rates.

(8) The table below provides perspective on the relationship

between growth rates proposed for the QIV '77-QIV '78 period and for 5-

and 18-month periods also ending in QIV '78. It shows, for instance,

that growth in M-1 at around the 5-1/4 per cent mid-point of the pro-

posed alternative B range would lead to a 5.6 per cent annual rate of

expansion over the 15-month period starting with QIII '77 and to a 6.3

per cent annual rate of growth over the 18-month period beginning with

QII '77--in both cases within the current FOMC range, but above the mid-

point. This is the case because of the sizable overshoot in M-1 growth in

the third quarter of last year and the slight overshoot in the fourth.

M-1 growth at the mid-point of the proposed 4-6 per cent alternative C

range would virtually compensate for the slight fourth quarter overshoot,

since this would lead to a 5.4 per annual rate of expansion over the

15-month QIII '77-QIV '78 period.1/

(9) Shorter-run specifications for monetary aggregates and

the Federal funds rate believed consistent with longer-run proposals

are summarized below for Committee consideration. (More detailed, and

longer-term, data are shown in the tables on pp. 8 and 9.)

(10) A Federal funds rate centered on the recently prevailing

6¾ per cent, as encompassed under alternative B, is likely to be

associated with M-1 growth over January-February in a 2½ to 8½ per cent

annual rate range. However, the staff expects that further increases

in market interest rates will be required relatively soon in order to

limit growth in this aggregate over the QIV '77 to QIV '78 period to

the mid-point of the longer-run 4 to 6½ per cent range associated with

alternative B. Money demand can be expected to be relatively strong over

the year. Nominal GNP is projected to increase at about an 11¾ per cent

rate during 1978, reflecting in part an assumed additional fiscal stimulus

from tax cuts. And the restraining effect of the previous increases in

interest rates will be diminishing with the passage of time. Moreover,

the evidence of the last three quarters suggests that the depressing

effect on money demand of regulatory and innovational factors has been

wearing off. Consequently, the staff has assumed only some moderate

additional downward shift in the demand for money over 1978. Thus, in

-10-

order to constrain M-1 growth, the Federal funds rate under alternative

B begins to rise next month and reaches an average of 8 per cent in the

fourth quarter, as shown in Appendix I.1/

(11) Under alternative B, growth in M-2 over the January-

February period is likely to be in a 5 to 9 per cent annual rate

range. With the recent increase in market yields, it appears likely

that savings deposits at banks, which were essentially unchanged in the

last two months of 1977, will remain weak in the early months of 1978.

Moreover, now that yields onmarket instruments are at or above effective

ceiling rates on all maturities of small denomination time deposits at

banks, growth in such deposits is likely to remain modest at best. But

relatively strong growth in large denomination time deposits included

in M-2 can be expected as banks offer these instruments aggressively

to offset slow growth of deposits subject to Regulation Q

ceilings.

(12) Thrift institutions too are faced with unfavorable

market rate comparisons, except on their 4 and 6 year maturities where

the favorable spread has narrowed to only about 5 and 25 basis points

respectively, since the last meeting. Consequently, growth in deposits

at these institutions can be expected to slow further in January-February.

With outstanding commitments at record levels, it seems likely that S&L's

will not only be forced to reduce their liquidity and to maintain a high

rate of borrowing from the FHLBanks, but also to slow their new commit-

ment activity in early 1978.

1/ The implied increases in the velocity of M-1 and M-2 over 1978 are
displayed in Appendix II.



-11-

(13) If the Federal Funds rate remains near its present

6¾ per cent level over the intermeeting period, as envisioned under

alternative B, short-term market interest rates will probably remain

near current higher levels. And given their increases since November,

bond yields may be fully adjusted to the current level of short-term

rates. Thus, yields in the corporate and tax-exempt bond markets may

remain essentially unchanged, and could even decline somewhat in response

to continuing strong institutional investment demands and a recent

reduction in new offerings of corporate bonds. However, on January 25,

the Treasury will announce terms for refunding more than $5 billion of

publicly-held issues maturing in mid-February; the Treasury may also

take the occasion to raise $1 to $2½ billion of new money.

(14) Beyond the intermeeting period, short-term interest

rates are expected to be under renewed upward pressure as efforts are

made to limit M-1 expansion to the 5¼ per cent mid-point of the

alternative B longer-run range. As short-term rates rise, some further

induced increase in intermediate-term rates can be expected. Thus,

even with the assumed increase in deposit rate ceilings, inflows to

thrifts will probably not be sufficient to enable them to meet their

mortgage commitments without further increases in borrowings from

the FHLBanks. Under the circumstances, mortgage rates are

likely to come under upward pressure. Banks would find it necessary

to continue to offer large denomination time deposits in volume to

supplement their deposit sources, and to reduce further their port-

folio liquidity in order to meet loan demands. Moreover, with



-12-

Treasury, corporate, and municipal bond offerings remaining sizable,

long-term yields can also be expected to be under renewed upward pres-

sure. Such increases, however, will be limited by the continued high

cash flows of insurance companies and pension funds.

(15) Alternative C contemplates an increase in the Federal

funds rate over the next few weeks to the mid-point of a 7 to 7-1/2

per cent range. Under this alternative M-1 and M-2 growth over the

January-February period may be in 2 to 8 and 4½ to 8½ per cent ranges,

respectively. If the Committee followed this course, the 3-month bill

rate would likely increase to about 7 per cent between now and the next

meeting, with commensurate adjustments in other short rates. Member

bank borrowing would begin to rise, and pressures for a discount rate

increase would develop. The increase in short-term interest rates under

the alternative would tend to strengthen the dollar on international

exchange markets.

(16) Such adjustments in short-term market conditions,

following so closely on recent discount rate and open market actions,

would probably be accompanied by a reappraisal of the basic financial

outlook by market participants. It is likely that banks and thrift

institutions would adopt more restrictive lending policies, while

mortgage bankers would take down existing FNMA commitments and aggres-

sively seek new commitments. Pressures for an upward adjustment in

ceiling rates on time deposits would be likely to emerge. Long-term

interest rates would probably rise further. At the higher level of



-13-

rates, corporate and municipal bond offerings would likely be postponed

or possibly cancelled, with borrowers turning more toward banks and the

short-term sector of the open market.

(17) The tightening of the money market over the next few

weeks would be a step toward reducing longer-run growth in the aggre-

gates to rates within the somewhat lower ranges proposed for alterna-

tive C. However, further interest rate increases appear necessary as

the year progresses, given the underlying strength of money demand.

The staff would expect the funds rate under this alternative to average

7-3/4 per cent by the second quarter of 1978 and 8-1/4 per cent in the

fourth.

(18) An easing in money market conditions over the next few

weeks under alternative A, which calls for a Federal funds rate of

about 6-1/4 per cent, would come as a considerable surprise so soon

after the Board's recent discount rate action. Recent interest rate

increases would be reversed, although perhaps not entirely in long-term

markets if the rate decline was considered to be temporary. The decline

in short-term rates, however, would tend to soften the dollar in inter-

national exchange markets.

(19) Even though this alternative is consistent with a shift

to higher long-term growth ranges for the aggregates, the decline in

the funds rate would soon have to be reversed in order to keep the aggre-

gates within the longer-run ranges of alternative A. The funds rate



-14-

would probably have to begin rising late in the first quarter and

reach a high of 7-3/4 per cent by fall. The delayed rise in short-

term rates would postpone the need for a change in deposit rate

ceilings.



-15-

Directive language

(20) Given below are alternatives for the operational

paragraphs of the directive. The first formulation places main

emphasis on near-term rates of growth in monetary aggregates. The

second formulation, like the directive adopted at the last meeting,

places main emphasis on money market conditions; it shows--in strike-

through form--the specifications adopted at the last meeting (except

that the specifications for the Federal funds rate reflect the modifi-

cations agreed upon on January 6). As suggested below, the particular

language needed in the opening lines of the money market formulation

would depend on the specific conditions sought; the three alternatives

shown--calling, respectively, for somewhat easier, prevailing, and

somewhat firmer money market conditions--are intended to be associated

with the specifications discussed in the preceding section under

alternatives A, B, and C.

"Monetary Aggregates" Formulation

The Committee seeks to encourage near-term rates of growth

in M-1 and M-2 on a path believed to be reasonably consistent with

the longer-run ranges for monetary aggregates cited in the preceed-

ing paragraph. Specifically, at present, it expects the annual

growth rates over the January-February period to be within the

ranges of ____ to ____ per cent for M-1 and ____ to ____

per cent for M-2. In the judgment of the Committee such growth

rates are likely to be associated with a weekly-average Federal



-16-

funds rate of about ____ per cent. If, giving approximately

equal weight to M-1 and M-2, it appears that growth rates over

the 2-month period will deviate significantly from the midpoints

of the indicated ranges, the operational objective for the Federal

funds rate shall be modified in an orderly fashion within a range

of ____ to ____ per cent. In the conduct of day-to-day opera-

tions, account shall be taken of emerging financial market condi-

tions, including the unsettled conditions in foreign exchange

markets.

If it appears during the period before the next meeting

that the operating constraints specified above are proving to be

significantly inconsistent, the Manager is promptly to notify the

Chairman who will then decide whether the situation calls for

supplementary instructions from the Committee.

"Money Market" Formulation

At this time, the Committee seeks to maintain about the

prevailing money market conditions (OR TO ACHIEVE SOMEWHAT EASIER

OR SOMEWHAT FIRMER MONEY MARKET CONDITIONS) during the period

immediately ahead, provided that monetary aggregates appear to be

growing at approximately the rates currently expected, which are

believed to be on a path reasonably consistent with the longer-

run ranges for monetary aggregates cited in the preceding paragraph.

Specifically, the Committee seeks to maintain the weekly-average

Federal funds rate at about [DEL: 6-3/4-per cent] ____, so long as M-1



-17-

and M-2 appear to be growing over the [DEL: December-January] JANUARY-

FEBRUARY period at annual rates within ranges of [DEL: 2-l/2-to-8-1/2]

____ TO ____ per cent and [DEL: 6-to 10] ____ TO ____ per cent,

respectively. If, giving approximately equal weight to M-1 and

M-2, it appears that growth rates over the 2-month period are

approaching or moving beyond the limits of the indicated ranges,

the operational objective for the weekly-average Federal funds

rate shall be modified in an orderly fashion within a range of

[DEL: 6-l/2-to-7] ____ TO ____ per cent. In the conduct of day-

to-day operations, account shall be taken of emerging financial

market conditions, including the unsettled conditions in foreign

exchange markets.

If it appears during the period before the next meeting that

the operating constraints specified above are proving to be

significantly inconsistent, the Manager is promptly to notify

the Chairman who will then decide whether the situation calls

for supplementary instructions from the Committee.

NOTE: Government security dealer trading positions are on a commitment basis. Trading positions, which exclude Treasury securities financed by
repurchase agreements maturing in 16 days or more, are indicators of dealer holdings available for sale over the near-term. Underwriting syndicate

positions consist of issues still in syndicate, excluding trading positions. The basic reserve deficit is excess reserves less borrowing at Federal
Reserve less net Federal funds purchases. Weekly data are daily averages for statement weeks, except for corporate and municipal issues in syndicate

which are Friday figures.

* Strictly confidential.

** Monthly averages for excess reserves and borrowings are weighted averages of statement week figures.

NOTE: Weekly data for columns 1, 2, 3, 5, and 6 are statement week averages of daily data. Data in column 4 are 1-day Wednesday quotes. For columns
7 through 10, the weekly date is the mid-point of the calendar week over which data are averaged. Columns 11 and 12 are 1-day quotes for Friday and
Thursday, respectively, following the end of the statement week. Column 13 is an average of contract interest rates on commitments for conventional
first mortgages with 80 per cent loan-to-value ratios made by a sample of insured savings and loan associations on the Friday following the end of the
statement week. Column 14 gives FNMA auction data for Monday preceding the end of the statement week. Column 15 is a 1-day quote for Monday preceding
the end of the statement week. The FNMA auction yield is the average yield in birweekly auction for short-term forward commitments for Governamet under-
written mortgages. GNMA yields are average net yields to investors on mortgage-backed securities for immediate delivery, assuming prepayment in 12
years on pools of 30-year FHA/VA mortgages carrying the coupon rate 50 basis points below the current FHA/VA ceiling.
