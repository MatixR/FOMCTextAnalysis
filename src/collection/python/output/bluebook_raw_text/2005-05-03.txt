MONETARY POLICY ALTERNATIVES 

Recent Developments 

(1) The Committee’s decision at its March meeting to increase the target 

federal funds rate 25 basis points to 2¾ percent was widely anticipated by market 

participants, as were the retention of the “measured pace” language and the 

assessment that the risks to sustainable growth and price stability were balanced.1  

However, the references in the statement to increased inflation pressures and to 

more evident pricing power, as well as the explicit conditioning of the balance of 

risks on “appropriate monetary policy action,” were apparently read by investors as 

indicating that the Committee might tighten policy more rapidly than previously 

thought.  In consequence, policy expectations firmed somewhat after the 

announcement and rose further on the heels of a larger-than-expected increase in 

consumer prices for February released on the next day.   

(2) In the weeks that followed, however, readings on spending, employment, 

and production came in weaker than expected, on balance, and equity markets sold 

off significantly.  In addition, the minutes of the March FOMC meeting were viewed 

as suggesting that the Committee perceived less upside risk to inflation than 

investors had earlier surmised.  Market participants took particular note of the 

statement in those minutes that members believed that an accelerated path of policy 

tightening did not appear necessary at the time.  Despite the subsequent publication 

                                                 
1 The effective federal funds rate averaged 2.77 percent over the intermeeting period amid 
pressures from quarter-end flows and the April tax date.  Late in the period, participants again bid 
up the funds rate in anticipation of tightening at this meeting.  The Desk purchased $1.9 billion of 
Treasury coupon securities in the market and redeemed $211 million of two-year notes at an 
auction to comply with its per-issue portfolio guidelines.  The volume of outstanding long-term 
RPs remained unchanged on balance at $17 billion. 



of higher-than-expected consumer prices for March, the expected policy path 

rotated down on net over the intermeeting period (Chart 1).  Options on federal 

funds futures indicate that investors are certain of a 25 basis point tightening at this 

meeting and have considerably scaled back the odds placed on a larger move in June 

(see box).  Current futures prices also indicate a mean expectation for the federal 

funds rate a bit below 4 percent at the end of 2006, about 30 basis points lower than 

 

Probability of a Pause or a Half-Point Increase 

Money market futures prices indicate that the federal funds rate is expected to be raised to    
3 percent at this meeting and to reach 3½ percent by the end of this year.  Such a 
configuration is consistent with two more quarter-point increases in the funds rate target 
after this meeting spread over the five remaining FOMC meetings of the year.  Thus, 
financial markets appear to be betting that the process of policy firming will be put on pause 
at some point in 2005.    

Given the relatively deep market in options on July federal funds futures, we can infer 
probabilities associated with various policy actions at the June FOMC meeting.  As shown in 
the chart below, which takes a quarter-point tightening at the May meeting as a fait accompli, 
the implied probability of a half-point rate hike at the June meeting has declined over the 
intermeeting period from nearly even odds to below 10 percent.  Much of this drop occurred 
after the February PCE price index release and in mid-April as equity prices turned down.  In 
contrast, the probability of a pause at the June meeting has roughly doubled to about 
25 percent over the same period.

at the time of the last meeting.  According to a recent survey by the Desk, primary 

dealers do not expect changes to the balance-of-risk sentence at this meeting, 

although some predict that the “measured pace” language will be dropped. 

(3) The downward revision in policy expectations showed through to a 

15 basis point decline in two-year nominal Treasury yields over the intermeeting 

period, while longer-term nominal yields moved down about 35 basis points.  

Judging from TIPS, a drop in real yields accounted for about half of the decline in 

longer-term nominal interest rates, implying that inflation compensation fell about 

15 basis points.  Model-based estimates of term premiums have fallen further over 

the intermeeting period, consistent with the decline in the volatility of long-term 

Treasury securities inferred from options prices and perhaps indicative of 

heightened safe-haven demands prompted by the downturn in equity markets. 

(4) Despite generally favorable earnings reports for the first quarter, broad 

equity indexes fell 3 to 5 percent over the intermeeting period, apparently 

responding to the softer economic outlook (Chart 2).  In addition, investors’ 

appetite for risk was diminished by downbeat news from Ford, General Motors, and 

a few other prominent firms and by additional reports of accounting irregularities in 

the insurance industry.  A rough measure of the equity premium increased 

somewhat over the period, and implied volatilities on equities turned up, albeit from 

very low levels.  Corporate bond spreads, while still modest compared with recent 

years, climbed over the intermeeting period:  Those on investment-grade corporate 

securities widened about 10 to 20 basis points, and those on speculative-grade 

securities rose about 90 basis points (see box).   Meanwhile, most other indicators of 

corporate credit quality have remained strong on balance. Although General Motors’

Credit Market Conditions 

The softer economic outlook, concerns about the 
prospects of automobile manufacturers, and 
further reports of accounting irregularities in the 
insurance industry apparently made investors 
charier of risk.  Negative corporate news mostly 
concerned investment-grade firms, but the 
associated widening in spreads was larger and 
more pervasive in the speculative-grade sector.  
As shown in the top panel at the right, the cross-
sectional distribution of high-yield credit spreads 
shifted to the right and became more dispersed.  
Consistent with a somewhat diminished appetite 
for risk among investors, a staff estimate of the 
corporate bond risk premium rose a good bit 
from the very low levels it had reached in the first 
part of the year. 

Signs of heightened risk awareness were also 
visible in the credit default swaps (CDS) market.  
Indexes of investment-grade and speculative-
grade CDS have gained favor as vehicles to trade 
credit risk.  Trading of tranches of those indexes, 
which insure against losses within a specific 
percentile range, has also grown rapidly in recent 
years.  As was the case with bond and CDS index 
spreads, tranche spreads, including those on the 
super-senior slice of the investment-grade index, 
widened over the intermeeting period (the middle 
panel).  This particular tranche would absorb 
losses only if they exceeded 15 percent of the 
value of the whole index, and its spread can thus 
be interpreted as a measure of investors’ 
perception of the likelihood of extreme 
outcomes. 

Options on CDS indexes also began trading 
recently.  As shown in the bottom panel, the 
implied volatility computed from those options 
has climbed substantially since mid-March, 
indicating a greater sense of uncertainty among 
investors about movements in credit spreads 
going forward.   

Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) Page 6 of 40



debt remains investment grade, credit default swap (CDS) spreads on the firm’s 

obligations gapped 250 basis points higher over the period to levels similar to those 

for poor-quality speculative-grade issuers.  CDS spreads for Ford also rose, but by 

considerably less. 

(5) Over the intermeeting period, the trade-weighted value of the dollar 

increased 2¼ percent on balance against a basket of major foreign currencies  

(Chart 3).  The dollar rose steeply in late March on the heels of the FOMC 

announcement and indications of less robust growth abroad.  Against most 

currencies, however, some of that gain has been erased this month, prompted in 

part by disappointing U.S. data and the release of the FOMC minutes.  Even so, the 

dollar has continued to move higher versus the Canadian dollar as weaker-than-

expected Canadian output and employment data, political uncertainties, and a 

decline of oil prices from their recent peak weighed on that currency.  Euro-area 

data were also disappointing and suggested to market participants a less-robust 

outlook for growth there.  For the period as a whole, the dollar has appreciated 

4 percent versus the Canadian dollar, 2¼ percent versus the euro, and about 

1 percent versus the yen.2  Ten-year sovereign yields in most major foreign industrial 

countries declined 15 to 30 basis points, a bit less than comparable U.S. yields.  

Declines in foreign share prices outstripped those in the United States amid 

concerns about the strength of the global recovery.  Turmoil in Chinese-Japanese 

political relations likely added to the downward pressure on Japanese equity prices, 

which fell 6 percent over the intermeeting period, and may have affected share 

prices more broadly in the region.   

(6) The dollar declined slightly on average against the currencies of our other 

important trading partners over the intermeeting period.  Movements against most 

currencies were modest, with the notable exception of the Brazilian real, against

which the dollar fell almost 7 percent.  Despite signs of slower growth in Brazil, the 

central bank ceased its operations in currency swaps in mid-March, which had been 

viewed as part of an official effort to weaken the real, and raised its main policy rate 

25 basis points in mid-April to counter inflationary pressure.  Brazilian stocks fell  

10 percent over the intermeeting period, and stock prices in other Latin American 

countries also registered significant declines.  Spreads on dollar-denominated 

sovereign bonds widened slightly over the intermeeting period.  Various comments 

by G-7 officials emphasizing the need for China to modify its foreign exchange 

regime, as well as signs of growing protectionist pressures aimed at Chinese exports, 

pushed up the value of the renminbi versus the dollar in non-deliverable forward 

contracts.   

(7) Domestic nonfinancial sector debt appears to have grown at a 9½ percent 

rate in the first quarter, boosted in part by hefty federal borrowing (Chart 4).  

Perhaps in response to rising corporate yields, gross bond issuance by nonfinancial 

corporations has remained subdued of late, especially in the high-yield sector, while 

retirements of outstanding bonds have stayed near last year’s rapid pace.  

Meanwhile, commercial paper issuance and business borrowing from banks 

advanced at a brisk rate over the intermeeting period.  Significant fractions of 

respondents to the latest Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey reported stronger 

demand for commercial and industrial loans and continued easing of both lending 

standards and terms over the past three months.  The staff estimates that household 

debt growth slowed somewhat in the first quarter from the robust pace recorded last 

year.  Household credit quality has remained solid, notwithstanding the recent jump 

in personal bankruptcies sparked by the anticipation of bankruptcy reform. 

(8) M2 is estimated to have grown at a 2¾ percent annual rate on average in 

March and April, about the same pace as earlier in the year.  M2 growth remains 

below the estimated expansion of nominal income, although not by as much as

might have been expected given the increases in the opportunity costs of holding 

money balances.  Even in the first quarter, when the velocity of M2 rose at a rate of 

about 2¾ percent, this monetary aggregate expanded somewhat faster than standard 

models would have predicted, perhaps owing to the flattening of the yield curve and 

declines in equity prices.  

Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) Page 11 of 40



Policy Alternatives 

(9) Incoming data over the intermeeting period led the staff to reduce 

significantly its projection for near-term growth of real activity, to nudge up its 

forecast for inflation, and to mark down its assumption for the path of monetary 

policy.  The federal funds rate is now assumed to reach 3¼ percent by mid-year and 

to rise another 50 basis points by late 2006, a little less firming than currently built 

into markets and 25 basis points less cumulative action than assumed in the March 

Greenbook.  In the current forecast, long-term nominal interest rates are projected 

to stay near current levels over the projection period, despite the assumed monetary 

policy tightening, as investors come to recognize that less firming will be necessary 

to contain inflation than they currently expect.  Equity prices are expected to 

increase from their recent lower levels at a pace generating risk-adjusted returns in 

line with yields on fixed-income instruments, and the nominal trade-weighted index 

of the dollar’s value against major foreign currencies is assumed to fall at an 

annualized rate of 2 percent.  The price of West Texas Intermediate crude oil is 

forecast to be about flat on balance over the projection period and to finish 2006 

close to $53 per barrel, approximately $3 above the level forecast in the March 

Greenbook.  In these circumstances, real GDP is forecast to grow 3½ percent this 

year and next, a bit above the staff’s estimate of the expansion of potential output.  

Nonetheless, resource slack persists over the forecast period, with the 

unemployment rate holding at 5¼ percent (a little above the staff’s estimate of the 

natural rate of unemployment), in part as labor force participation rises in response 

to improving job prospects.  With regard to inflation, the staff has read the sharp 

jump in the core CPI in March in large measure as the result of factors that are 

expected to have a much smaller effect on PCE prices.  With some economic slack 

remaining, import prices rising less rapidly, and energy prices falling back somewhat 

as margins shrink, core PCE inflation is forecast to slow a little over the next two

years.  After a bulge in the first half of this year, overall PCE inflation is forecast to 

drop to a rate of about 1½ percent in the second half of 2005 and in 2006, and core 

PCE inflation is forecast to move down to around 1¾ percent late this year and to 

remain there in 2006.   

(10) This Bluebook presents three policy alternatives for Committee 

consideration that are listed in Table 1.  Under Alternatives A and B, the target 

federal funds rate would be increased 25 basis points at this meeting.  Apart from 

updating the description of recent economic conditions, the statement under 

Alternative B could be quite similar to that issued following the March FOMC 

meeting.  Alternative A would suggest that a near-term pause in the process of 

tightening could be in the cards.  Under Alternative C, the federal funds rate would 

be boosted 50 basis points, and the language would be modified substantially.  Some 

variant of the wording of this alternative might be appealing even if the Committee 

wished to tighten 25 basis points at this meeting if it also wanted to signal that its 

future actions spanned a wider range of outcomes than currently envisioned by 

market participants.  More generally, the Committee could use constituent elements 

from more than one of these alternatives in constructing its statement.  

(11) Although recent economic data have pointed to noticeably less strength in 

spending and output in the first half of 2005 than anticipated at the time of the 

March meeting, the Committee may still be inclined to tighten policy another 

25-basis-point notch at this meeting, as in Alternative B.  The Committee might 

share the view of the staff that, even after additional policy firming, growth in 

economic activity will exceed, albeit only slightly, the rate of expansion of potential 

output in coming quarters.  Such an outlook accords with staff estimates of the 

equilibrium real rate of interest, which remain above the current level of the real 

Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) Page 14 of 40



federal funds rate (Chart 5).3  Indeed, some relatively immediate increase in the 

nominal funds rate may be seen as necessary to prevent the real funds rate from 

declining as the result of the recent uptick in inflation.  While the absence of much 

further progress in working down resource slack in this forecast may not be 

particularly attractive, policymakers might believe that the current situation is best 

described as one in which the economy has been hit by an adverse supply shock 

emanating from the ratcheting higher of oil prices.  In such a circumstance, fate 

deals monetary policymakers an unappealing hand, in that pursuing greater resource 

utilization more aggressively could put price stability at risk and ensuring that 

inflation is kept in check could require a worsening of resource slack.   

(12) The draft statement associated with Alternative B updates the wording of 

the March release in light of recent information on spending, employment, and 

inflation.  As shown in Table 1, the Committee could indicate that “Recent data 

suggest that the solid pace of spending growth has slowed somewhat, partly in 

response to the earlier increases in energy prices.  Labor market conditions, 

however, apparently continue to improve gradually.”  In view of the elevated CPI 

figures for the past couple of months, and more generally in recognition of 

increased uncertainty about the interpretation of recent inflation news, the draft 

wording for Alternative B also suggests that the Committee omit the view expressed 

in March that “the rise in energy prices, however, has not notably fed through to 

core consumer prices.”  (The Committee’s consideration of such a change, however, 

could depend on the March reading on PCE prices, which will be released on the 

Friday before the meeting.)  If the Committee drops that sentence, it might wish to 

reverse the order of the thoughts in the first sentence on inflation that appeared in 

                                                 
3 Starting with this Bluebook, the TIPS-based measure of the equilibrium real interest rate 
incorporates an upward adjustment of 40 basis points to account for the anticipated average 
difference between total CPI inflation (the basis for TIPS indexation) and core PCE inflation (the 
basis for computing inflation expectations in the other measures).

Equilibrium Real Rate Chart: Explanatory Notes 
 

The equilibrium real rate is the real federal funds rate that, if maintained, would be projected to return 
output to its potential level over time.  The short-run equilibrium rate is defined as the rate that would 
close the output gap in twelve quarters given a model’s projection of the economy, and the medium-run 
concept is the value of the real funds rate projected to keep output at potential in seven years under the 
assumption that monetary policy acts to bring actual and potential output into line in the short run and 
then keep them equal thereafter.  The real federal funds rate employs the log difference of the core PCE 
price index over the previous four quarters as a proxy for expected inflation, with the staff projection 
used for the current quarter.  Since TIPS indexation is based on the total CPI, the TIPS-consistent 
measure incorporates an adjustment for the expected difference between CPI inflation and core PCE 
inflation. 
        

Measure Description 

Single-Equation 
Model  

The measure of the equilibrium real rate in the single-equation model is based on an 
estimated aggregate-demand relationship between the current value of the output gap and 
its lagged values as well as the lagged values of the real federal funds rate.  In light of 
this model’s simple structure, the short-run measure of the equilibrium real rate depends 
only on the recent position of output relative to potential, and the medium-run measure is 
virtually constant. 

Small Structural 
Model 

The small-scale model of the economy consists of equations for five variables: the output 
gap, the equity premium, the federal budget surplus, the trend growth rate of output, and 
the real bond yield.  Unlike the estimates from the single-equation model, values of the 
equilibrium real rate also depend directly on conditions associated with output growth, 
fiscal policy, and capital markets. 

Large Model 
(FRB/US) 

Estimates of the equilibrium real rate using FRB/US—the staff’s large-scale econometric 
model of the U.S. economy—depend on a very broad array of economic factors, some of 
which take the form of projected values of the model’s exogenous variables.  These 
projections make use of several simple forecasting rules which are appropriate for the 
three-year horizon relevant for the short-run concept but are less sensible over longer 
horizons.  Thus, we report only the short-run measure for the FRB/US model. 

Greenbook-
consistent  

Measures of the equilibrium real rate cannot be directly obtained from the Greenbook 
forecast, because the Greenbook is not based on a formal model.  Rather, we use the 
FRB/US model in conjunction with an extended version of the Greenbook forecast to 
derive a Greenbook-consistent measure.  FRB/US is first add-factored so that its 
simulation matches the extended Greenbook forecast, and then a second simulation is run 
off this baseline to determine the value of the real federal funds rate that closes the output 
gap.  The medium-run concept of the equilibrium real rate is not computed because it 
requires a relatively long extension of the Greenbook forecast. 

TIPS-consistent Yields on TIPS (Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities) incorporate investors’ 
expectations of the future path of real interest rates.  The seven-year instantaneous real 
forward rate derived from TIPS yields as of the Bluebook publication date reflects the 
short-term real interest rate expected to prevail in seven years. This forward rate is 
adjusted down for a term premium, assumed to be 70 basis points, and adjusted up for the 
difference between total CPI inflation and core PCE inflation, projected to be 40 basis 
points in the medium run.

the March announcement to avoid communicating an excessively pessimistic view 

of inflation prospects.  Apart from such updating, the announcement could be 

similar to the one issued after the March meeting.  In particular, it would seem—

assuming that members share an economic outlook broadly in line with that of the 

staff—that the Committee could retain its assessment of balanced risks to both 

sustainable growth and price stability under the assumption of “appropriate 

monetary policy action” that it adopted in March as well as its judgment that 

removal of policy accommodation can proceed at a measured pace.4   

(13) Investors appear certain that the Committee will boost the target federal 

funds rate 25 basis points at this meeting.  Also, most expect that the FOMC will 

not make major changes to its announcement, apart from those necessary to align 

the description of economic conditions with newly available information.  While a 

growing minority of market participants in recent days have come to expect the 

“measured pace” language to be shed, it is hard to tell whether they would view such 

an outcome as a signal of a stepped-up pace of firming or of a pause.  Assuming that 

those differing interpretations about offset each other, there is little reason to 

suspect that the market reaction to the adoption of Alternative B would be 

significant.   

(14) If the Committee is reasonably sure that inflation will be well contained 

but is concerned that spending and output growth may have lost significant 

momentum of late and that progress in reducing resource slack may have stalled, it 

                                                 
4 Members might interpret the adverse news over the intermeeting period as raising the 
probabilities of outsized deviations of spending growth below that which is sustainable and 
inflation above that consistent with price stability.  Such skewed risks might be expected to remain 
even after policy is set appropriately, implying that the Committee would view the risks to its two 
objectives individually as unbalanced—and in a manner that has offsetting implications for policy.  
However, much was made in markets of the Committee’s explicit conditioning of the risk 
assessment on appropriate policy and the conclusion generally drawn was that it was close to 
tautological.  While the selection of unbalanced risks is logically possible in the presence of 
significantly skewed probabilities, another change on the heels of the introduction of an explicit 
reference to appropriate policy would likely bewilder market participants. 

Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) Page 18 of 40



may wish to combine a 25-basis-point firming of policy at this meeting with 

statement language that strongly suggests the possibility of a pause in firming at the 

June meeting, as in Alternative A.  True, the Committee has repeatedly conveyed in 

its minutes that the “measured pace” language is consistent with a pause in the 

process of tightening, and market participants have priced in high odds of such a 

possibility later this year.  But it cannot be ruled out that the present configuration 

of market prices is conditioned on the expectation that the statement will be used to 

signal the possibility of a pause in policy tightening.  If so, the Committee might see 

merit in being more explicit.  A more gradual elimination of accommodation might 

be appealing in light of the downward revision of nearly ¾ percentage point in the 

short-run measure of the equilibrium real interest rate consistent with the 

Greenbook forecast (the first line in the table in Chart 5); by that index, the real 

funds rate would be less than ¼ percentage point below its estimated equilibrium 

value after implementation of this alternative.  In addition, a 3 percent nominal 

federal funds rate would sit high in the range of policy recommendations from 

simple policy rules provided in Chart 6—and especially so if members viewed 

2 percent inflation in the core PCE index as an acceptable outcome.  A gloomy view 

of the risks to the outlook for spending would presumably also incline the 

Committee to signal a pause.  For instance, economic activity could be weaker in 

coming quarters than in the staff forecast for the reasons explored in the “sentiment 

slump” and “sentiment slump with financial spillover” scenarios in the Greenbook.  

As another possibility, members may be of the view that the slowing in spending 

and activity of late owes less to elevated energy prices and more to the cumulative 

monetary policy restraint put in place since June of last year than is implicit in the 

Greenbook. 5   Pausing to assess the effects already in the pipeline from cumulative

short- and intermediate-term yields are now much higher.  Those latter increases may be crimping 
spending more than the staff has allowed for, either because the economy is now more sensitive to

policy restraint might therefore be in order, especially in light of the recent behavior 

of the stock market, bond spreads, and the foreign exchange value of the dollar.    

(15) The statement accompanying selection of Alternative A could employ 

virtually the same text on aggregate spending and labor market conditions suggested 

for Alternative B—but omitting the word “somewhat”—as follows:  “Recent data 

suggest that the solid pace of spending growth has slowed, partly in response to the 

earlier increases in energy prices.  Labor market conditions, however, apparently 

continue to improve gradually.”  Regarding inflation, the sentence offered under 

Alternative B could be modified under this alternative by saying, “While pressures 

on inflation have picked up in recent months and pricing power is more evident, 

longer-term inflation expectations remain well contained.”  Also, consistent with a 

relatively benign view of inflation, the penultimate sentence could be changed to 

begin “With underlying inflation expected to be relatively low…”  The second 

sentence of the announcement could be altered to indicate that “the stance of 

monetary policy remains somewhat accommodative,” implying that the amount of 

policy accommodation still to be removed had been reduced.  Correspondingly, in 

the second-to-last sentence, the Committee could refer to “remaining policy 

accommodation” instead of just to “policy accommodation.”  Finally, to reinforce 

that the trajectory for policy could involve a near-term pause, the statement could 

refer to “appropriate monetary policy” instead of “appropriate monetary policy 

action” in the assessment of risks. 

(16) Market participants would not likely miss the hints in the announcement 

of Alternative A of a higher likelihood of a pause in June.  Intermediate- and longer-

term interest rates probably would drop appreciably, and equity markets would rally.  

The value of the dollar on foreign exchange markets would decrease along with the 

drop in U.S. yields.  These market moves might be more sizable if investors read the

statement as evidence that inflation pressures could be less intense than previously 

perceived.  In any event, market participants would likely be especially sensitive to 

readings on inflation over the upcoming intermeeting period.   

(17) Should the Committee be particularly concerned that underlying inflation 

pressures may be intensifying, it might be attracted to the 50-basis-point increase in 

the federal funds rate of Alternative C.  Members may be more inclined than the 

staff to assign signal, rather than noise, to the jump in the March CPI.  Also, prices 

of far-dated crude oil futures contracts have remained elevated over the period since 

the last Greenbook, which could be seen as implying little likelihood of a significant 

unwinding of the previous run-up in energy costs.  As discussed in an alternative 

scenario in the Greenbook, firms might pass on to their customers more of the 

higher energy costs than in the baseline forecast.  Moreover, actual productivity 

growth appears to have slowed over recent quarters, and Committee members 

might be concerned that structural labor productivity will decelerate by more than 

incorporated in the staff projection.  Taken together, higher energy prices and 

slower underlying productivity growth may be viewed as an especially adverse supply 

shock that lowers output in a manner that should be accepted rather than resisted.  

Abstracting from such gloom about aggregate supply, last summer’s episode, as well 

as broader economic experience, suggests that “soft patches” crop up from time to 

time and do not necessarily threaten robust expansion of aggregate demand over a 

longer period.  If the Committee believes that economic growth is likely to remain 

solid, it could move to check elevated inflation pressures by more vigorous policy 

action at this meeting.  The words of Alternative C (from row 2 down) might have 

an appeal even if the Committee chose to firm 25 basis points at this meeting.  A 

“C-lite” approach would convey a sense that the Committee wished to ensure that 

the market understood that future policy options spanned a wider range than the 

current statement might appear to some to allow.  As long as references to the 

Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) Page 23 of 40



accommodative stance of policy remain elsewhere in the statement, market 

participants would interpret that flexibility as introducing a tilt toward a firmer, 

rather than an easier, funds rate.  Removing all forward-looking guidance would 

require excising characterizations of the degree of accommodation as well as the 

“measured pace” language. 

(18) As indicated in Table 1, the Committee could consider a number of 

alterations to its statement in association with the selection of Alternative C to 

convey a heightened concern about inflation prospects.  For example, the 

Committee could strike the reference to “robust underlying growth in productivity” 

in the second sentence.  In addition, it could choose not to focus on the apparent 

recent slowing in output growth and simply note that “output continues to grow at a 

pace sufficient to eliminate any remaining resource slack.”  With regard to inflation, 

the Committee would probably wish to delete the sentence in the previous 

announcement that “The rise in energy prices, however, has not notably fed through 

to core consumer prices.”  Given the conditioning assumption of “appropriate 

monetary policy,” the Committee could retain its assessment that the risks to 

attainment of sustainable growth and price stability are balanced.  However, if the 

Committee wanted to gain flexibility to tighten policy at a faster pace in the future, it 

presumably would delete the risk assessment and the sentence expressing its belief 

that policy accommodation can be removed at a pace that is likely to be measured.  

(The characterization that policy is accommodative elsewhere in the statement 

would remain as the sole signal of the direction of future action.)  Even after these 

deletions, the Committee might wish to underscore that its future actions would 

depend on evolving economic outcomes by indicating, with a nod to its dual 

objectives, that “The Committee will respond to changes in economic prospects as 

needed to fulfill its obligation to foster the attainment of both sustainable economic 

growth and price stability.” 

Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) Page 24 of 40



(19) The selection of the 50-basis-point increase in the federal funds rate of 

Alternative C would come as a considerable surprise to market participants.  That 

hike, coupled with some or all of the changes in announcement wording discussed 

in the previous paragraph, would prompt investors to revise sharply upward their 

expectations for the path of monetary policy in the near term and likely beyond, and 

thus would have a pronounced effect on financial markets more generally.  Interest 

rates would rise substantially across the yield curve, equity prices would probably 

decline, and the foreign exchange value of the dollar could increase significantly.  

The same language associated with a quarter-point increase in the funds rate would 

also send markets in the same direction, but to a lesser extent. 

Money and Debt Forecasts 

(20) Under the Greenbook forecast, rising short-term interest rates are 

expected to be accompanied by increasing opportunity costs of holding monetary 

assets as deposit interest rates, particularly those on liquid deposits, lag increases in 

market yields.  As a result, growth of M2 is projected to remain weak, averaging just 

2¾ percent for 2005 as a whole and 4 percent in 2006.  Over the forecast period, 

the debt of nonfinancial corporations is projected to expand at a moderate rate.  

External financing needs are expected to be held down this year by inflows from 

abroad in response to temporary favorable tax treatment of repatriated earnings and 

high levels of liquid assets.  In 2006, nonfinancial corporations are expected to tap 

credit markets to a somewhat greater extent, and net equity runoffs are projected to 

diminish.  Household sector borrowing is anticipated to decelerate in coming 

quarters as house price increases slow and households begin to reverse the sharp 

decline in the saving rate that has occurred in recent years.  In 2005 and 2006, 

federal debt is expected to grow at a pace a little below the 9 percent rate of increase

Directive and Balance of  Risks Statement 

(21) Draft language for the directive and draft risk assessments identical to 

those presented in Table 1 are provided below. 

Directive Wording 
The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and financial 

conditions that will foster price stability and promote sustainable growth 

in output.  To further its long-run objectives, the Committee in the 

immediate future seeks conditions in reserve markets consistent with 

MAINTAINING/increasing/REDUCING the federal funds rate 

AT/to an average of around ____________ 2-3/4 percent. 

Risk Assessments  

A. The Committee perceives that, with appropriate monetary policy, the 

upside and downside risks to the attainment of both sustainable growth 

and price stability should be kept roughly equal.  With underlying 

inflation expected to be relatively low, the Committee believes that 

remaining policy accommodation can be removed at a pace that is likely 

to be measured.  Nonetheless, the Committee will respond to changes in 

economic prospects as needed to fulfill its obligation to maintain price 

stability. 

B. The Committee perceives that, with appropriate monetary policy action, 

the upside and downside risks to the attainment of both sustainable 

growth and price stability should be kept roughly equal.  With underlying 

inflation expected to be contained, the Committee believes that policy 

accommodation can be removed at a pace that is likely to be measured.  

Nonetheless, the Committee will respond to changes in economic 

prospects as needed to fulfill its obligation to maintain price stability.

C. The Committee will respond to changes in economic prospects as 

needed to fulfill its obligation to foster the attainment of both
