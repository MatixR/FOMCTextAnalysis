MONETARY POLICY ALTERNATIVES

Recent Developments

(1) The stance of monetary policy has remained unchanged since

the May FOMC meeting: Federal funds have continued to trade around 5-3/4

percent--as they have since the cut in the discount rate at the end of

April--and the formal allowance for adjustment plus seasonal borrowing was

changed only for technical reasons. The borrowing allowance was raised in

several steps, to its current level of $325 million, in line with the

pickup in seasonal borrowing. Over the intermeeting period, borrowing

consistently ran a bit above the allowance as adjustment credit showed

increased strength; the buildup of seasonal credit, however, was somewhat

below its usual early-summer gradient.1

(2) Growing evidence that the business-cycle trough had passed

raised interest rates all along the yield curve through most of the inter-

meeting period. Against a backdrop of economic data releases supporting

the notion that the economy was recovering and statements by Federal

Reserve officials in the same vein, the structure of rates began to

reflect a chance of a tightening before year-end. Most recently, investor

skittishness has reemerged, especially with respect to bank paper in the

wake of reports of increased problems with asset quality. In this

environment, yields on Treasury securities have been bid down, leaving

ample liquidity at agricultural banks, which are seeing damped loan
demand--owing in part to the recession and rain-delayed planting--and
stronger retail deposit inflows.

them little changed to 20 basis points higher over the intermeeting

period. Spreads on bank obligations have widened, as have those on lower-

rated commercial paper in response to a default by Columbia Gas.

(3) With U.S. interest rates tending higher amid clearer signs

of an emerging economic recovery here, the weighted average exchange value

of the dollar rose about 5-1/4 percent over the intermeeting period. The

dollar appreciated 7 percent against the mark, but was little changed

against the yen, which itself was supported by stronger-than-expected

economic data for Japan that fostered a sense that the anticipated easing

of Japanese monetary policy would be postponed. Interest rates in Japan

rose 10 to 20 basis points. Despite the Bundesbank's nudging up of RP

rates, most market interest rates in Germany were down slightly until the

end of the period, when bond yields jumped on fears of a reintroduction of

the withholding tax on interest income. These fears, along with turmoil

in Yugoslavia, contributed to downward movement of the mark late in the

period.

the Desk sold $50 million in mid-May

(4) M2 growth, now estimated at a 3-1/4 percent rate for the

March-to-June period, fell short of the 4 percent pace specified by the

Committee at the May meeting. Although the bounceback in May from the

tax-related weakness in money in April turned out to be stronger than had



been expected, renewed weakness appeared in June, with M2 growth at just a

2 percent rate. The rebound in May was most evident in transaction depos-

its, lifting M1 to a 13-3/4 percent annual rate of growth for the month.2

A slowdown in M1 in June showed through to M2, and its effect on the

broader aggregate was reinforced by the ongoing deceleration of that

aggregate's nontransaction component. Although inflows to liquid non-

transaction deposits stayed very strong in June in response to the sub-

stantial narrowing in their opportunity costs in recent months, small time

deposits ran off at an accelerating rate. Much of this runoff no doubt

represented a redirection toward the liquid components of M2 as the rate

advantage of retail CDs waned, but part of it likely was a net drag on the

aggregate as, for example, investors moved into capital market instruments

in an effort to maintain yields on funds released by maturing time depos-

its. Certainly, inflows to bond and stock mutual funds were very heavy in

May and, for bond funds, are said to have continued strong in June as

well. The attractiveness of these longer-term market investments also was

reflected in money fund shares, which were about flat. While the unusual

strength of portfolio shifts into longer-term instruments may explain some

of the recent weakness in M2, the causes of much of this shortfall remain

unclear.

(5) After two months over which it posted a slight net decline,

bank credit is estimated to have risen a bit in June, buoyed by a pickup

in acquisitions of securities and a cessation of the runoff in loans.

2. After increasing at a 16-1/2 percent pace in May, total reserves
rose at a 8-3/4 percent rate in June. With currency growth subdued, the
monetary base increased at about a 3-1/2 percent pace in both months.



Nevertheless, overall depository funding needs likely continued to

decrease, with the decline in thrift assets apparently accelerating as the

RTC stepped up its resolution activity. Largely as a result, M3 fell

slightly in June and was about unchanged for the entire March-to-June

period, compared with the 2 percent growth rate specified in the most

recent directive.

(6) Preliminary data indicate that C&I loans continued to drop

at a substantial rate in June, and commercial paper of nonfinancial firms

again ran off, albeit at a slower pace than in May. In part, the weakness

in these components reflected a redirection of credit demands toward the

bond market, as issuers apparently considered bond yields to be near

cyclical lows. However, overall debt growth of nonfinancial firms is

estimated to have been quite sluggish in the second quarter, likely

restrained by the runoff of business inventories and drop in associated

funding needs. In addition, the rapid pace of gross equity issuance,

combined with a slowdown in merger-related reductions in equity, probably

damped firms' borrowing. Gross debt issuance by state and local govern-

ments increased markedly in June: The continued robust pace of long-term

issuance was augmented by a slug of short-term funding, a portion of which

was necessitated by revenue shortfalls in certain localities. In the

household sector, borrowing appears to have increased a bit in recent

months, owing primarily to a resumption in consumer credit expansion; in

June, growth of consumer credit at banks (adjusted for securitization) was

the highest in several months. The overall debt aggregate is estimated to



-5-

have accelerated to about a 5-3/4 percent rate in May, and there is little

reason to think that June strayed far from that pace.

(7) From the fourth quarter of last year through June, M2 grew

at a 4 percent annual rate, a bit below the midpoint of its annual target

range. M3 growth also, at a 2-1/2 percent pace, was slightly below the

midpoint of its range. The rate of increase for both these aggregates is

about as had been expected by the staff at the time of the February FOMC

meeting. While nominal income was weaker than projected in February, the

effects on M2 were about offset by subsequent policy easings, which

narrowed opportunity costs on money assets. M2 velocity declined in the

first half at a 1-1/4 percent annual rate. However, the drop in V2 was

less (and M2 growth weaker) than implied by the staff econometric model of

money demand. The model overprediction, which had been built into the

staff forecast, lessened from that in the second half of 1990, but its

persistence indicated the presence of a continuing upward velocity shift,

likely related to the ongoing redirection of credit flows away from depos-

itories together with the appetite of asset holders for the higher yields

of longer-term investments. The growth of M3 was boosted by a surge in

issuance of large CDs by U.S. branches and agencies of foreign banks,

after removal of the reserve requirement on these instruments. The

branches and agencies have been using the funds to pay down other types of

liabilities, funnel funds offshore, and re-book assets previously held

offshore to the United States.3 Instead of the earlier expectation for

the debt of domestic nonfinancial sectors to be just below the middle of

its 4-1/2 to 8-1/2 percent monitoring range at midyear, it is tracking the

bottom edge of its annual cone. This miss may have reflected not only the

slower pace of economic activity, but also a more cautious attitude by

borrowers toward taking on debt. Certainly, net equity retirements are

running well below projections, damping that source of credit demand. On

the supply side, the marked narrowing of yield spreads in securities mar-

kets suggests credit availability for many borrowers improved over the

first half; however, the prime rate has remained relatively high and banks

restrictive in granting credit.

Alternative Long-Run Strategies

(8) Four alternative long-run strategies for monetary policy are

presented below as background for consideration of the annual ranges for

the aggregates. Strategy I, the baseline, assumes that policy seeks to

make gradual progress toward price stability by promoting a moderate pace

of output growth over the next several years, maintaining a small degree

of slack in resource utilization. It adopts the greenbook forecast for

1991 and 1992 and extends that forecast through 1995 using the staff's

macro-econometric model. The economic outcomes for strategies II, III,

and IV are derived from the baseline using the econometric model.4

Strategy II contemplates a tighter policy, indexed by M2 growth slower by

1 percentage point at an annual rate than in the baseline, designed to

make more progress toward price stability. Strategy III is more stimula-

tive than the baseline policy, with money growth faster by 1 percentage

point at an annual rate, in order to assure a more robust economic expan-

sion. Strategy IV has the same five-year money growth as the baseline to

provide the same long-run restraint on inflation, but frontloads that

growth to assure a stronger pace of output growth in the initial years of

4. The results of these exercises depend importantly on the model's
"sacrifice ratio"--the number of years that unemployment must remain
above the natural rate by 1 percentage point in order to reduce the
inflation rate by 1 percentage point. The model's sacrifice ratio is
about 2--perhaps a shade more than is implicit in the staff's judgmental
forecast for 1991-92. The formation of price expectations is a key
element in the determination of this ratio. The model assumes that
expectations of inflation are formed in an "adaptive" fashion, that is,
that they depend only on past inflation. If expectations were formed in
a more forward-looking manner, and if, for example, a particular strat-
egy led to the perception that monetary policy was committed to achiev-
ing a lower inflation rate, the actual costs of disinflation under that
strategy would be smaller than implied by the results presented here.



the expansion. One consideration taken into account in constructing the

money paths for each strategy was the ongoing downward shift in M2 demand,

which has been assumed to continue through 1993, albeit at a diminishing

rate.

(9) Under the baseline strategy, M2 would expand at a 5-1/2

percent rate throughout the forecast period. The assumed growth of money

5. In particular, these simulations assume downward shifts in M2 de-
mand, for given nominal incomes and opportunity costs, of 2 percent in
1990, 1 percent in 1991, 3/4 percent in 1992, and 1/2 percent in 1993.



-10-

is consistent with some monetary restraint. Indeed, over the next few

years flat M2 growth implies increasing restraint as the money demand

shift abates. Real interest rates move higher over the first few years

and remain at those elevated levels in 1994 and 1995. Nominal interest

rates decline over the last two years as inflation abates, boosting the

demand for money relative to income. This strategy keeps the unemployment

rate from falling below 6 percent and maintains downward pressure on

inflation, which would fall to about a 2-3/4 percent rate by 1995.

(10) The tighter monetary policy of strategy II produces a

sharper decline in inflation. Achieving the slower M2 growth of this

strategy would require higher nominal short-term interest rates from now

into 1993, averaging roughly 1/2 percentage point above the baseline.

Nominal rates fall below the baseline later in the simulation period, but

real interest rates are higher throughout. The higher real interest rates

would have relatively little impact on economic developments this year,

given the usual lags. Therefore, real GNP growth each year would be sig-

nificantly below that of the baseline and below the expansion of the

economy's capacity, pushing up the unemployment rate to over 7 percent by

the end of the period. The higher real interest rates of this strategy

would be expected to produce a modest appreciation of the dollar, rein-

forcing the restraining effects of slack aggregate demand on domestic

prices; these combined forces pull inflation down to 1-1/4 percent by

1995.

(11) The easier policy of strategy III stimulates output and

employment in the near term and makes some progress against inflation over



-11-

the next few years. However, that progress is largely a consequence of

the slowing already in train, and inflation accelerates later in the

period. Early on, nominal interest rates would have to drop about a half

point to get the higher money growth, and would remain below the baseline

through 1993. The implied lower real interest rates and more rapid money

growth of this strategy result in a steep decline of the unemployment rate

over the projection period, bringing it below the natural rate by late

1993. Inflation increases only moderately within the simulation period,

but would be on an upward trend, boosted a little by a declining dollar.

(12) Strategy IV has the basic tenor of policy under the base-

line, but it is more activist, with changes in money growth and interest

rates intended to raise the odds on healthy output growth initially but to

restore the downward tilt to inflation over time once the expansion is

well underway. Money growth is 1 percentage point faster than the

baseline for the next four quarters, but that excess is offset subse-

quently with slower growth for a time, leaving the level of money from

mid-1994 the same as in the baseline. To achieve this path for money, the

federal funds rate would have to be about 1/2 percentage point below

baseline for the first four quarters of the period, but then would have to

rise by a percentage point, and remain above the baseline for the much of

the remainder of the period. Under this strategy, the unemployment rate

drops sooner and farther than in the baseline, before edging up in

response to later monetary restraint. Because the average degree of slack

in resource use over the five-year period is smaller than in the baseline,

the progress against inflation is a little less.



-12-

(13) The table below presents inflation rates derived from the

P* model simulated under the four strategies.6 Two variants of the model

are employed. One variant uses the historical long-run average of veloc-

ity; results from these simulations are presented in the upper panel.

This model, without adjustment for velocity shifts, in effect views the

slow money growth of the past few years as implying more monetary strin-

gency than under the staff forecast, placing current P* 3-1/2 percent

below actual prices. As a result, it indicates a much sharper drop of

inflation than in the staff forecast, to the 2 percent range under base-

line money by 1992; however, 2 percent is below the long-run, steady-state

inflation rate that would be associated with 5-1/2 percent M2 growth, and

inflation begins to cycle higher in 1995. The simulations presented in

the lower panel assume that equilibrium velocity shifts up by the same

percentages as M2 demand was assumed to shift in the simulation with the

large-scale model. The baseline simulation with adjustments for velocity

shifts indicates that P* is currently about 1 percent below the actual

price level, providing a moderate downward thrust to inflation in the near

term. Inflation in this simulation initially declines a bit more quickly

than in the staff forecast. By 1992, however, P* is equal to the price

level, and with 5-1/2 percent money growth, P* rises above the price level

subsequently, causing inflation to turn up in the later years of the

simulation. To achieve continuing disinflation over the whole simulation

Projections for 1991 and 1992

(15) M2 is expected to accelerate to a 5-1/2 percent rate over

the second half of 1991, bringing growth for the year to about 5 percent.

Expansion of this aggregate should be stimulated by the anticipated pickup

of nominal GNP growth to a 7-3/4 percent pace over the second half. With

short-term market rates assumed steady, opportunity costs will widen as

offering rates on liquid deposits fall further in lagged adjustment to

earlier declines in market rates. The rise in opportunity costs will

restrain the aggregate's growth, contributing to a rise in its velocity at

more than a 2 percent annual rate over the rest of the year (see chart).

In addition, the likely persistence of a steep yield curve also should

keep long-term market instruments, such as bond funds, an attractive out-

let for some maturing small time deposits that had much higher rates when

originally issued. By early next year, opportunity costs cease rising and

their depressing effects on M2 demands die out. As the rate of nominal

income expansion scales back to 6 percent over 1992, M2 is seen as sus-

taining a 5-1/2 percent growth rate. This projection assumes that the

shortfall in M2 growth relative to model projections, although continuing,

tends to abate gradually, as restraint on credit supplies at depositories

unwinds with the economic recovery.

(16) M3 is projected to grow at around a 3 percent rate through

next year, influenced by offsetting forces. On the one hand, bank credit

is anticipated to strengthen with the economic recovery, enlarging bank

financing needs.7  On the other hand, thrift credit is likely to decline

more rapidly as RTC activity moves into higher gear. Moreover, issuance

of large CDs by branches and agencies of foreign banks is expected to slow

over the forecast horizon, as more of the adjustment to the change in

relative borrowing costs caused by the reduction in reserve requirements

is completed.

(17) The debt of domestic nonfinancial sectors is expected to

accelerate over the second half of the year to a 6-1/2 percent rate,

7. This forecast has made no special allowance for the effects of any
new banking bill that might be passed this year. In particular, both
bank credit and M3 might be affected if such a bill significantly lim-
ited the reach of the federal safety net, so that uninsured creditors
felt their funds were at greater risk. These creditors would require
higher yields on bank obligations. With many banks facing higher costs
and greater potential for losing access to funding sources, restraints
on bank lending may ease less rapidly in the economic expansion.
Effects on M2 are likely to be muted and their direction ambiguous
unless insurance coverage is cut back substantially.



-16-

spurred by a surge in federal borrowing. The federal deficit will widen

over the remainder of the year, augmented in part by enlarged RTC resolu-

tion activity and reduced payments by foreign governments to the Defense

Cooperation Account. Nonfederal debt growth rises only gradually in the

staff projection, and the debt of these sectors is projected to expand

less rapidly than their spending. Restraint on debt growth will continue

to be imparted by some lingering reluctance of lenders to extend credit to

less than top-quality borrowers. Given relatively wide spreads between

rates charged and rates paid by intermediaries, borrowers should be more

prone to finance additional spending out of assets than by taking on more

debt. Consumer installment credit growth moves slightly higher, while

expansion in household mortgage debt stays at about the estimated pace of

this quarter. Nonfinancial business debt growth should strengthen a

little over the second half, primarily because of renewed short-term

borrowing associated in part with the anticipated turn to inventory

accumulation over the second half. For 1992, overall debt growth remains

at 6-1/2 percent. Nonfederal debt growth continues to firm, though to a

pace still below that of nominal GNP. Business borrowing increases as

greater capital spending further widens the financing gap and as merger

activity reawakens; household debt acquisition also continues to pick up

slightly. As an offset, federal debt growth ebbs with a slackening in RTC

funding needs, but remains in double digits.

Ranges for 1991

(18) This bluebook does not present alternatives to the current

1991 ranges for money and debt. In the past, the FOMC has altered the



-17-

ranges for the current year at the midyear meeting only when the aggre-

gates have shown signs of markedly diverging from the established annual

ranges owing to special factors thought to be unrelated to economic per-

formance. That is not the case this year. The monetary aggregates are

projected to remain in the middle portions of their existing ranges over

the balance of the year, and their growth is expected to be consistent

with economic recovery continuing into next year accompanied by reduced

inflation pressures. Those ranges also should be adequate to allow for

needed reactions to unexpected economic or financial developments or to

accommodate adjustments to the Committee's longer-term strategy, perhaps

along the lines outlined above.

(19) So far this year, domestic nonfinancial debt is growing

only at the lower bound of its range, but the staff anticipates a speed-up

in growth over the rest of the year sufficient to bring this aggregate

well up into the bottom half of its range. Moreover, the aggregate's

position in its range reflects the unusual restraint on private credit

formation, as well as slow growth in nominal spending. Indeed, this

weakness relative to the announced range warrants careful monitoring for

any implications about spending plans and the availability of credit.

From that point of view, a downward revision to the range could be misin-

terpreted as signalling complacency about the credit slowdown.

Ranges for 1992

(20) The table below presents three alternative sets of ranges

for growth of the monetary and debt aggregates over 1992. Alternative II



-18-

replicates the current 1991 ranges, while alternative I raises and alter-

native III lowers the current ranges by 1/2 percentage point.

Money and Debt Growth over 1992
(QIV to QIV percent change)

Memo:
Alt. II Staff

Alt. I (1991 Ranges) Alt. III Projection

M2 3 to 7 2-1/2 to 6-1/2 2 to 6 5-1/2

M3 1-1/2 to 5-1/2 1 to 5 1/2 to 4-1/2 3

Debt 5 to 9 4-1/2 to 8-1/2 4 to 8 6-1/2

(21) Alternative II is broadly consistent with staff forecasts

for money, economic activity, and prices, and therefore with the baseline

strategy of gradual reductions in inflation. M3 and debt are projected at

the midpoint of their alternative II ranges, but M2 is projected to be

well up in its range. In the case of M2, this range might imply that the

Committee was less willing to tolerate surprisingly strong than surpris-

ingly weak nominal income growth. This feature may be viewed as espe-

cially appropriate after the initial stages of economic expansion, when

with higher levels of resource utilization, unanticipated strength in

demand could undermine the disinflationary process. On the other hand, if

economic activity proves weaker than the staff forecast, prompting a

monetary policy easing, alternative II could constrain further easing

somewhat; the resulting stimulus of lower opportunity costs could bring

growth of M2 near the upper bound of its range rather quickly.



-19-

(22) If the risks to the outlook were viewed as weighted on the

side of weaker-than-expected production, employment and inflation pres-

sures, or if the staff's greenbook forecast were judged to embody an

insufficient economic recovery, the higher growth rates of alternative I

could be selected. Thus, this alternative would line up roughly with the

easier strategy discussed above, with its emphasis on assuring expansion

sufficient to reduce the margin of unutilized resources. Alternative I

also could be preferred if, given an acceptable economic forecast, the

bluebook projection for M2 growth were viewed as too low. This view could

be buttressed by the notion that an economic recovery should improve the

quality of bank assets, leading to a faster unwinding of restraint on bank

lending and of the associated reluctance of banks to attract retail

deposits. Accordingly, the previous shortfall of M2 growth relative to

typical experience could be seen as more likely to reverse than to

continue.

(23) Alternative III, on the other hand, could be justified if

the odds were seen concentrated on the side of a more robust economic

recovery than in the staff forecast, with the attendant risk that less

progress would be made against inflation, or if the slowing of inflation

over time in the baseline forecast were itself viewed as inadequate. The

tighter long-term strategy discussed above is readily encompassed within

the current alternative II range. But alternative III would seem more

consistent with the spirit and intent of that strategy, since reducing the

ranges another 1/2 percentage point would underscore the Committee's com-

mitment to the attainment of price stability. The upper bound of the M2



-20-

range for 1992 would be brought within 1/2 percentage point of the staff

projection, implying the need for a prompt tightening of policy should

unexpected strength in nominal spending further raise M2. The reduced

lower bound also could imply considerable tolerance for slower-than-

expected M2 growth before a policy easing would be triggered, either

because the Committee would tolerate slower expansion of income or because

continued problems of banks and thrifts are reflected in further rechan-

nelling of credit flows outside depositories and even greater strength in

V2.



-21-

Short-Run Policy Alternatives

(24) Three near-term alternatives for monetary policy are pre-

sented below for Committee consideration. Under alternative B, federal

funds would continue to trade around 5-3/4 percent. Initially, the al-

lowance for adjustment and seasonal borrowing would remain at $325 mil-

lion.8  Under alternative A, the federal funds rate would decline to

around 5-1/4 percent. This reduction could be accomplished either by

providing nonborrowed reserves sufficient for adjustment and seasonal

borrowing to decline to about $275 million or by cutting the discount rate

by 1/2 percentage point from its current level of 5-1/2 percent.9 Alter-

native C incorporates a funds rate of 6-1/4 percent and borrowing of about

$375 million. Growth rates for the monetary aggregates projected to ac-

company the three alternatives are shown in the table below. More detail-

ed data are presented in the tables and charts on the following pages.

(25) Under alternative B, market interest rates would probably

remain near their current levels. Market rates appear generally to incor-

porate a consensus view of no change in the stance of monetary policy over

the rest of the summer. Market participants, however, seem to expect the

economic rebound over the next few months to be weaker than presented in

the greenbook. If economic data turn out to be consistent with the green-

book, some upward pressure on interest rates could occur, though that

8. Although seasonal borrowing has been somewhat lower than usual this
year, such borrowing is expected to rise over the summer, and additional
upward adjustments to the borrowing allowance probably will be required
in the next few months.
9. As discussed in recent bluebooks, the first approach has the

disadvantage of limiting the ability of the discount window to absorb
fluctuations in reserve supply and demand, thereby causing the funds
rate to become a little more volatile.

pressure would be offset if data also continue to indicate good inflation

performance. The foreign exchange value of the dollar also is not

expected to show much change from its current level under this alterna-

tive.

(26) Alternative B embodies the staff projections for money and

debt consistent with the nominal GNP and unchanged interest rates of the

greenbook forecast. With the pickup in GNP, M2 would accelerate to a

5-1/2 percent annual rate from June to September, bringing this aggregate

up to the middle of its long-run range in September. On a quarterly

average basis, M2 would expand at a 4-1/2 percent rate during the third

quarter which, given the staff projection of an 8 percent increase in

nominal GNP, implies that velocity would rise at a 3-1/2 percent rate.

This increase reflects, in part, the rise in opportunity costs as deposit

rates decline, as well as lags in the adjustment of money holdings to a

marked change in income growth. M3 is expected to increase at a 3 percent

rate from June to September under alternative B, keeping this aggregate a

little below the midpoint of its annual range. The pickup in M3 relative

to the last three months reflects a rise in overall borrowing, including

from banks, as the economy recovers. Total nonfinancial debt is projected

to increase at a 6-3/4 percent annual rate over June to September, raising

this aggregate well into the lower bound of its monitoring range by Sep-

tember.

(27) Alternative A would provide more assurance of a pickup in

the growth of the monetary aggregates, and by implication in the growth of

the economy as well later this year and in early 1992. The staff pro-

jects that M2 growth would be at a 6-1/2 percent rate from June to Septem-

ber under alternative A. By September, M2 would be a little above the

midpoint of its annual range. The further easing of monetary policy

contemplated under alternative A would catch market participants by

surprise, and short-term market interest rates would drop considerably.

Bond yields are unlikely to fall much, absent favorable inflation news.

The value of the dollar on foreign exchange markets likely would decline

substantially.

(28) Alternative C also would catch market participants un-

awares, and short-term interest rates likely would adjust upward rather

sharply. Bond yields also would rise, but by considerably less than

short-term rates if market participants came to the view that the Federal

Reserve was taking the opportunity to make more decisive progress against

inflation. The foreign exchange value of the dollar might well increase

considerably further under this alternative. M2 would expand at only a

4-1/2 percent annual rate from June through September, with growth rates



-25-

falling off over the quarter. M2 would still be below the midpoint of its

range in September and would be headed for a lower position in its range

by year-end, with the effects of higher interest rates reinforced by some

restraint on nominal spending. M3 probably would expand at a 2-1/2 per-

cent rate over the June-to-September period, keeping this aggregate a

little below the midpoint of its range.

Directive Language

(29) Presented below for Committee consideration is a draft of

the directive paragraph relating to the ranges for 1991 and for 1992.

With regard to the first sentence in the paragraph, which states the

Committee's general policy objectives, the Committee may wish to delete

the phrase "a resumption of." The deletion essentially would restore the

previous language and would be consistent, of course, with a view that a

recovery is underway.

(30) Draft wording for the operational paragraph, with the usual

options and updating, is presented in the second paragraph below.

The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and

financial conditions that will foster price stability, promote

[a resumption of] sustainable growth in output, and contribute

to an improved pattern of international transactions. In fur-

therance of these objectives, the Committee REAFFIRMED at THIS

its meeting THE RANGES IT HAD ESTABLISHED in February

established ranges for growth of M2 and M3 of 2-1/2 to 6-1/2

percent and 1 to 5 percent, respectively, measured from the

fourth quarter of 1990 to the fourth quarter of 1991. [IN

FURTHERANCE OF THESE OBJECTIVES, THE COMMITTEE AT THIS MEETING

RAISED/LOWERED THE RANGES IT HAD ESTABLISHED IN FEBRUARY FOR

GROWTH OF M2 AND M3 TO RANGES OF ____ TO ____ AND ____ TO ____ PERCENT

RESPECTIVELY, MEASURED FROM THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 1990 TO THE

FOURTH QUARTER OF 1991.] The monitoring range for growth of



-27-

total domestic nonfinancial debt ALSO was MAINTAINED set at

4-1/2 to 8-1/2 percent [(ALSO) WAS RAISED/LOWERED TO ____ TO ____

PERCENT] for the year. FOR 1992 THE COMMITTEE AGREED ON

TENTATIVE RANGES FOR MONETARY GROWTH, MEASURED FROM THE FOURTH

QUARTER OF 1991 TO THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 1992, OF ____ TO ____

PERCENT FOR M2 AND ____ TO ____ PERCENT FOR M3. THE COMMITTEE

PROVISIONALLY SET THE ASSOCIATED MONITORING RANGE FOR GROWTH OF

TOTAL DOMESTIC NONFINANCIAL DEBT AT ____ TO ____ PERCENT FOR 1992.

With regard to M3, the Committee anticipated that the ongoing

restructuring of thrift depository institutions would continue

to depress THE its growth OF THIS AGGREGATE relative to spend-

ing and total credit. The behavior of the monetary aggregates

will continue to be evaluated in the light of progress toward

price level stability, movements in their velocities, and

developments in the economy and financial markets.

OPERATIONAL PARAGRAPH

In the implementation of policy for the immediate

future, the Committee seeks to DECREASE SOMEWHAT/maintain/

INCREASE SOMEWHAT the existing degree of pressure on reserve

positions. Depending upon progress toward price stability,

trends in economic activity, the behavior of the monetary

aggregates, and developments in foreign exchange and domestic

financial markets, somewhat (SLIGHTLY) greater reserve re-

straint (MIGHT/WOULD) or somewhat (SLIGHTLY) lesser reserve



-28-

restraint might (WOULD) be acceptable in the intermeeting per-

iod. The contemplated reserve conditions are expected to be

consistent with growth of M2 and M3 over the period from [DEL: March

through] June THROUGH SEPTEMBER at annual rates of about ____ AND

____ {DEL: 4 and 2] percent, respectively.

*--Growth rates in parentheses are QIV'90 t:o June 1991, except QIV to May for debt.
1. Targets are for bank credit until 1983; from 1983 onward targets are for domestic
nonfinancial sector debt.
2. At the February 1979 meeting the FOMC adopted a QIV'78 to QIV'79 range for M1 of 1-1/2
to 4-1/2 percent. This range anticipated that shifting to ATS and NOW accounts in New
York State would slow Ml growth by 3 percentage points. At the October meeting it was
noted that ATS/NOW shifts would reduce M1 by no more than 1-1/2 percentage points. Thus,
the longer-run range for M1 was modified to 3-6 percent.
3. The figures shown reflect target and actual growth of M1-B in 1980 and shift-adjusted
M1-B in 1981. M1-B was relabeled Ml in January 1982. The targeted growth for Ml-A was 3-
1/2 to 6 percent in 1980 (actual growth was 5.0 percent); in 1981 targeted growth for
shift-adjusted Mi-A was 3 to 5-1/2 percent (actual growth was 1.3 percent).
4. When these ranges were set, shifts into other checkable deposits in 1980 were expected
to have only a limited effect on growth of Ml-A and M1-B. As the year progressed,
however, banks offered other checkable deposits more actively, and more funds than
expected were directed to these accounts. Such shifts are estimated to have decreased Ml-
A growth and increased Ml-B growth each by at least 1/2 percentage point more than had
been anticipated.

(Footnotes are continued on next page)



Adjusted for the effects of shifts out of demand deposits and savings deposits into
other checkable deposits. At the February FOMC meeting, the target ranges for observed
M1-A and M1-B in 1981 on an unadjusted basis, expected to be consistent with the adjusted
ranges, were -4-1/2 to -2 and 6 to 8-1/2 percent, respectively. Actual M1-B growth (not
shift adjusted) was 5.0 percent.
6. Adjusted for shifts of assets from domestic banking offices to International Banking
Facilities.
7. Range for bank credit is annualized growth from the December 1981-January 1982 average
level through the fourth quarter of 1982.
8. Base period, adopted at the July 1983 FOMC meeting, is QII'83. At the February 1983
meeting the FOMC had adopted a QIV'82 to QIV'83 target range for M1 of 4 to 8 percent.
9. Base period is the February-March 1983 average.
10. Base period, adopted at the July 1985 FOMC meeting, is QII'85. At the February 1985
meeting the FOMC had adopted a QIV'84 to QIV'85 target range for M1 of 4 to 7 percent.
11. No range for M1 has been specified since the February 1987 FOMC meeting because of
uncertainties about its underlying relationship to the behavior of the economy and its
sensitivity to economic and financial circumstances.
12. At the February 1990 meeting the FOMC specified a range of 2-1/2 to 6-1/2 percent.
This range was lowered to 1 to 5 percent at the July 1990 meeting.
