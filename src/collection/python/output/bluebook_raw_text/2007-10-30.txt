MONETARY POLICY ALTERNATIVES 

Recent Developments 

Summary 

(1) Financial market functioning improved somewhat over the intermeeting 

period, but conditions in a number of markets remained strained.  Market interest 

rates declined and the expected path of the federal funds rate shifted down following 

the FOMC’s decision at its September meeting to lower the target federal funds rate 

by 50 basis points.  Amid mixed economic data releases and some worsening of credit 

concerns, yields moved down a bit further, on balance, over the remainder of the 

period.  In longer-term corporate markets, investment- and speculative-grade bond 

spreads narrowed somewhat over the period as a whole.  Bond issuance by 

investment-grade firms continued to be strong, a few LBO-related bonds were issued 

for the first time since early summer, and underwriters were able to syndicate a 

portion of a few large LBO-related loans to nonbank lenders.  In housing finance, the 

spread between offer rates on prime jumbo fixed-rate mortgages and conforming 

loans declined a bit, but remained elevated.  Issuance of securities backed by subprime 

mortgages stayed low, while issuance of those backed by prime jumbo mortgages 

appears to have increased only modestly.  Respondents to the October Senior Loan 

Officer Opinion Survey reported having tightened standards and terms on many types 

of loans over the past three months.  The exchange value of the dollar moved lower 

over the intermeeting period, and broad stock price indexes increased, on net, despite 

some recent sharp sell-offs.

Monetary Policy Expectations and Treasury Yields 

(2) The FOMC’s decision at its September 18 meeting to lower the target 

federal funds rate by 50 basis points to 4¾ percent prompted a decline in market 

interest rates, as investors apparently had attached substantial odds to a smaller policy 

move.1  The subsequent publication of the minutes of the September meeting left 

little imprint in financial markets.  The anticipated path of monetary policy moved 

down somewhat further, on net, over the remainder of the period in response to 

mixed economic data releases and some worsening of credit concerns (Chart 1).  

Market quotes indicate that investors currently assign about 60 percent probability to 

a 25 basis point easing at the October meeting and nearly 30 percent probability to a 

larger easing move.  Investors appear to expect about a 100 basis point cumulative 

reduction in the target federal funds rate by the end of 2008—about 35 basis points 

more than just before the September meeting.  With regard to the statement language, 

respondents to the Desk’s survey of primary dealers, conducted between October 18 

and October 22, were about equally divided between those expecting the Committee 

to judge that downside risks to growth are now the predominant policy concern; 

those anticipating a balanced risk assessment; and those expecting the Committee, as 

in September, to offer no explicit assessment of risk.  Measures of uncertainty around 

the future funds rate path derived from option prices were little changed, on net, over 

                                           
1 The effective federal funds rate averaged 4.75 percent over the intermeeting period.  
During the period, the federal funds rate was more volatile than usual.  The intraday 
standard deviation averaged 22 basis points, considerably higher than the 7 basis point 
average for the year through the end of July.  The funds rate continued to show a tendency 
to soften over the course of the day, reportedly reflecting in part strong demand for funds 
from European banks during morning trading.  The root mean squared deviation of the daily 
effective federal funds rate from the target also was higher than its average between the start 
of the year and the end of July.  Over the period, the Desk did not purchase any securities 
outright.  The volume of long-term RPs remained at $12 billion.

the intermeeting period, and the distribution of federal funds rates at six- and twelve-

month horizons remained skewed to the downside. 

(3) Consistent with the revision in policy expectations, two-year nominal 

Treasury yields fell 35 basis points, on net, over the intermeeting period, while ten-

year nominal yields declined 10 basis points.  Despite a marked rise in spot oil prices, 

TIPS-based inflation compensation was about unchanged.  Measures of short- and 

long-term inflation expectations from the Reuters-Michigan survey ticked down in 

October.  

Money Markets      

(4) Conditions in money markets appear to have improved a bit during the 

intermeeting period, with much of the improvement coming on the heels of the 

September policy easing.  In the United States, spreads on asset-backed commercial 

paper (ABCP) and on lower-rated unsecured commercial paper declined, on balance, 

but remained above their July levels.  Outstanding ABCP has continued to contract, 

albeit at a slower pace than in August, whereas unsecured paper has expanded so far 

in October (Chart 2).  A proposal by a consortium of large banks to create a Master 

Liquidity Enhanced Conduit that would purchase sound assets of some SIV conduits 

as a means of avoiding asset “fire sales” met with mixed reviews from other market 

participants.  The volume of ABCP issued in Europe appeared to stabilize in early 

October, but declined again late in the intermeeting period.  In Canada, the deadline 

for final agreement on restructuring outstanding ABCP was extended two more 

months to mid-December.  Conditions in term bank funding markets eased a little 

over the intermeeting period, although some signs of year-end pressures emerged.  

(See box “Early Indications of Year-end Pressures.”)  Spreads of term libor and 

federal funds rates over comparable overnight index swap rates stepped down after 

the September FOMC meeting, but they remained wide by historical standards.

Funding reportedly was available at somewhat longer maturities than in August and 

early September.  In European interbank money markets, spreads narrowed 

substantially at the shortest maturities and more modestly at longer maturities.  The 

functioning of the foreign exchange swap market improved somewhat over the 

period, but has not yet returned to pre-crisis conditions. 

  

Early Indications of Year-end Pressures  

 In recent years, year-end pressures in money markets have been muted.  This year, the 
extent of year-end pressures is difficult to gauge because diminished liquidity in term funding  
markets complicates the interpretation of forward rates.  Nonetheless, there are some signs of 
year-end pressures in interbank funding markets.  The spread of the one-month forward libor 
rate ending three months hence over the corresponding one-month forward Overnight Indexed 
Swap (OIS) rate—a measure that encompasses the year-end—is currently over 90 basis points.      
In contrast, the adjacent one-month forward spreads covering intervals ending two and four 
months hence―and thus excluding the year-end―are both around 55 basis points.  Moreover, the 
gap between the one-month forward libor-OIS spreads ending two and three months hence 
widened around the time that the maturity date on a three-month deposit crossed into the new 
year.  This development could reflect an increased premium that borrowers in the libor market 
are willing to pay in order to secure funding over year-end.  Moreover, the expectation that the 
Desk will supply generous reserves to avoid a spike in the effective federal funds rate on the last 
day of the year acts to keep the OIS rate from drifting higher.  Market participants in the 
commercial paper market have expressed some concerns about year-end pressures.  However, 
direct evidence on such pressures in the CP market is scarce because very little lower-grade 
commercial paper has been issued that matures beyond the end of December.

(5) Flows to prime money market mutual funds, which invest heavily in 

commercial paper, were robust over the intermeeting period, while government-only 

funds registered only small net inflows.  Functioning in the Treasury bill market has 

improved some since the September FOMC meeting, but continues to show signs of 

pressure; bill lending from the SOMA portfolio was heavy at times.  Bid-asked 

spreads in the interdealer market for Treasury bills reportedly remain somewhat 

elevated, though less so than in August.  The thinness of the market has been 

exacerbated by paydowns of Treasury bills in recent weeks following the receipt of 

September tax payments.  Day-to-day movements in bill yields have been outsized at 

times, and yields on three-month bills declined about 20 basis points, on net, over the 

period.   

Capital Markets 

(6) Conditions in corporate bond markets improved somewhat over the 

intermeeting period.  Spreads on longer-term investment- and speculative-grade 

bonds narrowed as much as 20 and 60 basis points, respectively, over the first part of 

the intermeeting period, but they widened more recently to end the period down 

about 15 basis points, on net.  Investment-grade corporate bond issuance was strong 

in September and early October, and speculative-grade issuance has picked up notably 

this month.  For the first time since early summer, a few LBO-related bonds were 

issued.  Conditions also appear to have improved a bit in the leveraged loan market.  

An index of credit default swap spreads on leveraged syndicated loans (the LCDX) 

fell 20 basis points, on balance, and secondary market credit spreads on the most 

liquid loans reportedly narrowed some.  The pipeline of underwritten leveraged loans 

that have not yet been syndicated, which includes some large LBO deals, remained 

substantial.  However, underwriters were able to sell portions of a few of these loans 

to institutional investors, including traditional loan investors such as mutual funds, 

Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) 7 of 44



pension funds, and collateralized loan obligations (CLOs), but also hedge funds and 

bank proprietary desks.  The syndications of these deals were reportedly followed very 

closely by market participants, partly because they could serve as a template for sales 

of other large deals that are still in the pipeline.  However, new issuance of CLOs, 

which provided much of the demand for leveraged loans in recent years, remained 

well below the pace observed during the first two quarters of the year.  On net, broad 

stock price indexes rose 2 to 4 percent despite some sharp sell-offs in the latter part of 

the intermeeting period.  Outside the financial sector, earnings generally exceeded 

expectations.  For financial firms, however, earnings in the third quarter came in 

below analysts’ expectations, reflecting in part substantial write-downs of mortgage-

related assets and collateralized debt obligations (CDOs).  Options-implied volatility 

on the S&P 500 declined, on net, over the period.         

(7) Markets for nonconforming home mortgages showed little improvement 

over the intermeeting period:  The spread between offer rates on prime jumbo fixed-

rate mortgages and comparable conforming loans stayed elevated, and securitization 

activity for jumbo mortgages appears to have increased modestly.  A significant net 

fraction of respondents to the October Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey reported 

that their originations of prime jumbo mortgages declined over the past three months 

compared with the previous three-month period.  Spreads on indexes of credit default 

swaps on subprime mortgages widened notably, and delinquency rates on variable-rate 

subprime mortgages posted a further increase in August.  Issuance of subprime-

mortgage-backed securities remained weak through mid-October.  Considerable 

fractions of respondents to the October Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey 

indicated that they had tightened lending standards on prime as well as nontraditional 

and subprime residential mortgage loans over the past three months.  In contrast, 

available information suggests that the origination of conforming mortgages has been 

little affected by recent developments.

Foreign Developments 

(8) As in the United States, conditions in financial markets abroad improved 

noticeably following the FOMC’s decision to cut the target federal funds rate, but a 

number of foreign markets remain unsettled.  The European Central Bank continued 

to provide substantial amounts of liquidity during the intermeeting period.  The Bank 

of England also added liquidity and allowed banks greater flexibility in meeting their 

target balances.  Equity prices in major industrial countries gained 2 to 5 percent over 

the period, and their implied volatilities declined (Chart 3).  Yields on long-term 

government securities recorded small net changes.  Stock prices in emerging market 

economies, which generally had been less affected by the recent financial crisis, 

performed even better in most cases, and EMBI+ spreads for many key emerging 

market economies narrowed. 

(9) The foreign exchange value of the dollar recorded a decline of more than 

3½ percent over the intermeeting period against a trade-weighted index of major 

foreign currencies, with a wide range of moves against individual currencies.2  The 

dollar dropped almost 5½ percent versus the Canadian dollar in response to 

indications of continued robust Canadian economic performance and higher prices 

for oil and other commodities.  The U.S. dollar fell below parity with the Canadian 

currency for the first time in more than thirty years.  The dollar declined 3 percent on 

balance against the euro and reached a record low during the period.  The dollar 

moved down somewhat less versus the yen, which appeared to be weakened by the 

re-establishment of yen-funded carry trade positions.  Both the Australian dollar and 

New Zealand dollar, currencies that are often on the other side of carry trades, 

appreciated substantially over the period.  The dollar also declined about 1¾ percent 

against an index of currencies of our other important trading partners.

Debt and Money 

(10)  Domestic nonfinancial sector debt is estimated to have increased at an 

annual rate of 7½ percent in the third quarter, a bit faster than in the second quarter, 

as slower borrowing by households and nonfinancial businesses was more than offset 

by faster expansion of federal government debt (Chart 4).  Notable net fractions of 

banks reported in the October Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey that they had 

tightened lending terms on C&I loans over the previous three months.  (See box 

“Recent Developments at Commercial Banks.”)  Even so, business debt growth 

remained strong, reflecting robust issuance of investment-grade bonds and the 

continued surge in C&I lending.  The growth of C&I loans was partly the result of 

LBO-related financings that underwriters could not syndicate to institutional investors 

ending up on banks’ books.  Household mortgage borrowing is estimated to have 

decelerated again in the third quarter, reflecting further declines in home price 

appreciation and home sales and tighter credit conditions for nonconforming 

mortgages.  In contrast, consumer credit continued to expand at a moderate pace 

through August.   

(11) M2 advanced at a 5½ percent annual rate in September and October, a 

significant deceleration from the rapid pace experienced in August in the midst of the 

financial market tumult.  After surging in August, liquid deposits contracted in 

September and seem to be growing only modestly in October.  Retail money market 

funds expanded rapidly again last month, and available data for October point to 

continued strong growth.  Small time deposits grew briskly in both months, 

apparently owing in part to relatively attractive rates offered by some institutions on 

such deposits.

Recent Developments in Commercial Banking 
 
Commercial bank credit has grown at a 13 percent annual rate since the end of July.  
Most of the advance has been accounted for by a surge in C&I loans (left hand chart) 
and loans to nonbank financial institutions extended by large domestic commercial 
banks and U.S. branches and agencies of foreign banks.  The increase in these banks’ 
C&I loans has been caused partly by the retention of underwritten LBO-related loans 
that these institutions have not been able to syndicate.  The jump in loans to financial 
institutions occurred in August and early September and was consistent with reports 
that some banks provided short-term financing to commercial paper conduits and to 
other nonbank financial institutions.  In addition, steady expansion of C&I loans at 
smaller banks suggests appreciable underlying growth in the demand for bank-
intermediated business credit that is unrelated to the dislocations in financial markets. 
 
Banks have funded the expansion of their balance sheets largely with managed 
liabilities, such large time deposits and nondeposit sources, which include Federal 
Home Loan Bank advances.  Perhaps in an effort to conserve balance sheet capacity, 
large banks shed U.S. housing finance agencies’ mortgage pass-through securities. The 
October Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey indicated that, on net, banks have 
tightened standards and terms for most categories of loans to businesses and 
households over the past three months, probably reflecting in part a desire to manage 
their balance sheet capacity as well as their credit risk. 
 
Profits declined at many large banking companies last quarter, and results often came 
in below analysts’ estimates.  Many of the firms attributed their disappointing earnings 
largely to deteriorating credit quality, particularly in the home mortgage sector, while 
several of the largest firms also reported significant write-downs on leveraged 
syndicated loans and structured financial products.  Partly as a result, CDS spreads for 
large banking organizations remained elevated over the intermeeting period (right 
hand chart).

Medium-Term Strategies 

(12) To shed additional light on the economic outlook and possible monetary 

policy strategies over the medium term, the staff has extended the Greenbook 

forecast beyond 2009 using the FRB/US model with adjustments to ensure 

consistency with the staff’s assessment of longer-run trends.3  This extended forecast 

embeds several key assumptions for the period beyond 2009:  Trend multifactor 

productivity grows 1 percent per year; energy prices are approximately flat in real 

terms; the real value of the dollar depreciates 1¼ percent per year; and the unified 

federal budget deficit edges up to 2½ percent of GDP by 2012.  In the extension, the 

unemployment rate beyond 2009 stays close to the staff’s assumed long-run NAIRU 

of 4¾ percent while core PCE inflation remains fairly stable at about 2 percent—a 

rate roughly consistent with recent survey measures of long-run inflation expectations.  

The real funds rate path consistent with these outcomes declines from slightly above 

2¾ percent in 2009 to about 2¼ percent on average in 2011 and 2012. 

(13) As shown in Chart 5, the Greenbook-consistent measure of short-run r*—

the value that would close the output gap over the next twelve quarters—has shifted 

up 10 basis points and now stands at 2.9 percent, about the same as the actual real 

federal funds rate.  The three model-based estimates of short-run r* range from  

1.6 to 2.6 percent; on average, these estimates are a bit lower than in the previous 

Bluebook.4  The model-based and TIPS-based estimates of medium-run r* range from 

1.9 to 2.4 percent and are little changed from the previous Bluebook. 

(14) Chart 6 depicts optimal control simulations of the FRB/US model using  

the staff’s extension of the Greenbook forecast beyond 2009.  In these simulations,

by Michael McCracken, “The Extended Greenbook Forecast,” October 25, 2007. 
4 In contrast with past practice, starting with this Bluebook all model-based estimates of r* 
take as given the staff’s estimates of real activity and other economic variables in the current 
quarter.

policymakers place equal weights on keeping core PCE inflation close to a specified 

goal, on keeping unemployment close to the long-run NAIRU, and on avoiding 

changes in the nominal federal funds rate.5  For an inflation goal of 1½ percent (the 

left-hand set of charts), the optimal control simulation prescribes a nominal federal 

funds rate path that rises slightly from about 5¼ percent in the third quarter to 

roughly 5½ percent by the end of 2008 and then declines gradually to a little under  

4 percent by the end of 2012.  With an inflation goal of 2 percent (the right-hand set 

of charts), the optimal funds rate gradually falls to a bit under 4½ percent by the end 

of 2012.  The prescription for the trajectory of the funds rate with a 1½ percent 

inflation goal is a little higher than that shown in the September Bluebook, reflecting 

the somewhat stronger assessment by the staff of the outlook for aggregate demand.  

Under either inflation goal, the paths of the unemployment rate and the inflation rate 

over the next few years are a bit lower than those shown in the previous Bluebook, 

consistent with the revisions to the Greenbook forecast. 

(15) As shown in Chart 7, the outcome-based monetary policy rule (the left 

panel) prescribes a funds rate path that declines to around 4½ percent by the middle 

of next year and then rises to about 5 percent near the end of the decade before 

falling back.  This path is about ¼ percentage point on average higher than in the 

September Bluebook, reflecting the upward revision to the projection for real growth, 

and is somewhat above the funds rate path anticipated by financial market participants 

(the right panel).  Stochastic simulations of the FRB/US model indicate a 70 percent 

probability that the prescriptions of the outcome-based rule will fall in a range of  

                                           
5  In conducting these simulations, policymakers and participants in financial markets are 
assumed to understand fully the forces shaping the economic outlook (as summarized by  
the extended Greenbook projection), whereas households and firms form their expectations 
using more limited information.  In this Bluebook, the current quarter is the first period of 
the simulation for which a value for the nominal funds rate different from that embedded in 
the extended Greenbook projection is permitted.

3½ to 5¾ percent at the end of next year.6  Interest rate caps suggest a broadly similar 

degree of uncertainty in financial markets regarding the prospective path of policy 

over the next several years, with a 70 percent confidence interval of about 2½ to 4¾ 

percent at the end of 2008. 

(16) For an inflation goal of either 1½ percent or 2 percent, the near-term 

prescriptions of simple policy rules generally point to additional policy easing, 

although the Taylor (1999) rule with a higher r* and the first difference rule with an 

inflation goal of 1½ percent both suggest a slightly tighter policy stance.  The 

prescriptions of the Taylor (1993) rule are virtually unchanged from those of the 

previous Bluebook, reflecting the offsetting influences of a slightly higher output gap 

and slightly lower core inflation.  Because the Taylor (1999) rule responds more 

aggressively to output gaps, the prescriptions from this rule—and the variant with  

a higher intercept—have been revised up more noticeably, about 15 basis points.   

The first-difference rule responds to three-quarter-ahead projections of four-quarter 

core inflation and GDP growth relative to potential; the prescriptions from this  

rule are little changed for an inflation goal of 1½ percent and are up a notch for  

an inflation goal of 2 percent. 

                                           
6 The width of these confidence intervals is determined by the past two decades of estimated 
model residuals.

Economic Outlook through 2009 

(17) Reflecting incoming economic data that were, on balance, stronger than 

expected, as well as higher stock prices, lower corporate bond rates, and a weaker 

foreign exchange value of the dollar, the staff outlook for growth in aggregate demand 

has been marked up a bit over the near term but is little changed farther ahead.  The 

staff has retained its assumption that the target federal funds rate will be held constant 

at 4¾ percent during 2008 and 2009.  As investors instead anticipate some policy 

easing at this and subsequent meetings, longer-term Treasury yields are expected to 

firm going forward.  As usual, stock prices are assumed to rise at the 6½ percent 

annual rate required to equate the risk-adjusted return on equities to that on Treasury 

securities.  The real foreign exchange value of the dollar is projected to depreciate 

about 1¼ percent per year.  Consistent with futures market quotes, spot oil prices are 

projected to decline gradually but from a substantially higher level than in the 

September forecast.  Against this backdrop, the pace of economic expansion is 

projected to slow from 3¼ percent in the third quarter to about 1½ percent in the 

current quarter and the first quarter of 2008, as the housing correction deepens and 

the recent strength in consumer and business spending moderates.  Beyond the first 

quarter of 2008, the staff’s forecast is little changed from the September Greenbook:  

Output is projected to expand somewhat more slowly than potential over the 

remainder of 2008, and at about the same rate as potential in 2009, when residential 

investment is anticipated to begin growing modestly.  The unemployment rate 

remains essentially equal to the staff’s 4¾ percent estimate of the NAIRU through the 

end of the forecast period.  Spurred by the recent surge in oil prices, total PCE 

inflation climbs to nearly 2¾ percent in the fourth quarter; it then drops to 2¼ 

percent in the first quarter of next year and to about 1¾ percent for the rest of the 

forecast period as oil prices trend down.  Core PCE inflation rises from 1½ percent 

Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) 20 of 44



over the past two quarters to 2 percent in the current quarter and subsequently 

remains just under that rate through 2009. 

Short-Run Policy Alternatives 

(18) This Bluebook presents three policy alternatives for the Committee’s 

consideration, summarized in Table 1.  Alternative A lowers the target federal funds 

rate 25 basis points to 4½ percent, while Alternatives B and C leave the target rate 

unchanged at 4¾ percent.  In the rationale paragraph, all three alternatives recognize 

that economic growth was solid in the third quarter.  (The advance report for third-

quarter GDP growth will be published on October 31, the second day of the FOMC 

meeting.  The staff and most private sector forecasters expect that output grew 

significantly faster than potential last quarter.  If third-quarter growth turns out to be 

considerably above or below expectations, “strong” or “moderate” perhaps could be 

substituted for “solid.”)  All three alternatives also acknowledge that strains in 

financial markets have eased somewhat on balance and suggest that the Committee 

expects some slowing of the pace of economic expansion in the near term.  

Alternative A alludes to the possibility that the tightening of credit conditions since 

earlier this year could restrain economic growth, and Alternative B makes that point 

more directly.  Because recent inflation readings have continued to be relatively 

benign but have not shown signs of further moderation, Alternatives A and B 

maintain the language regarding inflation used in the September statement.  In 

contrast, Alternative C states that the high level of resource utilization and recent 

increases in energy prices may put renewed upward pressures on both overall and 

core inflation.  While considerable uncertainty about the economic outlook remains, 

the three alternatives assume that the Committee is prepared to resume the practice of 

assessing the balance of risks to growth and inflation.  Alternatives A and C 

characterize the downside risks to growth as roughly balancing the upside risks to

2. Economic growth was moderate 
during the first half of the year, 
but the tightening of credit 
conditions has the potential to 
intensify the housing correction 
and to restrain economic growth 
more generally.  Today’s action is 
intended to help forestall some of 
the adverse effects on the broader 
economy that might otherwise 
arise from the disruptions in 
financial markets and to promote 
moderate growth over time. 

Economic growth was solid in the 
third quarter, and strains in financial 
markets have eased somewhat on 
balance.  However, the pace of 
economic expansion will likely slow 
somewhat in the near term, partly 
reflecting the intensification of the 
housing correction.  Today’s action, 
combined with the policy action taken 
in September, should help forestall 
some of the adverse effects on the 
broader economy that might otherwise 
arise from the disruptions in financial 
markets and promote moderate 
growth over time. 

Economic growth was solid in the 
third quarter, and strains in financial 
markets have eased somewhat on 
balance.  The pace of economic 
expansion will likely slow somewhat in 
the near term, partly reflecting the 
intensification of the housing 
correction.  But, to date, other sectors 
of the economy have proven resilient 
and the global economy remains 
strong.  The Committee anticipates 
that the economic expansion will 
return to a moderate pace over time, 
but sees continuing risks to growth, 
notably the potential impact of the 
tightening of credit conditions for 
some households and businesses.   

Economic growth was solid in the 
third quarter despite an intensification 
of the housing correction.  Strains in 
financial markets have eased 
somewhat on balance, reducing the 
downside risks to growth.  Though 
incoming indicators point to some 
near-term slowing in the pace of 
economic expansion, the recent easing 
of monetary policy should help 
promote moderate growth over time. 

Rationale 

3. Readings on core inflation have 
improved modestly this year.  
However, the Committee judges 
that some inflation risks remain, 
and it will continue to monitor 
inflation developments carefully.

Assessment 
of Risk 

4. Developments in financial markets 
since the Committee’s last regular 
meeting have increased the 
uncertainty surrounding the 
economic outlook.  The 
Committee will continue to assess 
the effects of these and other 
developments on economic 
prospects and will act as needed to 
foster price stability and 
sustainable economic growth. 

The Committee judges that the upside 
risks to inflation roughly balance the 
downside risks to growth.  The 
Committee will continue to assess the 
effects of financial and other 
developments on economic prospects 
and will act as needed to foster price 
stability and sustainable economic 
growth. 

On balance, the Committee views 
downside risks to growth as the 
greater policy concern.   The 
Committee will continue to assess the 
effects of financial and other 
developments on economic prospects 
and will act as needed to foster price 
stability and sustainable economic 
growth. 
 

The Committee judges that the upside 
risks to inflation roughly balance the 
downside risks to growth.  Future 
policy adjustments will depend on the 
outlook for both inflation and 
economic growth, as implied by 
incoming information. 

 

Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) 22 of 44



inflation, while Alternative B identifies the downside risks to growth as the greatest 

policy concern.  As usual, the Committee could combine language from different 

alternatives. 

(19) If the Committee judges that the current stance of policy is likely to be 

consistent with sustainable growth and an acceptable trajectory for inflation over time 

but sees appreciable downside risks to growth, it may wish to choose Alternative B.  

The economy seems to have expanded at a brisk pace in the third quarter, boosted 

primarily by personal consumption and business expenditures, suggesting 

considerable underlying strength of spending prior to the recent financial turbulence.  

In addition, strains in financial markets have eased somewhat on balance, partly 

allaying concerns about a severe credit crunch.  The strong performance of the global 

economy could also support U.S. economic growth.  And while the housing data 

received during the intermeeting period were not encouraging, they also were not 

greatly surprising, at least from the perspective of the September Greenbook forecast.  

The real federal funds rate is now equal to its Greenbook-consistent equilibrium value 

and just a bit above the range of model-based estimates (Chart 5), suggesting that the 

current policy stance is likely to keep output in the vicinity of its potential.  In 

addition, the present target for the federal funds rate remains close to near-term policy 

prescriptions derived from optimal policy simulations with a 2 percent inflation target 

(Chart 6) and is consistent with a number of policy rules, even assuming a 1½ percent 

inflation objective (Chart 7).  However, the functioning of some financial markets is 

still quite far from normal, credit conditions have tightened considerably for some 

households and businesses since early in the year, and there is some possibility that 

recent improvements in market functioning could be reversed.  The Committee may 

be sufficiently concerned about a possible further deterioration in financial conditions 

or about potential spillovers from the housing sector to believe that the risks to its 

growth outlook are significantly skewed to the downside.  Moreover, it may see the 

Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) 23 of 44



possibility that a weakening of the economy could have a negative impact on financial 

markets, leading to further tightening of credit conditions.  At the same time, the 

Committee may believe that the inflation outlook is acceptable, although with some 

upside risks.  Inflation data have been fairly benign in recent months, suggesting that 

the underlying rate of inflation is relatively moderate, and the Committee may be 

optimistic that recognition of its commitment to price stability will help gradually 

reduce inflation over time.  But the high level of resource utilization, the recent 

increases in energy and other commodity prices, and the decline in the foreign 

exchange value of the dollar may be viewed as presenting upside risks to inflation.  

Nonetheless, the Committee may believe that the downside risks to growth are the 

greater policy concern.  

(20) Given that the economy likely expanded at a pace noticeably above that of 

potential in the third quarter, the draft statement for Alternative B describes recent 

growth as “solid.”  It also takes note of the fact that strains in financial markets have 

eased somewhat on balance.  While recognizing that the ongoing housing 

deterioration will likely weigh substantially on economic performance over the next 

few quarters, the statement points out that other sectors of the economy have proven 

resilient so far and that the global economy remains strong.  The assessment of risk 

paragraph would note that downside risks to growth are a greater policy concern to 

the Committee than inflation risks and then repeats the second sentence of the risk 

assessment from the September statement. 

(21) Market participants have priced in more than 25 basis points of easing at 

this meeting.  Thus, a decision to leave the federal funds rate unchanged is likely to 

produce a considerable backup in shorter-term interest rates.  However, with the 

statement pointing to downside risks to growth and thus suggesting that further policy 

easing could be forthcoming, short-term rates are not likely to move up by the full 

amount of the policy surprise.  The anticipation of future policy easing will likely 

Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) 24 of 44



restrain the increase in longer-term interest rates even more.  With relative yields 

probably adjusting in favor of dollar assets, the recent tendency for the foreign 

exchange value of the dollar to depreciate could be reduced.  Equity prices would 

likely decline, given the policy surprise and the assessment that risks to growth are 

tilted to the downside.   

(22) If the Committee has a modal outlook similar to the Greenbook projection 

that growth will return to potential in a few quarters and sees the risks around that 

forecast as relatively balanced, it might be inclined to choose Alternative C.  Under 

this alternative, there would be no change in the target federal funds rate, and the 

statement would indicate that downside risks to growth are balanced by upside risks 

to inflation.  Members might view the partial easing of the strains in financial markets 

since mid-summer as substantially reducing the likelihood that instability in the 

financial system will undermine economic performance, especially since there do not 

appear to have been significant spillovers to consumer and business spending as yet.  

Indeed, the Committee may see the improved financial market conditions and the 

outlook for growth near potential in 2008 and 2009 as close to the situation it 

envisioned after the September policy easing.  Even if the Committee believes that 

ongoing financial strains pose downside risks to growth, it may also believe that those 

risks are partly offset by other factors.  For example, Committee members might be 

more optimistic than the staff regarding the persistence of the recent robust growth in 

business fixed investment and household consumption, along the lines of the 

“Greater Momentum in Aggregate Demand” alternative scenario in the Greenbook.  

On the inflation side, the Committee may have become more worried about the 

potential for renewed price pressures.  While inflation readings have remained 

relatively benign, the Committee might view the increase in energy prices over the 

past few weeks as likely to push up overall inflation in the near term, with potential 

adverse effects on inflation expectations.  Indeed, the Committee may be concerned 

Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) 25 of 44



by the increase since earlier this year of around 25 basis points in forward inflation 

compensation implied by TIPS securities.  The weakening of the dollar may also be 

seen as posing a greater inflationary threat than foreseen by the staff.  Some members 

may also be worried that current levels of resource utilization are not sustainable and 

pose an upside risk to inflation.  Others may see particularly high costs to an increase 

in inflation from its recent readings and, partly for that reason, may have little 

expectation that a near-term easing of policy would be warranted.  Under these 

circumstances, the Committee might judge that the current stance of policy is 

appropriate and believe that the downside risks to growth are balanced by upside risks 

to inflation. 

(23) The proposed statement for Alternative C indicates that economic growth 

was solid in the third quarter despite the ongoing housing correction.  It then notes 

the easing in financial market strains and associates that development with a reduction 

in the downside risks to growth.  The statement proceeds to affirm the expectation 

that the pace of economic expansion will slow in the near term but also that the 

substantial easing of monetary policy in September should help promote moderate 

growth over time.  The statement makes no explicit mention of potential risks 

induced by tighter credit conditions.  The wording on inflation begins by noting the 

improvement in inflation readings this year, as in the September FOMC statement, 

but then cites the risk that the high level of resource utilization and recent increases in 

energy prices may put renewed upward pressures on overall and core inflation.  The 

Committee would indicate that the downside risks to growth are balanced by the 

upside risks to inflation and would reintroduce the indication that future policy 

adjustments will depend on the outlook for both inflation and economic growth.  

Market participants would be quite surprised by the combination of no policy action 

at this meeting and the statement proposed for Alternative C.  They would likely 

conclude that the Committee has no inclination to lower rates in the near term.  

Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) 26 of 44



Given that high odds are placed on policy easing at this and coming meetings, both 

short- and long-term interest rates would likely increase considerably following the 

announcement.  In response to the jump in interest rates, the foreign exchange value 

of the dollar might appreciate somewhat.  Although investors’ views about economic 

prospects might be buoyed to some extent by an inference that the Federal Reserve 

anticipated sustainable growth at the current level of the federal funds rate, it seems 

more likely that market participants would mark down their expectations for 

economic growth.  Consequently, concerns about credit risk could increase, and 

equity prices could decline significantly. 

(24) While strains in financial markets have eased in recent weeks, functioning in 

some markets remains impaired.  Moreover, banks appear to have responded to the 

problems in funding markets, concerns about balance sheet capacity, and worries 

about the economic outlook by tightening terms and standards across a broad range 

of credit products.   The Committee might see these developments as reducing its 

modal outlook for aggregate demand relative to its expectations after its September 

action.  Alternatively, members might see the failure of credit market conditions to 

improve more significantly and incoming evidence of a steepening contraction in the 

housing sector as indicating that the downside risks to overall economic performance 

remain unacceptably large; the potential implications of such factors are illustrated in 

the “Greater Fallout from Financial Stress” alternative scenario in the Greenbook.  

Either view might incline the Committee to choose Alternative A, which lowers the 

target federal funds rate 25 basis points.  The Committee might see easing policy 

another notch as an appropriate risk-management tactic, given the potential for 

particularly adverse outcomes, especially since a 25 basis point cut in the target federal 

funds rate would still be consistent with several policy rules (Chart 7).  Given that 

inflation data have continued to be favorable, the Committee may also believe that a 

policy easing would be consistent with its price stability objectives, especially if 

Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) 27 of 44



members believe that, if necessary, they could act quickly in the future to reverse 

some or all of the easing implemented since September. 

(25) The draft statement for Alternative A, like those for Alternatives B and C, 

begins by noting the solid economic performance in the third quarter and the easing 

of strains in financial markets.  As the other alternatives, it also recognizes that the 

pace of economic expansion will likely slow in the near term but, by prefacing that 

consideration with the word “however,” gives it more prominence.  The statement 

then asserts that the cut in the target rate, combined with the policy easing at the 

September meeting, should help forestall some of the adverse effects on the broader 

economy that might otherwise arise from the disruptions in financial markets, 

replicating the words in the September statement.  The paragraph regarding inflation 

is unchanged from September, as in Alternative B.  If the Committee believes that, 

after this move, the risks to growth would still be tilted somewhat to the downside 

while some upside inflation risks would remain, it could characterize the risks as 

balanced and continue by stating its intent to assess the effects of financial and other 

developments on economic prospects as in Alternative B. 

(26) Investors currently see a 25 basis point policy easing at this meeting as the 

most likely outcome.  Thus, very short-term interest rates would likely change little in 

response to an announcement along the lines of that proposed under Alternative A.  

However, because market participants expect more than 25 basis points of easing over 

the next few quarters, the balanced risk assessment, which would likely be seen as 

suggesting that further policy easing may not be forthcoming, could prompt a modest 

increase in intermediate- and longer-term interest rates.  If participants interpreted the 

statement as suggesting reasonably good odds of sustainable growth given the easier 

stance of policy, the equity market might rally modestly and the foreign exchange 

value of the dollar could firm a bit.

Money and Debt Forecasts 

(27) Under the Greenbook projection, M2 is forecast to grow at about a 5½ 

percent rate on average in the current quarter and the first quarter of 2008—about 1 

percentage point higher than in the previous forecast, which assumed a more gradual 

policy easing than the Committee implemented at the September meeting.  After the 

first quarter of next year, M2 growth is projected to slow to just under a 4½ percent 

pace for the remainder of the projection period, about in line with the rate forecast in 

the September Bluebook. 

(28) After having expanded at an annual rate of 7½ percent in the first half of 

the year, domestic nonfinancial debt is expected to increase at about a 6½ percent 

pace in the second half of 2007 and a 4¾ percent rate in 2008 and 2009.  The 

deceleration in total nonfinancial sector debt reflects a projected slowdown in 

borrowing across all major sectors except the federal government.  With house prices 

expected to decline, home sales seen as falling further before posting a modest 

recovery in 2009, and tighter standards and terms on mortgage loans projected to 

persist for at least some borrowers, the staff expects household debt growth to slow 

to 4¾ percent at an annual rate in the second half of this year and to 3½ percent in 

2008 and 2009, which would be the slowest annual rate of growth in real terms since 

1991.  Nonfinancial business debt, which expanded robustly in the third quarter, is 

projected to decelerate somewhat over the forecast period, as the demand for funds 

to finance LBOs and share repurchases abates.

Directive  

Draft language for the directive is provided below.7 

The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and financial 

conditions that will foster price stability and promote sustainable growth 

in output.  To further its long-run objectives, the Committee in the 

immediate future seeks conditions in reserve markets consistent with 

MAINTAINING/INCREASING/reducing the federal funds rate 

AT/to an average of around ________ 4¾ percent. 

 

                                           
7 The Committee plans to vote on the entire statement beginning with the October meeting.  
Draft statements associated with the various alternatives are presented in Table 1.

Appendix A: Measures of the Equilibrium Real Rate 
 

The equilibrium real rate is the real federal funds rate that, if maintained, would be projected to return 
output to its potential level over time.  The short-run equilibrium rate is defined as the rate that would 
close the output gap in twelve quarters given the corresponding model’s projection of the economy.   
The medium-run concept is the value of the real federal funds rate projected to keep output at potential 
in seven years, under the assumption that monetary policy acts to bring actual and potential output into 
line in the short run and then keeps them equal thereafter.  The TIPS-based factor model measure 
provides an estimate of market expectations for the real federal funds rate seven years ahead.  
 
The actual real federal funds rate is constructed as the difference between the nominal rate and realized 
inflation, where the nominal rate is measured as the quarterly average of the observed federal funds rate, 
and realized inflation is given by the log difference between the core PCE price index and its lagged 
value four quarters earlier.  For the current quarter, the nominal rate is specified as the target federal 
funds rate on the Bluebook publication date.  For the current quarter and the previous quarter, the 
inflation rate is computed using the staff’s estimate of the core PCE price index. 
 
Confidence intervals reflect uncertainties about model specification, coefficients, and the level of 
potential output.  The final column of the table indicates the values published in the previous Bluebook. 
  

Measure Description 

Single-equation 
Model  

The measure of the equilibrium real rate in the single-equation model is based on an 
estimated aggregate-demand relationship between the current value of the output gap and 
its lagged values as well as the lagged values of the real federal funds rate. 

Small Structural 
Model 

The small-scale model of the economy consists of equations for five variables: the output 
gap, the equity premium, the federal budget surplus, the trend growth rate of output, and 
the real bond yield. 

Large Model 
(FRB/US) 

Estimates of the equilibrium real rate using FRB/US—the staff’s large-scale econometric 
model of the U.S. economy—depend on a very broad array of economic factors, some of 
which take the form of projected values of the model’s exogenous variables. 

Greenbook-
consistent  

The FRB/US model is used in conjunction with an extended version of the Greenbook 
forecast to derive a Greenbook-consistent measure.  FRB/US is first add-factored so that 
its simulation matches the extended Greenbook forecast, and then a second simulation is 
run off this baseline to determine the value of the real federal funds rate that closes the 
output gap. 

TIPS-based 
Factor Model 

Yields on TIPS (Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities) reflect investors’ expectations of 
the future path of real interest rates, but also include term and liquidity premiums.  The 
TIPS-based measure of the equilibrium real rate is constructed using the seven-year-ahead 
instantaneous real forward rate derived from TIPS yields as of the Bluebook publication 
date.  This forward rate is adjusted to remove estimates of the term and liquidity 
premiums based on a three-factor arbitrage-free term-structure model applied to TIPS 
yields, nominal yields, and inflation.  Because TIPS indexation is based on the total CPI, 
this measure is also adjusted for the medium-term difference—projected at 40 basis 
points—between total CPI inflation and core PCE inflation.

Appendix B: Analysis of Policy Paths and Confidence Intervals 
 

Rule Specifications:  For the following rules, it denotes the federal funds rate for quarter t, while  
the explanatory variables include the staff’s projection of trailing four-quarter core PCE inflation (πt), 
inflation two and three quarters ahead (πt+2|t and πt+3|t), the output gap in the current period and one 
quarter ahead ( *t ty y−  and *1| 1|t t t ty y+ +− ), and the three-quarter-ahead forecast of annual average GDP 
growth relative to potential ( 4 4 *3| 3|t t t ty y+ +Δ − Δ ), and *π  denotes an assumed value of policymakers’ 
long-run inflation objective.  The outcome-based and forecast-based rules were estimated using real-
time data over the sample 1988:1-2006:4; each specification was chosen using the Bayesian information 
criterion. Each rule incorporates a 75 basis point shift in the intercept, specified as a sequence of  
25 basis point increments during the first three quarters of 1998.  The first two simple rules were 
proposed by Taylor (1993, 1999), while the third is a variant of the Taylor (1999) rule—introduced  
in the August Bluebook—with a higher value of r*.  The prescriptions of the first-difference rule do  
not depend on assumptions regarding r* or the level of the output gap; see Orphanides (2003). 
 

Outcome-based rule it =  1.20it-1–0.39it-2+0.19[1.17  + 1.73 πt  + 3.66( *t ty y− )  – 2.72( *1 1t ty y− −− )]

Forecast-based rule it =  1.18it-1–0.38it-2+0.20[0.98 +1.72 πt+2|t+2.29( *1| 1|t t t ty y+ +− )–1.37( *1 1t ty y− −− )]

Taylor (1993) rule it = 2 + πt + 0.5(πt – *π ) + 0.5( *t ty y− ) 

Taylor (1999) rule it = 2 + πt + 0.5(πt – *π ) + ( *t ty y− ) 

Taylor (1999) rule     
with higher r* 

it = 2.75 + πt + 0.5(πt – *π ) + ( *t ty y− )  

First-difference rule it = it-1 + 0.5(πt+3|t – *π ) + 0.5( 4 4 *3| 3|t t t ty y+ +Δ − Δ ) 
 
FRB/US Model Simulations:  Prescriptions from the two empirical rules are computed using dynamic 
simulations of the FRB/US model, implemented as though the rule were followed starting at this FOMC 
meeting.  The dotted line labeled “Previous Bluebook” is based on the current specification of the policy 
rule, applied to the previous Greenbook projection.  Confidence intervals are based on stochastic 
simulations of the FRB/US model with shocks drawn from the estimated residuals over 1986-2005.  
Information from Financial Markets:  The expected funds rate path is based on forward rate 
agreements, and the confidence intervals for this path are constructed using prices of interest rate caps. 
Near-Term Prescriptions of Simple Policy Rules:  These prescriptions are calculated using Greenbook 
projections for inflation and the output gap. Because the first-difference rule involves the lagged funds 
rate, the value labeled “Previous Bluebook” for the current quarter is computed using the actual value  
of the lagged funds rate, and the one-quarter-ahead prescriptions are based on this rule’s prescription for 
the current quarter.

Inflation Indicator Based on M2

Note: P* is defined to equal M2 times V* divided by potential GDP. V*, or long-run velocity, is estimated
using average velocity over the 1959:Q1-to-1989:Q4 period and then, after a break, over the interval from
1993:Q1 to the present. For the forecast period, P* is based on the staff M2 forecast and P is simulated using a
short-run dynamic model relating P to P*. Blue areas indicate periods in which P* is notably less than P.
Gray areas denote the projection period.
