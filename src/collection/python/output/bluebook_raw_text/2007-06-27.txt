MONETARY POLICY ALTERNATIVES 

Recent Developments 

(1) The anticipated path of the federal funds rate embedded in financial market 

prices rotated up sharply over the intermeeting period (Chart 1).  Only a small portion 

of this change, however, was posted on the heels of the May 9th FOMC meeting.  The 

decision to leave the federal funds rate target unchanged at 5¼ percent accorded with 

market expectations, but some market participants were reportedly surprised by the 

retention of the assessment that inflation was “somewhat elevated.”1  There was little 

market response to the publication of the minutes of the meeting.  Over the 

intermeeting period, however, investors seemed to reappraise their beliefs that the 

economic expansion would slow and that monetary policy easing would be 

forthcoming, based in part on monetary policy communications and the release of 

some more-favorable-than-expected economic data in the United States and abroad.   

(2) Futures quotes indicate that market participants now expect the FOMC to 

leave the target federal funds rate unchanged through the end of this year and see only 

about 25 basis points of easing by the end of 2008, about 60 basis points less than at 

the time of the May FOMC meeting.  As indicated in the Desk’s recent survey, 

primary dealers also envision policy being on hold for some time, with a number of 

firms abandoning their forecasts for rate cuts this year.  These revisions were 

associated with a marked decline in the weight attached to lower interest rates in the 

option-implied distributions of future federal funds rates, and measures of uncertainty 

about the near-term path of policy narrowed to historical lows. 

                                           
1 The effective federal funds rate averaged 5.25 percent over the intermeeting period.  
During the period, System holdings of Treasury securities were unchanged.  The volume of 
outstanding long-term RPs decreased by $1 billion, to $11 billion.

(3) Yields on nominal Treasury securities rose sharply over the intermeeting 

period, with two-year rates increasing 30 basis points and ten-year rates gaining about 

55 basis points.  This upward shift in the term structure reflected increases in one-year 

forward rates across the yield curve, with the most pronounced gains posted in 

forward rates three to five years ahead.  Real rates accounted for the bulk of the 

increase.  TIPS-based inflation compensation for the next five years edged lower on 

net, but five-to-ten-year-ahead inflation compensation rose about 20 basis points.  

Survey measures of inflation expectations posted mixed changes.  According to staff 

models, the pickup in real yields at distant horizons owed primarily to increases in real 

term premiums, while about half of the increase in inflation compensation at the long 

end of the curve reflected increases in inflation expectations.  (See box entitled “More 

on Recent Interest Rate Developments.”) 

(4) Equity markets were volatile at times during the intermeeting period, but 

broad stock price indexes gained about 1 percent, on net, as the boost from largely 

favorable news on the economy and announcements of mergers and acquisitions 

outweighed the drag of higher bond yields (Chart 2).  The implied volatility of the 

S&P 500 edged up on net, but remained low by historical standards.  Yields on 

investment-grade corporate bonds increased about in line with those on nominal 

Treasury securities of comparable maturity.  In contrast, yields on speculative-grade 

corporate bonds rose less, leaving risk spreads about 20 basis points narrower.  

Corporate credit quality remained solid, with realized and expected default rates 

staying very low. 

(5) Despite the substantial declines in bond prices posted over the intermeeting 

period, fixed-income markets generally functioned smoothly, with elevated Treasury 

trading volumes and normal bid-asked spreads.  However, credit conditions in 

markets for assets backed by subprime mortgages deteriorated notably in some cases.  

For example, spreads on indexes of subprime credit default swaps rose steadily, and

More on Recent Interest Rate Developments
 
The increase in shorter-term Treasury yields over the 
intermeeting period appeared to reflect a revised outlook for 
monetary policy.  About half of the 30 basis point move in two-
year yields occurred in the narrow windows bracketing FOMC 
communications and economic data releases.  Apparently in 
response to incoming news, as well as a more general change in 
sentiment, most of the remaining primary dealers who had been 
predicting policy easing this year threw in the towel and now 
forecast policy to be on hold for some time.  Short-term yields 
around the globe also increased, as data pointed to somewhat 
stronger growth and higher inflation in a number of countries, 
and some foreign central banks either tightened policy or 
signaled increased concern about inflationary pressures. 
 
The shift in the economic outlook was likely the prime mover of 
longer-term rates as well, but mortgage convexity hedging flows 
reportedly amplified these upward movements in rates.  Swap 
spreads widened and swaption-implied volatility rose, as 
investors sought to trim longer-dated exposures when the 
effective duration of their mortgage holdings lengthened.  
However, the rise in swap rates was considerably smaller than 
during past episodes when convexity hedging likely played a 
significant role.  Moreover, the staff estimates that only a small 
amount of mortgages was economically refinanceable even 
before the rise in mortgage rates.   
 
Over this intermeeting period, changes in option-based 
measures of interest rate uncertainty have been mixed, as 
implied volatilities on short-term rates declined and those on 
longer-term rates rose.  However, the reduced skew of the 
implied distributions of expected funds rates in the near term 
may go some way in helping to explain movements in term 
premiums.  Market participants now evidently see the risks to 
the outlook for short-term interest rates as more symmetric, as 
opposed to tilted sharply to the downside, and borrowers may 
be willing to pay a higher term premium to avoid the risk of 
having to roll over debt at higher short-term rates in the future.

some of the indexes reached new highs.  Reflecting the weakness in these markets, 

and perhaps reinforcing them as well, were the well-publicized difficulties at two 

medium-sized hedge funds managed by Bear Stearns Asset Management.  The funds 

were positioned to gain from an improvement in subprime credit quality, and when 

the market worsened instead, the resulting losses led to massive liquidity pressures on 

at least one of the two funds.  Following unsuccessful negotiations to reach a 

workout, some counterparties moved to take collateral and close out positions.  

Actual and anticipated sales of fund assets raised concerns that the resulting 

downward pressure on prices could lead to significant losses among market 

participants.  These concerns were exacerbated by the high degree of uncertainty 

about the valuation of subprime assets, particularly CDOs.  Spillover effects of the 

funds’ difficulties have apparently been modest thus far, although spreads on some 

lower-quality corporate credit derivative indexes also widened this week.  Market 

participants report no other sizable hedge funds with similar problems.  Credit 

exposures to the two funds are widely dispersed, and CDS spreads for the creditor 

firms have generally moved up only a few basis points.  Bear Stearns’s CDS spread 

has risen more, but it remains near the peak it reached during the period of volatility 

in late February and early March.   

(6) The foreign exchange value of the dollar was little changed on balance over 

the intermeeting period against a trade-weighted index of major foreign currencies 

(Chart 3).  The dollar fell 3 percent against the Canadian dollar, but rose 3 percent 

against the Japanese yen and by smaller amounts against most other major currencies.  

Day-to-day movements in foreign government bond yields were highly correlated 

with fluctuations in U.S. longer-term rates, with yields abroad increasing 25 to 50 basis 

points, on net, somewhat less than in the United States.  As in the United States, most 

of the increases in foreign nominal yields reflected changes in real yields, which were 

boosted by stronger-than-expected indicators of economic growth and prospects for

tighter monetary policy.  Major foreign stock markets posted modest gains.  As was 

widely expected, the Bank of England and the European Central Bank raised their 

policy rates 25 basis points.  In contrast, the Bank of Canada and the Bank of Japan 

left their policy rates unchanged during the intermeeting period.  However, strong 

data releases and a hawkish policy statement by the Bank of Canada appeared to buoy 

the Canadian dollar and fuel the relatively large advance in Canadian bond yields 

relative to those in other foreign industrial countries.2  

(7) The value of the dollar was down slightly over the intermeeting period 

against an index of currencies of our other important trading partners, led by a 

5 percent decline against the Brazilian real and a 1 percent fall against the Chinese 

renminbi.  Local-currency bond yields rose 30 to 60 basis points in emerging Asia and 

Eastern Europe.  Spreads on dollar-denominated issues in emerging markets, much 

like those in U.S. speculative-grade markets, declined slightly.  Stock prices in most 

emerging-market countries recorded solid gains over the period, including in China 

despite a sharp drop at the end of May related to the increase of a tax on equity 

transactions.  

(8) The debt of domestic nonfinancial sectors appears to be expanding at a 

6½ percent annual rate in the second quarter, off a little from the 7¼ percent pace 

registered in the first quarter (Chart 4).  The slowdown is primarily attributable to a 

decline in debt growth for the federal government, which has resulted from more-

than-seasonally strong tax receipts.  Business debt is estimated to be rising at a robust 

10 percent rate, boosted by financing of a large volume of mergers and acquisitions.  

Both bond issuance and growth in business loans have been brisk.  Bank lending 

standards and terms remain quite accommodative, with information from the

syndicated loan market indicating narrow spreads, high leverage, and an erosion in 

loan covenants.  With house prices continuing to be soft, home sales sluggish, and 

mortgage rates moving higher, growth of home mortgage debt is estimated to be 

slowing slightly to a 6 percent annual rate in the second quarter, while the overall 

expansion of consumer credit appears modest at a 4¼ percent rate.   

(9) Smoothing through tax-related fluctuations, M2 grew at a 6 percent average 

annual rate in April and May, following surprisingly strong expansion in the first 

quarter.  The moderation was broad-based and led by a decline in liquid deposit 

growth to a pace more in line with that of nominal income.  Retail money market 

mutual funds and small time deposits also decelerated.  Currency growth continued to 

be modest, likely reflecting weak foreign demand.  

Economic Outlook through 2008 

(10) In response to incoming data over the intermeeting period, the staff marked 

up its assessment of the pace of growth in the second quarter but changed the broad 

contours of the forecast thereafter relatively little from those in the May Greenbook.  

Smoothing through volatile quarterly readings, real GDP is now seen as expanding at 

around a 2 percent annualized rate in the first half of this year; the pace of real GDP 

growth is forecast to pick up to 2¼ percent in the remainder of 2007 and 2½ percent 

in 2008.  As a consequence, the labor market is expected to be slightly tighter than in 

the previous Greenbook, with the unemployment rate predicted to rise slowly, but to 

remain below 5 percent―the staff’s estimate of the NAIRU―throughout the forecast 

period.  The staff forecast continues to be predicated on the assumption that the 

federal funds rate will be held at 5¼ percent until the end of 2008.  Following the 

substantial upward shift in investors’ policy expectations over the intermeeting period, 

this trajectory is now very similar to that implied by money market futures quotes.  

Consequently, with little expected change in term premiums, longer-term interest rates 

Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) Page 10 of 42



are projected to remain near their current higher levels.  Equity prices are expected to 

rise at a rate sufficient to generate risk-adjusted returns comparable to those on fixed-

income investments.  The foreign exchange value of the dollar is assumed to 

depreciate 2 percent per year―a somewhat faster pace than in the May forecast.  Spot 

oil prices are still expected to move somewhat higher, as informed by futures market 

quotes.  Recent favorable inflation readings led the staff to lower the core inflation 

forecast slightly.  The staff now expects core PCE inflation to average 2 percent both 

this year and next.  Total PCE inflation is projected to be nearly 3 percent this year, 

boosted by higher energy and other commodity prices, before falling back to 

2 percent in 2008.   

(11) In the survey of economic projections taken for the May meeting, the 

central tendency of FOMC participants’ forecasts for real GDP growth was 2 to 

2.5 percent in 2007 and 2.5 to 2.8 percent in 2008.  The central tendency of the 

forecasts for core PCE inflation was 2.1 to 2.3 percent this year and 1.8 to 2.1 percent 

next year.  The May Greenbook projection was at the bottom of the central tendency 

of FOMC participants’ forecasts for growth and the top of the central tendency of 

their forecasts for inflation. 

Medium-Term Strategies 

(12) To provide a longer-term perspective on the economic outlook and possible 

monetary policy strategies, optimal control simulations of the FRB/US model were 

conducted using the staff’s extension of the Greenbook forecast beyond 2008.3  

These simulations employ a new benchmark specification of the model equation that 

determines the evolution of the long-run inflation expectations of wage and price 

setters, which are now assumed to respond not only to movements in actual 

                                           
3 More information on the extended outlook is provided in the memo to the Committee  
by Thomas Laubach, “Extended Greenbook Forecast,” June 20, 2007. 

Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) Page 11 of 42



inflation—as in previous Bluebooks—but also to shifts in the nominal federal funds 

rate and the output gap.4  Because long-run inflation expectations in the previous 

specification responded quite slowly to changes in actual inflation, disinflation came  

at a relatively high cost in terms of cumulative labor market slack.  In contrast,  

the new specification implies that a shift in monetary policy directly affects the 

public’s perception of the central bank’s inflation goal and hence their long-run 

inflation expectations.  As a result, the costs of a policy-induced disinflation in 

FRB/US are lower than presented in previous Bluebooks and are now in closer 

alignment with the staff’s judgmental assessment.5 

(13) Chart 5 shows optimal control simulations of the FRB/US model in which 

policymakers’ inflation goal is either 1½ percent or 2 percent.6  For an inflation goal 

of 2 percent (the right-hand set of charts), the optimal control simulation prescribes  

a federal funds rate path that remains close to 5¼ percent through early 2009 and 

then declines gradually to just above 4 percent by the end of 2012; from late 2008 

forward, the unemployment rate is near the 5 percent NAIRU, and core inflation  

is close to the 2 percent goal (solid lines).  This optimal policy outcome is similar to 

that shown in the May Bluebook (dotted lines); furthermore, the change to the 

                                           
4 For further details, see the memo to the Committee by Michael Kiley, “Changes to the 
evolution of long-run inflation expectations in the FRB/US model and their implications  
for FRB/US properties and optimal control simulations,” June 11, 2007. 
5 In spirit, the new specification is broadly consistent with private agents learning about  
the Committee’s inflation goal from policy surprises—as in the scenario dubbed learning from 
policy actions that was discussed in the March Bluebook box, “Inflation Expectations and 
Optimal Control Policies.”  An extreme version of learning is the immediate-recognition scenario 
of the March Bluebook in which wage and price setters match their long-run inflation 
expectations to the announced setting of the policymakers’ goal. 
6 Policymakers are assumed to place equal weight on three stabilization objectives: limiting 
deviations of core PCE inflation from a specified goal, limiting deviations of unemployment 
from the long-run NAIRU, and limiting changes in the nominal funds rate.  It is also 
assumed that policymakers and participants in financial markets fully understand the forces 
shaping the economic outlook whereas the expectations of households and firms are formed 
using more limited information.

model’s specification is of little consequence in this case because long-run inflation 

expectations are already aligned with both actual inflation and the inflation goal, as 

they were in the May extended Greenbook baseline.  By contrast, with an inflation 

goal of 1½ percent (the left-hand set of charts), the optimal funds rate rises to above 

6 percent over the next few quarters and then declines to just above 3½ percent  

by 2012.  Core inflation beyond 2008 stays lower than in the May Bluebook, but  

this difference is mainly due to the revised specification of the FRB/US model.   

In particular, if the May optimal-control policy is re-computed using the new model 

specification reflecting more rapid adjustment in long-run inflation expectations 

(dashed lines), core inflation descends more quickly toward the 1½ percent goal than 

was shown in the May Bluebook, accompanied by a virtually identical path for  

the unemployment rate.  Another factor influencing inflation dynamics, the degree  

of global integration in product markets, is discussed in the box on “International 

Dimensions of Monetary Policy.”  

(14) As shown in Chart 6, the current level of the real funds rate, 3.3 percent,  

is identical to the Greenbook-consistent estimate of short-run r*—the value of the 

real federal funds rate that would put the level of real GDP at that of its potential 

twelve quarters ahead—and 100 basis points or more higher than the three model-

based estimates of short-run r*.  The Greenbook-consistent and model-based r* differ 

because the former incorporates the staff’s judgment on current-quarter data and 

forces not captured in the three models—including staff projections of conditioning 

factors that differ from the automated projections used by the three models.   

The Greenbook-consistent measure has been marked up about 20 basis points over 

the intermeeting period, largely in response to incoming data pointing to somewhat 

stronger consumption, business fixed investment, and net exports.  Model-based 

estimates of medium-run r*—the value of the real funds rate consistent with keeping

International Dimensions of Monetary Policy
 
A number of channels have been suggested through which the 
increased mobility of goods, capital, and labor may alter the 
economic landscape in which monetary policy operates, and the 
staff routinely takes these considerations into account in its current 
analysis and projections.  As an example of such a channel, in a 
more open economy, imports may better serve as a “release valve’’ 
for excess aggregate demand, damping its effects on output and 
inflation. 
 
This box explores these issues using SIGMA, a multi-country 
dynamic stochastic general equilibrium model used for policy 
analysis developed in the Division of International Finance.   
SIGMA is sufficiently rich in behavioral and sectoral detail to 
encompass a variety of mechanisms through which increased global 
integration can alter the dynamic properties of the macroeconomy.   
Based on work by Erceg, Gust, and Lopez-Salido, this box presents 
an analysis of how greater openness in product markets can alter 
the effects of domestic and foreign aggregate demand shocks on 
the U.S. economy and highlights the implications of these changes 
for the conduct of monetary policy.1 
 
Consider the macroeconomic effects of a persistent 1 percent 
autonomous rise in domestic aggregate demand in alternative 
specifications of the model that differ only in the degree of trade 
openness.  In each of the four panels to the right, the benchmark 
specification (solid line) corresponds to a trade share—the average 
of exports and imports—calibrated in the model to 14 percent of 
output, roughly in line with current U.S. data.  In contrast, in the 
nearly closed scenario (dashed red line) trade accounts for only 5 
percent of domestic output, close to the U.S. trade share of about 
forty years ago.  Finally, under the specification with higher 
openness (dotted blue line) this share climbs to 25 percent, roughly 
around the recent experience of the United Kingdom and, 
conceivably, the degree of U.S. trade openness in a few decades if 
global integration continues its post-World War II pace.  
 
In all three specifications, increased domestic spending prompts 
monetary policy to tighten, causing real interest rates to rise (first 
panel).  The combination of higher real interest rates and an 
induced appreciation of the dollar (not shown) limits the initial 
expansion of output and helps bring it back to baseline, in part 
through a decline in the trade balance (fourth panel).  However, 
consumer price inflation rises (third panel) because the Taylor rule 
employed in these simulations does not tighten policy enough to 
keep output (second panel) from expanding above potential.

International Dimensions of Monetary Policy 
(continued) 
 
As can been seen in the comparison of these three specifications in 
the previous page, the degree of openness affects the magnitude of 
the U.S. economy’s response to domestic shocks.  With greater 
openness, more of the increase in aggregate demand is satisfied 
through higher imports, implying a larger deterioration in the trade 
balance, a smaller increase in GDP, and less pressure on domestic 
resources.  Furthermore, the appreciation of the dollar reduces U.S. 
import prices, and with a larger share of trade in output, the 
resulting downward pressure on domestic prices is magnified.  
Accordingly, increased global integration of product markets helps 
monetary policy to stabilize the economy in the face of domestic 
spending shocks, as smaller hikes in interest rates are needed to 
keep output close to potential and to contain inflationary pressures.  
 
Increased openness, however, may also make the economy more 
vulnerable to external shocks.  The response to a 1 percent 
autonomous increase in foreign aggregate demand is shown in the 
four panels on this page.  Under all three calibrations, the 
combination of higher foreign activity and an induced depreciation 
of the dollar (as foreign interest rates rise relative to U.S. rates) 
stimulate U.S. real net exports, causing both U.S. output and 
inflation to rise.  The boost in exports is clearly more substantial 
the greater the openness of the economy, which also amplifies the 
effect of higher import prices on aggregate inflation.  Thus, not 
surprisingly, greater openness magnifies the effects on the domestic 
economy of an expansion in foreign aggregate demand, and 
requires a tighter monetary policy stance to keep inflation 
contained.   
 
Overall, these model simulations suggest that increased trade 
openness is likely to have modest, though noticeable, implications 
for how domestic shocks affect U.S. real activity and inflation. 
These simulations also highlight the extent to which openness 
increases the susceptibility of the economy to foreign 
developments.

output at potential at a seven-year horizon—are both around 2¼ percent, just above 

the TIPS-based measure of about 2.1 percent. 

(15) The upper panels of Chart 7 depict model- and market-based assessments 

of the monetary policy outlook through the end of 2012.  In the absence of shocks, 

the estimated outcome-based policy rule prescribes a funds rate path that declines 

gradually to about 4 percent.  Stochastic simulations of the FRB/US model indicate  

a 70 percent probability that the prescriptions of the outcome-based rule will fall  

in a range between 2½ and 6½ percent during 2012.  Relative to these simulations, 

information from both in- and out-of-the-money interest rate caps suggests that 

investors see less uncertainty but more downside skewness regarding the prospective 

path of policy at longer horizons (see box entitled “Assessing the Implied 

Distribution of Funds Rates at Longer Horizons using Interest Rate Caps”).   

In contrast to the outcome-based rule, Taylor rules prescribe a lower funds rate  

path for the near term than in the May Bluebook, reflecting a decrease in the forecast 

of the core PCE inflation rate for the current quarter. 

Short-Run Policy Alternatives 

(16) This Bluebook presents three policy alternatives for the Committee’s 

consideration, summarized in Table 1.  Under Alternative A, the Committee lowers 

the target federal funds rate 25 basis points to 5 percent.  Alternative B maintains the 

target for the federal funds rate at 5¼ percent.  Alternative C envisions the 

Committee tightening by 25 basis points, to bring the target rate to 5½ percent.  As 

for the wording of the statement, economic growth appears to have rebounded in the 

second quarter from its anemic first-quarter pace.  Accordingly, the reference in the 

previous statement indicating that “economic growth slowed in the first part of the 

year” is updated in all three alternatives to indicate that the economy appears to have 

expanded at a moderate pace so far this year.  This assessment is intended to smooth

ExtenExad fall Assessing the Implied Distribution of Funds Rates at Longer Horizons using 
Interest Rate Caps 
 
The degree of uncertainty around the expected path of the federal funds rate can be assessed 
using implied volatilities derived from interest rate options.  Beginning with the January 
Bluebook, prices on interest rate caps, which are sequences of call options on three-month 
LIBOR, have been used to construct the confidence intervals for the funds rate shown 
through 2012 in Chart 7.1  Until this Bluebook, those estimates have been based solely on 
price quotes for at-the-money options, and following convention, it was assumed that 
interest rates were log-normally distributed.  By construction, the estimated distribution of 
interest rates was skewed somewhat toward higher rates.   
 
Recently, Board staff have analyzed in- and out-of-the-money interest rate caps to obtain 
information on the possible skew in the distribution of short-term interest rates.2  This 
analysis is broadly similar to the construction of the distribution of the expected federal 
funds rate six months ahead derived from options on Eurodollar futures that is shown in 
Chart 1.  Based on interest rate caps, the staff can now calculate risk-neutral, non-parametric 
probability density functions of future short-term rates from the near term to very distant 
horizons and monitor the width and skew of these distributions.   
 
These estimates generally suggest that the assumption that interest rates are log-normally 
distributed results in an underestimation of the weight market participants put on very low 
rates.  Over the last two years, the lower bound of the 90 percent confidence band about six 
years hence based on these density functions has been about 70 basis points below that 
derived from confidence intervals under the log-normal assumption.

Uncertainty at Longer Horizons using Interest Rate Caps.”

Rationale 

3. Core inflation remains somewhat 
elevated.  Although inflation 
pressures seem likely to moderate 
over time, the high level of resource 
utilization has the potential to 
sustain those pressures. 

 

Core inflation has edged lower in 
recent months and is expected to 
remain moderate over the next year or 
so.  However, the high level of 
resource utilization has the potential to 
add to inflation pressures going 
forward. 

Readings on core inflation have 
improved modestly in recent months.  
However, the high level of resource 
utilization has the potential to sustain 
inflation pressures. 
 

Although readings on core inflation 
have improved modestly in recent 
months, core inflation remains 
somewhat elevated.  Inflation 
pressures seem likely to moderate 
over time, but considerable 
uncertainty surrounds that 
judgment.  Moreover, the high level 
of resource utilization, in 
combination with earlier increases 
in the prices of energy and other 
commodities, has the potential to 
sustain those pressures. 

Assessment 
of Risk 

4. In these circumstances, the 
Committee’s predominant policy 
concern remains the risk that 
inflation will fail to moderate as 
expected.  Future policy adjustments 
will depend on the evolution of the 
outlook for both inflation and 
economic growth, as implied by 
incoming information. 

With this policy action, the Committee 
judges that the downside risk to 
economic growth now roughly 
balances the upside risk to inflation.  
Future policy adjustments will depend 
on the evolution of the outlook for 
both inflation and economic growth, 
as implied by incoming information. 

 

In these circumstances, the 
Committee’s predominant policy 
concern is the risk that the moderation 
in inflation will fail to be sustained.  
Future policy adjustments will depend 
on the evolution of the outlook for 
both inflation and economic growth, 
as implied by incoming information. 
  

Even after this action, the

inflation and economic growth, as 
implied by incoming information.

through the quarterly variation that has largely been driven by transitory factors.  Core 

inflation data for recent months have been benign, with the twelve-month change in 

the core PCE deflator dropping to 2 percent in April for the first time since March of 

last year.  The draft language for all three alternatives acknowledges these favorable 

readings, but the alternatives differ notably in their assessment of inflation going 

forward.  As usual, the Committee could consider combining elements from more 

than one alternative.   

(17) If the Committee continues to view the current policy stance as likely to 

foster a return of output to potential and sustain the recent moderation of inflation, as 

in the staff forecast, then it may wish to choose Alternative B, under which the 

federal funds rate is maintained at 5¼ percent.  In the staff analysis underlying the 

Greenbook forecast, the real federal funds rate is seen as near its equilibrium value 

(Chart 6), suggesting that the current stance of policy is likely to reduce pressures on 

resources over time.  Additionally, the current target for the funds rate is very close to 

prescriptions for near-term policy obtained from optimal policy simulations with a 

2 percent inflation goal (Chart 5) and some of the policy rules shown in Chart 7.  

While financial conditions tightened substantially over the intermeeting period, 

Committee members may view this development as merely bringing forward an 

adjustment they had anticipated would occur before long, suggesting that no policy 

offset is necessary.  The Committee might also judge that maintaining its current 

policy stance for the time being would provide a reasonable weighting of the risks that 

weakness in housing could eventually have a more pronounced effect on overall 

economic activity and that the recent moderation in inflation could prove temporary. 

(18) The draft statement accompanying Alternative B reiterates the view that the 

economy seems likely to expand at a moderate pace over coming quarters.  Following 

benign inflation readings, the draft language drops both the characterization of the 

level of core inflation as “somewhat elevated” and the prediction that inflation seems 

Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) Page 22 of 42



likely to moderate from its current level.  Instead, the statement acknowledges the 

recent favorable information while expressing the view that the high level of resource 

utilization has the potential to sustain price pressures.  This language would be 

intended to indicate that incoming data point to a slowing in core inflation but, given 

that monthly inflation readings are noisy, to suggest that the Committee is awaiting 

more data before being satisfied that the moderation in inflation will be sustained.  

The statement would conclude by indicating that the Committee’s predominant policy 

concern remains the upside risk to inflation, with the language modified for 

consistency with the inflation paragraph. 

(19) Market participants do not expect a change in the funds rate at this meeting 

and judging from the Desk’s survey of primary dealers, most expect only minor 

modifications to the text of the accompanying statement.  The revisions to the 

inflation paragraph under Alternative B would likely garner considerable attention.  

Investors would not overlook the deletion of the “somewhat elevated” language and 

would probably infer that the Committee believes that its prior expectation for 

moderating core inflation is on track.  Particularly in light of the revisions to the risk 

assessment, markets might also interpret the overall statement as signaling that the 

Committee finds 2 percent to be an acceptable level of core inflation.  Market 

participants would most likely mark down their expectations for the path of the 

federal funds rate.  Equities would rally, and the foreign exchange value of the dollar 

would depreciate.  Long-term bond yields might edge lower, but that fall could be 

tempered, or even reversed, if the statement led investors to mark up their long-run 

inflation expectations.   

(20) The large rise in real yields and the resilience of equity markets over the 

intermeeting period could be interpreted as an indication that investors have marked 

up their growth expectations, anticipate greater pressures on resources, and 

correspondingly expect a more restrictive stance of policy.  Indeed, judging from 

Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) Page 23 of 42



options on Eurodollar futures, investors now place about one-third odds on monetary 

policy tightening within the next year.  Under this interpretation, there is a risk that if 

investors come to perceive resource markets as taut and do not see the Committee 

adopting a more restrictive policy, then inflation expectations could continue to rise.  

If the Committee is especially concerned by this risk, it might prefer to tighten 

25 basis points at this meeting, as in Alternative C.  Raising the funds rate at this 

meeting might be seen as the best way to mitigate the risk of an updrift in inflation 

expectations and reassure markets that the Committee will indeed tighten as necessary 

to keep inflation contained.  Members may also be concerned about the possibility 

that increases in energy and commodity prices could lead to greater price pressures 

than currently foreseen by the staff.  Moreover, the optimal policy path shown in 

Chart 5 indicates that policy would need to be tightened about 1 percentage point 

over the next year should the Committee wish to bring inflation down to 1½ percent. 

(21) The statement accompanying Alternative C could reiterate the assessment 

that the economy seems likely to expand at a moderate pace while reordering the 

clauses in order to underscore the view that the adjustment in the housing sector 

appears unlikely to derail the economic expansion.  The inflation paragraph would de-

emphasize the recent monthly price data and retain the explicit acknowledgement that 

the level of core inflation remains somewhat elevated, which many investors would 

read as a signal that the Committee prefers a core inflation rate of around 1½ percent.  

The Committee’s concern about the inflation outlook could be stressed by noting that 

“considerable uncertainty” surrounds the assessment that inflation is likely to 

moderate and also by expanding the set of factors that could sustain inflation 

pressures to include the pass-through from higher prices of energy and other 

commodities.  The statement could conclude by noting that, even after the increase in 

the funds rate, the Committee’s predominant policy concern remains the upside risk 

to inflation. 

Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) Page 24 of 42



(22) A tightening of monetary policy at this meeting would take financial 

markets aback.  Short-term interest rates and option-implied volatility of money 

market rates would surely rise.  However, inflation compensation and distant-horizon 

forward yields could well fall as the announcement would likely lower long-run 

inflation expectations.  The net effect on long-term yields is thus ambiguous.  The 

foreign exchange value of the dollar would probably appreciate, and equity prices 

would likely decline. 

(23) Against the backdrop of the recent sharp rise in interest rates and an already 

weak housing market and following a number of benign inflation readings, members 

may feel that the risk of unacceptably sluggish economic growth is now greater than 

the upside risk to inflation.  If so, the Committee might wish to lower the target 

federal funds rate by 25 basis points as in Alternative A.  The Committee might view 

the recent backup in long-term yields as owing mainly to an exogenous rebound in 

term premiums from an abnormally low level.  A rising term premium could dampen 

consumer and business spending and further weaken the housing market, a possibility 

explored in the Greenbook alternative simulation “Tighter financial conditions.”  In 

light of this possibility, the Committee may believe that a lower federal funds rate is 

required to maintain the desired strength of aggregate demand.  Furthermore, with 

low unemployment not clearly boosting labor costs, the Committee might think that 

the NAIRU could well be lower than currently estimated by the staff—as in the 

“lower NAIRU” Greenbook alternative scenario.  In this case, it may judge that a 

slightly more accommodative stance of monetary policy would run little risk of 

stoking inflationary pressures, especially since the real funds rate is now above the 

range of model-based estimates of its equilibrium.    

(24) The statement in Alternative A would continue to note that the economy 

seems most likely to expand at a moderate pace.  But the Committee may perceive the 

downside risk to that forecast emanating from the housing sector as being greater 

Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) Page 25 of 42



than it was in May, owing to the backup in mortgage interest rates.  Accordingly, the 

draft language highlights this risk by placing it in a separate sentence at the end of the 

second paragraph and by pointing explicitly to “ongoing weakness” in the housing 

sector rather than “ongoing adjustment.”  In the inflation paragraph, the reference to 

core inflation being elevated would be deleted and replaced by the assessment that 

core inflation has edged lower and is likely to remain moderate, implicitly placing 

considerable weight on the recent inflation news.  The statement could conclude by 

noting that even after the 25 basis point easing, the downside risk to the Committee’s 

growth objective is roughly offset by the upside risk to its inflation objective, and that 

future policy adjustments will depend on the evolution of the outlook for both 

inflation and economic growth. 

(25) An easing of monetary policy at this meeting would come as a complete 

surprise to investors, particularly in the wake of the recent jump in policy 

expectations.  Short-term interest rates would fall appreciably and option-implied 

volatility in fixed-income markets would rise.  The effect on longer-term interest rates 

is less clear.  Investors might interpret the announcement as signaling that the 

economy is weaker than they had previously thought, driving long-term yields down.  

Alternatively, the announcement might lead investors to mark up their expectations 

for inflation and to demand a larger inflation risk premium, boosting long-term yields.  

The effects on equity markets and the foreign-exchange value of the dollar are 

likewise ambiguous, depending on how investors update their forecasts for inflation 

and growth in light of the surprise decision. 

Money and Debt Forecasts 

(26) Under the Greenbook forecast, M2 is projected to expand about 

5½ percent this year and 5 percent next year, as in the May forecast.  Opportunity 

costs of holding money are expected to edge down further over the remainder of this

year, as deposit rates continue to catch up with earlier increases in short-term interest 

rates, and accordingly M2 grows a little faster than nominal GDP.  In the forecast, 

ongoing rapid growth in retail money funds offsets more sluggish expansion in small 

time deposits and currency. 

(27) The growth rate of domestic nonfinancial sector debt is projected to fall 

from 8 percent last year to 6¾ percent in 2007 and 5¾ percent in 2008.  Corporate 

borrowing is predicted to slow later this year.  In the household sector, flat house 

prices, rising interest rates, and tightening credit standards are all expected to weigh 

on mortgage borrowing.

Directive and Balance of  Risks Statement 

(28) Draft language for the directive and draft risk assessments identical to those 

presented in Table 1 are provided below. 

Directive Wording 
The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and financial 

conditions that will foster price stability and promote sustainable growth 

in output.  To further its long-run objectives, the Committee in the 

immediate future seeks conditions in reserve markets consistent with 

maintaining/INCREASING/REDUCING the federal funds rate at/TO 

an average of around ________ 5¼ percent. 

Risk Assessments  

 A.   With this policy action, the Committee judges that the downside risk to 

economic growth now roughly balances the upside risk to inflation.  

Future policy adjustments will depend on the evolution of the outlook 

for both inflation and economic growth, as implied by incoming 

information.  

 B.   In these circumstances, the Committee’s predominant policy concern is 

the risk that the moderation in inflation will fail to be sustained.  Future 

policy adjustments will depend on the evolution of the outlook for both 

inflation and economic growth, as implied by incoming information. 

 C.   Even after this action, the Committee’s predominant policy concern 

remains the risk that inflation will fail to moderate as expected.  Future 

policy adjustments will depend on the evolution of the outlook for both 

inflation and economic growth, as implied by incoming information.

Appendix A: Measures of the Equilibrium Real Rate 
 

The equilibrium real rate is the real federal funds rate that, if maintained, would be projected to return 
output to its potential level over time.  The short-run equilibrium rate is defined as the rate that would 
close the output gap in twelve quarters given the corresponding model’s projection of the economy.   
The medium-run concept is the value of the real federal funds rate projected to keep output at potential 
in seven years, under the assumption that monetary policy acts to bring actual and potential output into 
line in the short run and then keeps them equal thereafter.  The TIPS-based factor model measure 
provides an estimate of market expectations for the real federal funds rate seven years ahead.  
 
The actual real federal funds rate is constructed as the difference between the nominal rate and realized 
inflation, where the nominal rate is measured as the quarterly average of the observed federal funds rate, 
and realized inflation is given by the log difference between the core PCE price index and its lagged 
value four quarters earlier.  For the current quarter, the nominal rate is specified as the target federal 
funds rate on the Bluebook publication date.  For the current quarter and the previous quarter, the 
inflation rate is computed using the staff’s estimate of the core PCE price index. 
 
Confidence intervals reflect uncertainties about model specification, coefficients, and the level of 
potential output.  The final column of the table indicates the values published in the previous Bluebook. 
  

Measure Description 

Single-equation 
Model  

The measure of the equilibrium real rate in the single-equation model is based on an 
estimated aggregate-demand relationship between the current value of the output gap and 
its lagged values as well as the lagged values of the real federal funds rate. 

Small Structural 
Model 

The small-scale model of the economy consists of equations for five variables: the output 
gap, the equity premium, the federal budget surplus, the trend growth rate of output, and 
the real bond yield. 

Large Model 
(FRB/US) 

Estimates of the equilibrium real rate using FRB/US—the staff’s large-scale econometric 
model of the U.S. economy—depend on a very broad array of economic factors, some of 
which take the form of projected values of the model’s exogenous variables. 

Greenbook-
consistent  

The FRB/US model is used in conjunction with an extended version of the Greenbook 
forecast to derive a Greenbook-consistent measure.  FRB/US is first add-factored so that 
its simulation matches the extended Greenbook forecast, and then a second simulation is 
run off this baseline to determine the value of the real federal funds rate that closes the 
output gap. 

TIPS-based 
Factor Model 

Yields on TIPS (Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities) reflect investors’ expectations of 
the future path of real interest rates, but also include term and liquidity premiums.  The 
TIPS-based measure of the equilibrium real rate is constructed using the seven-year-ahead 
instantaneous real forward rate derived from TIPS yields as of the Bluebook publication 
date.  This forward rate is adjusted to remove estimates of the term and liquidity 
premiums based on a three-factor arbitrage-free term-structure model applied to TIPS 
yields, nominal yields, and inflation.  Because TIPS indexation is based on the total CPI, 
this measure is also adjusted for the medium-term difference—projected at 40 basis 
points—between total CPI inflation and core PCE inflation.

Appendix B: Analysis of Policy Paths and Confidence Intervals 
 

Rule Specifications:  For the following rules, it denotes the federal funds rate for quarter t, while  
the explanatory variables include the staff’s projection of trailing four-quarter core PCE inflation (πt), 
inflation two and three quarters ahead (πt+2|t and πt+3|t), the output gap in the current period and one 
quarter ahead ( *t ty y−  and *1| 1|t t t ty y+ +− ), and the three-quarter-ahead forecast of annual average GDP 
growth relative to potential ( 4 4 *3| 3|t t t ty y+ +Δ − Δ ), and *π  denotes an assumed value of policymakers’ 
long-run inflation objective.  The outcome-based and forecast-based rules were estimated using real-
time data over the sample 1988:1-2006:4; each specification was chosen using the Bayesian information 
criterion. Each rule incorporates a 75 basis point shift in the intercept, specified as a sequence of  
25 basis point increments during the first three quarters of 1998.  The first two simple rules were 
proposed by Taylor (1993, 1999), while the third is a variant of the Taylor (1999) rule—introduced  
in the August Bluebook—with a higher value of r*.  The prescriptions of the first-difference rule do  
not depend on assumptions regarding r* or the level of the output gap; see Orphanides (2003). 
 

Outcome-based rule it =  1.20it-1–0.39it-2+0.19[1.17  + 1.73 πt  + 3.66( *t ty y− )  – 2.72( *1 1t ty y− −− )]

Forecast-based rule it =  1.18it-1–0.38it-2+0.20[0.98 +1.72 πt+2|t+2.29( *1| 1|t t t ty y+ +− )–1.37( *1 1t ty y− −− )]

Taylor (1993) rule it = 2 + πt + 0.5(πt – *π ) + 0.5( *t ty y− ) 

Taylor (1999) rule it = 2 + πt + 0.5(πt – *π ) + ( *t ty y− ) 

Taylor (1999) rule     
with higher r* 

it = 2.75 + πt + 0.5(πt – *π ) + ( *t ty y− )  

First-difference rule it = it-1 + 0.5(πt+3|t – *π ) + 0.5( 4 4 *3| 3|t t t ty y+ +Δ − Δ ) 
 
FRB/US Model Simulations:  Prescriptions from the two empirical rules are computed using dynamic 
simulations of the FRB/US model, implemented as though the rule were followed starting at this FOMC 
meeting.  The dotted line labeled “Previous Bluebook” is based on the current specification of the policy 
rule, applied to the previous Greenbook projection.  Confidence intervals are based on stochastic 
simulations of the FRB/US model with shocks drawn from the estimated residuals over 1986-2005.  
Information from Financial Markets:  The expected funds rate path is based on forward rate 
agreements, and the confidence intervals for this path are constructed using prices of interest rate caps. 
Near-Term Prescriptions of Simple Policy Rules:  These prescriptions are calculated using Greenbook 
projections for inflation and the output gap. Because the first-difference rule involves the lagged funds 
rate, the value labeled “Previous Bluebook” for the current quarter is computed using the actual value  
of the lagged funds rate, and the one-quarter-ahead prescriptions are based on this rule’s prescription for 
the current quarter.

Inflation Indicator Based on M2

Note: P* is defined to equal M2 times V* divided by potential GDP. V*, or long-run velocity, is estimated
using average velocity over the 1959:Q1-to-1989:Q4 period and then, after a break, over the interval from
1993:Q1 to the present. For the forecast period, P* is based on the staff M2 forecast and P is simulated using a
short-run dynamic model relating P to P*. Blue areas indicate periods in which P* is notably less than P.
Gray areas denote the projection period.
