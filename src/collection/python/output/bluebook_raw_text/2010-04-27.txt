CLASS I FOMC - RESTRICTED CONTROLLED (FR) 

MONETARY POLICY ALTERNATIVES 
 

PREPARED FOR THE FEDERAL OPEN MARKET COMMITTEE

RECENT  DEVELOPMENTS 
 

SUMMARY  

Investors seemed to become more upbeat about economic prospects over the 

intermeeting period. Equity prices moved higher, buoyed by positive earnings news, 

and spreads on corporate bonds edged down further on signs of improvement in 

corporate credit quality. Yields on Treasury securities rose slightly, on net, and the 

expected path of the federal funds rate edged down.  Market functioning was 

generally stable, with no apparent adverse reaction to the end of the Federal Reserve’s 

programs to purchase agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities (MBS) at 

quarter-end. Corporate bond issuance surged over the intermeeting period, while 

bank loans to both businesses and households continued to decline in March.  Results 

from the April Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey (SLOOS) indicated that the 

tightening of bank lending standards likely came to an end, on net, in the first quarter, 

but banks continued to tighten loan terms, particularly for risky borrowers, and to 

experience weaker loan demand. Across the globe, equity indexes rose, evidently 

reflecting growing confidence that the global recovery is gaining momentum, although 

concerns about fiscal sustainability in Greece intensified. 

MONETARY  POLICY  EXPECTATIONS  AND  TREASURY  YIELDS  

Despite the more optimistic tone in financial markets regarding the economic 

outlook, policy expectations edged down, on net, over the intermeeting period. The 

expected path of the federal funds rate declined modestly after the release of the 

statement following the March FOMC meeting, as some market participants 

reportedly interpreted the retention of the “extended period” language as pointing to 

a longer period of low rates than previously expected.  That downward revision in 

policy expectations was reinforced by subsequent communications by Federal Reserve

officials that were read by investors as somewhat more cautious about the economic 

recovery than had been expected.   

Futures quotes combined with the staff’s standard assumption regarding the term 

premium suggest that the expected path of the funds rate starts to rise above 25 basis 

points in the fourth quarter of this year and reaches just above 1½ percent by the end 

of 2011, a bit lower than at the time of the last FOMC meeting (Chart 1).  Market 

quotes for interest rate caps provide information about the distribution of the 

anticipated federal funds rate at points in the future, and these data suggest that the 

modal path of the federal funds rate lies well below the mean path captured by federal 

funds futures.  The April survey of primary dealers asked them to assign probabilities 

to the event that the first increase in the FOMC’s target funds rate would occur in a 

given quarter over the next couple of years.  The responses indicated that the dealers 

see probabilities that the first target rate increase will occur in the second half of this 

year, the first half of next year, or in the second half of next year and beyond of about 

40 percent, 35 percent, and 23 percent, respectively. 

On net, yields on 2- and 10-year Treasury securities edged up, on balance, over 

the intermeeting period, reportedly reflecting in part some concerns about the fiscal 

outlook and modestly improved prospects for economic growth.  Trading was volatile 

at times, particularly in late March, and option-implied measures of uncertainty about 

longer-term Treasury yields moved higher, on balance.  The rise in implied volatility is 

consistent with model estimates pointing to an increase in term premiums.  Near-term 

inflation compensation rose some over the period.  Longer-term inflation 

compensation increased 11 basis points, but survey measures of longer-term inflation 

expectations were about unchanged.

The Treasury auctioned about $200 billion in coupon securities of various 

maturities over the intermeeting period.  Some of the auctions held in late March, 

particularly those for 5- and 7-year notes, had stop-out rates that were somewhat 

above when-issued rates.  By contrast, the coupon auctions that took place in April 

had strong bid-to-cover ratios and stopped out at rates just above or somewhat below 

when-issued rates. The 10-year TIPS auction in April also experienced robust 

demand. Concerns about the fiscal outlook seemed to be a factor contributing to the 

continued narrowing of ten-year swap spreads over the period.  (See box entitled 

“Determinants of the Ten-Year Swap Spread.”) 

CAPITAL  MARKETS  

Broad equity indexes rose 5 to 9 percent, on balance, over the intermeeting 

period, with bank shares gaining 12 percent (Chart 2).  Equity prices were supported 

by generally positive macroeconomic data and a favorable response by investors to 

the initial batch of first-quarter corporate earnings reports.  The first-quarter earnings 

of banking institutions were well above expectations, on balance, with the largest 

banks posting strong capital markets revenue, and banks of all sizes reporting a 

decrease in loan loss provisioning that boosted earnings more broadly.  The equity 

premium, measured as the staff’s estimate of the expected real return on equities over 

the next 10 years relative to the real 10-year Treasury yield, remained well above levels 

observed during the past decade, while option-implied volatility on the S&P 500, 

which spiked briefly on the news of the SEC’s fraud case against Goldman Sachs, 

declined, on balance, over the intermeeting period.  

Yields on investment-grade corporate bonds edged down, leaving their spreads to 

comparable-maturity Treasury securities a bit lower at levels around those that 

prevailed in late 2007. Consistent with more favorable investor sentiment toward 

risky assets, yields and spreads on speculative-grade corporate bonds declined, and 



1 A negative swap spread does not indicate that corporations can issue long-term debt at a lower cost than 
the U.S. Treasury.  This is because, in order to do so, companies would need to either keep rolling over 
short-term debt over the next ten years or issue ten-year floating-rate bonds, while in the meantime 
swapping the floating-rate liabilities into fixed rates.  The former arrangement exposes them to the risk that 
their short-term borrowing cost might rise in the future, while in the latter scenario, the floating-rate debt is 
typically issued at a spread over Libor that is sufficiently large to result in an overall borrowing cost 
exceeding the ten-year Treasury yield.

Determinants of the Ten‐Year Swap Spread 

The ten-year swap spread 
(based on dollar Libor rates) has 
narrowed significantly since the fall 
of 2008 and recently turned 
slightly negative.1  Several factors 
have been mentioned as 
contributing to the decline in U.S. 
swap spreads:  (1) concerns about 
the U.S. fiscal outlook, (2) reduced 
mortgage hedging demand as a 
consequence of large MBS 
purchases by the Federal Reserve, 
(3) recent elevated bond issuance 
by firms that subsequently 
swapped fixed rates on the bonds 
into floating rates, (4) diminished  
credit risks of the banking sector, 
(5) concerns about U.S. sovereign 
credit risk, and (6) effects of 
ongoing deleveraging by financial 
firms. 

Based on regression analysis 
over the 1993:Q1 to 2009:Q4 
period, the deterioration in the 
fiscal outlook appears to be the 
single most important factor 
influencing the ten-year swap 
spread. We measure this variable 
by the average ratio of the federal 
budget surplus to nominal GDP 
over the next ten years based on 
the baseline projections by the 



April 22, 2010 Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) 6 of 59

Congressional Budget Office (CBO) and plotted it as the red line in the top panel.  
This variable alone explains about 80 percent of the variation in swap spreads over 
the sample period. A proxy for the credit risk of the banking sector (the Libor-OIS 
spread) and a measure of mortgage hedging demand (MBS duration adjusted for 
purchases by the Federal Reserve and the Treasury) also have significant 
explanatory power; available proxies for all other factors mentioned above appear 
to be insignificant over this period as a whole.   

This model accounts for about 2/3 of the swap spread narrowing since late 
2008. However, as shown in the middle panel, the model is unable to account for 
the recent sharp drop in swap spreads into negative territory, suggesting that other 
transitory market factors—such as strong corporate bond issuance and the 
unwinding of swap-spread-widening positions amid narrowing swap spreads—may 
have been at play in recent weeks.  In addition, market participants reportedly saw 
the passage in March of health care reform by the Congress as implying more 
deterioration in the fiscal outlook than suggested by the CBO budget estimates.    

Of note, as shown in the bottom panel, swap spreads in other countries have 
behaved similarly to those in the United States.  Staff work suggests that these 
spreads are also reflective, in part, of concerns about the future supply of 
government securities.

secondary market prices of syndicated leveraged loans rose further.  Indicators of 

credit quality for nonfinancial firms continued to improve.  The number of 

nonfinancial corporate bonds that Moody’s upgraded in the first quarter far exceeded 

the number it downgraded. No defaults on nonfinancial bonds were recorded in 

March, bringing the six-month trailing average down even further.  The year-ahead 

expected default frequency for nonfinancial firms from Moody’s KMV declined again 

in March, but remained somewhat elevated. 

Overall, net debt financing by nonfinancial firms was solidly positive in March 

(Chart 3). Issuance of nonfinancial bonds surged and net issuance of commercial 

paper rebounded appreciably. Reportedly, a portion of the proceeds from the 

increased bond issuance went to pay down other debt. Institutional investors, 

including collateralized loan obligation pools, were said to have used the significant 

amount of cash provided by the resulting loan prepayments to purchase new loans in 

the primary market. Consequently, issuance of leveraged loans picked up in the first 

quarter. Meanwhile, the contraction in C&I loans at banks continued at roughly its 

recent pace; anecdotal information from banks indicated this decline was also 

attributable in part to continued paydowns of existing loans.  Net equity issuance by 

nonfinancial firms was negative again in the first quarter as the solid pace of gross 

public equity issuance was more than offset by equity retirements from both cash-

financed mergers and share repurchases.  Financial firms issued a robust volume of 

debt securities in the first quarter, and also raised a moderate amount of gross funds 

in the equity market; this pattern appears to have continued in the first half of April. 

The conclusion of purchases under the Federal Reserve’s agency MBS program 

had only a modest market effect. The spread of yields on 30-year current coupon 

MBS over yields on 10-year Treasury securities retraced much of the increase seen 

around the time of the program’s conclusion, ending the period roughly where it

began it. However, the spread of option-adjusted yields on MBS over yields on 

Treasury securities widened some. The average interest rate on 30-year conforming 

fixed-rate mortgages increased about 10 basis points to 5.07, about in line with the 

increase in 10-year Treasury yield, leaving the spread between these two rates roughly 

unchanged.  Market-based indicators of investor expectations do not point to a 

widening of MBS spreads in the near term.  The factors contributing to the still-low 

MBS and mortgage spreads include the low level of mortgage originations, which has 

damped the supply of new MBS, and the GSEs’ increased purchases of mortgages 

through their buyouts of delinquent loans. In addition, market participants have 

noted that a number of traditional investors that have been underweight in mortgages 

over recent months have reportedly become active buyers of mortgages since the 

conclusion of the Federal Reserve’s purchases of MBS.   

Consumer credit continued to trend lower in recent months, pushed down by a 

steep decline in revolving credit. Spreads on high-quality credit card and auto loan 

asset-backed securities (ABS) edged down over the period, with little upward pressure 

evident from the end of the portion of the Term Asset-Backed Securities Loan 

Facility (TALF) supporting ABS. Still, fewer ABS were issued in the first quarter than 

in the fourth quarter, reflecting continued weakness in loan originations.  Delinquency 

rates on consumer loans edged down further in February but remained very elevated.  

Spreads of interest rates on credit cards over yields on two-year Treasury securities 

continued to drift upward. By contrast, interest rates on new auto loans at dealerships 

and their spread over yields on five-year Treasury securities declined further.   

MARKET  FUNCTIONING  AND  FEDERAL  RESERVE  PROGRAMS  

Overall, conditions in short-term funding markets remained generally stable 

during the intermeeting period. Libor-OIS spreads at the one-, three-, and six-month 

tenors stayed around levels that prevailed in late 2007, as did spreads in the 



 

                                           
1 Although Libor-OIS spreads were little changed, anecdotal reports late in the period 
suggested that some institutions might be experiencing a modest increase in funding 
pressures. A number of possible causes were cited, included potential concerns about 
institutions’ perceived exposures to Greece. 

2 To minimize the dollar amount of the assessment fee for the TAGP at each quarter-end, 
some banks reportedly sought to encourage their customers to shift funds from transaction 
deposits, which were subject to the assessment, to other types of investments that were not.  
The resulting shifts put downward pressure on GC repo rates and other short-term money

commercial paper market.1  The effective federal funds rate was somewhat firm 

relative to the recent past, averaging 18 basis points compared to 13 basis points over 

the previous intermeeting period. The firming was likely the result in part of higher 

levels of the Treasury general collateral (GC) repo rate, which in turn largely reflected 

continued increases in the supply of Treasury debt including Supplementary Financing 

Program bills. Moreover, Fannie Mae reportedly reduced its lending in the federal 

funds market over the intermeeting period, using a substantial portion of its short-

term liquidity to fund part of its buybacks of delinquent loans.  Futures market quotes 

suggest that market participants expect the effective federal funds rate to stay near 

current levels for some time. 

Funding pressures in financial markets were muted in the run-up to quarter-

end. Rates in some money markets, including those on very short-term Treasury bills, 

did decline sharply on the quarter-end, but not as sharply as at the December year-

end, and they normalized quickly thereafter. Market participants indicated that rates 

may have been supported at the end of the quarter by a number of factors, including a 

large month-end settlement of Treasury coupon issues that provided approximately 

$90 billion in net new collateral to the market, issuance of Treasury bills under the 

Supplementary Financing Program, and a decrease in quarter-end window dressing by 

banks as fewer were subject to FDIC fee assessments after opting out of the 

Transaction Account Guarantee Program (TAGP) following year-end.2 



market rates. Now that most large banks are no longer subject to the assessment fee, the 
shift into GC repo at quarter-end has eased, implying less downward pressure on rates.

Outflows from institutional money market mutual funds intensified in March.  

The acceleration appears to reflect at least in part the increase in rates in money 

markets over the period. Rates on money market mutual funds adjust to changes in 

rates paid on underlying instruments with a lag, and some investors apparently reacted 

to the widening in spreads by substituting away from money market mutual funds and 

directly into higher-yielding money market instruments. 

The volume of fails in the MBS market dropped significantly relative to its recent 

peak in March, apparently reflecting in part the active efforts of market participants to 

reduce their fails positions. Investors noted the announcement by the Treasury 

Market Practices Group that it planned to expand its scope to include the agency 

MBS and agency debt markets. Some market participants reportedly interpreted the 

announcement as likely to presage the establishment of a fails charge in the MBS 

market similar to the one instituted in the Treasury market in May 2009.   

In addition to completing its purchases of agency MBS, the Federal Reserve also 

concluded its purchases of agency debt and held its last TALF subscription for legacy 

commercial mortgage-backed securities (CMBS).  (See box entitled “Balance Sheet 

Developments during the Intermeeting Period.”)  These events passed with no major 

adverse effects on markets or institutions.  The last purchase of agency debt was made 

on March 24; since then, agency debt spreads to Treasury securities have been roughly 

unchanged.  The final legacy CMBS TALF subscription settled on March 29.  Spreads 

of AAA-rated CMBS to 10-year Treasury securities, which remain elevated relative to 

pre-crisis levels, decreased substantially over the intermeeting period, reportedly 

reflecting increased demand. These developments suggest that the end of the portion

             Balance Sheet Developments during the Intermeeting Period 

The Federal Reserve’s total assets edged up over the intermeeting period to just 
over $2.3 trillion.1  An increase in securities held outright, as purchases under the 
large-scale asset purchases (LSAPs) continued to settle, more than offset a decline 
in lending through liquidity and credit facilities.   

During the intermeeting period, securities held outright rose, on net, $39 billion, 
reflecting increases of $1 billion in agency debt securities and $38 billion in agency 
mortgage-backed securities (MBS).2  The Desk completed purchases of agency debt 
under the agency LSAP program by the end of March.  However, given the lags in 
the settlement of agency MBS purchase transactions and the dollar roll transactions 
conducted by the Desk, the final agency MBS purchases under the agency MBS 
LSAP program will likely not settle until late June.  

Credit provided through the System’s liquidity and credit programs contracted 
further over the intermeeting period.  Credit outstanding under the Term Auction 
Facility (TAF) dropped to zero on April 8, and primary credit declined by $5 billion 
to $7 billion over the period.  The last $3 billion of commercial paper holdings of the 
Commercial Paper Funding Facility (CPFF) will mature on April 26.3 

Loans extended through the Term Asset-Backed Securities Loan Facility 
(TALF) decreased by about $1 billion, on net.  About $857 million in loans backed 
by legacy commercial mortgage-backed securities (CMBS) settled in the final legacy 
TALF subscription on March 29.  This increase in lending was offset by about 
$2 billion in loan prepayments. No loans secured by newly issued CMBS were 
requested at the April 21 subscription, and it appears unlikely that there will be any 
such loan requests before the facility closes on June 30.     

On the liability side of the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet, the U.S. Treasury’s 

general account declined $39 billion over the period.  However, the Treasury’s 

supplementary financing account increased $125 billion, bringing the balance to 

$200 billion, the level the Treasury intends to maintain going forward.  Reserve 

balances of depository institutions decreased by $49 billion over the intermeeting 

period.

CMBS market. Prices of indexes of CDS on AAA-rated CMBS rose, and the first 

multi-borrower CMBS deal since the summer of 2008 was issued by the Royal Bank 

of Scotland without TALF support. This deal was well received by the market, with 

spreads narrower than the single-borrower deals issued last spring. Although the 

portion of TALF supporting new-issue CMBS deals does not close until the end of 

June, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York requested that investors submit term 

sheets by April 19 for any new-issue CMBS they intended to finance through the 

TALF; no new term sheets were received. The first new-issue non-agency residential 

MBS deal since 2007 came to market on April 21.  The deal is relatively small in size, 

at roughly $200 million dollars, and backed by high-quality jumbo mortgages.  There 

reportedly has been significant demand for the syndication. 

FOREIGN  MARKET  DEVELOPMENTS  

During the intermeeting period, equity indexes rose across the globe, implied 

volatilities remained low, and emerging-market risk spreads generally declined    

(Chart 4). These moves appeared to reflect growing confidence that the global 

recovery is gaining momentum, particularly in emerging market economies.  However, 

Greek sovereign debt remained under pressure despite the European Union’s 

announcement that a substantial package of financial assistance would be offered by 

the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and euro-area countries. 

Spreads of Greek sovereign debt over German debt rose in the second half of 

March and early April prompting the European Union to announce details of an 

assistance package for Greece, consisting of up to €45 billion in bilateral loans from 

euro-area countries and the IMF; Greek spreads fell on the news.  However, spreads 

moved higher again over the following days as market participants recognized that 

parliamentary approval for the aid would be required in several countries, including 

Germany. After Greece’s deficit figures were again revised higher, spreads on Greek

debt increased further to a record level of 580 basis points.  Debt spreads of other 

peripheral euro-area countries generally moved in synch with Greek spreads since the 

last FOMC meeting, but these moves were muted by comparison; Portuguese debt 

spreads increased the most, rising to about 190 basis points.  After the close of the 

European sovereign bond markets today, Moody’s downgraded Greece’s sovereign 

debt rating one notch to A3, and Greek CDS spreads widened considerably further. 

The trade-weighted value of the dollar, as measured by the staff’s broad nominal 

index, changed little, on net, over the intermeeting period; gains against the euro and 

yen were offset by declines against the Canadian dollar and most emerging market 

currencies.  Chinese authorities did not allow the renminbi spot exchange rate to 

fluctuate meaningfully against the dollar, but by the end of the intermeeting period, 

rumors were widespread that China would let the renminbi appreciate soon, and the 

dollar continued to depreciate against most other emerging-Asian currencies.  The 

dollar ended the period up 2½ percent, on balance, versus the euro, which was 

buffeted daily by news and rumors about the fiscal situation in Greece.  The 

depreciation of the euro also prompted the Swiss National Bank to renew its 

intervention operations, purchasing euros in order to limit further appreciation of the 

Swiss franc. The dollar also rose against the yen as Japanese investors reportedly 

sought to invest in higher-yielding foreign assets. 

Yields on ten-year German sovereign issues and on debt of other core euro-area 

countries were little changed, on balance, over the intermeeting period, as were yields 

on U.K. and Japanese debt. However, Canadian yields rose about 20 basis points, and 

market expectations of policy tightening in Canada increased sharply as strong 

economic growth and rising inflation prompted the Bank of Canada to drop its 

conditional commitment to keeping rates steady through the first half of this year.  

Policy rates of central banks in the major advanced economies were unchanged, but 



 

 

 

April 22, 2010 Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) 18 of 59

the terms of some lending facilities were adjusted.  The European Central Bank 

(ECB) announced that it would extend its relaxed collateral rules into 2011 and that it 

would not impose further haircuts on lower-rated sovereign debt.  Both moves helped 

reduce some of the pressure on Greek banks. The Bank of Japan doubled the size of 

its 3-month fixed-rate funds supplying operations to ¥20 trillion.  The Reserve Bank 

of Australia raised its policy rate 25 basis points to 4¼ percent. 

DEBT,  BANK  CREDIT,  AND  MONEY  

Aggregate debt of the U.S. domestic private sectors appears to have expanded 

slightly in the first quarter after having contracted for the previous five quarters  

(Chart 5). The staff estimates that the growth rates of both nonfinancial business 

debt and household debt turned positive in the first quarter.  Issuance of federal 

government debt remained rapid over the same period, while state and local 

government debt continued to expand moderately.  All told, the growth rate of 

domestic nonfinancial sector debt appears to have increased to an annual rate of 

about 5 percent in the first quarter, up from roughly 1½ percent in the final quarter of 

2009. 

After adjusting to remove the effects of banks’ adoption of Financial Accounting 

Standards (FAS) 166 and 167, bank credit continued to contract in March, as both 

loans and securities holdings declined.  (See box entitled “Effects of FAS 166/167 on 

Banks’ Balance Sheets.”) This decrease was driven by a fall in core loans, which ran 

off at a 9 percent annual rate, about the same pace as in recent months.  The 

contraction in C&I loans remained pronounced.  The drop in commercial real estate 

loans also persisted, reflecting weak fundamentals in the sector as well as charge-offs 

of existing loans. Bank holdings of residential real estate loans fell again in March, as 

did credit card and other consumer loans. Securities declined in March for the second 

consecutive month as robust growth in banks’ holdings of Treasury and agency debt

1 The weekly data show that balance sheet positions for 17 of the 25 largest domestic banks, 8 smaller 

domestically chartered commercial banks, and 4 foreign-related institutions were affected by FAS 166/167.  
The March Call Report may show that balance sheet positions of some banks that are not in our weekly 
sample were also affected by FAS 166/167.  The estimated net effect on total assets of the accounting 
changes was an increase of about $400 billion or 4 percent (total assets are measured net of banks’ allowance 
for loan and lease losses, and banks’ adoption of FAS 166/167 extinguished some asset-backed securities 
previously held on banks’ books).  The major liability item affected was borrowings from nonbanks.

               Effects of FAS 166/167 on Banks’ Balance Sheets 

By the end of the first quarter of this year, all U.S. banks were required to 

adopt the Financial Accounting Standards Board’s (FASB) Financial Accounting 

Statements No. 166 (FAS 166), Accounting for Transfers of Financial Assets, and No. 

167 (FAS 167), Amendments to FASB Interpretation No. 46(R).  The new standards 

made achieving off-balance-sheet treatment of assets much more difficult.  As a 

result, according to the Federal Reserve’s weekly bank balance sheet data through 

March 31, 2010, a total of 29 banks had brought about $450 billion in gross loans 

back onto their balance sheets, increasing banks’ books by 7 percent.1


 Some earlier estimates by industry analysts of the likely effects of these 
changes in accounting rules had been quite a bit higher, with some reaching          
$1 trillion. However, subsequent to those estimates, FASB indefinitely deferred the 
implementation date for the consolidation of certain bank-sponsored investment 
funds such as mutual funds. Additionally, since the publication of the new rules 
last June, Federal Reserve data indicate that securitized credit card pools have run 
off significantly, and some banks reportedly also sold the residual tranches of their 
institution’s private mortgage-backed securities issues in order to avoid having to 
consolidate the underlying loans. 

Despite the increase in loans on banks’ books, the capital ratios of the banks 
affected by the accounting change are estimated to have remained well in excess of 
the levels required to maintain well-capitalized status under regulatory standards.  
In addition, according to a special question in the April Senior Loan Officer 
Opinion Survey, none of the banks surveyed indicated that they had changed their 
lending standards or terms on loans to businesses and households in response to 
the new accounting rules.      

As shown in the table below, the reported on-balance-sheet amounts of credit 

card loans and related plans nearly doubled as a result of the accounting changes, 

while other categories of loans increased to a lesser degree.  Nearly all previously

securitized credit card loans were returned to the balance sheets.2  Other consumer 
loans increased $41 billion; commercial and industrial loans rose $33 billion; and 
residential real estate loans increased $27 billion.  In addition, banks augmented the 
allowance for loan and lease losses by $36 billion. 

The effects of FAS 166 and 167 on bank balance sheets was much larger than 
previous changes to accounting standards that forced the grossing up of balance 
sheets. For instance, FASB’s Interpretation No. 46(R), Consolidation of Variable 
Interest Entities, brought about $160 billion of assets, or 2 percent of the total at the 
time, back onto banks’ books between 2003 and 2005.    



 

 

 

April 22, 2010 Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) 22 of 59

securities was more than offset by declines in their holdings of MBS and other 

securities. Reflecting the decline in bank credit as well as a drop in cash assets (which 

includes reserve balances), total commercial bank assets decreased in March. 

The April SLOOS indicated that banks’ lending standards changed little, on 

balance, in the first quarter, and demand for loans declined further.  Information from 

this survey, taken together with the survey results from the fourth quarter, suggests 

that the episode of substantial tightening of lending standards that took place over the 

past several years is drawing to a close.  Indeed, if bank responses are weighted by 

outstanding loan amounts, domestic banks eased standards somewhat last quarter, on 

net, for the first time in about three years, a move that mainly reflected an easing in 

standards on some loans to both businesses and households by a few large banks.  

However, banks continued to tighten some terms on loans to both businesses and 

households, on balance, particularly for riskier borrowers.  In addition, moderate net 

fractions of banks continued to report that demand for all major categories of loans 

weakened further in the first quarter. For most loan categories, the net fraction of 

banks reporting weaker demand waned, but more banks experienced weaker demand 

for residential mortgages than in the fourth quarter. 

M2 decreased at an annual rate of 4 percent in March, reflecting a slowing in the 

expansion of liquid deposits along with a further contraction in small time deposits 

and a steep runoff in retail money market mutual funds. Currency grew at an annual 

rate of about 6 percent; staff estimates suggest this was a result of  continued demand 

for U.S. banknotes from abroad coupled with solid domestic demand.  The monetary 

base contracted in March as the effect on reserves of purchases under the Federal 

Reserve’s large-scale asset purchase programs was more than offset by a further 

contraction in credit outstanding under liquidity and credit facilities and an increase in 

the Treasury’s balances at the Federal Reserve.   



 
3 The staff forecast also assumes there will be no asset sales.  The Federal Reserve currently 
holds about $1.5 trillion of longer-term securities associated with the recently completed 
large-scale asset purchase program. The System’s holdings of these securities are assumed 
to run off gradually, declining to about $1.4 trillion by the end of 2011; maturing Treasury 
securities are assumed to be rolled over into new issues, but proceeds from maturing 
agency debt issues and prepayments on agency MBS are not reinvested.

ECONOMIC  OUTLOOK
  

On balance, the data on economic activity received over the intermeeting period 

were a little stronger than anticipated by the staff while core inflation came in 

somewhat below expectations. In response, the staff marked up slightly its outlook 

for real activity this year and revised down its projection for core inflation a bit.  The 

broad contours of the staff’s medium-term forecast are the same as those in the 

March Greenbook—a moderate recovery in economic activity, unemployment 

declining slowly from an elevated level, and subdued rates of inflation through 2014.  

The staff forecast assumes that the current target range for the federal funds rate 

will not be raised until early 2012—as in the March projection—and that no further 

asset purchases will be conducted.3  As in the March Greenbook, fiscal policy is 

expected to add about 1 percentage point to real GDP growth this year and then be a 

neutral influence on growth next year. House prices are projected to decline about 

3 percent this year in response to the large volume of foreclosed properties and then 

to edge up in 2011 as demand gradually picks up. 

Interest rates on 30-year fixed-rate mortgages and longer-term Treasury securities 

are projected to rise moderately through 2011.  The spread between the two rates is 

assumed to widen about 20 basis points by the end of this summer—slightly less than 

in the March projection—in response to the cessation of purchases of agency MBS by 

the Federal Reserve, and then level off over the medium term.  Risk spreads on 

investment-grade bonds are expected to narrow somewhat more as the economic 



 

 

April 22, 2010 Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) 24 of 59

expansion becomes more firmly established; as a result, yields on these securities 

move only slightly higher over the remainder of this year and in 2011.  With the equity 

risk premium also expected to decline over the forecast period, stock prices are 

projected to rise at an annual rate of 13½ percent over the next two years, slightly less 

than in the March Greenbook, but starting from a higher level because of an increase 

in equity prices since the previous projection.  Credit conditions are anticipated to 

improve slowly as banks gradually ease their lending standards and terms.     

The spot price of West Texas intermediate crude oil has risen about $1 per barrel 

since the March projection, to $83 per barrel, and, consistent with futures prices, the 

staff projects a further rise to about $90 per  barrel by the end of next year.  Following 

an appreciation in the first quarter, the real foreign exchange value of the dollar is 

expected to decline at an annual rate of 5 percent in the current quarter and at a rate 

of about 3½ percent over the remainder of this year and during 2011.   

Against this backdrop, the staff expects real GDP to grow about 3½ percent this 

year, slightly more than in the March projection, and about 4½ percent in 2011.  In  

light of incoming data on the labor market and the higher projection for output 

growth in 2010, the trajectory for the unemployment rate has been lowered marginally 

compared to the last Greenbook. The projected rate now declines to about 

9¼ percent at the end of 2010 and 8¼ percent at the end of 2011, still well above the 

staff’s estimate of the effective NAIRU over this period.  With inflation expectations 

stable and economic slack forecast to remain substantial, the staff projects that core 

PCE prices will rise just under 1 percent this year and next.  Total PCE inflation is  

expected to be a bit above core inflation this year, reflecting the rise in energy prices, 

but to move close to the rate of core inflation in 2011. 



 

 

  

April 22, 2010 Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) 25 of 59

Looking farther ahead, the staff forecasts above-trend output growth, falling 

unemployment, and slowly rising inflation  over 2012-2014.  The federal funds rate is 

assumed to start rising in early 2012 and to reach a bit more than 3½ percent by late 

2014. Real GDP is anticipated to expand 4¾ percent in 2012 before decelerating to 

3½ percent by 2014, while potential output is expected to advance slightly more than 

2½ percent per year on average. As a result, the projected unemployment rate 

declines to 5¼ percent in late 2014, about in line with the staff’s estimate of the 

NAIRU at that time. With a steadily narrowing output gap and stable expectations 

for longer-term inflation, total PCE inflation rises slowly after 2011 and reaches 

1½ percent by 2014—a rate still somewhat below the central tendency of 

policymakers’ long-run projections for inflation.  



 

 

4 Moving the first quarter of this period forward to the second quarter of 2010 implies that resource 
utilization is higher at the end of the twelve-quarter window used in the calculation.  As a result, less policy 
stimulus is required to move output back to potential by the end of that window, raising the estimated level 
of r*. The upward effect on r* of moving the window is expected to be repeated going forward, as resource 
slack continues to diminish.

MONETARY  POLICY  STRATEGIES 
 

Chart 6 displays estimates of short-run r*, defined as the real federal funds rate 

that, if maintained over time, would return output to potential in twelve quarters.  All 

of the estimates of short-run r* have increased since the March Bluebook. The 

Greenbook-consistent estimates of short-run r* generated by the FRB/US and EDO 

models are up by 50 basis points and 70 basis points, respectively.  These increases 

primarily reflect the one-quarter shift in the time period entering the calculation of r*, 

with the somewhat stronger staff projection for economic activity also making a 

contribution.4  Like the Greenbook-consistent estimates, the four model-based 

estimates of short-run r* are above those shown in March, reflecting both the shift in 

the window used for the r* calculation and a higher projected path for economic 

activity in these models. In particular, higher equity prices have boosted r* modestly 

in the FRB/US model and the small structural model.  

Chart 7 shows the results of optimal control simulations of the FRB/US model. 

In these simulations, policymakers are assumed to place equal weight on keeping core 

PCE inflation close to a 2 percent inflation goal, on keeping unemployment close to 

the effective NAIRU, and on minimizing changes in the federal funds rate.  As in 

recent Bluebooks, optimal monetary policy in these simulations is constrained by the 

effective lower bound, and the nominal funds rate does not leave this bound until 

early 2013 (black solid lines).  Under this policy, the unemployment rate would be 

projected to remain above the NAIRU through late 2012, while core PCE inflation

5 The staff has made a technical adjustment in its methods for constructing the policy expectations and 
confidence intervals shown in the upper-right panel of Chart 8.  To facilitate comparability, those methods 
have also been applied to the financial market data available at the time of the March Bluebook, and hence 
the line labeled “Previous Bluebook” differs slightly from the one that was published in March.

would stay appreciably below 2 percent through late 2014.  The chart also displays the 

optimal-control results obtained if the nominal funds rate were not constrained by the 

effective lower bound (blue dashed lines). Absent the constraint, the nominal funds 

rate would move down to about -3¾ percent early next year; this more 

accommodative policy would bring the unemployment rate back to the NAIRU more 

quickly and move the inflation trajectory closer to the assumed 2 percent goal.  The 

unconstrained path for the funds rate is slightly lower than in the last Bluebook, as the 

effects on the optimal policy path of the staff’s somewhat lower outlook for inflation 

later this year and in early 2011 outweigh the effects of slightly lower unemployment.    

As shown in Chart 8, the outcome-based policy rule prescribes a trajectory for the 

federal funds rate virtually identical to the one in the previous Bluebook (upper-left 

panel). The nominal funds rate starts rising above the effective lower bound in 

2012Q2, the same quarter as shown in the March Bluebook.  According to money-

market futures quotes, market participants’ expectations regarding the path of the 

funds rate also were little changed over the intermeeting period (upper-right panel).5 

The lower panel of Chart 8 provides near-term prescriptions from simple policy rules, 

all of which are nearly identical to their counterparts in the March Bluebook.  The two 

variants of the Taylor rule and the two estimated policy rules would keep the federal 

funds rate at its effective lower bound over the next two quarters.  In contrast, the 

first-difference rule is more responsive to the projected pace of economic recovery 

rather than the current level of resource slack and hence prescribes a rising funds rate.

POLICY  ALTERNATIVES
  

This Bluebook presents three policy alternatives—labeled A, B, and C—for the 

Committee’s consideration. The alternatives vary somewhat in their characterization 

of current conditions and the outlook; they also provide different forward guidance 

about the federal funds rate.  The drafts offer paragraphs on reinvestment strategy— 

and in Alternative C, on asset sales—that the FOMC may wish to consider including 

in its statement. Table 1 shows key elements of the alternatives.  Draft statements 

follow the table. Subsequent pages summarize the arguments for each alternative.   

Each of the draft statements begins by noting that economic activity has 

continued to strengthen, that the labor market shows some improvement, and that 

growth in household spending has picked up.  The wording of Alternative A is more 

tentative than that of Alternative B. Alternative C offers the most upbeat summary of 

current conditions by omitting the list of factors that are restraining household 

spending, a list that Alternatives A and B carry over from the March statement.  All 

three alternatives provide a somewhat more positive characterization of economic 

conditions than did the Committee’s March statement, which said the labor market 

was stabilizing and household spending was increasing at a moderate rate.   

The alternatives differ more substantially in their characterization of recent and 

prospective inflation. Alternative B repeats the words of the March statement:  “With 

substantial resource slack continuing to restrain cost pressures and longer-term 

inflation expectations stable, inflation is likely to be subdued for some time.”  

Alternative C highlights recent increases in energy prices but notes that inflation has 

remained subdued. It then states that “The Committee will adjust the stance of 

monetary policy as necessary over time to ensure that longer-term inflation 

expectations remain well anchored and that inflation outcomes are consistent with 



 

 

 

April 22, 2010 Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) 32 of 59

price stability.” Alternative A observes that longer-term inflation expectations have 

been stable but also notes that recent data suggest inflation has been trending down in 

response to substantial resource slack; moreover, Alternative A indicates that the 

Committee expects inflation to remain “quite subdued.”   

Each alternative would maintain the 0 to ¼ percent target range for the federal 

funds rate during the upcoming intermeeting period.  In light of the Committee’s 

implicit judgment at its recent meetings that the costs of purchasing additional longer-

term assets would outweigh the benefits—except perhaps if the economy were to 

weaken—none of the alternatives includes such purchases.  Instead, the alternatives 

provide markedly different forward guidance.  Alternative B says, as in recent FOMC 

statements, that the Committee anticipates that economic conditions “are likely to 

warrant exceptionally low levels of the federal funds rate for an extended period.”  

Alternative C modifies the final words to “for some time,” signaling an earlier increase 

in the funds rate.  Alternative A sharpens the conditionality in the extended period 

language and suggests that an increase in the federal funds rate is likely to come later 

than markets now expect. After observing that inflation has been trending down in 

response to substantial slack, Alternative A says:  “To promote a more robust 

economic recovery in a context of price stability, the Committee anticipates 

maintaining the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to ¼ percent for an 

extended period—until economic conditions such as appreciably higher rates of 

resource utilization, increasing inflation pressures, or rising inflation expectations 

warrant a less accommodative monetary policy.”   

The Desk, at the Committee’s direction, has been pursuing an interim approach 

of rolling over the proceeds of maturing Treasury securities while not reinvesting the 

proceeds of agency debt and MBS that mature or prepay. That practice will, if 

continued, gradually shrink the SOMA portfolio and move it back toward a more 



 

 

 

April 22, 2010 Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) 33 of 59

normal “Treasuries-only” composition. The fourth paragraph of Alternative A (in 

brackets) illustrates language that the Committee might add to its statement if it 

wished to announce a more permanent adoption of that approach.  The fourth 

paragraph of Alternative B (also in brackets) offers a choice between continuing to 

roll over maturing Treasuries or stopping. Policymakers might view a decision to 

maintain the current reinvestment policy as a matter to be noted in the minutes rather 

than in the statement, but they may see a decision to stop reinvesting the proceeds of 

maturing Treasury securities as a change in policy that warrants mention in the 

statement. Or they might prefer to indicate such a decision in the directive.  The 

fourth paragraph of Alternative C (not in brackets) offers language that the 

Committee could use to announce that it will no longer roll over maturing Treasuries 

and that—to further reduce the size of the balance sheet and return it to a more 

normal composition—the Committee anticipates that it will soon begin gradual sales 

of agency debt and MBS. If the statement for this meeting were to include a new 

fourth paragraph on reinvestments and perhaps sales, it would seem natural to move 

the final sentence of the third paragraph (“The Committee will continue to monitor 

the economic outlook and financial developments and will employ its policy tools as 

necessary to promote economic recovery and price stability”) to the end of that new 

paragraph. 

All three draft statements conclude by noting that the TALF, the one remaining 

special liquidity facility, is scheduled to close on June 30 for loans backed by new-issue 

CMBS and that it closed on March 31 for loans backed by all other types of collateral.

March  FOMC  Statement   

1.	 Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in January suggests 
that economic activity has continued to strengthen and that the labor market is 
stabilizing. Household spending is expanding at a moderate rate but remains constrained 
by high unemployment, modest income growth, lower housing wealth, and tight credit. 
Business spending on equipment and software has risen significantly. However, 
investment in nonresidential structures is declining, housing starts have been flat at a 
depressed level, and employers remain reluctant to add to payrolls. While bank lending 
continues to contract, financial market conditions remain supportive of economic 
growth. Although the pace of economic recovery is likely to be moderate for a time, the 
Committee anticipates a gradual return to higher levels of resource utilization in a 
context of price stability.  

2.	 With substantial resource slack continuing to restrain cost pressures and longer-term 
inflation expectations stable, inflation is likely to be subdued for some time.  

3.	 The Committee will maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to 1/4 
percent and continues to anticipate that economic conditions, including low rates of 
resource utilization, subdued inflation trends, and stable inflation expectations, are likely 
to warrant exceptionally low levels of the federal funds rate for an extended period. To 
provide support to mortgage lending and housing markets and to improve overall 
conditions in private credit markets, the Federal Reserve has been purchasing $1.25 
trillion of agency mortgage-backed securities and about $175 billion of agency debt; 
those purchases are nearing completion, and the remaining transactions will be executed 
by the end of this month. The Committee will continue to monitor the economic 
outlook and financial developments and will employ its policy tools as necessary to 
promote economic recovery and price stability.  

4.	 In light of improved functioning of financial markets, the Federal Reserve has been 
closing the special liquidity facilities that it created to support markets during the crisis. 
The only remaining such program, the Term Asset-Backed Securities Loan Facility, is 
scheduled to close on June 30 for loans backed by new-issue commercial mortgage-
backed securities and on March 31 for loans backed by all other types of collateral.

April  FOMC  Statement—Alternative  A  

1.	 Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in March suggests 
that economic activity has continued to strengthen and that the labor market is showing 
signs of improving. Although growth in household spending has picked up 
recently, it is likely to remain constrained by high unemployment, modest income 
growth, lower housing wealth, and tight credit.  Business spending on equipment and 
software has risen significantly; however, investment in nonresidential structures is 
declining and employers remain reluctant to add to payrolls.  Housing starts have edged 
up but remain at a depressed level. While bank lending continues to contract, financial 
market conditions remain supportive of economic growth. 

2.	 Although longer-term inflation expectations have remained stable, recent data 
suggest inflation has been trending down in response to substantial resource slack. 
The Committee anticipates that inflation is likely to be quite subdued for some time. 

3.	 To promote a more robust economic recovery in a context of price stability, the 
Committee anticipates maintaining the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to ¼ 
percent for an extended period—until economic conditions such as appreciably 
higher rates of resource utilization, increasing inflation pressures, or rising inflation 
expectations warrant a less accommodative monetary policy. The Committee will 
continue to monitor the economic outlook and financial developments and will employ 
its policy tools as necessary to promote economic recovery and price stability.   

4.	 [To gradually reduce the size of the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet and return it 
to a more normal composition over time, the Committee will maintain its 
approach of not reinvesting the proceeds of maturing agency debt and payments 
on mortgage-backed securities held by the System Open Market Account.  The 
Committee is continuing to roll over maturing Treasury securities.] 

5.	 In light of improved functioning of financial markets, the Federal Reserve has closed all 
but one of the special liquidity facilities that it created to support markets during the 
crisis. The only remaining such program, the Term Asset-Backed Securities Loan Facility, 
is scheduled to close on June 30 for loans backed by new-issue commercial mortgage-
backed securities; it closed on March 31 for loans backed by all other types of collateral.

April  FOMC  Statement—Alternative  C  

1. 	 Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in March 
indicates that economic activity has continued to strengthen and that the labor market is 
improving. Though investment in nonresidential structures is declining, housing starts 
have edged up, growth in household spending has increased, and business spending 
on equipment and software has risen significantly.  While bank lending continues to 
contract, financial market conditions have become more supportive of economic 
growth. With economic recovery under way, the Committee anticipates a gradual 
return to higher levels of resource utilization. 

2. 	 Although energy prices have risen on balance in recent months, inflation has 
remained subdued. The Committee will adjust the stance of monetary policy as 
necessary over time to ensure that longer-term inflation expectations remain well 
anchored and that inflation outcomes are consistent with price stability. 

3. 	 The Committee will maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to 1/4 
percent and now anticipates that economic conditions, including low rates of resource 
utilization, subdued inflation trends, and stable inflation expectations, are likely to 
warrant exceptionally low levels of the federal funds rate for some time. 

4.	 The Committee will maintain its approach of not reinvesting the proceeds of 
maturing agency debt and payments on mortgage-backed securities held by the 
System Open Market Account.  In addition, on May 3 the Committee will stop 
reinvesting the proceeds of maturing Treasury securities.  To further reduce the 
size of the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet, and to return the balance sheet to a 
more normal composition, the Committee anticipates that it will soon begin 
gradual sales of agency debt and mortgage-backed securities.  The timing and 
pace of such sales will depend on evolving economic and financial conditions. 
The Committee will continue to monitor the economic outlook and financial 
developments and will employ its policy tools as necessary to promote economic 
recovery and price stability. 

5.	 In light of improved functioning of financial markets, the Federal Reserve has closed all 
but one of the special liquidity facilities that it created to support markets during the 
crisis. The only remaining such program, the Term Asset-Backed Securities Loan Facility, 
is scheduled to close on June 30 for loans backed by new-issue commercial mortgage-
backed securities; it closed on March 31 for loans backed by all other types of collateral.

THE  CASE  FOR  ALTERNATIVE  B  

If policymakers expect the pace of economic recovery to be moderate and 

inflation to be subdued for some time, as they did at the time of the Committee’s 

March meeting, and if they still judge that the potential benefits of further purchases 

of longer-term assets would not outweigh the costs, then they might choose to 

maintain the current target range for the federal funds rate and reiterate that economic 

conditions are likely to warrant exceptionally low levels of the federal funds rate for 

an extended period, as in Alternative B. 

FOMC participants may see economic and financial developments during the 

intermeeting period as broadly consistent with their assessments of the outlook at the 

time of the March meeting; they, like the staff, may have made only modest revisions 

to their forecasts for economic activity and inflation.  Nonetheless, recent data on 

nonfarm payrolls and consumer spending, in combination with indications that some 

banks have begun to reverse the extraordinary tightening of lending standards 

implemented during the past three years, may have given policymakers somewhat 

greater assurance that the recovery will be sustained and that private demand will 

grow at a rate sufficient to generate a gradual decline in unemployment going forward.  

Policymakers may, however, continue to anticipate that elevated unemployment, tight 

credit conditions for small businesses and many households, and waning fiscal 

stimulus will weigh on growth of aggregate demand over coming quarters.  In line 

with such an outlook, both of the Greenbook-consistent measures of short-run r* 

shown in Chart 6 indicate that a real federal funds rate at least as low as the current 

level of -1.2 percent would be required to close the output gap in three years. 

Recent readings on inflation and inflation expectations may have strengthened 

participants’ confidence that inflation will remain subdued for some time and reduced 

their concerns that expected inflation might rise appreciably.  Core PCE inflation has 



 

 

April 22, 2010 Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) 40 of 59

trended lower in recent months, and growth in both hourly compensation and the 

employment cost index slowed substantially during 2009, consistent with the view that  

substantial resource slack is continuing to reduce cost pressures.  The median of the 

Reuters/Michigan survey of longer-term inflation expectations is noticeably lower 

than its level at any time from the spring of 2005 through the fall of 2008 and remains 

close to the lower ends of its historical range.   

Reflecting subdued inflation as well as sizable resource slack, the two versions of 

the Taylor rule shown in Chart 8, along with the outcome-based rule and the forecast-

based rule, prescribe a substantially negative nominal federal funds rate for the current 

quarter and next quarter, with the constrained prescriptions of these rules remaining 

at the effective lower bound.  Participants may see retaining the extended period 

language as consistent with these prescriptions.   

Even if some policymakers remain worried that inflation expectations could rise 

in response to continued highly accommodative monetary conditions, they may see 

risk management considerations as supporting a reiteration of the extended period 

forward guidance. The effective lower bound on the funds rate could bind severely if 

a move toward tighter policy proved premature and led to a substantial deterioration 

in the economic outlook. In contrast, with considerable economic slack prevailing, 

and with inflation below levels deemed appropriate over the longer run, participants 

might be reasonably confident that in the event of a surprisingly rapid economic 

recovery or a surge in inflation expectations, they could firm policy sufficiently quickly 

to avoid a significant runup in actual inflation.   

Some participants may see the outlook for moderate growth, a gradual decline in 

unemployment, and subdued inflation as arguing not only for keeping the federal 

funds rate at exceptionally low levels but also for caution in shrinking the Federal 



 

 

April 22, 2010 Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) 41 of 59

Reserve’s balance sheet and the supply of reserve balances.  If so, they may judge it 

appropriate to continue rolling over maturing Treasury securities, at least for the time 

being, while allowing redemptions and prepayments on agency debt and MBS to 

gradually reduce the share of such securities in the SOMA portfolio.  Other 

participants may judge that greater confidence about the economic outlook offers an 

opportunity to shrink the balance sheet and the supply of reserve balances somewhat 

more rapidly, by not reinvesting the proceeds of maturing Treasuries, even if they 

expect that economic conditions will warrant an exceptionally low federal funds rate 

for an extended period. Also, they may see some benefit from allowing the quantity 

of Treasury coupon securities in the SOMA portfolio to decline in coming years 

because doing so could facilitate a subsequent shift toward short-term Treasuries once 

the portfolio shrinks enough that Treasury purchases resume.  Alternative B offers a 

choice between the two approaches. As noted earlier, the Committee might conclude 

that the statement should contain neither version of the fourth paragraph of 

alternative B; policymakers may judge it better to communicate reinvestment policy in 

the minutes or in the directive. 

Language along the lines of that proposed in Alternative B—if it did not include 

an announcement that the Committee will stop reinvesting the proceeds of maturing 

Treasury securities—probably would result in little change in bond yields, equity 

prices, or the foreign exchange value of the dollar.  The Desk’s recent survey of 

primary dealers indicates that they do not anticipate changes in the federal funds rate 

target or in the Committee’s forward policy guidance at this meeting, though half 

expect a more positive characterization of current economic conditions.  The dealers 

see a near-zero probability that the Committee will increase its target for the federal 

funds rate this quarter; they see substantial probabilities (ranging from 15 to 25 

percent) that the first increase in the funds rate will occur during each of the next four 

quarters. Market quotes are broadly consistent with the Desk’s survey:  Money 



 

                                           

 

6 Figures provided by the Desk show that allowing all maturing Treasury securities to roll off 
beginning in May 2010 would reduce the Federal Reserve’s holdings by $60 billion in 2010, 
another $70 billion in 2011, and a total of $435 billion through 2015—an average decline of 
$6.4 billion per month. 

April 22, 2010 Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) 42 of 59

 

 

 

market futures indicate that the expected federal funds rate remains below 25 basis 

points until the fourth quarter of this year and rises to 50 basis points during the first 

quarter of next year; interest rate caps suggest that investors place high odds on the 

first increase in the funds rate occurring during the fourth quarter of 2010 or first 

quarter of 2011. 

  The size of the market reaction to an announcement that the Federal Reserve 

will no longer roll over maturing Treasuries is difficult to judge.  That move would 

come as a surprise: On average, dealers see a probability of roughly one-third that the 

Committee will, by the middle of this year, stop reinvesting the proceeds of some or 

all maturing Treasury securities, and a probability of one-half that the Federal Reserve 

will stop reinvesting the proceeds of at least some maturing Treasuries by mid-2011.  

The direct effect on yields of a decision to stop rolling over maturing Treasury 

securities could be modest because the resulting increase in the amount of long-term 

debt held by the public, though sizable, would not be all that large relative to the 

projected stock. Moreover, the increase would be fairly gradual.6  However, the 

increase in yields resulting from this step could be considerably greater if investors 

inferred that the FOMC had embarked on a path leading to an earlier-than-expected 

onset of policy firming or to asset sales, or if investors became more uncertain about 

the likelihood of future asset sales; either outcome could result in larger term 

premiums. In addition, allowing maturing Treasuries to roll off would reduce the 

SOMA’s holdings of on-the-run securities and thereby limit the ability of the Desk’s 

securities-lending program to address market pressures. 



 

 

 

April 22, 2010 Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) 43 of 59

THE  CASE  FOR  ALTERNATIVE  C  

If policymakers are confident that a sustainable economic recovery is now  

under way and see substantial upside risks to the medium-term inflation outlook—or  

significant risks that financial imbalances could emerge—in the absence of prompt 

monetary policy adjustments, then they might choose to issue a statement such as that 

proposed in Alternative C. In particular, if participants anticipate that it might well be 

appropriate to begin removing policy accommodation this summer, they may prefer 

to modify the forward guidance now to indicate that exceptionally low levels of the 

funds rate are likely to be warranted “for some time” rather than “for an extended 

period.” This change would suggest that the Committee will begin moving to a less 

accommodative stance of monetary policy sooner than markets now appear to expect. 

In addition, policymakers may judge it important to indicate that the Federal Reserve 

will shrink its balance sheet not only by allowing maturing assets to run off but also by 

gradually selling agency debt and MBS.   

Policymakers may expect the pace of recovery over coming quarters—in the 

housing sector and in the economy more broadly—to be determined largely by the 

speed of structural adjustments and see a substantial risk that attempting to accelerate 

the economic recovery by keeping the real funds rate well below zero for much longer 

would result primarily in higher expected and hence actual inflation.  To the extent 

that policymakers see inflation outcomes as linked mainly to expected inflation rather 

than to resource slack, they may view the level of forward inflation compensation, 

which remains near 3 percent, and the continuing dispersion in professional 

forecasters’ longer-run inflation projections, as worrisome indicators that inflation 

expectations may not be firmly anchored.  If so, participants might see prompt policy 

firming, and an announcement that the Federal Reserve will shrink its balance sheet 

by selling assets, as necessary to reduce the risk of outcomes in which inflation 



 

 

 

April 22, 2010 Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) 44 of 59

expectations become unhinged. Such steps could be seen by the public as reinforcing 

the Federal Reserve’s commitment to low and stable inflation, and thus could help 

keep inflation expectations well anchored.  Moreover, policymakers may judge that 

the Federal Reserve’s support for housing finance is no longer necessary or warranted 

and see gradual sales of MBS as likely to reduce distortions in that market.   

In addition, in light of the extraordinarily high level of excess reserves held by the 

banking system and indications that banks might be starting to ease credit standards, 

participants may have become more concerned about the possibility of a brisk 

turnaround in lending and resulting rapid growth in broad monetary aggregates that 

could put significant upward pressure on inflation.  Furthermore, some may judge 

that the current very accommodative stance of policy risks allowing financial 

imbalances to build, potentially leading to another boom-bust credit cycle.  Even if 

the probabilities of such outcomes are judged to be low, the possible adverse 

consequences might be seen as sufficiently severe to warrant a tightening of financial 

conditions. For these reasons, policymakers may want to signal an earlier increase in 

the federal funds rate than investors currently anticipate and ensure a noticeable 

reduction in the supply of reserve balances over coming quarters.  To increase the rate 

at which the supply of reserve balances will decline, policymakers might consider it 

appropriate to immediately stop reinvesting the proceeds of maturing Treasury 

securities held by the SOMA and to begin selling agency debt and MBS in the near 

future. If so, they may choose to announce those decisions—and the reasons for the 

decisions—by issuing a statement like that in Alternative C. 

The adoption of Alternative C would surprise financial market participants, who 

appear to expect only small changes in the statement at this meeting, in part because 

the minutes of the FOMC’s March meeting emphasized the conditionality and 

flexibility of the existing language and noted that it would not limit the Committee’s 



 

 

 

 

 

 

April 22, 2010 Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) 45 of 59

ability to commence monetary policy tightening promptly if necessary.  Investors 

likely would read the shift to “for some time” as a signal that the FOMC intends to 

begin firming policy considerably sooner than markets currently expect.   

An announcement that the Committee will no longer roll over maturing Treasury 

securities, and soon will begin to sell agency debt and MBS, also would surprise most 

of the primary dealers and likely the markets as well.  As noted earlier, dealers see a 

probability of roughly one-third that the Committee will stop reinvesting the proceeds 

of some or all maturing Treasury securities by the middle of 2010, and a probability of 

one-half that it will do so by mid-2011.  The dealer survey also asked respondents to 

report their perceptions of the probability that the Federal Reserve would conduct 

asset sales during the next two years and the next five years.  The median reported 

probability of sales during the next two years is about 20 percent.  But the median 

probability of sales at some time during the next five years is 50 percent for agency 

debt and 75 percent for MBS.   

Thus the adoption of Alternative C would surprise investors on several fronts.  

Investors likely would read the statement of Alternative C as signaling earlier policy 

firming than they had previously anticipated and hence short-term interest rates would 

increase. Intermediate- and longer-term yields would rise as well, perhaps 

substantially. Indeed, in response to another question in the Desk’s survey, dealers 

indicated their expectation that, abstracting from any signal that sales would convey 

about future monetary policy, Federal Reserve sales of MBS at a pace of $150 billion 

per year would push up the current coupon yield on MBS by about 40 basis points 

and would raise the yield on 10-year Treasury notes by about 25 basis points.  

Forward measures of inflation compensation might decline if investors became less 

concerned about risks to the longer-term inflation outlook.  Equity prices likely would 

fall, and the dollar appreciate. 



 

 

 

April 22, 2010 Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) 46 of 59

THE  CASE  FOR  ALTERNATIVE  A  

Policymakers’ primary concern may be that, for the next several years, 

unemployment will remain well above, and inflation well below, the levels they see as 

most consistent with their dual mandate.  Accordingly, they may judge that not only is 

the federal funds rate likely to remain exceptionally low for an extended period, but 

that, as in the staff forecast, economic conditions are likely to make it appropriate to 

keep the funds rate at or close to its current level for an appreciably longer period 

than markets currently appear to expect.  If so, policymakers may want to issue a 

statement like that in Alternative A in an effort to bring market expectations for the 

federal funds rate into closer alignment with their own.   

Participants may see the simulations of constrained and unconstrained optimal 

monetary policy depicted in Chart 7 of the Bluebook as supporting the conclusion 

that increased monetary stimulus would be desirable and that, in the absence of 

additional stimulus, the funds rate will need to remain at its effective lower bound 

longer than markets currently appear to anticipate.  Moreover, recent progress in 

developing tools for draining reserve balances may have given participants greater 

confidence that the Committee would be able to reduce the supply of reserve balances 

quickly and by a substantial amount if doing so were to become necessary.   

Policymakers might perceive an even stronger case for keeping the funds rate at 

its effective lower bound longer than markets now think likely if their assessment of 

the outlook is substantially weaker than that of the staff or if they judge the risks to 

economic activity or inflation to be tilted predominantly to the downside.  They may 

note, for example, that the Greenbook forecast for output growth is on the high side 

of private forecasts. Participants may be concerned that the recovery of the labor 

market will be less rapid than projected in the Greenbook, and that slower job growth 

would contribute to tepid growth in household spending, perhaps along the lines of 



 

 

 

April 22, 2010 Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) 47 of 59

 

the “Jobless Recovery” alternative scenario in the Greenbook.  Moreover, low and 

declining readings on core inflation in recent months may have underscored 

participants’ concerns about downside risks to price stability.  While the staff assumes 

that inflation expectations will remain steady, and thus projects that core inflation will 

be essentially constant at a rate just below 1 percent over the next two years, 

participants may assign a higher probability to alternative scenarios—such as the 

Greenbook’s “Greater Disinflation” scenario—in which persistently large resource 

slack weighs more heavily on expected inflation and labor compensation and hence 

generates stronger downward pressure on prices.  If policymakers see a significant risk  

of such outcomes, they may judge it appropriate to signal, as in Alternative A, that 

monetary policy will remain unusually accommodative until measures of resource 

utilization increase appreciably or inflation pressures rise. 

To reinforce that signal, policymakers might decide to announce that they plan to 

continue on a more permanent basis the practice of reinvesting the proceeds of 

maturing Treasury securities even as they allow the System’s holdings of agency debt 

and MBS to run off over time. If so, they could include paragraph 4 of Alternative A 

in the statement. 

A statement like Alternative A—with or without paragraph 4—would come as a 

surprise to financial market participants, who appear to anticipate only minor 

updating of the language. Short- and intermediate-term interest rates would fall as 

investors lengthened the horizon over which they expect the federal funds rate to 

remain at exceptionally low levels. However, any potential decline in longer-term 

yields might be offset by an increase in inflation compensation if the Committee’s 

statement undermined investors’ confidence in a timely exit from the period of 

exceptionally accommodative monetary policy.  Equity prices would probably rise, 

while the foreign exchange value of the dollar would likely fall.   



 

 

April 22, 2010 Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) 48 of 59

 

DEBT,  BANK  CREDIT,  AND  MONEY  FORECASTS 
 

The staff projects that domestic nonfinancial sector debt will expand at an annual 

rate of about 6¾ percent in the second quarter of 2010, reflecting rapid growth in 

government debt and a modest expansion in private-sector debt. Over 2010 and 

2011, domestic nonfinancial sector debt is expected to grow at an average annual rate 

of about 5½ percent; federal government debt is projected to increase at a substantial 

pace over this period—though more slowly than in the current quarter—but 

household and business borrowing is expected to be modest.  Household debt is 

projected to edge up in the second quarter of 2010 and expand only slowly thereafter, 

with house prices remaining about flat and households deleveraging.  Standards on 

bank lending are projected to ease only gradually, and loan charge-off rates, which 

subtract directly from reported loan growth, are likely to remain elevated for some 

time. The debt of nonfinancial businesses is expected to grow modestly in the current 

quarter and throughout the forecast period, despite a projected increase in investment 

outlays, as large cash balances and solid profits limit firms’ needs for external funds.  

Although federal government debt is projected to expand rapidly through 2010 and 

2011, state and local government debt is expected to increase only moderately, with 

fiscal pressures limiting spending on new capital projects.  

Commercial bank credit is expected to contract at an annual rate of about            

3 percent in the second quarter of 2010, and to decline 1 percent over the year as a 

whole. Declines in most categories of lending for 2010 are expected to be only 

partially offset by increases in securities holdings.  C&I loans are projected to contract 

through the third quarter of 2010, reflecting tight lending standards that have only 

begun to ease slightly and subdued demand for bank loans from nonfinancial firms.   

Real estate loans are expected to decline throughout 2010 due to weak fundamentals, 

tight lending standards, and rising delinquency and charge-off rates for commercial 



 

 

 

 

 

April 22, 2010 Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) 49 of 59

real estate loans, as well as continued strains in residential housing markets.  

Consumer loans are projected to run off through the second quarter, but then rise 

over the remainder of the forecast period, buoyed by robust spending on consumer 

durables. Total bank loans are expected to resume growth by the fourth quarter of 

this year, and commercial bank credit is projected to expand at about a 4½ percent 

annual rate in 2011.  

The staff anticipates that M2 growth will gradually rise from near zero in the 

current quarter to roughly 4¼ percent at an annual rate by 2011.  Throughout the 

forecast period, M2 is projected to expand at a slower pace than nominal GDP as the 

safe-haven flows generated by the financial crisis unwind, and as the opportunity cost 

of holding M2 assets rises along with short term interest rates in 2011.  Liquid 

deposits are expected to expand rapidly in both 2010 and 2011.  However, some of 

this increase will likely reflect a reallocation from other M2 assets, including small time 

deposits and retail money market mutual funds.  Both of these components of M2 are 

expected to continue to decline through 2011, though the pace of that decline should 

moderate. Currency is also predicted to slow from its robust 2009 pace as 

precautionary holdings continue to unwind. 

The staff projects that the monetary base will expand, on net, into the third 

quarter of this year as the last of the LSAP purchases settle.  Over that period, 

however, monthly growth rates of the base are expected to be volatile due to the 

effects on reserve balances of swings in the Treasury’s account at the Federal Reserve.    

The monetary base is projected to contract over the remainder of the forecast period, 

as securities in the SOMA portfolio mature or are prepaid.  The contraction in reserve 

balances over the projection period swamps the moderate increase expected for 

currency.

DIRECTIVE 
 

Draft language for an April directive corresponding to each of the alternatives 

follows the March directive shown on the next page.  In each case, the April directive 

drops the sentence that instructs the Desk to complete the execution of purchases of 

agency debt and MBS but retains the authorization to engage in dollar roll 

transactions to facilitate the settlement of transactions.  The directive for Alternative 

A directs the Desk to not reinvest the proceeds of maturing agency debt and 

payments on agency MBS. With no instruction to the contrary, the Desk would 

continue the standing practice of rolling over maturing Treasury securities.  The 

directive for Alternative C directs the Desk to not reinvest the proceeds of maturing 

Treasury and agency debt as well as payments on MBS.  Alternative C does not direct 

the Desk to begin asset sales during the intermeeting period, so the directive for 

Alternative C does not mention asset sales. The directive for Alterative B offers the 

option of directing the Desk to not reinvest the proceeds of agency debt and MBS, or 

to not reinvest the proceeds of Treasury as well as agency securities.

APRIL  2010  FOMC  DIRECTIVE  —  ALTERNATIVE  C  

The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and financial conditions 

that will foster price stability and promote sustainable growth in output.  To further 

its long-run objectives, the Committee seeks conditions in reserve markets consistent 

with federal funds trading in a range from 0 to ¼ percent.  The Committee directs the 

Desk to engage in dollar roll transactions as necessary to facilitate settlement of the 

Federal Reserve’s agency MBS transactions. To gradually reduce the size of the 

Federal Reserve’s balance sheet over time, the Committee directs the Desk to 

not reinvest the proceeds of maturing Treasury and agency debt and payments 

on mortgage-backed securities held by the System Open Market Account.  The 

System Open Market Account Manager and the Secretary will keep the Committee 

informed of ongoing developments regarding the System’s balance sheet that could 

affect the attainment over time of the Committee’s objectives of maximum 

employment and price stability. 



   

 
 

  

 

 

 

 

Measure Description 

Single-
equation 

Model 

The measure of the equilibrium real rate in the single-equation model is based on an 
estimated aggregate-demand relationship between the current value of the output gap and its 
lagged values as well as the lagged values of the real federal funds rate. 

Small 
Structural 

Model 

The small-scale model of the economy consists of equations for six variables: the output 
gap, the equity premium, the federal budget surplus, the trend growth rate of output, the real 
bond yield, and the real federal funds rate. 

EDO 
Model 

Estimates of the equilibrium real rate using EDO—an estimated dynamic-stochastic­
general-equilibrium (DSGE) model of the U.S. economy—depend on data for major 
spending categories, price and wages, and the federal funds rate as well as the model’s 
structure and estimate of the output gap. 

FRB/US 
Model 

Estimates of the equilibrium real rate using FRB/US—the staff’s large-scale econometric 
model of the U.S. economy—depend on a very broad array of economic factors, some of 
which take the form of projected values of the model’s exogenous variables. 

Greenbook-
consistent 

Two measures are presented—based on the FRB/US and the EDO models.  Both models 
are matched to the extended Greenbook forecast.  Model simulations determine the value of 
the real federal funds rate that closes the output gap conditional on the extended baseline. 

TIPS-based 
Factor 
Model 

Yields on TIPS (Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities) reflect investors’ expectations of 
the future path of real interest rates.  The TIPS-based measure of the equilibrium real rate is 
constructed using the seven-year-ahead instantaneous real forward rate derived from TIPS 
yields as of the Bluebook publication date.  This forward rate is adjusted to remove 
estimates of the term and liquidity premiums based on a three-factor arbitrage-free term-
structure model applied to TIPS yields, nominal yields, and inflation.

APPENDIX  A:   MEASURES  OF  THE  EQUILIBRIUM  REAL  RATE
  

The equilibrium real rate is the real federal funds rate that, if maintained, would be projected to 
return output to its potential level over time. The short-run equilibrium rate is defined as the rate 
that would close the output gap in twelve quarters given the corresponding model’s projection of 
the economy.  The medium-run concept is the value of the real federal funds rate projected to keep 
output at potential in seven years, under the assumption that monetary policy acts to bring actual 
and potential output into line in the short run and then keeps them equal thereafter.  The TIPS-
based factor model measure provides an estimate of market expectations for the real federal funds 
rate seven years ahead. 

The actual real federal funds rate is constructed as the difference between the nominal rate and 
realized inflation, where the nominal rate is measured as the quarterly average of the observed 
federal funds rate, and realized inflation is given by the log difference between the core PCE price 
index and its lagged value four quarters earlier. If the upcoming FOMC meeting falls early in the 
quarter, the lagged inflation measure ends in the last quarter.  For the current quarter, the nominal 
rate is specified as the target federal funds rate on the Bluebook publication date.

Estimates of the real federal funds rate depend on the proxies for expected inflation used.  The table 
below shows estimated real federal funds rates based on lagged core PCE inflation, the definition 
used in the Equilibrium Real Federal Funds Rate chart; lagged four-quarter headline PCE inflation; 
and projected four-quarter headline PCE inflation beginning with the next quarter.  For each 
estimate of the real rate, the table also provides the Greenbook-consistent FRB/US-based measure 
of the short-run equilibrium real rate and the average actual real federal funds rate over the next 
twelve quarters.

APPENDIX B:  ANALYSIS OF POLICY PATHS AND CONFIDENCE INTERVALS 

RULE SPECIFICATIONS
For the following rules, it denotes the federal funds rate for quarter t, while the explanatory variables 
include the staff’s projection of trailing four-quarter core PCE inflation (πt), inflation two and three 
quarters ahead (πt+2|t and πt+3|t), the output gap in the current period and one quarter ahead ( y y *t t−  
and y y− *t t+ +1| t t1| ), and the three-quarter-ahead forecast of annual average GDP growth relative to 
potential (∆4 4y y− ∆ * π *t t+ +3| t t3| ), and  denotes an assumed value of policymakers’ long-run inflation 
objective.  The outcome-based and forecast-based rules were estimated using real-time data over the 
sample 1988:1-2006:4; each specification was chosen using the Bayesian information criterion. Each 
rule incorporates a 75 basis point shift in the intercept, specified as a sequence of 25 basis point 
increments during the first three quarters of 1998.  The first two simple rules were proposed by 
Taylor (1993, 1999).  The prescriptions of the first-difference rule do not depend on assumptions 
regarding r* or the level of the output gap; see Orphanides (2003).

FRB/US MODEL SIMULATIONS  
Prescriptions from the two empirical rules are computed using dynamic simulations of the FRB/US 
model, implemented as though the rule were followed starting at this FOMC meeting.  The dotted 
line labeled “Previous Bluebook” is based on the current specification of the policy rule, applied to 
the previous Greenbook projection.  Confidence intervals are based on stochastic simulations of the 
FRB/US model with shocks drawn from the estimated residuals over 1969-2008.  

INFORMATION FROM FINANCIAL MARKETS  
The expected funds rate path is based on Eurodollar quotes and implied three-month forward rates 
from swaps, and the confidence intervals for this path are constructed using prices of interest rate 
caps.  

NEAR-TERM PRESCRIPTIONS OF SIMPLE POLICY RULES  
These prescriptions are calculated using Greenbook projections for inflation and the output gap. 
Because the first-difference rule involves the lagged funds rate, the value labeled “Previous 
Bluebook” for the current quarter is computed using the actual value of the lagged funds rate, and 
the one-quarter-ahead prescriptions are based on this rule’s prescription for the current quarter.
