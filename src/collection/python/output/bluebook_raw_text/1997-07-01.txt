Prefatory Note 

 
 

The attached document represents the most complete and accurate version 
available based on original copies culled from the files of the FOMC Secretariat at the 
Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System.  This electronic document was 
created through a comprehensive digitization process which included identifying the best-
preserved paper copies, scanning those copies,1 and then making the scanned versions 
text-searchable.2  Though a stringent quality assurance process was employed, some 
imperfections may remain. 
 

Please note that this document may contain occasional gaps in the text.  These 
gaps are the result of a redaction process that removed information obtained on a 
confidential basis.  All redacted passages are exempt from disclosure under applicable

1 In some cases, original copies needed to be photocopied before being scanned into electronic format.  All 
scanned images were deskewed (to remove the effects of printer- and scanner-introduced tilting) and lightly 
cleaned (to remove dark spots caused by staple holes, hole punches, and other blemishes caused after initial 
printing). 
2 A two-step process was used.  An advanced optimal character recognition computer program (OCR) first 
created electronic text from the document image.  Where the OCR results were inconclusive, staff checked 
and corrected the text as necessary.   Please note that the numbers and text in charts and tables were not

MONETARY POLICY ALTERNATIVES

Recent Developments

(1) Since the Committee meeting on May 20, the federal funds rate has averaged

near its unchanged intended level of 5-1/2 percent. Most other market interest rates declined,

on balance, apparently in response to incoming data suggesting that growth of final demand

was slowing markedly in the current quarter and inflation was remaining well-contained

(Chart 1). Private short-term rates dropped 5 to 15 basis points; rates on Treasury bills,

however, fell more as bills continued to be paid down in volume in response to robust federal

tax receipts. Futures rates for federal funds and Eurodollars now suggest that the likelihood

that markets had attached to additional near-term System tightening at the time of the May

meeting has evaporated; indeed, markets seem to anticipate that policy is likely to be on hold

well into next year and perhaps beyond.

(2) Rates on intermediate- and longer-term instruments declined about 15 to 25

basis points, with forward rates dropping noticeably all along the yield curve. The view that

a downshift in inflation expectations-perhaps precipitated by a string of consistently good

inflation readings--contributed to this decline is supported by the considerable narrowing over

the intermeeting period of the spread between nominal interest rates and the rate on the

Treasury's indexed note. The narrowing in that spread also may reflect a reduction in

uncertainty about future inflation and, hence, the size of the inflation risk premium embedded

in nominal rates--a notion consistent with the sizable drop in the implied volatility of note and

bond yields in recent months. These developments were, on net, quite positive for equity

markets, which moved up sharply on balance over the intermeeting period to reach record

levels.

(3) The dollar's weighted-average exchange value appreciated about 2/3 percent,

on balance, over the intermeeting period even though U.S. long-term rates fell by more than

the average of foreign long-term rates; the latter declined 15 basis points. The dollar

appreciated more than 1-1/2 percent against the DM and most other continental European

currencies in response to a growing perception in the market that none of the major European

countries will be able to comply strictly with the Maastricht deficit criterion--implying that if

EMU goes forward, it will be with a broad group of countries. The market apparently

believes that a broad EMU, and one that might place a bit greater emphasis on reducing

unemployment given the results of the French election, will be less committed to the

monetary discipline required for price stability. The dollar declined 1 percent against the yen

amid growing market focus on recent and prospective increases in Japan's current account

surplus. Short-term interest rates in most industrial countries were little changed over the

intermeeting period. Short-term rates moved up in the United Kingdom and Canada after the

newly independent Bank of England increased its repo rate by 1/4 percentage point and the

Bank of Canada raised its bank rate by the same amount. Italian short-term rates are

expected to fall next week after the Bank of Italy announced late today that it would cut both

its discount and Lombard rates by 50 basis points effective next Monday.

(4) Broad money grew moderately this month. M2 is estimated to have increased

at a 4-1/4 percent rate in June after expanding at a subdued pace over April and May. From

the fourth quarter of last year through June, M2 grew at a 4-3/4 percent rate, placing it just a

bit below the 5 percent upper bound of its annual range. This outcome is about in line with

that envisioned by the staff at the time of the February Committee meeting, despite what is

now expected to be considerably more rapid nominal income growth than had been projected.

The velocity of M2 was apparently up about 1 percent at an annual rate in the first half of the

year--although M2's opportunity cost was little changed--perhaps because the substantial flows

into equity mutual funds included some savings that would have been in M2. Still, this is a

relatively small increase in velocity, and the relationship between M2 velocity and its

opportunity cost re-established over the last couple of years appears to remain broadly intact.

M3 is estimated to have increased at a 3-1/2 percent pace in June, down from the 5-1/4 per-

cent average rate in April and May. Rapid M3 growth over most of the first half of the

year--associated with robust expansion of bank credit, paydowns of liabilities to foreign

offices with proceeds from large time deposit issuance, and rapid growth in MMMFs--left M3

in June 3/4 percentage point above the 6 percent upper bound of its range, in line with the

staffs expectation in February.

(5) Private debt growth has picked up in recent months, reflecting greater credit

demands and continuing favorable supply conditions for the business sector. Debt of the

household sector, though still growing more rapidly than disposable income, has continued to

expand at the more moderate rate established in the final months of last year. With the

strengthening in the expansion of nonfederal debt, total debt growth has edged up in recent

months despite a marked slowing in its federal component. Domestic nonfinancial debt grew

at a 4-3/4 percent annual rate from the fourth quarter of last year through May, near the

middle of its annual range.

Longer-Term Strategies

(6) This section provides a longer-term perspective on several strategic issues

confronting the Committee. With the Greenbook forecast of unemployment throughout 1998

a percentage point below the staffs working assumption for the NAIRU, inflation would be

expected to be on a rising trajectory into 1999. In light of this outlook, we first present

alternative strategies, derived using the staffs econometric model, that the Committee could

select for containing or reducing inflation in the medium term. Second, because the news on

both inflation and unemployment has been better than the staff anticipated, we present a

model simulation in which the NAIRU is substantially lower than the staff's present

assessment. Third, we use the staff model to gauge four specific rules for conducting

monetary policy, each of which embeds a long-run inflation objective in a monetary policy

reaction function that also pays attention to variations in output.

(7) The first and second exercises are based on Greenbook assumptions through

1998 and judgmental extensions beyond. Specifically, we assume that the federal budget

comes into balance by early in the next decade and that the chronic current account deficit

puts downward pressure on the dollar. In addition, except in the scenario where we adjust it

lower, we assume that the NAIRU is 5.6 percent. In the staff model, the sacrifice ratio over

five years is about 2; that is, a 1 percentage point reduction in inflation can be achieved only

by pushing the unemployment rate above the NAIRU by the equivalent of about 2 percentage

point for one year.

(8) The baseline scenario, shown by the solid lines in Chart 2, is the Greenbook

forecast through 1998, extended for subsequent years using the staff model with limited

judgmental adjustments. With inflation on an upward track in early 1999, the Committee

picks up the pace of its tightening actions, but avoids inducing an outright recession.1 The

nominal funds rate is moved up to 7 percent by mid-1999. As a result, when the unemploy-

ment rate rises to the NAIRU two years later, consumer price inflation levels off at a little

more than 3 percent. The real federal funds rate settles at about 3.3 percent. This real funds

rate is near the levels of the past two or three years, which in the staff view have been

associated with a build-up of pressures on resources. However, it is consistent with output at

its potential and steady inflation in the out years because the imposition of fiscal restraint

through 2002 and the appreciable decline in equity prices over the next few years restrain

aggregate demand.

(9) The stable inflation strategy limits the near-term increase in inflation in the

Greenbook forecast and ultimately brings it back to near its currently prevailing rate. This

scenario--which is plotted by the dotted lines and extends the "tighter" alternative in the

Greenbook--entails raising the federal funds rate to about 6-3/4 percent by the middle of 1998

and maintaining that level for a little more than a year. While the unemployment rate

1 In the charts, inflation is measured by the core PCE chain-weight price index, and
past movements in this index are used to proxy for inflation expectations in converting
nominal to real interest rates. Core PCE inflation increases a few tenths more than broader
GDP measures of inflation over the next several years. We feel core PCE gives a reasonably
clear view of the underlying inflation tendencies, though it may not accurately depict inflation
expectations and thus may tend to distort the profile of real rates shown in the charts. In
particular, core PCE inflation has a more pronounced increase over the next several years than
do broader GDP measures of inflation. In the simulation results, the model relies on a more
complex calculation of expected inflation to derive real rates.

remains below the NAIRU for a time, inflation is damped in the near term both by the

strengthening foreign exchange value of the dollar and by falling inflation expectations

over the short run associated with slower economic growth and tighter monetary policy.

Eventually, though, the unemployment rate will have to be kept above the NAIRU for a while

to offset the inflationary momentum imparted by the economy operating above its potential

from 1996 through 1999.

(10) The third strategy--shown by the dashed line in Chart 2--is designed to achieve

price stability within seven years or so. Price stability is defined here as an inflation rate

slightly less than 1 percent, consistent with the staffs estimate of measurement error.2 To

achieve this objective, the Committee would need to boost the nominal funds rate to 7 percent

by early 1998 and hold it there for a couple of years. Although the nominal funds rate under

this scenario never exceeds its level under the stable-inflation scenario by more than 50 basis

points, the gap between the two real rate trajectories is temporarily as wide as 100 basis

points. The unemployment rate remains noticeably above the NAIRU for most of the

simulation period.3

(11) The recent behavior of inflation raises the possibility that the NAIRU could be

considerably below the current staff estimate of 5.6 percent. Chart 3 compares the baseline

discussed above (the solid lines) with a situation in which the NAIRU has been and will

remain at 4-3/4 percent (the dotted lines). In that circumstance, the equilibrium real federal

inflation on to the level or growth of potential output.

funds rate would be lower than in the baseline because the economy could support a higher

level of production and spending on a sustained basis. Under this reading of labor-market

conditions, the recent level of the real funds rate is near its equilibrium, and holding the

nominal federal funds rate at its current level would contain inflation.

(12) The remainder of this section evaluates the performance of four explicit policy

rules or Federal Reserve reaction functions. Our method of evaluating these rules is not tied

to the Greenbook projection; instead, it involves subjecting the staff econometric model to a

series of "shocks"--that is, economic developments unexplained by the model equations. For

these "stochastic simulations," we randomly draw from the shocks the economy has

experienced over the last thirty years.

(13) All of the rules set the nominal funds rate in terms of inflation and the output

gap, but the nature and strength of the responses vary across the rules, as shown in the table.

One rule we study was proposed by John Taylor. In this rule, the prescribed nominal federal

funds rate is calculated as the sum of an estimated equilibrium real federal funds rate, plus

the most recent four-quarter rate of inflation, plus half the difference between the actual

inflation rate over the most recent four quarters and the long-run inflation target (1 percent in

our exercise), plus half the percentage difference between actual and potential output.4

4 In algebraic terms, the rule is given by:

i = r+ nt- + 0.5[it-I - ' ] + .5(t-Q )'

where i is the nominal federal funds rate, r* is the equilibrium real funds rate, it is the
four-quarter rate of inflation, and Q-Q* is the output gap in percentage terms.

3. Percentage point deviation of inflation from upper or lower end of opportunistic or target zone.

(14) A second rule we examine was proposed by Henderson and McKibbin. 5 It

has the same form as the Taylor rule, but adjusts the nominal interest rate by the full amount

of the inflation gap and twice the output gap. Some previous research based on stochastic

simulations like those presented here has suggested that this rule may yield better macro-

economic performance than the Taylor rule.

5 See "A Comparison of Some Basic Monetary Policy Regimes for Open Economies:
Implications of Different Degrees of Instrument Adjustment and Wage Persistence," by Dale
Henderson and Warwick J. McKibbin, Carnegie-Rochester Conference Series on Public Policy
(39) 221-318.



- 11 -

(15) A third rule we consider attempts to capture the main features of the

"opportunistic" approach to monetary policy. This approach resembles the Henderson-

McKibbin rule in the strength of its response to the output gap, but in reaction to inflation

it has two distinctive features. First, the policy response to the observed rate of inflation is

calculated relative to an intermediate target for inflation rather than to the long-run target.

The intermediate target is specified as a weighted average of the long-run target and the

recently prevailing rate of inflation. As a consequence, the intermediate target moves,

shifting in the same direction as the prevailing rate of inflation, but by a lesser amount.

This specification implies that, in the course of a disinflation, the opportunistic policymaker

will become more dissatisfied with any given rate of inflation above the long-run target as

the prevailing rate comes down. For example, an inflation outcome of 3 percent may look

desirable when the prevailing rate is 4 percent, but undesirable when the prevailing rate is

2 percent. A conventional policymaker would be equally dissatisfied with a 3 percent

inflation outcome regardless of the recently prevailing inflation rate.

(16) The second distinctive feature of the opportunistic approach is the "zone of

opportunism": When actual inflation is close to the intermediate target (within 1 percentage

point in our specification), the opportunistic policymaker responds to changes in inflation

only by moving the nominal funds rate enough to keep the real funds rate unaffected. When

inflation is outside the zone of opportunism, however, the opportunistic policymaker responds

vigorously to each additional percentage point of inflation or deflation--even more vigorously,

in our specification, than the Henderson-McKibbin policymaker.



- 12-

(17) The fourth rule we consider is designed to capture the behavior of a policy-

maker who is aiming to contain inflation within a specified target zone. This "zone targeter"

can be understood as resembling a conventional Henderson-McKibbin policymaker in the

strength of the response to the output gap, but the inflation objective is a fixed target zone

rather than a single point. Alternatively, the zone targeter can be understood as resembling

an opportunistic policymaker, but with the target zone fixed over time. Like the opportunist,

the zone targeter responds to small changes in inflation within the zone by only enough to

hold the real funds rate unchanged and responds vigorously to changes in inflation that are

outside the zone. In the simulations reported below, we assume that the target zone extends

from 0 to 2 percent.6

(18) Chart 4 examines the performance of the four policy rules in achieving a

long-run inflation objective of 1 percent. 7 We constructed this chart by simulating the staff

econometric model 1,000 times under each rule. In each simulation, we started with inflation

at 2-1/2 percent and the economy producing at its potential. We then hit the model with a

sequence of random shocks and allowed the policymaker to react to the resulting situation

according to the four rules. For each rule, the chart displays the average of the resulting

1,000 inflation trajectories (top panel) and the average of the resulting 1,000 output-gap

trajectories (bottom panel). These averages allow us to gauge how quickly the disinflation

6 For more information about the four rules, see "A Quantitative Exploration of the
Opportunistic Approach to Disinflation," by Athanasios Orphanides, David Small, Volker
Wieland, and David Wilcox, June 1997, Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System.

7 Along these transition paths to 1 percent inflation, we assume the public does not
have full confidence that the rules will be followed exactly. Its expectation of the long-term
trend to inflation falls only gradually in light of realized gains in lowering inflation.

might be expected to unfold if the economy retains the same structure and experiences the

same type of shocks as in the past.

(19) All four rules succeed in bringing the average inflation trajectory down toward

the long-run target of 1 percent. Because under some of the rules the long-run target is

achieved on average only in the indefinite future, we assess the speed of convergence under

each rule by measuring the length of time until the average inflation trajectory crosses the

1-1/2 percent level. As can be seen in the chart, the Taylor-type policymaker is first to arrive

at this mark, the inflation zone targeter and the Henderson-McKibbin policymaker are next,

and the opportunistic policymaker is last.8 Not surprisingly, given the inflation results, the

Taylor policymaker, on average, imposes the deepest recession in the early going, while the

8 The Taylor policymaker arrives at 1-1/2 percent inflation more quickly than does the
Henderson-McKibbin policymaker because the latter assigns a higher relative priority to
stabilizing output. This means that if both policymakers strive to lower inflation, the resulting
output shortfall prompts the Henderson-McKibbin policymaker to ease off a bit more than it
does the Taylor policymaker. The zone targeter beats the opportunist to 1-1/2 percent
inflation because the former calculates the inflation response relative to the long-run target
whereas the opportunist calculates it relative to the intermediate target. The zone targeter also
beats the Henderson-McKibbin policymaker (albeit by a narrow margin); evidently, the zone
targeter makes up for tolerance of low, positive, inflation by applying a relatively stiff penalty
to inflation outside the zone.



- 14-

opportunist keeps output closest to potential.9 The ultimate cost in terms of cumulative out-

put loss to get to 1 percent inflation is approximately the same under all four rules. The

time to disinflate for the opportunist depends on the size and nature of the shocks hitting the

economy. If those shocks in the future more closely resemble the shocks that have occurred

during the past ten years (which have been relatively tranquil), then the time required for

the economy to reach 1-1/2 percent inflation would be extended noticeably.

(20) These simulation results illustrate only two aspects of the macroeconomic

consequences of letting policy be guided by the various formal rules--the expected time to

disinflate, and the accompanying path of output. Equally important are the implications of

the rules for the variability of output and inflation. In studying this issue of variability, we

abstract from any initial period of disinflation, and focus instead on the properties that the

model economy would exhibit once the rule in question has been in effect for a very long

time. Consistent with that focus on the steady state, in these simulations we assume that

9 Later in the scenario, the relative positions switch: Having achieved the long-run
inflation objective (indeed, having overshot it slightly), the Taylor policymaker runs output at
the highest level, on average. By contrast, the opportunist still runs the economy with a small
amount of slack on average, even twenty years into the simulation. The shortfall of output
from potential under the opportunistic rule is greatest early in the simulations, when inflation
is close to the upper bound of the opportunistic region. In such circumstances, the
opportunistic policymaker reacts asymmetrically to shocks; those that put upward pressure on
inflation are offset aggressively and therefore result in output shortfalls. Later in the
simulations when the opportunistic policymaker is more comfortably within the opportunistic
zone, shocks push inflation outside the opportunistic zone less frequently, so the asymmetric
policy responses and their effects on output are less prevalent.



- 15-

private-sector agents fully understand the rule that the Federal Reserve is using to guide

policy. 10

(21) The top panel in Chart 5 displays the distribution of inflation under each

of the rules, while the bottom panel shows the distribution of the output gap. In these

simulations, the opportunistic rule and the Taylor rule both fare relatively poorly: The

opportunistic rule produces a distinctly more diffuse distribution of inflation (top panel),

while achieving only a slightly more concentrated distribution of the output gap (bottom

panel); the Taylor rule produces a more diffuse distribution of the output gap while gaining

nothing on the inflation front.

(22) All these rules are disciplined ways of conducting policy, and in the context

of the model structure and distribution of shocks would produce less output and inflation

variability than the U.S. economy experienced over history. In the simulations we summarize

here, the Henderson-McKibbin rule and the inflation zone targeting rule generally outperform

the Taylor rule and the opportunistic rule. The opportunistic rule produces a more diffuse

distribution of inflation because the policymaker's target zone shifts over time. Both of the

winners feature relatively vigorous responses to deviations of output from potential and

deviations of inflation from the long-run target. In practice, policymakers must solve

10 This assumption of model-consistent expectations differs from that used in the dis-
inflation analysis, where the public was assumed to have only an approximate understanding
of the nature of monetary policy and the economy as a whole. To be exact, in the earlier
analysis expectations were derived from a small-scale VAR model that approximates the
average historical behavior of the economy (including monetary policy). This assumption was
deemed more appropriate for analyzing how the economy might respond-particularly in the
first few years-to a program of disinflation carried out under policy rules not previously
employed by the FOMC.

other things, they confront substantial uncertainty about the actual structure of the economy,

and they face the real possibility of structural change. These and other factors might counsel

adopting less forceful policy responses.

Annual Ranges for Money and Debt

(23) The issues concerning the Committee's decision about the ranges for money

and debt for 1997 and 1998 would seem to be similar to those faced at other recent

Humphrey-Hawkins meetings. In particular, the choice boils down to deciding between

continuing to structure the ranges as benchmarks for monetary and credit growth under

conditions of price stability with historically normal behavior of velocity, or aligning them

with probable outcomes for money and debt. Because money, in particular M2, has likely

tacked on two more quarters of relatively predictable behavior this year, the Committee may

feel a bit more confident in announcing ranges that it expects to be consistent with its

economic outlook. If it chooses to do so, however, the Committee will need to decide

whether to adopt higher ranges than those used recently, given that under the staff forecast

money would be expected to grow near the upper ends of the existing ranges. While a

decision to align money ranges with expected outcomes need not, as a logical matter, imply

that the Committee was upgrading money in judging its policy stance, it may also want to

consider whether a more stable demand means that money should be accorded added weight

as one of the many indicators relevant for policymaking.

Background

(24) Because the economy is not expected to be at price stability, the staff again is

projecting money growth associated with the Greenbook forecast to be near, or above, the

upper ends of the current money growth ranges. In the Greenbook, nominal GDP increases

5-1/2 percent this year before slowing to 4-1/4 percent in 1998 when the expansion of real

output is restrained, in part, by slightly less accommodative financial conditions. The



- 18 -

projections of M2 in 1997 and 1998 assume a continuation of the recent experience in which

demand for that aggregate has been broadly consistent with its historical relationship with

income and opportunity costs, albeit at a higher level of velocity. Against this backdrop, M2

is expected to grow 4-1/2 percent this year and 4 percent in 1998. The small increase in V2

in 1997 largely reflects the rise in velocity in the first half of this year. In 1998, the

projected rise in V2 results from the widening of opportunity costs late in the year, when the

System is assumed to tighten. With equity prices projected to decline next year, flows into

equity mutual funds would no longer be restraining M2 and boosting its velocity beyond that

predicted by the money demand function, as seems to have occurred to a limited extent this

year. (Chart 6 shows that the staff forecast of velocity in both years is well within the recent

cluster of velocity/opportunity cost observations.)

(25) Growth in M3 has continued to outpace that of nominal GDP in the first half

of this year, albeit by a narrower margin than in the past couple of years, and the staff

expects M3 to outrun income through the end of 1998 (Chart 7). Acting to boost M3 over

the next year and a half is the expectation of continued robust expansion in bank credit,

which is projected to exceed growth in GDP and nonfinancial debt as banks continue to find

healthy profits in intermediation. Also contributing to the downward drift in M3 velocity is

the growing popularity of M3 money funds for liquidity management by businesses and

further substitution of large time deposits for other funding sources. As a consequence, M3 is

expected to increase 6-1/2 percent this year and 6 percent next.

(26) The total debt of domestic nonfinancial sectors is forecast to expand this year

and next a bit more slowly than in the past couple of years--about 5 percent per year. The

modest slowdown is accounted for by the federal sector, in keeping with narrower federal

deficits. Growth in the nonfederal component stays around the fairly strong 6 percent pace of

recent years; within that total, household debt decelerates, while business borrowing expands

a little when profits and, thus, internal funds level out. Credit supply conditions should

stabilize or even tighten a notch as lenders continue to react to the difficulties of marginal

borrowers in the household sector and begin to see narrowing profit margins as portending

some erosion of the very favorable debt-carrying capacity of businesses. Nonetheless, the

forecast does not embody "headwinds" that would greatly constrain borrowing and spending.

Ranges for 1997 and 1998

(27) Shown below are two alternative sets of ranges for M2, M3, and debt for

Committee consideration for 1997 and 1998, along with the staff projections for both years.

Alternative I is the same as the ranges adopted last February for 1997.11 Alternative II

would raise the M2 and M3 ranges by one and two percentage points, respectively, to center

them better on the staffs expectations. The alternative II range for the debt aggregate is the

same as the alternative I range on the rationale that, with the staff forecast around the mid-

point of that range, there would seem to be no need for an upward adjustment.

" It is also same as the provisional ranges for 1997 selected in July 1996 and the
same as the ranges for 1996.

(28) As in the past couple of years, the Committee may wish to retain the alter-

native I ranges, even though staff projections are around their upper ends, on the grounds that

sufficient uncertainty persists regarding M2 and M3 velocity relationships to suggest that the

best use for the ranges still is as benchmarks for noninflationary monetary growth.12 13

Although the more predictable behavior of M2 demand has continued over the first half of the

year, the Committee may view the re-established relationships as not adequately tested under

a variety of circumstances to be confident in their persistence. For example, greater variation

in interest rates and nominal income could provoke substantial shifting between M2 assets

12 If the Committee retains this rationale, it might want to consider whether it should
lower the range for debt. This aggregate, like M2, has tended to grow over time at about the
same pace as nominal GDP, suggesting that a 1 to 5 percent range for debt would be more
consistent with the benchmark money growth ranges.

13 Note also that the current range for M2 appears most consistent with steady state
nominal GDP growth of around 3 percent. This would seem to imply that the Committee was
seeking true price stability--assuming trend real growth of 2 percent or so and around 3/4 per-
centage point of measurement bias in the deflator. If the Committee thought that output
growth might be greater going forward because of more favorable productivity trends or was
concerned that nominal rigidities argued for inflation a bit above true price stability, these
ranges might need to be higher to reflect the Committee's long-run expectations.

and mutual funds, since the latter are now much more readily available than in the 1970s and

1980s. Moreover, even if money demand remains reasonably predictable, the Committee may

value the ranges primarily as a means of signifying long-term goals, a role that they began to

take on in the second half of the 1980s. Although the Committee used M2 growth as one of

its indicators at that time, the emphasis was more on longer-term trends than on recent

behavior relative to the range, in part because the interest elasticity of M2 meant that its

velocity varied appreciably over the shorter-run, albeit fairly predictably, with changes in the

stance of policy.

(29) Alternatively, the Committee could see the better behavior of money demand

as making velocity relationships sufficiently predictable to warrant an attempt, at least on a

provisional basis, to let the public know approximately what rates of growth of money and

debt it thought were likely to accompany its expectations for economic performance.

Supplying such an expectation might be viewed as more in the spirit of the Federal Reserve

Act, which calls for the Federal Reserve to provide "objectives and plans" for money and

credit in the specific years. While that expectation would not be a "plan" or "objective," it

might be helpful to the public. Should the Committee wish to move in this direction but on

a very tentative basis, one possible approach would be to retain the current ranges and their

rationale for 1997, but to adopt provisional 1998 ranges that were keyed to the Committee's

expected outcomes. The Committee could emphasize the provisional nature of the ranges and

the opportunity to re-examine the ranges and their rationale next February in light of

experience in the second half of 1997. If the Committee saw growth in M2 or the other

aggregates as having some value as indicators relevant for policy, the case for presenting



-22-

ranges designed to capture expected growth would be strengthened. Given the relatively close

relationship of M2 and nominal income of late, persistent strength or weakness of money

relative to expectations, unless evidently caused by a demand shift or short-term policy

action, might raise questions about whether nominal GDP was on track.

(30) If the Committee decided to align the ranges more closely with expected or

desired outcomes, it still might wish to retain the specifications of alternative I, particularly

for 1998. These relatively low ranges would be consistent with an intent to counter a

tendency for inflation to drift higher, as under the staff forecast. Indeed, the rise in interest

rates envisioned in the intermediate strategy to hold inflation constant in the previous section

of the bluebook would likely produce M2 growth rates of 4-1/4 percent in 1997 and 3 percent

in 1998, and M3 growth that dropped well within a 2 to 6 percent range in 1998. Even if the

Committee believed there were greater prospects for favorable supply-side outcomes than

does the staff--and thus better prospects for either more output growth or less inflation--

alternative I might still be favored if the Committee wished to signal its intent to implement a

relatively tight policy stance and thereby ensure that any such shock would be translated, at

least in part, into lower inflation.

(31) The staff projections for M2 and M3 growth would be encompassed by

alternative II ranges in both years. As compared with alternative I, the Committee could use

alternative II to indicate an intent to pursue a less restrictive policy, which would not be as

likely to involve raising short-term interest rates substantially to fight the inflationary

tendencies in the staff forecast. Such a policy approach also would allow more of any

favorable supply developments to be taken in greater output and less in lower inflation,



-23-

because nominal income would be expected to grow more rapidly than in the staff forecast

under these circumstances, at least for a time.



-24-

Short-run Policy Alternatives

(32) Two short-run policy alternatives are presented below for Committee consider-

ation. Under alternative B, the intended federal funds rate would be maintained at its current

5-1/2 percent level. Under alternative C, it would be raised 1/4 percentage point to 5-3/4

percent. (A variant of the standard wording of the operational paragraph of the directive that

includes a specific reference to the federal funds rate appears on page 30.)

(33) Incoming information since the last Greenbook has led the staff to strengthen

its real growth forecast over coming quarters, implying a bit lower trajectory for the

unemployment rate, even as the prospects for containing inflation this year have brightened.

Compared with the central tendencies of the members' forecasts for 1997 announced in

February, real GDP and employment this year promise to be appreciably more robust, while

CPI inflation seems in train to come in much lower. For 1998, with the unemployment rate

holding at around a 4-1/2 percent rate during the year, the staff forecasts that inflation will

pick up and be poised to increase further in 1999; a partial reversal over the next year of

recent increases in the exchange value of the dollar removes one source of downward

pressure on inflation.

(34) The Committee may favor the unchanged federal funds rate of alternative B if

it thinks that chances are that the staff has not gone far enough to incorporate a more

favorable tradeoff between resource use and inflation into the outlook. But even if the staffs

current forecast were to prove about right, the deterioration in inflation performance would

unfold gradually enough that the Committee may judge that it can afford to wait for clearer

evidence on the situation. Certainly, the hard evidence in hand does not point to an imminent



-25-

step up in inflation, despite the low rate to which unemployment has fallen. And the odds

that recent inflation performance reflects, at least to some degree, a more lasting structural

change, as opposed to a confluence of temporary factors, surely go up the longer inflation

remains subdued. No change in the stance of monetary policy at this FOMC meeting is built

into the structure of market interest rates, so financial market prices would react little to the

Committee's choice of alternative B. Over the upcoming intermeeting period, some firming in

Treasury bill rates should accompany the return to positive net issuance of bills, while early

signs of a pickup in economic growth after a pause in the second quarter could well induce

some upward pressures on bond yields. In the context of evidence of a widening trade

deficit, these interest rate increases are not expected to contribute to upward pressure on the

dollar.

(35) The 1/4 percentage-point increase in the federal funds rate embodied in

alternative C might seem appropriate if the Committee sees the likelihood of intensifying

inflation pressures, as in the Greenbook, and wishes to impart some resistance to the

anticipated acceleration of prices. The idea that the current degree of pressure on productive

resources could be sustained without inducing an eventual upward spiral in wages and prices

might be viewed by the Committee as still too speculative to risk deferring further preemptive

policy action. Indeed, it could even believe, as does the staff, that many of the forces that

have acted to hold down inflation in the recent past are likely to be abating in the near future.

For example, a list of the forces that might be mostly played out by now include: (i) in-

creases in the labor force participation rate, which have kept strong aggregate demand from

generating a still lower unemployment rate; (ii) lower increases in the cost of worker benefits,



-26-

which have restrained labor costs; (iii) slow adjustment in inflation expectations to the lower

path of actual inflation, which also has conditioned wage and price setting; and (iv)

appreciation of the exchange value of the dollar, which has induced outright declines in

import prices. Judging by the relationships incorporated in the "Longer-Term Strategies"

section of this document, a 25 basis point rise in the funds rate represents only a small down

payment on the increase that would be needed to contain inflation permanently at about a

2-1/2 percent rate. Should the Committee want to improve the prospects of holding inflation

down to such a rate, it might consider a 50 basis point firming at this FOMC meeting. Even

if the tradeoff between resource use and inflation through the end of next year proves to be

still more favorable than is now incorporated in the staff forecast or in those model exercises,

the consequences of choosing a more restrained policy stance at this meeting may not be seen

as adverse. The Committee might well view it as a favorable outcome if the economic

expansion were to proceed at a slightly slower-than-projected pace but with a declining path

for inflation that better conformed to the Federal Reserve's long-run goal of stable prices.

(36) The 25 basis point firming in alternative C would catch market participants off

guard, inducing an immediate selloff in securities markets and an appreciation of the dollar in

exchange markets, with short-term interest rates jumping by virtually the same amount as the

intended funds rate. Market participants would likely interpret the tightening as another

preemptive action that would underscore their sense of the Federal Reserve's anti-inflationary

resolve. To the extent that, as seems likely, market participants continued to perceive that

any potential inflationary threat was rather muted, they would probably extrapolate further

firming moves only to a limited extent, thereby restraining the reaction in financial market



-27-

prices. A 50 basis point firming would, of course, represent an even greater surprise to

market participants and would induce a still sharper backup in interest rates and drop in

equity prices.

(37) The staffs projections of money and debt growth this year, assuming main-

tenance of the unchanged federal funds rate of alternative B, were described in the previous

section. In brief, for the year as a whole the staff projects growth of M2 and M3 of 4-1/2

and 6-1/2 percent, respectively, just below their pace from 1996:Q4 to June, and of domestic

nonfinancial debt of 5 percent, just above its pace from 1996:Q4 to May. Maintenance of the

slightly higher short-term interest rates of alternative C would lower these growth rates only

slightly over this year.

Directive Language

(38) Presented below for the members' consideration is draft wording relating to the

Committee's ranges for the aggregates in 1997 and 1998 along with the standard and

alternative language for the operational paragraph for the intermeeting period.

1997 and 1998 Ranges

The paragraph that follows includes the usual options and updating changes. In

addition, staff suggests deleting the term "monitoring" in the reference to the growth of total

domestic nonfinancial debt. The deletion would seem to avoid any inference that the

monetary aggregates receive a degree of emphasis that substantially distinguishes their role

from that of non-financial debt in the formulation of monetary policy.

The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and financial

conditions that will foster price stability and promote sustainable growth in

output. In furtherance of these objectives, the Committee REAFFIRMED at

THIS [DEL:its] meeting [DEL: in February] THE RANGES IT HAD established IN

FEBRUARY [DEL: ranges] for growth of M2 and M3 of 1 to 5 percent and 2 to 6

percent respectively, measured from the fourth quarter of 1996 to the fourth

quarter of 1997. [IN FURTHERANCE OF THESE OBJECTIVES, THE

COMMITTEE AT THIS MEETING RAISED/LOWERED THE RANGES IT

HAD ESTABLISHED IN FEBRUARY FOR GROWTH OF M2 AND M3

TO RANGES OF ___ TO ___ PERCENT AND ___ TO ____ PERCENT

RESPECTIVELY, MEASURED FROM THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 1996

TO THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 1997.] The [DEL: monitoring] range for growth



-30-

of total domestic nonfinancial debt was MAINTAINED [DEL: set] at 3 to 7 percent

(RAISED/LOWERED TO ___ TO ___ PERCENT) for the year. FOR 1998,

THE COMMITTEE AGREED ON TENTATIVE RANGES FOR MONE-

TARY GROWTH, MEASURED FROM THE FOURTH QUARTER OF

1997 TO THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 1998, OF ___ TO ___ PERCENT

FOR M2 AND ____ TO ____ PERCENT FOR M3. THE COMMITTEE

PROVISIONALLY SET THE ASSOCIATED RANGE FOR GROWTH OF

TOTAL DOMESTIC NONFINANCIAL DEBT AT ___TO ___ PERCENT

FOR 1998. The behavior of the monetary aggregates will continue to be

evaluated in the light of progress toward price level stability, movements in

their velocities, and developments in the economy and financial markets.

OPERATIONAL PARAGRAPH

Shown below is (1) standard draft wording for the operational paragraph that

includes the usual options for Committee consideration and (2) possible alternative

wording for Committee consideration that makes explicit reference to the federal

funds rate and recasts part of the sentence on possible intermeeting adjustments to

policy.

Standard Version

In the implementation of policy for the immediate future, the

Committee seeks to DECREASE (SLIGHTLY/SOMEWHAT)/maintain/

INCREASE (SLIGHTLY/SOMEWHAT) the existing degree of pressure on

reserve positions. In the context of the Committee's long-run objectives for



-31-

price stability and sustainable economic growth, and giving careful con-

sideration to economic, financial, and monetary developments, somewhat

(SLIGHTLY) greater reserve restraint would (MIGHT) or (SOMEWHAT)

slightly lesser reserve restraint (WOULD) might be acceptable in the

intermeeting period. The contemplated reserve conditions are expected to be

consistent with MODERATE GROWTH [DEL: some moderation in the expansion of]

M2 and M3 over coming months.

ALTERNATE WORDING

In the implementation of policy for the immediate future, the

Committee seeks to maintain current/tighten/ease (somewhat/slightly)

conditions in reserve markets consistent with the federal funds rate remaining

at/increasing to/decreasing to an average of around ___ percent. In the con-

text of the Committee's long-run objectives for price stability and sustainable

economic growth, and giving careful consideration to economic, financial, and

monetary developments, decisions regarding the desirability of adjusting the

federal funds rate during the intermeeting period should give

(1) equal weight to developments indicating a need to tighten or ease

the stance of policy,

(2) greater weight to developments indicating a need to tighten/ ease

the stance of policy.

The contemplated reserve conditions are expected to be consistent with

moderate growth in M2 and M3 over coming months.

1. Targets are for bank credit until 1983; from 1983 onward targets are for domestic nonfinancial sector debt.

2. The figures shown reflect target and actual growth of M1-B in 1980 and shift-adjusted M1-B in 1981. M1-B was
relabelled M1 in January 1982. The targeted growth for M1-A was 3-1/2 to 6 percent in 1980 (actual growth was
5.0 percent); in 1981 targeted growth for shift-adjusted M1-A was 3 to 5-1/2 percent (actual growth was 1.3 percent).

3. When these ranges were set, shifts into other checkable deposits in 1980 were expected to have only a limited
effect on growth of M1-A and M1-B. As the year progressed, however, banks offered other checkable deposits more
actively, and more funds than expected were directed to these accounts. Such shifts are estimated to have decreased
M1-A growth and increased M1-B growth each by at least 1/2 percentage point more than had been anticipated.

4. Adjusted for the effects of shifts out of demand deposits and savings deposits. At the February FOMC meeting,
the target ranges for observed M1-A and M1-B in 1981 on an unadjusted basis, expected to be consistent with the
adjusted ranges, were -(4-1/2) to -2 and 6 to 8-1/2 percent, respectively. Actual M1-B growth (not shift adjusted)
was 5.0 percent.

5. Adjusted for shifts of assets from domestic banking offices to International Banking Facilities.

6. Range for bank credit is annualized growth from the December 1981 - January 1982 average level through the
fourth quarter of 1982.

7. Base period, adopted at the July 1983 FOMC meeting, is 1983 QII. At the February 1983 meeting, the FOMC
had adopted a 1982 QIV to 1983 QIV target range for M1 of 4 to 8 percent.

8. Base period is the February-March 1983 average.

9. Base period, adopted at the July 1985 FOMC meeting, is 1985 QII. At the February 1983 meeting, the FOMC
had adopted a 1984 QIV to 1985 QIV target range for M1 of 4 to 7 percent.

10. No range for M1 has been specified since the February 1987 FOMC meeting because of uncertainties about its
underlying relationship to the behavior of the economy and its sensitivitiy to economic and financial circumstances.

11. At the February 1990 meeting, the FOMC specified a range of 2-1/2 to 6-1/2 percent. This range was lowered
to 1 to 5 percent at the July 1990 meeting.

12. At the February 1993 meeting, the FOMC specified a range of 2 to 6 percent for M2, 1/2 to 4-1/2 percent for
M3, and 4-1/2 to 8-1/2 percent for domestic nonfinancial debt. These ranges were lowered to 1 to 5 percent for M2,
0 to 4 percent for M3, and 4 to 8 percent for domestic nonfinancial debt at the July 1993 meeting.

13. At the February 1995 FOMC meeting, the FOMC specified a range of 0 to 4 percent. This range was raised
to 2 to 6 percent at the July 1995 meeting.

14. Growth rates in parentheses for the monetary aggregates are from 1996 QIV to June 1997 and for nonfinancial
debt are from 1996 QIV to May 1997.
