CLASS I FOMC - RESTRICTED CONTROLLED (FR)

MONETARY POLICY ALTERNATIVES 

PREPARED FOR THE FEDERAL OPEN MARKET COMMITTEE 
BY THE STAFF OF THE BOARD OF GOVERNORS OF THE FEDERAL RESERVE SYSTEM 

JUNE 18, 2009 



RECENT DEVELOPMENTS 
 
SUMMARY 

Strains in financial markets eased further over the intermeeting period.  Investor 

unease about the largest U.S. bank holding companies seemed to lessen following the 

release of the results of the Supervisory Capital Assessment Program (SCAP), and 

subsequently these institutions issued a large amount of equity and nonguaranteed 

debt.  Equity price indexes rallied, with financial stocks outperforming.  Short-term 

funding rates generally fell, and market functioning showed widespread improvement.  

Consistent with the improvements in financial markets, demand for Federal Reserve 

credit declined. 

 Yields on nominal Treasury securities climbed steeply over the intermeeting 

period, especially for longer-dated issues.  Market participants attributed the move to 

several factors, including an upward shift in the expected path of the federal funds 

rate resulting from the somewhat improved economic outlook, and a rise in term 

premiums reflecting, in part, technical factors associated with mortgage-related 

hedging flows.  The increase in TIPS yields did not keep pace with the rise in their 

nominal counterparts, leaving inflation compensation markedly higher over the 

period.  While some of the widening in inflation compensation likely reflected an 

increase in inflation expectations, evidence suggests that an increase in inflation risk 

premiums as well as technical factors may also have boosted inflation compensation.  

In private debt markets, rates on mortgages and mortgage-backed securities climbed 

along with the run-up in nominal Treasury yields.  In contrast, yields on both 

investment-grade and speculative-grade corporate bonds declined, and their spreads 

to comparable-maturity Treasury securities narrowed substantially.

 Domestic nonfinancial sector debt is projected to have expanded at an annual 

rate of 5½ percent in the second quarter, with net borrowing due almost entirely to 

the federal government.  Bank credit increased slightly in May, following six 

consecutive months of decline, although core loans shrank again.  Recent issuance of 

credit card and auto asset-backed securities (ABS) was solid, stimulated by the Term 

Asset-Backed Securities Loan Facility (TALF). 

Money market conditions abroad also improved slightly over the intermeeting 

period.  Yields on sovereign bonds rose notably, and the dollar depreciated against 

most major currencies.  Many foreign central banks eased policy rates or expanded 

nonconventional policies.  Stock market indexes around the world moved up sharply. 

FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS 

Investors’ concerns about the health of the largest U.S. financial institutions eased 

somewhat over the intermeeting period as the announcement of the results of the 

SCAP stress tests and subsequent successful capital raising efforts were seen as key 

steps toward recovery of the financial system.  In particular, stock prices of banks rose 

11 percent and CDS spreads on debt of major bank holding companies narrowed 

considerably (Chart 1).1   

The results of the SCAP, released on May 7, were positively received in financial 

markets.  Implied volatility of bank share prices declined markedly after the results, 

apparently reflecting a reduction in uncertainty about prospects for these institutions.  

                                           
1 On June 17, Standard & Poor’s announced that it lowered its ratings for 18 U.S. banks, 

noting that operating conditions for the industry will become less favorable than they were 
in the past.  The rating action included 7 banks that were included in the stress tests.  While 
the announcement was reportedly not entirely unexpected, equity prices of the downgraded 
institutions declined.

Spreads on outstanding FDIC-guaranteed debt for most issuers narrowed a bit over 

the intermeeting period but there was considerable variation across institutions in the 

yields on non-guaranteed debt.  CDS spreads for large banking organizations declined 

notably over the period, though they remained elevated.   

Subsequent to the release of the SCAP results, the 10 institutions that were 

required to increase their capital buffer raised or announced plans to raise around 

$55 billion in common equity through public offerings, conversions of preferred 

stock, and asset sales, and they submitted capital plans to raise the remaining capital 

required under the SCAP by November.  Most of the other institutions evaluated in 

the stress tests also raised capital, totaling an additional $15 billion, with the intent to 

repay U.S. Treasury capital.  The 19 firms issued more than $25 billion of non-

guaranteed debt after the SCAP results were announced, and a few firms issued a total 

of roughly $10 billion in FDIC-guaranteed debt.  On June 1 the Federal Reserve 

Board released an outline of the criteria it would use to evaluate applications to repay 

U.S. government capital, and on June 9, the Treasury announced that 10 of the largest 

institutions had met the requirements for repaying funds; equity prices of these 

institutions generally rose and CDS spreads ticked lower on the day of the Treasury 

announcement.  On June 17, about $68 billion was repaid to the Treasury.   

Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac reported fourth-quarter losses in line with market 

expectations and requested an additional $19 billion and $6 billion, respectively, from 

the Treasury under the Senior Preferred Stock Purchase Agreement.  Nonetheless, 

Fannie Mae issued $5 billion of five-year notes and Freddie Mac issued $9 billion of 

three-year notes in well-subscribed auctions.  The Federal Home Loan Bank System 

auctioned $5 billion in two-year notes, its largest such issuance in a year, amid 

reportedly high demand.  Spreads of yields on agency debt over those on comparable-

maturity Treasury securities narrowed over the intermeeting period as the Federal 

Reserve continued its purchases of agency debt.   

Market participants appeared to view the outlook for insurance firms as somewhat 

improved, as their equity prices rose, on net, over the intermeeting period.  The 

improvements coincided with news reports suggesting that insurance companies 

would be eligible for TARP funds.  Some insurance companies, including Ameriprise 

Financial and Allstate, announced that they would not accept such funds, but others, 

such as Hartford Financial and Lincoln National, announced that they intend to issue 

preferred stock to the Treasury and have obtained preliminary approval to do so.   

MARKET FUNCTIONING 

 Functioning in many financial markets improved, on net, over the intermeeting 

period.  Pressures in short-term bank funding markets eased further, as evidenced by 

declines in Libor fixings and spreads over OIS (Chart 2).  Spreads at the one- and 

three-month horizons narrowed to levels not seen since early 2008, volume increased 

modestly, and market participants reported tentative signs of improved liquidity.  The 

reverse repurchase (repo) market saw slight improvement, with bid-asked spreads for 

most types of transactions ticking down and haircuts roughly unchanged.  Delivery 

fails on Treasury securities dropped after the May 1 implementation of the Treasury 

Market Practices Group’s fails charge.2  Nevertheless, the 10-year on-the-run Treasury 

                                           
2 On May 1, a “fails charge” recommended by the Treasury Market Practices Group was 

implemented.  The charge is incurred when a party to a repo or cash transaction fails to 
deliver the contracted Treasury security to the other party by the date agreed upon by the 
parties.  The charge is a share of the value of the securities, where the share is the greater of 
3 percent (annual rate) minus the target federal funds rate (or the bottom of the range 
when the FOMC specifies that instead) and zero.  Previously, the practice was that a failed 
transaction was allowed to settle on a subsequent day at an unchanged invoice price; 
therefore, the cost of a fail was the opportunity cost of the funds owed in the transaction, 
which was minimal when short-term interest rates were very low, and thus provided little

security was in particularly short supply in early June, and delivery fails for that issue 

increased notably and trades in overnight repos for this issue took place at negative 

yields.  On June 15, a new supply of the on-the-run 10-year note settled following the 

regular reopening, and delivery fails fell to zero.   

 Consistent with improvement in the bank funding markets, use of Federal 

Reserve liquidity facilities directed at depository institutions declined.  (See box 

entitled “Balance Sheet Developments During the Intermeeting Period.”)  Term 

Auction Facility (TAF) credit outstanding declined by nearly $70 billion over the 

intermeeting period.  Bidding in both the 28-day and 84-day auctions decreased fairly 

steadily over the period, although the 28-day auction that immediately preceded the 

announcement of the SCAP results drew more aggressive bidding, reportedly because 

of anxiety on the part of a few SCAP banks about the stress tests results.  Foreign 

central bank liquidity swaps outstanding dropped about $100 billion over the period, 

continuing their steady decline since the start of the year.  With the improvement in 

bank funding markets and the relatively higher cost of this funding relative to the 

TAF, foreign central bank dollar liquidity was seen as less attractive.   

 Lending through the Commercial Paper Funding Facility (CPFF) dropped by 

$50 billion, as less than half of maturing commercial paper in the program was 

reissued to the CPFF.  Reportedly, many firms issued longer-term debt to pay down 

short-term borrowing financed through the facility.  Outside the CPFF, spreads on 

30-day asset-backed commercial paper and A2/P2 commercial paper edged down 

further to around the low end of their ranges recorded over the past 18 months.   

                                                                                                                                        
incentive to minimize fails.  The new practice of a fails charge ensures that the total cost of 
a fail (opportunity cost plus the fails charge) is at least 3 percent.  Given the new rules, repo 
rates for securities in especially high demand can routinely trade as low as -3 percent; 
previously, market conventions prevented repo rates from falling much below zero even 
during periods of intense demand for  particular securities.

Balance Sheet Developments During the Intermeeting Period 

Since the April FOMC meeting, the Federal Reserve’s total assets have 
remained at around $2 trillion, but their composition has shifted significantly.1  As a 
result of the ongoing asset purchase programs, securities held outright increased 
$201 billion, but this increase was roughly offset by a decrease of $206 billion in 
liquidity programs and other credit facilities.   

The Open Market Desk purchased $90 billion in U.S. Treasury securities, 
$22 billion in agency debt securities, and $90 billion in agency mortgage-backed 
securities.2  Loans extended under the Term Asset-Backed Securities Loan Facility 
(TALF) increased by $19 billion, and those extended under the Asset-Backed 
Commercial Paper Money Market Mutual Fund Liquidity Facility (AMLF) 
increased by $15 billion.  The TALF conducted two operations during the 
intermeeting period to finance the issuance of asset-backed securities.  The 
increased lending through the AMLF occurred just prior to the announcement of 
results from the Supervisory Capital Assessment Program and reportedly reflected 
money market mutual funds’ concern that their holdings of commercial paper 
issued by some of the institutions subject to the stress tests might be downgraded 
or placed on watch for downgrade by the rating agencies and thereby become 
ineligible for the facility. 

A number of the System’s credit and liquidity programs contracted.  Foreign 
central bank liquidity swaps declined $101 billion, term auction credit declined $67 
billion, and primary credit declined $9 billion.3  All of these declines likely reflect 
improvements in global bank funding markets.  Credit extended through the 
Commercial Paper Funding Facility declined $50 billion after a large amount of 
commercial paper funded under the program matured and was not completely 
rolled over.  This decline likely reflects, at least in part, some substitution of longer 
term credit for commercial paper.  Lending under the Primary Dealer Credit 
Facility declined $1 billion to zero, and securities lent through the Term Securities 
Lending Facility (TSLF), which do not affect assets because the Federal Reserve 
retains ownership of the securities lent, declined by $17 billion.  The decline in 
TSLF lending reportedly reflects improvements in the repo market, particularly a 
narrowing of risk spreads on term repo transactions.      

                                           
1 These data are through June 17, 2009. 
2 The figures for MBS holdings reflect only trades that have settled.  Over the intermeeting period, the Open 

Market Desk committed to purchase $172 billion of MBS, on net. 
3 The amount of term auction credit and the amount of foreign central bank liquidity swaps are expected to 

decline $54 billion and $27 billion respectively, on June 18, 2009.

On the liability side of the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet, the U.S. Treasury’s 
general account increased $70 billion as a result of tax payments and the repayment 
of some of the preferred stock provided to financial institutions under the U.S. 
Treasury’s Troubled Asset Relief Program.  This increase was roughly offset by a 
$69 billion decrease in reserve balances of depository institutions, leaving the 
Federal Reserve’s total liabilities about unchanged over the period.

One exception to the decreased usage of Federal Reserve facilities was the Asset-

Backed Commercial Paper Money Market Mutual Fund Liquidity Facility (AMLF), 

which jumped from zero to $27 billion in early May.  The increase was sparked by 

concerns about potential downgrades of commercial paper issued by banking 

institutions around the time of the stress tests that led money funds to place their 

paper in the AMLF in case the collateral subsequently became ineligible for this 

facility.  Subsequently, amounts borrowed from the AMLF declined, with amounts 

outstanding falling to $19 billion most recently.   

Functioning in the market for Treasury securities generally improved and trading 

volumes picked up, but some strains remained.  The average fitting error estimated 

from staff yield curve models decreased noticeably.  The on-the-run/off-the-run 

premium narrowed considerably at the short end of the yield curve.  Concerns about 

volatility linked to mortgage-related hedging flows, however, appeared to keep these 

spreads somewhat wide for longer-dated issues.  Some strains emerged at times in the 

mortgage-backed securities (MBS) market perhaps associated with the mortgage-

related hedging flows; market participants reacted to the large and rapid changes in 

MBS yields by widening the bid-asked spreads on MBS.  

Functioning in the corporate bond market reportedly improved a bit over the 

intermeeting period.  Bid-asked spreads for speculative-grade and investment-grade 

bonds declined on net over the period.  Meanwhile, the basis between the CDX 

investment-grade index of CDS spreads and measures of investment-grade corporate 

bond spreads―a rough measure of unexploited arbitrage opportunities in the 

corporate bond market―decreased, although it remained wide.  Market sentiment 

toward the syndicated leveraged loan market also improved, with the average bid price 

June 18, 2009 Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) Page 11 of 79



increasing notably and bid-asked spreads narrowing a bit further.3  Liquidity in the 

CDS market appeared to improve, with the average range of CDS dealer 

contributions narrowing significantly, especially so for financial firms. 

Use of the TALF continued to expand, with the May and June subscriptions 

providing $10.6 billion and $10.7 billion in new loan extensions, respectively.  

Issuance of auto and credit card ABS, including a couple of ABS issues that came to 

market outside of the TALF, was solid in these months.  In addition, the TALF 

program was extended in two dimensions.  First, the list of eligible collateral under the 

TALF program was expanded to include newly issued and legacy commercial 

mortgage-backed securities (CMBS), as well as insurance premium finance loans.  

Second, the Board authorized TALF loans with maturities of five years to finance 

purchases of CMBS, ABS backed by student loans, and loans guaranteed by the Small 

Business Administration.4  The inclusion of CMBS in the TALF program resulted in a 

narrowing of spreads in the secondary market.  However, CMBS spreads have since 

widened as rating agencies have issued conflicting opinions regarding the 

methodology to evaluate credit quality of many senior CMBS tranches.  In addition, 

commercial real estate fundamentals worsened as vacancy rates rose and prices 

declined, resulting in higher delinquency rates on commercial mortgages and 

construction loans. 

                                           
3 Some market participants suggested that two factors might have contributed to the increase 

in leveraged loan prices.  First, some issuers tapped the bond market and reportedly paid 
down loans, leaving managers of collateralized loan obligations with excess cash to reinvest 
in the loan market.  Second, many syndicated loan borrowers have reportedly reached 
agreements with their creditors to extend the maturity and increase the size of their loan 
facilities in exchange for significantly wider spreads. 

4 The first TALF subscription for new CMBS on June 16 received no submissions.  This 
outcome was expected, given the time that it takes to arrange CMBS transactions.

MONETARY POLICY EXPECTATIONS AND TREASURY YIELDS 

The Committee’s decision at its April 28-29 meeting to leave the target range for 

the federal funds rate unchanged and the accompanying statement indicating that the 

FOMC would maintain the size of the large-scale asset purchase program were largely 

anticipated, but yields on Treasury securities rose slightly as a few investors apparently 

had placed some odds on the Committee expanding the purchase program.5  The 

release of the April FOMC minutes three weeks later prompted a reversal of this 

move, as market participants reportedly focused on the suggestion that the total size 

of the purchase program might need to be increased at some point to spur a more 

rapid pace of recovery.  The expected path for the federal funds rate implied by 

futures prices was largely unchanged by the releases of the Committee’s statement and 

the minutes.  However, in the days following the release of the May employment 

report, which was read as being significantly less negative than anticipated, market 

participants marked up their expected path for the federal funds rate.  Although about 

half of this upward shift has since been reversed, futures quotes – combined with our 

standard assumptions about the term premium – imply an expected federal funds rate 

at the end of 2010 of about 1.8 percent, up about 65 basis points from the expected 

rate at the time of the April FOMC meeting (Chart 3).  Part of the increase in the 

expected funds rate path might reflect an increase in the term premium that is not 

incorporated in our standard assumptions.  The option-implied distribution of the 

federal funds rate six months from now widened substantially over the period 

possibly pointing to a widening in the term premium.   And the Desk’s survey of 

primary dealers reported that all respondents continued to expect short-term policy 

                                           
5 The effective federal funds rate averaged 0.19 percent over the intermeeting period.  

Trading volumes declined somewhat toward the end of the period, and the intraday 
standard deviation averaged 5 basis points.

rates to remain on hold in 2009, again suggesting that some portion of the upward 

revision in the futures path may reflect higher term premiums. 

Nominal Treasury yields increased sharply over the intermeeting period, with 

yields on two- and ten-year notes up about 35 and 80 basis points, respectively.  

Against a backdrop of heavy Treasury issuance, the ten-year yield trended up over the 

intermeeting period likely reflecting a number of factors, including the favorable 

reception of the SCAP results and better-than-expected economic data, which 

boosted the expected path of future short rates and pushed up the term premium, as 

well as technical factors related to mortgage-related hedging flows. (See box entitled 

“The Recent Rise in Long-term Nominal Treasury Yields.”)  The two-year Treasury 

yield increase mainly followed the release of the milder-than-expected May 

employment report. 

 Inflation compensation rose over the intermeeting period as yields on inflation-

indexed Treasury securities increased much less than those on their nominal 

counterparts.  Some of the increase in inflation compensation may reflect an increase 

in inflation expectations, but an improvement in liquidity in the TIPS market and 

mortgage-related hedging flows may have boosted inflation compensation as well.  

(See box entitled “Interpreting the Rise in Inflation Compensation.”) 

CAPITAL MARKETS 

Broad stock price indexes rose about 7 percent, on balance, over the intermeeting 

period amid generally better-than-expected economic data releases (Chart 4).  Implied 

stock-price volatility continued to decline, although it remained elevated.  The equity 

premium―measured as the staff’s estimate of the expected real equity return over the 

next ten years relative to the real 10-year Treasury yield―narrowed notably but 

remained high by historical standards.  Revisions to analysts’ forecasts of year-ahead 

June 18, 2009 Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) Page 15 of 79



The Recent Rise in Long‐term Nominal Treasury Yields 

Yields on long-term nominal Treasury securities increased substantially over 
the intermeeting period.  The 10-year yield climbed 80 basis points (left chart 
below), with much of the increase concentrated in forward rates at horizons 
between 3 and 7 years.  Estimates from the staff’s three-factor affine term structure 
model suggest that much of the rise in the 10-year yield can be attributed to wider 
term premiums, although the expected path of future short-term rates also boosted 
yields.    

A more optimistic assessment of the economic outlook on the part of investors 
was reportedly a significant factor boosting the expected path of future short rates.  
Data releases in the United States and other countries pointed to some tentative 
signs that the global deterioration in economic activity could be moderating.  
Indeed, nominal government bond yields moved higher in most industrialized 
countries.  Stronger economic data and rising oil prices may also have contributed 
to an increase in inflation expectations over the period, leading to higher inflation 
compensation in nominal government bond yields in a number of advanced foreign 
economies.     

  

A number of factors reportedly boosted term premiums for Treasury securities.  
The favorable reception of the Supervisory Capital Assessment Program (SCAP) 
results and the improved tone of economic data seemed to spur an unwinding of 
safe-haven demands.  As yields moved higher, other factors reportedly amplified 
the upturn in rates.  First, investors concluded that the Fed was not defending 
particular rate levels for Treasuries and mortgages as part of its large-scale asset 

June 18, 2009 Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) Page 16 of 79



purchase (LSAP) programs.  Second, the rise in yields reportedly prompted 
mortgage-related hedging flows—as mortgage rates moved higher, the duration of 
mortgage-backed securities increased and investors reportedly pared holdings of 
longer-term Treasuries in an effort to keep the duration of their portfolios at 
desired levels.  The rise in mortgage hedging demands was accompanied by a 
notable increase in option-implied measures of uncertainty about long-term interest 
rates (shaded grey area in the right chart above), which may have also contributed 
to the widening of term premiums.   

June 18, 2009 Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) Page 17 of 79



Interpreting the Rise in Inflation Compensation 

Inflation compensation, defined as the difference between yields on nominal 
Treasury securities and those on comparable-maturity TIPS, increased notably over the 
intermeeting period.  Five-year inflation compensation rose about 70 basis points, and 
five-year inflation compensation five years forward increased about 35 basis points, with 
the largest increases occurring following the May nonfarm payroll release, comments 
from Fed officials pointing to upside inflation risks, and large increases in oil prices.   

The staff’s real term structure model provides one means of decomposing these 
changes into changes in inflation expectations, inflation risk premiums, and other factors.  
As noted in the table below, the model suggests that inflation expectations at the five-year 
and five-year forward horizon moved up about 40 basis points over the intermeeting 
period.  For comparison, the Michigan and Philadelphia Fed measures of long-term 
inflation expectations increased 40 basis points and 10 basis points, respectively, since the 
April meeting.  The model also points to an increase of about 20 basis points in the 
inflation risk premium at both the five-year and five-year forward horizons.  

Changes over the intermeeting period

       Change in inflation risk premium +17 +22 

       Change in residuals +11 –25 

       Total change +68 +34 

While these model results are suggestive, the point estimates of changes in the 
components may be subject to more than the usual degree of uncertainty.   In particular, 
market participants pointed to a number of special factors boosting nominal yields over 
the period that probably would not have affected TIPS yields to the same degree.  For 
example, the unwinding of safe haven demands in light of the perceived improvement in 
the economic outlook as well as the upward pressure on longer-term rates stemming from 
mortgage-hedging flows both are factors that could be expected to boost nominal 
Treasury yields relative to TIPS yields.  Indeed, inflation compensation at both the five-
year and five-year forward horizon moved up very sharply in the summer of 2003 during 
the intense mortgage-hedging episode at that time.

earnings for S&P 500 firms were negative in the month ending in mid-May, but the 

downward revision was much smaller than in the prior several months.  Financial 

firms issued a record volume of public equity in May, and seasoned offerings by 

nonfinancial firms surged.  Net issuance of equity by nonfinancial firms, which had 

been negative since 2002, was essentially zero in the first quarter, as equity retirements 

from cash-financed mergers and share repurchases slowed significantly.     

Yields on speculative-grade and investment-grade bonds dropped, and spreads 

over yields on comparable-maturity Treasury debt narrowed considerably.  Consistent 

with the generally improved market sentiment, CDX indexes of spreads for both 

investment-grade and speculative-grade debt fell over the intermeeting period, with 

the largest declines recorded for financial firms.  Gross issuance of corporate bonds 

was strong over the intermeeting period by both nonfinancial and financial firms.  

Issuance by investment-grade nonfinancial firms rebounded from its April lull, and 

the pace of issuance by speculative-grade companies was the highest since June 2007.  

Many firms reportedly used the proceeds to pay down bank loans and commercial 

paper over the intermeeting period.  Bond issuance by financial firms was primarily 

outside the FDIC’s Temporary Liquidity Guarantee Program.  The expected year-

ahead default rate from Moody’s KMV, which covers both financial and nonfinancial 

firms, decreased markedly over the period, reflecting both higher estimated asset 

values and lower estimated asset volatilities.  Nevertheless, this measure of expected 

defaults remained extremely high by historical standards. 

Mortgage rates increased sharply over the intermeeting period.  Yields on MBS 

increased 80 basis points, while the average rate on 30-year fixed-rate conforming 

mortgages increased less, rising about 60 basis points to 5.4 percent.  As a result, the 

spread between the yield on Fannie Mae MBS and the primary mortgage market rate 

narrowed on net.  Rates offered on jumbo mortgages rose even less.  Issuance of 

June 18, 2009 Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) Page 20 of 79



MBS by the housing-related GSEs increased in recent months, due to the 

securitization of refinance mortgages originated earlier this year, as well as seasoned 

mortgages securitized from Fannie Mae's portfolio.  MBS issuance by Ginnie Mae 

expanded modestly in March and April.  However, the private-label MBS market 

remained closed.   

The credit card and auto ABS market saw a marked pickup in issuance, primarily 

associated with deals funded through the TALF.  Spreads on AAA-rated consumer 

ABS continued the narrowing that began early in the year and have now retraced a 

large portion of the run-up that occurred between mid-2007 and the end of 2008.     

 Conditions in the municipal bond market continued to improve.  Gross 

issuance of municipal bonds remained solid in May.  Yields on long-term municipal 

bonds rose less over the intermeeting period than those on comparable-maturity 

Treasury securities, reducing the ratio of municipal-to-Treasury yields to its lowest 

level in almost a year.  As indicated by the 7-day SIFMA Municipal Swap Index, yields 

on short-term municipal instruments declined notably and the index reached its 

lowest level on record. 

FOREIGN DEVELOPMENTS 

The major currencies index of the dollar has declined nearly 6½ percent during 

the intermeeting period as the dollar depreciated sharply against the currencies of all 

of our major trading partners except the yen (Chart 5).  This decline appeared to be 

driven by a renewed sense of optimism about global growth prospects, leading 

investors to shift demand from safe-haven assets in the United States and Japan to 

riskier assets elsewhere.  As in the United States, conditions in bank funding markets 

abroad improved over the period; spreads between Libor and OIS rates in euro and 

sterling decreased.  Investors’ concerns about foreign financial institutions eased a bit,

and foreign banks took advantage of better market conditions to raise capital.  This 

improved access to capital markets and the better economic outlook helped lead bank 

stocks higher.  Headline stock indexes in Europe and Japan rose roughly 4 and 16 

percent, respectively, while bank stocks increased 11 to 14 percent.   

The European Central Bank lowered its policy rate 25 basis points to 1 percent 

and announced that it would purchase €60 billion in covered bonds.  The Bank of 

England kept its policy rate constant at 50 basis points but increased the size of its 

planned asset purchases from £75 billion to £125 billion.  Despite these policy 

decisions, yields on longer-term sovereign nominal and inflation-indexed bonds rose 

over the period.  As in the United States, the rise in yields was likely driven by several 

factors, including an increased willingness on the part of investors to move out of safe 

assets such as government bonds and into riskier investments; the improvement in the 

global outlook, which may have led markets to expect that central banks will tighten 

rates sooner than had been anticipated; and concerns among some investors that 

rising fiscal deficits may lead to rising inflation.  Ten-year gilt yields rose about 15 

basis points following Standard & Poor’s warning that rising fiscal deficits might lead 

it to downgrade the United Kingdom’s sovereign rating, but Moody’s and Fitch 

reaffirmed the United Kingdom’s AAA rating. 

The dollar depreciated 3 percent against the currencies of our other important 

trading partners on a trade-weighted basis, falling 11 percent against the Brazilian real 

and 6½ percent against the Korean won.  Chinese authorities held the renminbi nearly 

unchanged against the dollar and the dollar depreciated a more modest 1 to 4 percent 

against most other emerging market currencies.  Several central banks intervened to 

purchase dollars in recent weeks, attempting to lessen the rate of the dollar’s 

depreciation against their currencies.  Stock indexes in most emerging market

economies rose at least 10 percent and several climbed more than 20 percent as 

mutual fund flows into those markets remained positive.    

DEBT, BANK CREDIT, AND MONEY 

 The level of private-sector debt is projected to have remained about unchanged 

in the second quarter as a further modest decline in household debt likely about offset 

a slight increase in nonfinancial business debt (Chart 6).  In contrast, the federal 

government issued debt at a rapid clip, and state and local government debt is 

projected to have expanded moderately.  All told, the growth rate of domestic 

nonfinancial sector debt is projected to have increased from an annual rate of 4 

percent in the first quarter of this year to 5½ percent in the second quarter.  

Call Report data for the first quarter showed a rebound in the profitability of 

commercial banks, although earnings remained quite low by historical standards.  The 

increase in profitability was concentrated among the largest banks and reflected a 

sharp increase in noninterest income and a drop in banks’ noninterest expense.  In 

contrast, profits for banks outside the top 25 stayed negative as loss provisions 

increased further amid deteriorating asset quality.  Indeed, the aggregate charge-off 

rate and the overall delinquency rate reached their highest levels in more than fifteen 

years last quarter. 

Commercial bank credit rose slightly in May, following six consecutive months of 

decline.  The turnaround, however, was accounted for by increases in reverse 

repurchase agreements as well as in banks’ securities holdings, with the latter boosted 

as a few banks reportedly retained portions of their recent securitizations of consumer 

loans.  In contrast, core loans — that is, loans to nonfinancial businesses and 

households — continued to contract, shrinking at a 7 percent annual rate in May, 

likely reflecting an ongoing tightening of lending standards and terms along with weak

loan demand, and some shifts in funding from banks to long-term credit markets.  

Those trends in securities holdings and core loans continued, on balance, through 

early June.   

All major components of core loans contracted in May.  C&I loans dropped at 

about a 15 percent annual rate amid subdued origination activity and broad-based 

paydowns of outstanding loans. Real estate loans fell nearly 5 percent, reflecting 

declines in commercial real estate loans, home equity loans (the first such decline 

since October 2006), and closed-end residential mortgages.  Consumer loans, both 

those originated by and those retained by banks, edged down.  Meanwhile, large banks 

significantly increased their allowances for loan and lease losses again in May, 

suggesting continued worsening of credit quality in the second quarter.   

M2 expanded at an average annual rate of about ¾ percent over April and May, a 

sharp slowdown from the rate of growth observed in the first quarter.  Considerable 

inflows into bond and equity mutual funds during these months suggest that 

households might have shifted funds away from M2 assets as concerns about the 

financial crisis eased.  Within M2, flows into liquid deposits were offset by flows out 

of retail money market funds and small time deposits, likely in response to declining 

rates on money funds and consumer CDs.  Currency growth slowed in April and May, 

apparently due to a softening in foreign demand.  The monetary base continued its 

recent expansion in April and May, although at a slower pace than in the first quarter 

as the effect of Federal Reserve asset purchases on reserves was mostly offset by a 

drop in usage of liquidity facilities.

ECONOMIC OUTLOOK 

Information received since the April meeting suggests that the downturn  

in economic activity is abating.  Consumer spending appears to have leveled off  

in recent months, and the housing sector has exhibited signs of stabilization.   

Tempering the positive news, further deterioration in the labor market has boosted  

the unemployment rate to 9.4 percent, considerably higher than the staff projected 

last round.  

As in April, the Greenbook outlook is predicated on the assumption that the  

Federal Reserve will not implement any further liquidity or credit programs beyond 

those that have already been announced and will not further expand its large-scale 

asset purchase programs.  The staff also assumes that the federal funds rate will 

remain at exceptionally low levels for the next few years.   

In the staff’s projection, longer-term Treasury yields edge up slightly during  

the remainder of this year and in 2010; this rise is moderated by the assumption  

that financial market participants will gradually revise their expectations regarding  

the onset of federal funds rate tightening to match the timing assumed in the 

Greenbook.  Mortgage rates shift up in parallel with yields on longer-term Treasuries, 

whereas investment-grade corporate bond yields drop substantially as risk spreads 

continue to moderate from historically high levels.  The equity risk premium—which 

remains very high by historical standards—diminishes further over coming quarters, 

and hence equity prices rise at a fairly brisk annual rate of 15 percent through the end 

of 2010.  The foreign exchange value of the dollar is assumed to depreciate at an 

annual rate of about 2 percent over this horizon.  The spot price of West Texas 

Intermediate crude oil jumped almost 50 percent to $70 per barrel over the 

June 18, 2009 Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) Page 27 of 79



intermeeting period; readings from futures quotes indicate that this price is likely to 

reach about $80 per barrel by the end of next year.   

Against this backdrop, the staff now expects real GDP to grow at an annual rate 

of about 1 percent during the second half of 2009, roughly ¼ percentage point faster 

than in the April Greenbook but still about a percentage point below the staff’s 

estimate of the current growth rate of potential output.  The unemployment rate  

is projected to rise further, reaching a peak of 10 percent by the fourth quarter of  

this year.  The economy is expected to strengthen somewhat further next year, with 

real GDP growing at a rate of 3 percent and the unemployment rate declining slightly 

to about 9¾ percent by the end of 2010. 

Core PCE prices increased almost 2 percent at an annual rate during the first  

half of this year, boosted in part by the transitory effects of a hike in excise taxes on 

tobacco.  Excluding tobacco prices, core prices rose at a pace closer to 1¼ percent 

over the first half.  With no further boost from excise taxes expected in coming 

months, and given the current high level of economic slack, the staff projects that 

core PCE inflation will moderate over time, averaging just under 1 percent over  

the second half of this year and ¾ percent in 2010.  Reflecting the recent runup  

in the prices of energy and other commodities, headline PCE prices are expected  

to rise at an annual rate of about 2½ percent over the remainder of the year before 

moderating to about 1 percent next year.  

Looking further ahead, the staff assumes that the federal funds rate will remain at 

its effective lower bound until 2012 and then move up to about 4 percent by the end 

of 2013.  The staff forecasts that real GDP will expand at an average rate of about  

4¾ percent from 2011 through 2013, outpacing a rise in potential output that 

averages nearly 2½ percent per year.  As a result, the unemployment rate declines 

June 18, 2009 Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) Page 28 of 79



steadily, falling to 4.9 percent by late 2013—a bit below the staff’s estimate of the 

NAIRU.  As real activity recovers, PCE inflation slowly rises to 1.3 percent by 2013 

but still remains well below the assumed long-run inflation goal of 2 percent.

MONETARY POLICY STRATEGIES 

As shown in Chart 7, all of the staff’s estimates of short-run r*—the value of the 

real federal funds rate that would close the output gap within twelve quarters—have 

moved up since the April Bluebook.  The Greenbook-consistent measure of short-run 

r*  based on the FRB/US model, at about -2¾ percent, has risen by ½ percentage 

point since April, mainly reflecting higher stock prices, a lower foreign exchange value 

of the dollar, and lower corporate bond rates.  The same factors largely account for an 

upward revision of the FRB/US model estimate to -5½ percent, about 1¼ percentage 

points higher than reported in the previous Bluebook.  The FRB/US model estimate 

still lies substantially below the Greenbook-consistent estimate in part because the 

former does not incorporate some of the effects of nontraditional monetary policy 

that are embedded in the Greenbook projection.  The short-run r* estimate from the 

small structural model is now -3½ percent, and its marked increase since the April 

Bluebook is largely due to declines in the equity risk premium and the real corporate 

bond yield.  All of these estimates remain substantially below the current real funds 

rate of -1.6 percent.  By contrast, the estimate from the single-equation model, which 

depends only on the level of the output gap and the lagged real funds rate and so does 

not take account of the effects of financial market strains, is a bit above the actual real 

rate.   

In addition to the three models that have been employed in the past to generate 

estimates of short-run r*, this Bluebook introduces new measures derived from the 

EDO model (see box “Measures of the Equilibrium Real Interest Rate from a DSGE 

Model”).  The current estimate of Greenbook-consistent r* from EDO is about  

-4 percent; this estimate is noticeably below the FRB/US Greenbook-consistent 

estimate of -2¾ percent because the estimated boost to real activity that results from a 

sustained period of low real rates is smaller in EDO than in FRB/US.  The EDO

Measures of the Equilibrium Real Interest Rate from a DSGE Model 

Chart 7 includes two new measures of the equilibrium real short-term interest 
rate (r*) derived from a dynamic stochastic general-equilibrium (DSGE) model 
developed and estimated by the staff.  This model—an Estimated Dynamic 
Optimization model, called EDO—consists of a set of equations for the spending, 
production, and wage and price decisions of households and firms that are derived 
from explicit utility and profit maximization both under model-consistent 
expectations.  Research has demonstrated that the model fits many aspects of the 
data well and has good forecasting properties.1 

The EDO model is used to generate two r* measures.  The first measure, called 
the EDO estimate, is the level of the real short-term interest rate that would close 
the output gap—defined as the deviation of GDP from EDO’s estimate of its 
long-run trend—in twelve quarters given the model’s projection of economic 
conditions.  The figure below presents this estimate of r* from EDO (the red, 
dashed line) along with the actual real federal funds rate (the black line).  For the 
early part of this year, the EDO model estimates r* to be quite low by historical 
standards, but this measure has recently risen somewhat and is about -3¾ percent 
as of 2009Q2.  

 

                                           
1 A detailed description of the model is contained in Rochelle M. Edge, Michael T. Kiley, and Jean-Philippe 

Laforte, 2007, “Documentation of the Research and Statistics Division’s Estimated DSGE Model of the 
U.S. Economy: 2006 Version,” Finance and Economics Discussion Series 2007-53, Board of Governors of 
the Federal Reserve System.  The forecast performance of the model is considered in Rochelle M. Edge, 
Michael T. Kiley, and Jean-Philippe Laforte, 2009, “A Comparison of Forecast Performance between 
Federal Reserve Staff Forecasts, Simple Reduced-form Models, and a DSGE Model,” Finance and 
Economics Discussion Series 2009-10, Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System. 

June 18, 2009 Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) Page 32 of 79



The second measure of r*, called the Greenbook-consistent estimate from 
EDO, is the value that closes the output gap given the staff’s extended projection 
for the economy.  Discrepancies between Greenbook-consistent r* from EDO and 
Greenbook-consistent r* from FRB/US reflect differences across the models in the 
responses of activity and inflation to changes in interest rates.  The current estimate 
of Greenbook-consistent r* from EDO is about -4 percent.  The EDO 
Greenbook-consistent estimate lies below the FRB/US Greenbook-consistent 
estimate of around -2¾ percent because the boost to real activity from a sustained 
period of low real interest rates is smaller in EDO than in FRB/US. 2 

 

                                           
2 A DSGE model can also be used to generate an alternative concept called the natural real interest rate.  This 

value corresponds to the real interest rate consistent with “efficient” economic fluctuations, or fluctuations 
that would occur in the absence of economic distortions generated by the presence of nominal wage and 
price rigidities.  This concept is less prevalent in policy discussion and relies to a considerable extent on 
modeling assumptions (for example, regarding the structural rigidities in price and wage setting) that are not 
necessarily comparable across models.  For a discussion of the natural rate of interest in the EDO model, 
see Rochelle M. Edge, Michael T. Kiley, and Jean-Philippe Laforte, 2008. “Natural Rate Measures in an 
Estimated DSGE Model of the U.S. Economy,” Journal of Economic Dynamics and Control, vol. 32(8), pages 
2512-2535, August. 

June 18, 2009 Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) Page 33 of 79



model estimate of r* is about -3¾ percent, 1¾ percentage points higher than the 

FRB/US model estimate; the higher value reflects the faster waning of the surprising 

weakness in spending in the EDO model than in FRB/US. 

Chart 8 shows the result of optimal control simulations of the FRB/US model 

that were conducted using the extended staff forecast as a starting point.  

Policymakers are assumed to place equal weight on keeping core PCE inflation close 

to their 2 percent inflation goal, on keeping unemployment close to the NAIRU, and 

on avoiding changes in the federal funds rate.  The staff now estimates that the 

NAIRU is 5 percent—¼ percentage point higher than assumed in previous 

Bluebooks—reflecting the staff’s assessment that this recession’s very high rates of 

permanent job loss will raise the level of frictional unemployment.  As in recent 

Bluebooks, monetary policy remains severely constrained by the zero lower bound in 

these simulations, with the nominal funds rate remaining at the lower bound until late 

2012 (black solid lines).  Due to this constraint, the unemployment rate stays 

significantly above the NAIRU until 2012, and core PCE inflation remains noticeably 

below the 2 percent goal.   

Chart 8 also displays the optimal control results that would be obtained if the zero 

bound did not constrain the nominal funds rate (blue dashed lines).  Under this 

unconstrained policy, the funds rate falls to almost -8 percent next year and stays 

below zero until mid-2012; the real funds rate decreases to about -9 percent in 2010.  

Relative to the constrained policy, such a policy would reduce unemployment by 

about 1½ percentage points over the next few years and would put core PCE inflation 

on a significantly higher trajectory.  These paths for unemployment and inflation are 

slightly above those reported in the April Bluebook (red dotted lines), reflecting the 

net effect of the following three intermeeting developments.  First, the outlook for 

aggregate demand has improved, as evidenced by the increase in r* in Chart 7.

Second, since April the unemployment rate has continued to move up by more than 

would be expected given developments in spending and production, implying that the 

outlook for labor market slack, which is reflected in the calculation of the optimal 

policy path, has not improved despite the revision in r*.  Third, the current projection 

of core inflation is slightly higher than in the previous Greenbook, in part because 

long-run inflation expectations have not declined as anticipated over recent months, 

but if anything, have increased modestly. 

As depicted in Chart 9, the outcome-based policy rule prescribes a funds rate at its 

effective lower bound until mid-2011; the federal funds rate begins to increase about a 

quarter earlier than the prescription shown in the April Bluebook and is consistently 

above the April path by about 1 percentage point, largely reflecting the improvement 

in the outlook for aggregate demand.  Financial market participants expect that the 

federal funds rate will rise above 2 percent by 2011 and subsequently reach a plateau 

of about 4 percent.6  The expected funds rate path is significantly higher than in the 

previous Bluebook, reflecting increased optimism on the part of market participants 

about the economic outlook.  The distribution of the anticipated federal funds rate is 

quite wide, with the 90 percent confidence interval ranging from 1½ to 7½ percent in 

2013, and is skewed to the upside.  The federal funds rate path anticipated by market 

participants appears to involve a much earlier start to tightening than implied by the 

outcome-based rule.  For example, in the second quarter of 2011, the outcome-based 

rule prescribes a funds rate at the lower bound, whereas the funds rate expected by 

financial markets appears to be about 2½ percent. 

                                           
6 The staff has incorporated some technical adjustments in the calculation of the expected 

federal funds rate path and the confidence intervals since the April Bluebook.  To facilitate 
comparison, the upper right panel of Chart 9 displays the expected path and the confidence 
intervals for the current and previous Bluebooks based on the revised estimation 
procedure.

The lower panel of Chart 9 provides near-term prescriptions from simple policy 

rules.  As shown in the left-hand columns, all the prescriptions are at the effective 

lower bound.  The right-hand columns show the prescriptions that would be implied 

by these rules if the lower bound was not imposed.  Under this counterfactual 

condition, the Taylor (1993) rule prescribes a slightly negative funds rate for the next 

couple of quarters.  This prescription is higher than in the April Bluebook by about  

½ percentage point, consistent with the improvement in the economic outlook as 

summarized in the output gap and inflation.  The funds rate prescriptions of all the 

other simple rules are also higher than in April.

POLICY ALTERNATIVES 

This Bluebook presents three main policy alternatives—labeled A, B, and C—for 

the Committee’s consideration.  A variant of B, labeled as B´, is also presented.   

Table 1 gives an overview of key elements of these alternatives, and draft statements 

are provided on the following pages. 

Each of the alternatives refers to the slowing pace of economic contraction and to 

improvements in financial market conditions but has a distinct characterization of the 

outlook for economic activity and inflation.  Consistent with these distinctions, each 

alternative presents a different set of judgments regarding the appropriate path of 

monetary policy, including the anticipated funds rate trajectory, the total amount and 

composition of the Federal Reserve’s large-scale asset purchases (LSAPs), and the 

likely timing of the end of such purchases.   

In characterizing the incoming information on economic activity, all of the 

alternatives state that “indicators of consumer and business sentiment have risen”  

and note that household spending has shown “further signs” of stabilizing but 

remains constrained by “job losses, reduced housing wealth, and tight credit.”  Each 

statement also refers to cuts in business spending and staffing while adding that firms 

are or appear to be “making progress in bringing inventory stocks into better 

alignment with sales.”   

Regarding the prospects for economic recovery, Alternative A indicates that  

in the absence of further monetary policy stimulus, “the sharp rise in some longer-

term interest rates over recent months” could undermine the economic recovery. 

Alternative B reiterates the language from the April FOMC statement indicating that 

the Committee anticipates that economic activity “is likely to remain weak for a time” 

but that the policies now in train, together with market forces, “will contribute to a 

June 18, 2009 Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) Page 39 of 79



gradual resumption of sustainable economic growth in a context of price stability.”  

These two alternatives are not specific about the likely timing of the recovery, whereas 

Alternative C indicates that a gradual recovery “is expected to begin later this year.” 

As in the April FOMC statement, each alternative indicates that the Committee 

expects inflation “will remain subdued.”  In elaborating on this outlook, Alternatives  

A and B make reference to “substantial resource slack here and abroad,” while 

Alternative C does not refer to the degree of resource slack.  Alternatives B and C  

also note that the prices of energy and other commodities have risen “of late.”   

Following the language of the April statement, Alternative A indicates that the 

Committee still sees some downside risks to the inflation outlook, whereas 

Alternatives B and C do not comment on the risks to inflation. 

All of the alternatives maintain an unchanged target range of 0 to ¼ percent for  

the federal funds rate while providing forward guidance about the anticipated duration 

of this policy setting.  As in the previous two FOMC statements, Alternative B 

indicates that economic conditions are likely to warrant an exceptionally low funds 

rate “for an extended period.”  Alternative A includes an option under which the 

Committee would specify that the funds rate will likely remain exceptionally low  

“at least through mid-2010.”  Alternative C states that the funds rate is likely to 

remain at exceptionally low levels “until late this year.”   

Each alternative includes the continuation of the previously announced LSAPs.  

Alternative A expands the total size of the LSAP program by specifying that the 

Federal Reserve will purchase up to $750 billion in Treasury securities and indicating 

that those purchases will be conducted through the end of this year.  Alternatives B 

and C make no changes to the maximum amounts or timing of securities purchases.   

June 18, 2009 Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) Page 40 of 79



All of the alternatives include language stating that the Committee will continue  

to evaluate the timing, composition, and amounts of the LSAPs based on financial 

market conditions and the economic outlook.  Alternatives A and B indicate that  

any additional purchases beyond the announced amounts will be evaluated in view  

of “the necessity of assuring that policy accommodation can ultimately be withdrawn 

smoothly and at the appropriate time,” thereby underscoring the importance of the 

exit strategy in the Committee’s decision-making process.  In contrast, Alternative B´ 

does not include this additional phrase.  Alternative C indicates that the Committee 

expects that the pace of LSAPs “will taper off gradually by the end of this year” and 

hence that this program is unlikely to be expanded or prolonged. 

FOMC statements since last December have indicated that the Federal Reserve 

will employ “all available tools” in promoting economic recovery and preserving price 

stability, whereas the alternatives presented here modify this phrase by referring to  

“a wide array of tools.”  Moreover, each of the alternatives concludes by stating that 

the Committee will continue to monitor the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet and that 

adjustments to credit and liquidity programs will be made “as warranted” by evolving 

economic and financial conditions.  These adjustments to the statement language 

could be particularly appropriate if policymakers determine that some liquidity 

facilities should be discontinued in light of the recent improvements in financial 

market functioning.7

April FOMC Statement 

Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in March 
indicates that the economy has continued to contract, though the pace of contraction 
appears to be somewhat slower.  Household spending has shown signs of stabilizing 
but remains constrained by ongoing job losses, lower housing wealth, and tight credit.  
Weak sales prospects and difficulties in obtaining credit have led businesses to cut 
back on inventories, fixed investment, and staffing.  Although the economic outlook 
has improved modestly since the March meeting, partly reflecting some easing of 
financial market conditions, economic activity is likely to remain weak for a time.  
Nonetheless, the Committee continues to anticipate that policy actions to stabilize 
financial markets and institutions, fiscal and monetary stimulus, and market forces  
will contribute to a gradual resumption of sustainable economic growth in a context 
of price stability.   

In light of increasing economic slack here and abroad, the Committee expects that 
inflation will remain subdued.  Moreover, the Committee sees some risk that inflation 
could persist for a time below rates that best foster economic growth and price 
stability in the longer term. 

In these circumstances, the Federal Reserve will employ all available tools to promote 
economic recovery and to preserve price stability.  The Committee will maintain  
the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to ¼ percent and anticipates that 
economic conditions are likely to warrant exceptionally low levels of the federal  
funds rate for an extended period.  As previously announced, to provide support to 
mortgage lending and housing markets and to improve overall conditions in private 
credit markets, the Federal Reserve will purchase a total of up to $1.25 trillion of 
agency mortgage-backed securities and up to $200 billion of agency debt by the end  
of the year.  In addition, the Federal Reserve will buy up to $300 billion of Treasury 
securities by autumn.  The Committee will continue to evaluate the timing and overall 
amounts of its purchases of securities in light of the evolving economic outlook  
and conditions in financial markets.  The Federal Reserve is facilitating the extension  
of credit to households and businesses and supporting the functioning of financial 
markets through a range of liquidity programs.  The Committee will continue to 
carefully monitor the size and composition of the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet  
in light of financial and economic developments.

 June FOMC Statement — Alternative A

1. Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in April 
suggests that the pace of economic contraction is slowing.  Indicators of 
consumer and business sentiment have risen, and household expenditures  
have shown further signs of stabilizing; nonetheless, spending remains constrained 
by ongoing job losses, lower housing wealth, and tight credit.  Businesses continue 
to cut back on fixed investment and staffing but are making progress in bringing 
inventory stocks into better alignment with sales.  Although conditions in 
financial markets have generally improved, the Committee judges that further 
monetary policy stimulus is warranted to help ensure that the sharp rise in 
some longer-term interest rates over recent months does not undermine  
a recovery in overall economic activity. 

2. Substantial resource slack is likely to persist here and abroad, and the Committee 
expects that inflation will remain subdued.  Moreover, the Committee still sees some 
risk that inflation could persist for a time below rates that best foster economic 
growth and price stability in the longer term.   

3. In these circumstances, the Federal Reserve is employing a wide array of tools  
to promote economic recovery and to preserve price stability.  The Committee will 
maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to ¼ percent and anticipates 
that economic conditions are likely to warrant exceptionally low levels of the federal 
funds rate [for an extended period|at least through mid-2010].  To provide 
additional support to mortgage lending and housing markets and to facilitate 
further improvement in private credit market conditions, the Committee  
decided to increase the total amount of its large-scale securities purchases.   
The Committee now anticipates that over the course of this year the Federal 
Reserve will purchase up to $1.25 trillion of agency mortgage-backed securities,  
up to $200 billion of agency debt, and up to $750 billion of Treasury securities.   
The Committee will evaluate the timing, composition, and amounts of any 
additional purchases of securities in view of market conditions, the evolving 
economic outlook, and the necessity of assuring that policy accommodation 
can ultimately be withdrawn smoothly and at the appropriate time.   
The Federal Reserve will also be monitoring the size and composition of its  
balance sheet and will make adjustments to its credit and liquidity programs  
as warranted in light of financial and economic developments.

be monitoring the size and composition of its balance sheet and will make 
adjustments to its credit and liquidity programs as warranted in light of

THE CASE FOR ALTERNATIVE B 

If policymakers judge that the monetary policy stimulus already in train is likely  

to foster economic and financial conditions that improve at an acceptable pace, then  

the Committee could choose to reiterate its previous forward policy guidance and  

to continue implementing the previously announced LSAPs while providing further 

clarification of its strategy for these purchases, as in Alternative B.  The Committee’s 

modal outlook may be broadly similar to that of the Greenbook, in which this  

policy stance contributes to a gradual acceleration in economic activity and to  

an unemployment rate trajectory that peaks later this year and then moves lower  

next year.  The indication that the federal funds rate is likely to remain exceptionally 

low “for an extended period” is consistent with the funds rate path prescribed by the 

constrained optimal control policy (Chart 8) and with that implied by the estimated 

outcome-based rule (Chart 9); moreover, given various sources of uncertainty about 

the evolution of economic and financial conditions, this expression may be helpful in 

preserving the Committee’s flexibility regarding the timing of its initiation of funds 

rate tightening.  

The Committee may also judge that developments over the intermeeting period—

including improved financial market functioning, the ability of banking institutions to 

raise significant amounts of private capital, the pickup in consumer and business 

sentiment, and the recent stabilization of household spending—point to a waning  

of downside risks to economic growth and inflation.  Even if Committee members 

remain concerned about significant downside risks to inflation stemming from their 

expectation of persistently elevated resource slack, they may also perceive a similar 

degree of upside risks to inflation associated with the possibility that inflation 

expectations could shift upward as a consequence of large federal budget deficits, 

June 18, 2009 Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) Page 48 of 79



exceptionally low levels of the federal funds rate, and the extraordinary size of the 

Federal Reserve’s balance sheet. 

While participants may anticipate—as in the projections they submitted in April—

that economic activity is likely to recover only gradually over the next few years, they 

may see the slow pace of this recovery as largely unavoidable in light of the nature and 

severity of the global financial crisis and the time required for healing of the financial 

system and for the other structural adjustments—such as the overhaul of the 

automobile sector—that are now underway.  Even if policymakers would prefer  

to foster a speedier recovery, they might be concerned that measures for providing 

further monetary stimulus could turn out to be counterproductive.  For example, 

expanding the total amount of purchases of Treasury securities could lead to an 

increase in private nominal and real borrowing rates if investors interpreted this  

policy as pointing towards possible future monetization of federal budget deficits and 

hence required greater compensation for inflation risk in nominal lending contracts. 

Committee members may perceive substantial benefits of providing additional 

guidance regarding the LSAP program in the statement for this meeting, especially  

if the recent upswing in measures of implied and realized volatility in Treasury bond 

markets is seen as partly reflecting investor uncertainty about the Committee’s LSAP 

strategy.8  First, stating that the Committee “may modify the timing and composition 

of these purchases in view of market conditions” could help signal that policymakers 

are prepared to be flexible in adjusting these aspects of the LSAP program.  As a case 

in point, if the recent rise in mortgage rates persists over coming months and induces 

                                           
8 As discussed in Appendix I of the memo “Large-Scale Asset Purchases:  Recent 

Experience and Some Policy Considerations” that was sent to the Committee on June 16, 
2009, theoretical and empirical research generally confirms that policy communications can 
significantly reduce the volatility of asset prices when market participants have imperfect 
information about the structure of the economy or the objectives of policymakers. 

June 18, 2009 Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) Page 49 of 79



a slower pace of refinancing, the Committee might conclude that the timeframe for 

completing its agency MBS purchases should be extended into the first quarter of 

next year or that the composition of purchases should be adjusted.  By indicating  

that policy accommodation will be “withdrawn smoothly,” the Committee could  

help underscore that the LSAPs are likely to taper off rather than ending abruptly.  

Finally, policymakers may wish to underscore the importance of maintaining a viable 

exit strategy by indicating that the Committee will take careful account of the need  

for policy accommodation to be withdrawn “at the appropriate time” in evaluating 

any securities purchases beyond the amounts that have already been announced.9 

Financial markets are likely to react only modestly to an announcement like that 

of Alternative B in which the Committee reiterates its forward policy guidance and 

maintains the LSAP program at the previously announced amounts.  Based on the 

latest Desk survey, dealers generally anticipate that at this meeting the Committee  

will continue to state that the funds rate is likely to remain exceptionally low “for an 

extended period.”  Dealers also place low odds on the possibility that the Committee’s 

announcement at this meeting will include an increase in the maximum amount of 

purchases of Treasury securities, agency MBS, or agency debt.  The survey indicates 

that dealers currently expect that the Federal Reserve’s purchases of Treasury 

securities will reach the announced maximum of $300 billion by autumn and that  

a majority of dealers anticipate that an additional amount in the range of $50 to  

$150 billion will be purchased during the fourth quarter.  Dealers expect that 

purchases of agency MBS and agency debt will reach the previously announced 

maximum amounts by December.  No additional LSAP purchases are anticipated 

beyond the end of this year. 

                                           
9 For further discussion of various exit strategies, see the memo “Reserve Management 

Tools to Target a Higher Policy Rate” that was sent to the Committee on June 12, 2009. 

June 18, 2009 Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) Page 50 of 79



Nonetheless, the market reaction to a statement like that of Alternative B might 

also depend on how investors interpret the new language describing the Committee’s 

evaluation of further adjustments to the LSAP program.  For example, the reference 

to “possible purchases beyond the amounts already announced” could cause investors 

to raise their assessment of the likelihood of expanding the total amount of LSAPs.  

On the other hand, market participants might interpret the clause referring to “the 

necessity of assuring that policy accommodation can ultimately be withdrawn” as 

indicating a high hurdle to any such expansion and as suggesting that the Committee 

has become more concerned about the viability of its exit strategy.  Moreover,  

the announcement could prompt some persistent volatility in asset prices as  

these interpretations continued to evolve.  On net, short- and long-term yields,  

equity prices, and the foreign exchange value of the dollar might not move  

very substantially, but judging the likely response of financial markets to this 

statement is subject to considerable uncertainty. 

If members’ assessment of the current outlook and the appropriate stance of 

policy matches that of Alternative B, but they see a significant risk that the associated 

statement could cause confusion on the part of financial market participants, then  

the Committee might wish to follow the language of the April FOMC statement  

more closely, as in Alternative B´.  The financial market reaction to the publication  

of a statement like Alternative B´ would likely be muted, with little change in yields, 

equity prices, or the foreign exchange value of the dollar. 

THE CASE FOR ALTERNATIVE A 

If policymakers judge that a protracted period of substantial resource slack 

continues to pose downside risks to inflation and if they are concerned that the recent 

increase in some longer-term interest rates could undermine the economic recovery, 

then the Committee may wish to expand the total amount of purchases of Treasury 

June 18, 2009 Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) Page 51 of 79



securities and to extend the timeframe for conducting those purchases, as in 

Alternative A.  Even if participants generally agree with the contours of the staff’s 

modal outlook, they may not view that outcome as acceptable and may see compelling 

grounds for providing increased monetary policy stimulus to promote a more rapid 

pace of recovery and to help keep inflation from falling persistently below rates 

consistent with the Federal Reserve’s dual mandate.  Indeed, the optimal control 

simulations depicted in Chart 8 indicate that the real federal funds rate would be 

substantially lower and would foster significantly better outcomes for unemployment 

and inflation if the nominal funds rate were not constrained by the effective  

lower bound; thus, these simulations may provide motivation for policymakers  

to expand the degree of monetary stimulus provided through nontraditional policies 

such as LSAPs.  

Policymakers may view the upward shift in mortgage rates over the intermeeting 

period as posing a significant threat to the stabilization of the housing sector that 

could put further pressure on financial institutions and economic activity.  Moreover, 

members may perceive a number of other factors as augmenting the magnitude of the 

downside risks, such as those considered in the “False Dawn” and “Deflation” 

scenarios in the Greenbook.  Thus, the Committee may conclude that an expansion of 

the LSAP program is warranted to reduce longer-term yields or at least to mitigate any 

further increases in such yields, thereby limiting the downside risks to the economy. 

As noted in recent staff analysis, the Committee may see expanded Treasury 

securities purchases as the most suitable means of implementing an expansion in the 

overall size of the LSAP program, given that the current flow of the Federal Reserve’s 

purchases of Treasury securities is relatively small in comparison with the amount of 

June 18, 2009 Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) Page 52 of 79



new issuance of those securities.10  In contrast, the monthly volume of agency MBS 

purchases already constitutes a large share of new issuance, and a further increase 

might be particularly problematic if the pace of mortgage refinancing falls off further 

in coming months.  Expanded purchases of agency securities would appear to be 

inadvisable in light of their narrow spreads and shrinking supply. 

Since market participants reportedly see only small odds that the Committee  

will announce an expansion of its securities purchases at this meeting, it is likely  

that longer-term yields would fall substantially following the release of a statement  

like that accompanying Alternative A.  Although considerable uncertainty surrounds  

any assessment of the effects of LSAPs on asset prices, recent experience suggests 

that an expansion of $450 billion in purchases of Treasury securities would induce  

a decline of about 20 to 45 basis points in Treasury yields and other longer-term rates 

immediately following the announcement.  Equity prices would likely climb, and the 

foreign exchange value of the dollar would fall.  Forward inflation compensation 

could increase if this announcement led to a heightening of investor concerns 

regarding the Federal Reserve’s exit strategy or the future monetization of federal 

budget deficits. 

THE CASE FOR ALTERNATIVE C 

If policymakers are reasonably confident that an economic recovery will begin  

during the second half of this year and that laying the foundations for a gradual 

withdrawal of monetary stimulus would thus be appropriate under present 

circumstances, they may judge that the LSAP program should taper off this fall and 

that an increased funds rate might well be warranted at the end of this year or early 

                                           
10 See section IV of the memo “Large-Scale Asset Purchases:  Recent Experience and Some 

Policy Considerations” that was sent to the Committee on June 16, 2009.  

June 18, 2009 Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) Page 53 of 79



next year, as in Alternative C.  Given the recent behavior of inflation expectations,  

the somewhat smaller margin of projected resource slack, and the rises in the prices of 

energy and other commodities, the Committee may now see the risks to the inflation 

outlook as roughly balanced, with significantly diminished odds of excessive 

disinflation.  Participants may also prefer to assign relatively little weight to real-time 

estimates of resource slack in projecting the likely path of inflation and in assessing 

the risks to the inflation outlook.  Uncertainties about the path of potential output 

and the level of the NAIRU might be seen as particularly high in the current context 

of structural changes related to the financial crisis, the housing collapse, and the 

overhaul of the auto sector.  

In light of the recent pickup in forward inflation compensation, policymakers  

may also determine that a preemptive move towards reducing policy accommodation 

would be appropriate to help ensure that long-term inflation expectations do not  

drift upward over coming quarters.  Moreover, participants may perceive a substantial 

likelihood that the recuperation of financial markets and institutions could contribute 

to a stronger rebound in economic activity than the staff projects, as illustrated by the 

Greenbook’s “Early Liftoff” scenario.   

An announcement like that of Alternative C would come as a considerable 

surprise to financial market participants and would likely lead many investors to 

expect a significantly less accommodative path of monetary policy than they had 

previously anticipated.  The Desk survey indicates that primary dealers uniformly 

expect that the Committee’s statement at this meeting will reiterate the same forward 

policy guidance as in recent FOMC statements.  Only one-third of the dealers expect 

the federal funds rate to be raised above its effective lower bound by next June, while 

another third expect the initial rate hike to occur during the second half of 2010,  

and the remainder do not expect tightening before 2011.  Thus, the publication of a 

June 18, 2009 Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) Page 54 of 79



statement like Alternative C would likely push up short- and long-term yields and the 

foreign exchange value of the dollar, while equity prices would likely fall.  Forward 

inflation compensation might decline if the statement were seen as signaling the 

Federal Reserve’s determination to avoid a significant increase in inflation.

LONG‐RUN PROJECTIONS OF THE BALANCE SHEET AND MONETARY BASE 

Under the Federal Reserve’s current policy approach, the size of the Federal 

Reserve’s balance sheet is driven by the evolution of its assets, specifically, the scale of 

asset purchases and demand for Federal Reserve liquidity facilities and credit 

programs.  Total liabilities are determined by total assets, and the composition of 

liabilities depends on currency demand and other factors on the liability side, with 

reserve balances determined as a residual.   

Two balance sheet scenarios are presented here; they differ in their assumptions 

regarding asset purchases.  The first scenario is a baseline scenario, which includes the 

maximum of large-scale asset purchases previously announced by the FOMC: 

$300 billion of Treasury securities by the autumn, $200 billion of agency debt by the 

end of this year, and $1,250 billion of agency mortgage-backed securities (MBS) by the 

end of this year.  This baseline scenario corresponds to Alternative B in the Policy 

Alternatives section.  The second scenario is an expanded purchases scenario, which 

corresponds to Alternative A in the Policy Alternatives section, where purchases of 

Treasury securities are increased by $450 billion to $750 billion, and the purchases 

continue through the end of this year.   

To construct the projections, we made assumptions about all components of the 

balance sheet other than reserve balances, which are the residual item.  On the asset 

side of the balance sheet, the foreign central bank liquidity swap lines and the Term 

Auction Facility (TAF) are assumed to wind down by year-end 2010 as financial 

markets continue to improve.  The assets held by Maiden Lane LLC, Maiden Lane II 

LLC, and Maiden Lane III LLC are assumed to be sold over time; they reach zero by 

2015.  The Term Asset-Backed Securities Loan Facility (TALF) is assumed to reach its 

peak at $175 billion–well below the announced $1 trillion limit–at the end of 2010.  

June 18, 2009 Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) Page 56 of 79



The first phase of the TALF makes $125 billion of three-year loans by the end of 

2010; later phases are assumed to make $50 billion of five-year loans by that date.  

Other Section 13(3) facilities are assumed to be extended beyond October 30, 2009, 

but are expected to run off by the end of 2010 in a similar fashion to the swap lines.  

For large-scale asset purchases, the baseline path of purchases matches the assumed 

path in the Greenbook whereas the expanded purchases scenario boosts Treasury 

purchases; both scenarios assume that the assets purchased are held to maturity.  For 

the projection of MBS holdings, a slower-than-average path for the prepayment of 

MBS implies that more than half of the MBS purchased are still on the balance sheet 

in 2016. 

Relative to the April Bluebook, there are two notable changes to the projections 

for assets.  First, the TALF is assumed to make a total of $175 billion in loans, sharply 

less than the $500 billion in total loans assumed in the last Bluebook.  This revision 

reflects experience to date with the uptake of the facility.  A second significant 

revision comes from the prepayment rate assumed for MBS holdings.  Higher interest 

rates in this projection and a reassessment of the models used to make these 

projections have led the staff to mark down the assumed prepayment rate of the MBS, 

implying holdings that are about $185 billion higher in 2016 than in the last Bluebook.  

In addition to these changes, holdings of agency debt are assumed to mature a bit 

more quickly than last round.  Some of the other lending facilities are now seen as 

running off slightly faster than was previously projected in light of the improvement 

in financial markets.  All told, total assets at year-end 2009 are about $500 billion 

lower in this projection compared with that presented in the April Bluebook.  

However, by the end of the projection period in 2016, total assets are in line with the 

April Bluebook projection.   

June 18, 2009 Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) Page 57 of 79



On the liability side of the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet, both scenarios assume 

that currency (Federal Reserve notes) grows at the same rate as the staff forecast for 

money stock currency through 2010 and after that point expands at the projected 

growth rate of nominal GDP in the extended Greenbook forecast.  The Treasury’s 

Supplementary Financing Account is projected to wind down by the middle of 2010, 

and the U.S. Treasury’s general account is assumed to return to its historical target 

level of $5 billion by the end of 2009.  All other liabilities other than reverse 

repurchase agreements and reserve balances are assumed to be constant at their level 

as of May 29, 2009.  Federal Reserve Bank capital is projected to grow in line with its 

average pace of expansion over the past ten years.  Relative to the April Bluebook, the 

staff has made only modest changes to the assumptions for liabilities.  The 

Supplementary Financing Account is now assumed to stay at its current level of 

$200 billion somewhat longer, based on statements made by the Treasury in its last 

quarterly financing estimates.  The assumption about capital replaces the previous 

assumption that capital was constant. 11   

These projections for liabilities and capital, combined with the assumed path for 

assets, imply a path for reserve balances under each scenario.  In both scenarios, the 

implied level of reserve balances rises rapidly until the end of 2009, and then declines 

through the end of the projection period.  Relative to the April Bluebook, the level of 

reserve balances is lower for the next few years, primarily reflecting the smaller 

assumed size of the TALF program.  However, from 2013 forward, the slower 

prepayment rate assumed for MBS holdings leads to a somewhat higher level of 

reserve balances.  

Under both scenarios, the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet expands rapidly over 

the course of 2009.  For the baseline scenario, the balance sheet reaches a peak of 
                                           
11 More details on the assumptions are provided in Appendix C.

$2.8 trillion in the fourth quarter of 2009 and then declines to a level just below 

$1.5 trillion at the end of the projection period.  For the expanded scenario, the peak 

is at the same date, but at a higher level of $3.3 trillion.  Assets then decline to roughly 

the same level as in the baseline at the end of the projection period.  Relative to the 

last Bluebook, the peak under either scenario is lower because of the assumed usage 

of the TALF and the runoff of other liquidity facilities.  By the end of the forecast 

period, the projected size of the balance sheet is in line with the last Bluebook.   

The composition of Federal Reserve assets in both of these projections differs 

notably from historical patterns.  Prior to August 2007, U.S. Treasury securities were 

about 90 percent of assets and the Federal Reserve did not hold any agency mortgage-

backed securities.  By contrast, under the baseline scenario, Treasuries are projected to 

account for only around one-fourth of total assets at the end of 2009 and rise to just 

40 percent of total assets at the end of the projection period.  Even under the 

expanded purchases scenario, Treasury securities account for only about one-third of 

assets at the end of 2009.   

Projections for the growth rates of the monetary base are derived from these 

balance sheet projections using the sum of Federal Reserve notes in circulation and 

reserve balances.12  Under both scenarios, the monetary base expands rapidly in 2009 

and into early 2010.  In the second quarter of 2010, however, as the liquidity facilities 

wind down and asset purchases cease, the monetary base begins to contract; the base 

continues to decline through the remainder of the projection period despite continued 

growth in currency. 

                                           
12 The calculated growth rates of the monetary base presented in the table are based on an 

approximation for month-average values.  In the April Bluebook, the calculation was based 
on month-end values.  The April values shown in this table use the new methodology.   

June 18, 2009 Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) Page 59 of 79



The extended Greenbook projection shows the target federal funds rate rising 

from the current 0 to ¼ percent range to 2.4 percent over the course of 2012.  Under 

the operating procedures employed before the financial crisis, the projected 2012 end-

of-year reserve balances of approximately $800 billion would not have been consistent 

with a federal funds rate significantly above zero.  If the interest rate paid on excess 

reserve balances becomes an effective floor for the federal funds rate, a higher target 

rate could be achieved even with quite elevated reserve balances simply by raising the 

excess reserves rate.  The experience last autumn, however, suggests that the Desk 

would likely need to drain reserves through open market operations to keep the funds 

rate close to the excess reserves rate.  The projection for the balance sheet implicitly 

assumes that alternative operating procedures can be put into place to achieve the 

path for the federal funds rate assumed in the Greenbook projection; such procedures 

might employ a range of tools such as reverse repurchase agreements, outright sales of 

securities, a term deposit facility, or other strategies.13   

  

                                           
13 A discussion of the issues surrounding tools to raise the federal funds rate can be found in 

a memorandum to the FOMC dated June 12, 2009 “Reserve Management Tools to Target 
a Higher Policy Rate.”

BANK CREDIT, DEBT, AND MONEY FORECASTS 

Bank credit is forecast to decline about 1 percent in 2009, reflecting weak loan 

demand and tight credit standards and terms, and to expand 4¾ percent in 2010.  

C&I loans are projected to grow only modestly through 2010, as business spending 

stays weak and some firms continue to substitute other sources of funding for bank 

loans.  Real estate loans will likely keep contracting this year amid higher mortgage 

rates and weak residential investment spending.  These loans are expected to grow 

modestly in 2010 as conditions in the housing sector begin to improve.  After staying 

about flat this year, consumer loans are also forecast to resume expanding in 2010, 

reflecting renewed growth in personal consumption expenditures and a pickup in 

nominal GDP growth.  An expansion in banks’ holdings of securities is also expected 

to support bank credit growth in 2010.    

Growth of domestic nonfinancial sector debt is forecast to be below its second-

quarter pace over the next few quarters and then to pick up somewhat in 2010 as the 

economy recovers.  Household debt is projected to edge lower and then remain weak 

next year, reflecting continuing declines in house prices, the sharply elevated level of 

unemployment, and lending standards that ease only slowly.  Similarly, business 

borrowing is forecast to remain sluggish, although it strengthens a bit next year in 

response to a pickup in capital expenditures and some improvement in credit 

conditions.  By contrast, federal government debt is expected to continue to increase 

rapidly over the forecast period, primarily reflecting the lower tax revenues and 

increased spending associated with the recession as well as the budget costs of the 

large fiscal stimulus package.      

M2 is projected to grow 3¾ percent in 2009, well above the rate of nominal GDP 

growth, boosted by the lagged effects of declines in opportunity cost as well as an 

June 18, 2009 Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) Page 64 of 79



increased preference for safe and liquid assets in view of heightened volatility in 

financial markets in recent quarters.  After growing robustly in the first half of 2009, 

M2 is expected to contract slightly in the second half of the year as the financial 

markets continue to recover and some of these safe-haven flows unwind.  In 2010, 

M2 growth is expected to pick up gradually over the course of the year, but the 

aggregate is forecast to expand only 2¼ percent for the year as a whole.  The rise in 

M2 velocity next year reflects some continued unwinding of the buildup in M2 that 

was related to the financial crisis.

DIRECTIVE 

The April directive and draft language for the June directive are provided below. 

APRIL FOMC MEETING  

The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and financial conditions that 

will foster price stability and promote sustainable growth in output.  To further its 

long-run objectives, the Committee seeks conditions in reserve markets consistent 

with federal funds trading in a range from 0 to ¼ percent.  The Committee directs the 

Desk to purchase agency debt, agency MBS, and longer-term Treasury securities 

during the intermeeting period with the aim of providing support to private credit 

markets and economic activity.  The timing and pace of these purchases should 

depend on conditions in the markets for such securities and on a broader assessment 

of private credit market conditions.  The Committee anticipates that the combination 

of outright purchases and various liquidity facilities outstanding will cause the size of 

the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet to expand significantly in coming months.  The 

Desk is expected to purchase up to $200 billion in housing-related agency debt by the 

end of this year.  The Desk is expected to purchase at least $500 billion in agency 

MBS by the end of the second quarter of this year and is expected to purchase up to 

$1.25 trillion of these securities by the end of this year.  The Desk is expected to 

purchase up to $300 billion of longer-term Treasury securities by the end of the third 

quarter.  The System Open Market Account Manager and the Secretary will keep the 

Committee informed of ongoing developments regarding the System's balance sheet 

that could affect the attainment over time of the Committee's objectives of maximum 

employment and price stability.

Measure  Description 

Single-
equation 

Model 

The measure of the equilibrium real rate in the single-equation model is based on an 
estimated aggregate-demand relationship between the current value of the output gap and its 
lagged values as well as the lagged values of the real federal funds rate. 

Small 
Structural 

Model 

The small-scale model of the economy consists of equations for six variables: the output 
gap, the equity premium, the federal budget surplus, the trend growth rate of output, the real 
bond yield, and the real federal funds rate. 

EDO 
Model 

Estimates of the equilibrium real rate using EDO—an estimated dynamic-stochastic-
general-equilibrium (DSGE) model of the U.S. economy—depend on data for major 
spending categories, price and wages, and the federal funds rate as well as the model’s 
structure and estimate of the output gap. 

FRB/US 
Model 

Estimates of the equilibrium real rate using FRB/US—the staff’s large-scale econometric 
model of the U.S. economy—depend on a very broad array of economic factors, some of 
which take the form of projected values of the model’s exogenous variables. 

Greenbook-
consistent 

Two measures are presented—based on the FRB/US and the EDO models.  Both models 
are matched to the extended Greenbook forecast.  Model simulations determine the value of 
the real federal funds rate that closes the output gap conditional on the extended baseline. 

TIPS-based 
Factor 
Model 

Yields on TIPS (Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities) reflect investors’ expectations of 
the future path of real interest rates.  The TIPS-based measure of the equilibrium real rate is 
constructed using the seven-year-ahead instantaneous real forward rate derived from TIPS 
yields as of the Bluebook publication date.  This forward rate is adjusted to remove 
estimates of the term and liquidity premiums based on a three-factor arbitrage-free term-
structure model applied to TIPS yields, nominal yields, and inflation. 

APPENDIX A:  MEASURES OF THE EQUILIBRIUM REAL RATE 

The equilibrium real rate is the real federal funds rate that, if maintained, would be projected to 
return output to its potential level over time.  The short-run equilibrium rate is defined as the rate 
that would close the output gap in twelve quarters given the corresponding model’s projection of 
the economy.  The medium-run concept is the value of the real federal funds rate projected to keep 
output at potential in seven years, under the assumption that monetary policy acts to bring actual 
and potential output into line in the short run and then keeps them equal thereafter.  The TIPS-
based factor model measure provides an estimate of market expectations for the real federal funds 
rate seven years ahead.  

The actual real federal funds rate is constructed as the difference between the nominal rate and 
realized inflation, where the nominal rate is measured as the quarterly average of the observed 
federal funds rate, and realized inflation is given by the log difference between the core PCE price 
index and its lagged value four quarters earlier.  If the upcoming FOMC meeting falls early in the 
quarter, the lagged inflation measure ends in the last quarter.  For the current quarter, the nominal 
rate is specified as the target federal funds rate on the Bluebook publication date.

used in the Equilibrium Real Federal Funds Rate chart; lagged four-quarter headline PCE inflation; 
and projected four-quarter headline PCE inflation beginning with the next quarter.  For each 
estimate of the real rate, the table also provides the Greenbook-consistent measure of the short-run 
equilibrium real rate and the average actual real federal funds rate over the next twelve quarters.

APPENDIX B:  ANALYSIS OF POLICY PATHS AND CONFIDENCE INTERVALS 

RULE SPECIFICATIONS   
For the following rules, it denotes the federal funds rate for quarter t, while the explanatory variables 
include the staff’s projection of trailing four-quarter core PCE inflation (πt), inflation two and three 
quarters ahead (πt+2|t and πt+3|t), the output gap in the current period and one quarter ahead ( *t ty y−  
and *1| 1|t t t ty y+ +− ), and the three-quarter-ahead forecast of annual average GDP growth relative to 
potential ( 4 *3| 3|t t t ty y+ +Δ ), and *π  denotes an assumed value of policymakers’ long-run inflation 
objective.  The outcome-based and forecast-based rules were estimated using real-time data over the 
sample 1988:1-2006:4; each specification was chosen using the Bayesian information criterion. Each 
rule incorporates a 75 basis point shift in the intercept, specified as a sequence of 25 basis point 
increments during the first three quarters of 1998.  The first two simple rules were proposed by 
Taylor (1993, 1999).  The prescriptions of the first-difference rule do not depend on assumptions 
regarding r* or the level of the output gap; see Orphanides (2003). 

4− Δ

Outcome-based rule it =  1.20it-1–0.39it-2+0.19[1.17  + 1.73 πt  + 3.66( *t ty y− )  – 2.72( *1 1t ty y− −− )] 

Forecast-based rule it =  1.18it-1–0.38it-2+0.20[0.98 +1.72 πt+2|t+2.29( *1| 1|t t t ty y+ +− )–1.37( *1 1t ty y− −− )] 

Taylor (1993) rule it = 2 + πt + 0.5(πt – *π ) + 0.5( *t ty y− ) 

Taylor (1999) rule it = 2 + πt + 0.5(πt – *π ) + ( *t ty y− ) 

First-difference rule it = it-1 + 0.5(πt+3|t – *π ) + 0.5( 4 4 *3| 3|t t t ty y+ +Δ − Δ ) 

FRB/US MODEL SIMULATIONS   
Prescriptions from the two empirical rules are computed using dynamic simulations of the FRB/US 
model, implemented as though the rule were followed starting at this FOMC meeting.  The dotted 
line labeled “Previous Bluebook” is based on the current specification of the policy rule, applied to 
the previous Greenbook projection.  Confidence intervals are based on stochastic simulations of the 
FRB/US model with shocks drawn from the estimated residuals over 1969-2008.  

INFORMATION FROM FINANCIAL MARKETS   
The expected funds rate path is based on forward rate agreement quotes and implied three-month 
forward rates from swaps, and the confidence intervals for this path are constructed using prices of 
interest rate caps.  

NEAR‐TERM PRESCRIPTIONS OF SIMPLE POLICY RULES   
These prescriptions are calculated using Greenbook projections for inflation and the output gap. 
Because the first-difference rule involves the lagged funds rate, the value labeled “Previous 
Bluebook” for the current quarter is computed using the actual value of the lagged funds rate, and 
the one-quarter-ahead prescriptions are based on this rule’s prescription for the current quarter.

APPENDIX C:  LONG‐RUN PROJECTIONS OF THE BALANCE SHEET AND 
MONETARY BASE  

This appendix presents more detail on the assumptions underlying the long-run projections of the 
Federal Reserve’s balance sheet and the monetary base shown in the section entitled “Long-run 
Projections of the Balance Sheet and Monetary Base.” 

GENERAL ASSUMPTIONS 
The projections are constructed on a monthly frequency from June 2009 to December 2016.  The 
few balance sheet items that are not discussed below are assumed to be constant over the projection 
period at the level reported in the May 29, 2009, H.4.1 Statistical Release.  The projections for all 
major asset and liability categories are summarized in the charts and table that follow the bullet 
points. 

ASSETS 

Asset Purchases 

• The baseline scenario incorporates only those asset purchases that have already been 
announced.  The Desk purchases a total of $300 billion of Treasury securities (by September 
2009), $200 billion of agency debt, and $1,250 billion of agency MBS; purchases in the latter 
two categories are to be completed by year-end 2009.  The maturity distribution of the 
Treasuries purchases is based on FRBNY Markets Group internal forecasts. The maturities 
of most purchases are between two and ten years, with the average being approximately five 
years.  No sales are assumed, but maturing securities are redeemed and are not replaced.  As 
a result, total holdings of Treasury securities decline as issues mature.  Securities previously 
held in the SOMA portfolio are assumed to be reinvested as they mature.  Agency debt 
peaks at $200 billion in 2009, and declines slowly over the remainder of the forecast horizon.  
For agency MBS, the rate of prepayment is based on rough estimates from the Desk.  The 
historically low coupon on these securities implies a relatively slow prepayment rate.  As a 
result, at the end of 2016, $784 billion of the $1.25 trillion of MBS purchased remains on the 
balance sheet. 

•  In the alternative scenario, purchases of Treasury securities are increased by $450 billion to 
$750 billion by the end of the year.  No other changes to the assumptions are made and 
securities mature at the same rate as in the baseline scenario. 

• By the end of the projection period, the expansion of currency and capital combined with a 
runoff of other assets necessitates the resumption of standard open market purchases to 
maintain reserve balances at a level of $25 billion.  It is assumed that the Desk purchases 
shorter-dated Treasury securities to satisfy this need.

Liquidity and Credit Facilities 

• Primary credit is assumed to decline moderately from its current level to $1 billion by the 
end of 2010 and remain at that level thereafter.  Secondary credit is assumed to be zero for 
the entire projection period. 

• Term Auction Facility (TAF) credit is assumed to decline with improved market functioning 
and is zero at the end of 2010. 

• Foreign central bank liquidity swaps decline with improved market functioning and are zero 
at the end of 2010. 

• Credit extended to AIG winds down by the end of 2014.  In addition, the assets held by 
Maiden Lane LLC, Maiden Lane II LLC, and Maiden Lane III LLC are assumed to be sold 
over time, and reach zero by 2015. 

• The Term Asset-Backed Securities Loan Facility (TALF), based partly on its slow initial 
uptake, is assumed to peak at $175 billion, well below the $1 trillion limit.  For purposes of 
these projections, TALF is assumed to consist of two components:  TALF 1.0 and TALF 
2.0/3.0.  TALF 1.0 issues loans with a three-year maturity and reaches $125 billion by the 
end of 2010.  These loans are held to maturity; the quantity outstanding reaches zero by the 
end of 2013.  TALF 2.0/3.0 extends loans with a five-year maturity and reaches $50 billion 
by the end of 2010.  These loans are also held to maturity, and the quantity outstanding 
reaches zero by the end of 2015. 

• Section 13(3) facilities other than the TALF are assumed to be extended beyond October 30, 
2009.  Credit extended through these facilities declines with improved market functioning 
and is zero at the end of 2010. 

LIABILITIES 
• Currency (Federal Reserve notes in circulation) grows in line with the staff forecast for 

money stock currency through the end of 2010.  From 2010 to the end of the projection 
period, currency grows at the same rate as nominal GDP as projected in the extended 
Greenbook forecast. 

• The U.S. Treasury’s general account returns to its historical target level of $5 billion by the 
end of 2009.  This account remains constant at that level over the forecast period. 

• The Treasury’s Supplementary Financing Account is projected to wind down to zero by the 
middle of 2010, and remain at zero for the rest of the of the forecast period.  

• Reverse repurchase agreements with foreign official and international accounts are expected 
to decrease to $38 billion by the end of 2010 as these funds move to other investments.   

• Capital is expected to grow at 15 percent per year, in line with the average rate of the past 
ten years. 

• For most of the projection period, reserve balances of depository institutions are assumed to 
be determined by the evolution of the assets and other liabilities of the Federal Reserve.  As 
the asset side of the balance sheet contracts, so do reserve balances.  When the implied level 
of reserve balances reaches $25 billion, the Desk is assumed to conduct open market 
operations to offset the growth of currency and capital to maintain a constant $25 billion 
level.
