The attached document represents the most complete and accurate version available 
based on original copies culled from the files of the FOMC Secretariat at the Board 
of Governors of the Federal Reserve System.  This electronic document was created 
through a comprehensive digitization process which included identifying the best-
preserved paper copies, scanning those copies,1 and then making the scanned 
versions text-searchable.2   Though a stringent quality assurance process was 
employed, some imperfections may remain. 
 
Please note that some material may have been redacted from this document if that 
material was received on a confidential basis.  Redacted material is indicated by

format.  All scanned images were deskewed (to remove the effects of printer- and scanner-introduced 
tilting) and lightly cleaned (to remove dark spots caused by staple holes, hole punches, and other 
blemishes caused after initial printing). 
 
2 A two-step process was used.  An advanced optical character recognition computer program (OCR) 
first created electronic text from the document image.  Where the OCR results were inconclusive, 
staff checked and corrected the text as necessary.  Please note that the numbers and text in charts and

Recent developments

(1) M-1 growth was at a 4.9 per cent annual rate in June and,

reflecting the expected effect of the early disbursement of social security

checks, appears to have accelerated in July. For the June-July period, M-1

growth is now projected at about a 6.2 per cent annual rate, just below the

upper end of the Committee's desired range. M-2 appears to be increasing

at about a 9¼ per cent annual rate over June and July, somewhat above the

midpoint of the Committee's range. Growth in the time and savings deposit

component of M-2 in recent weeks has accelerated from its April-May pace,

as sharp increases in large denomination non-negotiable CD's have more

than offset weakness in savings accounts. Nonborrowed reserves increased

at a 3.3 per cent annual rate in June but are expected to grow much more

rapidly in July, primarily in lagged response to the pickup in deposit

growth in late June and early July.

(2) Throughout the period since the last Committee meeting, growth

of both M-1 and M-2 remained within the Committee's desired ranges, and the Account

Management accordingly sought to maintain the funds rate at about 5-3/8 per

cent. With the funds rate remaining slightly above the discount rate, member

bank borrowings from the discount window averaged $257 million, little dif-

ferent from the preceding four weeks, but above the average level of $80

million during the first four months of the year.

(3) Demands on credit markets strengthened in June. Both financial

and nonfinancial corporations substantially increased their issuance of com-

mercial paper over the month. Nonfinancial corporations also stepped up their

short-term borrowing at commercial banks, and the volume of publicly offered

bonds of domestic financial corporations, public utilities, and foreign issuers

expanded significantly. At the same time, State and local governments marketed

a record volume of long-term securities. The Treasury auctioned $1.5 billion

of 15-year bonds near the end of the month but paid down a roughly equal

amount of short-term bills over the month.

(4) Despite the strengthening in short-term credit demands, rates

on private short-term debt instruments have shown essentially no change since

the June FOMC meeting. Treasury bill rates, however, have moved up about 10

to 20 basis points as the market has begun to adjust to the ending of the

period of large cash redemptions of Treasury bills. In addition, this up-

ward rate adjustment may reflect a slight shift in the market's interest

rate outlook in response to recent strengthening in published monetary

aggregates data.



(5) Since the June FOMC meeting yields on corporate and

municipal securities and also on intermediate-term Treasury coupon issues,

have advanced 5 to 15 basis points. Dealers in Treasury securities have

made substantial net sales of coupon issues in recent weeks. As a result,

they now have large net short positions in issues in the one- to ten-year

maturity category and only a modest long position in issues with maturities

over 10 years--the latter reflecting mainly the remainder of dealer awards

in the recent 15-year bond auction.

(6) Inflows into deposit accounts at nonbank thrift institutions

in June were maintained at about the moderate pace of other recent months,

but there appears to have been a pick-up in growth at savings and loan

associations in early July. With demands for mortgages remaining strong,

primary mortgage rates edged higher on balance in recent weeks.

(7) The table on the following page shows (in terms of percentage

annual rates of change) related monetary and financial flows over various

time periods.

Prospective developments

(8) Shown below for the Committee's consideration are four

alternative sets of longer-run ranges for the monetary aggregates--

alternatives A through D--that pertain to the one year period, QII '77-

QII '78. In the last column are shown the ranges adopted at the April

Committee meeting for the QI '77-QI '78 period. The growth rates for bank

credit shown under A through D relate to total loans and investments of all

1/commercial banks.rather than to the bank credit proxy.-

Alt. A Alt. B Alt. C Alt. D Current

M1 4½-7 4½-6½ 4-6½ 3½-6 4½-6½

M2  7-10 7-9½ 6½-9½ 6-9 7-9½

M3  8-11 8-10½ 7½-10½ 7-10 8½-11

Bank credit 7½-10½ 7½-10½ 7-10 6½-9½ 7-10

(9) Under alternative B, the one year growth ranges for M-1

and M-2 are the same as those adopted by the Committee in April. The growth

range for M-3, however, is lower by ½ percentage point. This lower M-3

range now appears more consistent with the ranges shown for M-1 and M-2,

given the staff's current projection of deposit flows at thrift institu-

tions over the next four quarters. Alternative A encompasses a little more

1/ Growth in the bank credit proxy--the sum of all deposits and certain
borrowings of member banks--has been consistently below the targets
adopted by the Committee, and has in the past year diverged increasingly
from bank credit, as may be seen from the table on p. 4. With the
relatively rapid growth of nonmember deposits and the greater use by banks
of reserve-free borrowings as a source of funds the bank credit proxy
(i.e. essentially total member bank deposits) has become a much more
imperfect statistical series. Bank credit, as measured by the end-of-
month series for loans and investments or by a new average series for the
month developed by the Board staff, has been closer to the Committee's
longer-run ranges for bank credit. The Committee might therefore wish to
consider substituting an all commercial bank credit measure for the proxy.
The issues are discussed in more detail in Appendix III.



rapid growth in all of the monetary aggregates than B, and alternative C

a little slower growth. The differences among these alternatives are in

line with the size of changes in longer-run ranges that the Committee has

actually made in its quarterly reviews of the one-year ranges. The specifi-

cations of alternative D, however, involve a larger adjustment in the

ranges, with the midpoint of the growth range for M-1 reduced to 4¾ per

cent over the QII '77-QII '78 period. This alternative would compensate

for the second quarter overshoot in growth of M-1; that is, it would result

in expansion of M-1 over the five quarters, QI '77-QII '78, at a 5½ per

cent annual rate--the midpoint of the M-1 range adopted by the Committee

in April for the QI '77-QI '78 period.1/ M-2 growth over the five quarter

period under this alternative would be at about an 8 per cent annual rate,

however, a shade below the midpoint of the current M-2 range.

(10) Shorter-run specifications for the monetary aggregates and

the Federal funds rate that are thought to be consistent with the various

long-run ranges are presented below. (Detailed data are shown in the

tables on pp. 7 and 8.)

(11) Under alternative B, the proposed Federal funds rate range

is the same as that adopted by the Committee at its previous meeting. If

the funds rate remains near the recently prevailing 5-3/8 per cent level,

the staff would expect M-1 growth for the July-August period to be at about

a 6 per cent annual rate. With the public's adjustment to the April bulge

in M-1 now completed, the transactions demand for money is expected to rise

more in line with the continued growth in nominal GNP. Growth in M-2 is

expected to be in a 7-11 per cent annual rate range during the July-August

period, as the time and savings deposit component of that aggregate continues

to expand at near its recent pace.

(12) Credit demands may remain substantial over the weeks ahead,

although State and local government and business demands may slacken from

their exceptional June pace. While the Treasury is expected to raise about

$3-1/2--4 billionof new money before the next meeting, mainly in conjunction

with its mid-August refunding of $3.3 billion of maturing publicly held coupon

issues, the Treasury securities market appears to be in a technically strong

position. Thus, there is likely to be little upward interest rate pressure

generated by market demand forces over the next few weeks. However, in the

late summer and early fall, with Treasury borrowing expanding considerably

further and demands for money and liquidity pressing against the available

supply, upward pressures on interest rates are likely to develop.

(13) Further increases in interest rates are likely to develop

late this year and in the first half of next year if the midpoints of the



-10-

longer-run growth ranges contemplated under alternative B are to be

achieved. The funds rate might need to rise to about 6 per cent by year-

end and to about 6¼ per cent by the second quarter of 1978. This would

be an appreciably smaller rise in interest rates than the staff thought

likely last month. It allows for the higher average level of the money stock

over the next year that results from applying an unchanged growth rate to a

new base period in which there has been a substantial overshoot. (The

Federal funds rate projections four quarters ahead are shown in Appendix II).

(14) As noted earlier, both alternatives C and D contemplate

lower longer-run growth ranges for the monetary aggregates than alternative

B. While the reduction is substantially larger in the case of alternative D,

in either case the Committee may wish to consider a rise in the funds rate

between now and the next meeting to around 5-7/8 per cent, the midpoint of

a 5½-6¼ per cent range. Such a funds rate increase is likely to be

accompanied by an increase in short-term rates of interest generally of

about ½ percentage point. Member bank borrowings from the discount window

may rise $50-100 million further, and markets may come to anticipate a rise

in the discount rate from its current 5¼ per cent level.

(15) With the funds rate rising over the next few weeks as

specified above, we would expect M-1 in the July-August period to expand

in a 3½-7½ per cent annual rate range and M-2 in a 6½-10½ per cent range.

Net inflows of shorter-term small denomination time deposits

to banks and thrift institutions may slow at the higher interest

levels, and there may also be a further outflow of interest-sensitive

savings deposits of individuals, businesses, and State and local governments.



-11-

Banks may be expected to adapt to such developments by more aggressively

offering large denomination time deposits; except for negotiable deposits

offered by large banks, these deposits are included in M-2. Even under the

short-run specifications of alternative C, there would appear to be sufficient

leeway between ceiling rates in time certificates maturing in four years

or more and yields on market instruments to enable banks to retain the

funds involved in maturing "wild card" certificates. They could, however,

lose some funds to thrift institutions, which can offer somewhat higher

rates.

(16) The rise in market rates of interest over the next few weeks

accompanying short-run alternative C (or D) would probably carry the 3-month

Treasury bill rate above the 5¼ per cent ceiling rate on thrift institution

savings deposits. This may trigger an increased diversion of these deposits

to market instruments. Under alternative C we would expect that thrifts

would become less willing to commit funds to the mortgage market at near

the recent pace. In addition, given the substantial mortgage takedowns

in train, these institutions would have to draw down their liquid assets

and borrow more heavily from the FHL Banks; the need for secondary mortgage

market support by FNMA would also increase. But the rise in mortgage rates

may be limited if insurance companies, for example, become more active

in the mortgage market as a result of the continuing favorable spread of

mortgage rates over corporate bond yields. In any event, upward pressures

on corporate and tax exempt bond yields are likely to be relatively modest,

given the substantial supply of investible funds at insurance companies and

other institutional investors.



-12-

(17) If the Committee wishes to achieve the midpoints of the

longer-run growth ranges for alternative C--indexed by an M-1 range of

4-6 per cent--the staff expects that the funds rate would need to rise

only a little further and would top out at around 6¼ per cent in the first

quarter of 1978. The greater restraint on growth of the monetary aggregates

over the longer-run under alternative D would require a larger rise of interest

rates to levels closer to those projected at the previous FOMC meeting.

The funds rate may rise to around 6½ per cent in the first quarter of next

year and probably further to a level of 6¾ per cent by the second quarter.

(18) Alternative A contemplates an easing of money market

conditions between now and the next Committee meeting. Interest rates

may tend to decline rather substantially as the funds rate begins to drop,

particularly in the intermediate-term Treasury area where dealers have a

net short position. But assuming that incoming economic news does not

cast doubt on the fundamental strength of the economy, interest rate declines

may be limited over the next month or so as corporations and State and local

governments increase market borrowing in anticipation of higher interest

rates later on and as the market focuses on the Treasury's large fall cash

need.

(19) We would expect the funds rate to begin rising in the fall

under alternative A if growth in the aggregates is to remain around the

midpoints of the longer-run ranges for this alternative. Given the degree

of near-term ease assumed, the funds rate by spring may have to be at or

slightly above the level assumed at that time under alternative B in order

to constrain monetary growth in the first half of next year to the indicated



-13-

rate. Meanwhile, however, for most of the one-year period ahead, short-

term rates would have been lower than under alternative B, with consequent

relatively easier credit and liquidity conditions at banks and other

institutions.



-14-

Directive language

(20) Given below are alternatives for the operational paragraphs

of the directive. The first formulation places main emphasis on near-term

rates of growth in monetary aggregates. The second formulation, like the

directive adopted at the last meeting, places main emphasis on money market

conditions; it shows--in strike-through form--the specifications adopted at

the last meeting. As suggested below, the particular language needed in

the opening lines of the money market formulation would depend on the specific

conditions sought; the three alternatives shown--calling, respectively, for

somewhat easier, prevailing, and somewhat firmer money market conditions--

are intended to be associated with the specifications discussed in the pre-

ceding section under alternatives A, B, and C.

"Monetary Aggregates" Formulation

The Committee seeks to encourage near-term rates of growth

in M-1 and M-2 on a path believed to be reasonably consistent with

the longer-run ranges for monetary aggregates cited in the preceding

paragraph. Specifically, at present, it expects the annual growth

rates over the July-August period to be within the ranges of ____

to ____ per cent for M-1 and ____ to ____ per cent for M-2.

In the judgment of the Committee such growth rates are likely to be

associated with a weekly-average Federal funds rate of about ____

per cent. If, giving approximately equal weight to M-1 and M-2, it

appears that growth rates over the 2-month period will deviate



-15-

significantly from the midpoints of the indicated ranges, the

operational objective for the Federal funds rate shall be modified

in an orderly fashion within a range of ____ to ____ per cent.

If it appears during the period before the next meeting that

the operating constraints specified above are proving to be signif-

icantly inconsistent, the Manager is promptly to notify the Chair-

man who will then decide whether the situation calls for supple-

mentary instructions from the Committee.

"Money Market" Formulation

At this time, the Committee seeks to maintain about the

prevailing money market conditions (OR TO ACHIEVE SOMEWHAT EASIER

OR SOMEWHAT FIRMER MONEY MARKET CONDITIONS) during the period

immediately ahead, provided that monetary aggregates appear to

be growing at approximately the rates currently expected, which

are believed to be on a path reasonably consistent with the longer-

run ranges for monetary aggregates cited in the preceding paragraph.

Specifically, the Committee seeks to maintain the weekly-average

Federal funds rate at about [DEL: 5-3/8] _____ per cent, so long as M-1

and M-2 appear to be growing over the [DEL: June-July] JULY-AUGUST period

at annual rates with ranges of [DEL: 2-1/2 to 6-1/2] ____ TO ____

per cent and [DEL: 6-to-10] ____ TO ____ per cent, respectively.

If, giving approximately equal weight to M-1 and M-2, it appears

that growth rates over the 2-month period are approaching or moving



-16-

beyond the limits of the indicated ranges, the operational

objective for the weekly-average Federal funds rate shall be

modified in an orderly fashion within a range of [DEL: 5-1/4 to 5-3/4]

____ TO ____ per cent.

If it appears during the period before the next meeting that

the operating constraints specified above are proving to be signif-

icantly inconsistent, the Manager is promptly to notify the Chair-

man who will then decide whether the situation calls for supplemen-

NOTE: The last four columns assume growth around the midpoints of the proposed ranges
is achieved and are the same numbers as shown in the table on p.

The table above facilitates comparison of longer-run paths proposed

in the current blue book with the Committee's current (QI '77 to QI '78) and

immediately previous (QIV '76 to QIV '77) longer-run paths. The first

column of the table shows the level of M1 and M2 implied by the midpoint

growth rate of the Committee's QIV '76 to QIV '77 longer-run range extended

to the first and second quarters of 1978. The second column shows the levels

of M1 and M2 in the first and second quarters of 1978 implied by midpoint



I - 2

growth rates of current longer-run paths (which take QI '77 as the base).

The last four columns show levels of M1 and M2 for the first and second

quarters of 1978 implied by the alternatives presented in this blue book

(which take QII '77 as the base).

As may be seen, alternatives A through C imply higher midpoint

levels for both M and M2 in QI '78 and QII '78 than would be implicit in

extension of Committee ranges based on QI '77 or QIV '76. For example,

under alternative B, M1 in QII '78 would be $2.5 billion (or .7 of a per

cent) above the implied level for that quarter derived by extending the

midpoint of the current M1 growth range to the second quarter of 1978

(shown in the second column). M2 in QII '78 under alternative B would be

.3 of a per cent above such an implied level.

Alternative D would achieve the implied QII '78 level based on

5 per cent growth from QI '77, but it would fall slightly short of

achieving the QII '78 level that would be implied if the base were carried

back to QIV '76. Alternative D would also fall short of achieving the

implied QII '78 levels for M2 based on the earlier paths.

Appendix III

Comparison of the Member Bank Credit
Proxy and All Commercial Bank Credit

In recent years the bank credit proxy--total member bank deposits

plus Euro-dollar borrowings and loans sold to affiliates--has become much

less useful than it had been as an indicator of the change in bank credit

at all commercial banks. In the mid-1960's, when the credit proxy was

developed, this measure was equal to approximately 80 per cent of the

outstanding credit at all commercial banks. By the end of 1976 the ratio

had declined to 67 per cent. The deterioration of the proxy has reflected

the increasing proportion of total credit extended by nonmember banks

and the increasing use by banks of nondeposit sources of funds not included

in the proxy, such as borrowings from nonbanks through RP's and Federal

funds.1/ The advantages of the credit proxy--its timeliness and its

availability on a daily average basis rather than as of a single day--have

increasingly been overshadowed by these problems.

Because of shifts in sources of credit expansion at all commercial

banks, the actual performance of the bank credit proxy has, with one

exception, fallen well short of the FOMC's longer-run ranges for bank

credit. The growth in total loans and investments of all commercial banks

has actually been much more consistent, on average, with the FOMC's credit

ranges, as may be seen from the table, which compares the Committee's

growth ranges for bank credit to the actual growth in the member bank

credit proxy and two measures of all commercial bank credit. The first

1/ It is estimated that in 1976 such borrowings increased nearly $23 billion
--accounting for 3 percentage points of the rise in bank credit last

year--and the total outstanding amount of such borrowed funds equalled

roughly 8 per cent of total member bank deposits at the end of 1976.



III - 2

of these measures is the Board's single-day last-Wednesday-of-the-month

all commercial bank credit series, and the second is a new "monthly

average" bank credit series that is derived by averaging Wednesday data.1/

The staff would recommend that the Committee no longer employ the

bank credit proxy in view of its deterioration as an indicator of credit

and since direct measures of commercial bank total loans and investments

will readily serve as a measure for purposes of establishing longer-run ranges.

1/ Both measures of all commercial bank credit are based on reported
data from all member banks and estimated data for nonmember banks.
Large member banks report detailed bank credit data for each
Wednesday. An abbreviated report showing three credit items
(total loans, U.S. Government securities, and other securities) is
also filed by small member banks each Wednesday. Small member bank-
nonmember bank ratios are derived from call report data for the
three reported credit items. The credit data reported by small
member banks for Wednesdays are multiplied by these call report
ratios to derive estimates of nonmember bank credit. The various
credit components for large and small member banks and nonmember
banks are aggregated to a gross loans and investments total. Inter-
bank loans are estimated, based on reported member bank data and
nonmember bank call report data, and subtracted from gross loans and
investments to obtain a net total loans and investments measure.
Data on loans sold to affiliates are reported for each Wednesday by
large banks and are added to the net loans and investments series
to complete the bank credit measure.

The monthly average series averages the estimated Wednesday
data for all banks. At this point in time the components of bank
credit are estimated only monthly, but the staff could develop a
monthly average series for the components also.

NOTE: Government security dealer trading positions are on a commitment basis. Trading positions, which exclude Treasury securities financed by repur-
chase agreements maturing in 16 days or more, are indicators of dealer holdings available for sale over the near-term. Underwriting syndicate positions
consist of issues still in syndicate, excluding trading positions. The basic reserve deficit is excess reserves less borrowing at Federal Reserve less
net Federal funds purchases. Weekly data are daily averages for statement weeks, except for corporate and municiapl issues in syndicate which are Friday
figures.

* STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL.
** Monthly averages for excess reserves and borrowings are weighted averages of statement week figures.

NOTE: Weekly data for columns 1 to 4 are statement week averages of daily data. Columns 5 and 6 are 1-day Wednesday quotes (prior to 1976, figures shown
are for 60-89 day and 90-119 day ranges, respectively). For columns 7 through 10, the weekly date is the mid-point of the calendar week over which data
are averaged. Columns 11 and 12 are 1-day quotes for Friday and Thursday, respectively, following the end of the statement week. Column 13 is an average
of contract interest rates on commitments for conventional first mortgages with 80 per cent loan-to-value ratios made by a sample of insured savings and loan
associations on the Friday following the end of the statement week. Column 14 gives FNMA auction data for Monday preceding the end of the statement week.
Column 15 is a 1-day quote for Monday preceding the end of the statement week. The FNMA auction yield is the average yield in bi-weekly auction for short-
term forward commitments for Government underwritten mortgages. GNMA yields are average net yields to Investors on mortgage-backed securities for immediate
delivery, assuming prepayment in 12 years on pools of 30-year FHA/VA mortgages carrying the coupon rate 50 basis points below the current FHA/VA ceiling.
