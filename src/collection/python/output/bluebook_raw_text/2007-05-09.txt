MONETARY POLICY ALTERNATIVES 

Recent Developments 

(1) The FOMC’s decision at its March meeting to leave the federal funds rate 

target unchanged at 5¼ percent accorded with market expectations.  However, 

investors read the accompanying statement as signaling that policy easing might begin 

sooner than had been anticipated, given the replacement of the reference to 

“additional firming” with more balanced language and the somewhat weaker-than-

expected characterization of recent economic indicators.  Even though there was little 

apparent net impetus from economic data released over the intermeeting period, on 

balance, money market futures rates subsequently more than reversed their initial 

decline.  The upward pressure on futures quotes probably owed in part to monetary 

policy communications—including the Chairman’s testimony to the Joint Economic 

Committee, speeches by FOMC members, and the release of the minutes of the 

March meeting—that were seen as affirming that upside risk to inflation remained the 

Committee’s predominant concern.  Futures quotes now indicate that market 

participants generally expect the target rate to be left unchanged at the May and June 

meetings and to be eased about ¾ percentage point by the end of 2008 (Chart 1).  

Respondents to the Desk’s survey of primary dealers generally anticipate no change in 

the policy rate and few changes to the statement at next week’s meeting, and they 

expect about 50 basis points of easing by the end of 2008, somewhat less than futures 

quotes imply.  Option-implied measures of uncertainty about the near-term path of 

policy were little changed over the intermeeting period, and the implied probability 

distribution for the target rate six months ahead shows about the same skew toward 

lower rates as it did at the time of the March meeting.  Despite the large flows of 

individual nonwithheld tax payments to the Treasury toward the end of the

intermeeting period, the federal funds rate did not deviate from the target more than 

is typical (see box entitled “Tax Receipts and Open Market Operations”).1  

(2) In the Treasury market, two- and ten-year nominal yields rose modestly 

over the intermeeting period.  TIPS-based inflation compensation edged up amid a 

noticeable rise in oil prices, and consumer survey responses also suggested slightly 

higher short- and long-term inflation expectations.  Broad equity indexes have risen 

about 6 percent since the March FOMC meeting and 8 percent since the publication 

of the March Greenbook (Chart 2).  The gains came on the heels of somewhat better-

than-expected first-quarter earnings reports and a lessening of the concerns about the 

outlook that gripped markets in late February.  Spreads of yields on investment-grade 

corporate bonds over those on comparable-maturity Treasury securities were about 

unchanged, while those on speculative-grade bonds narrowed somewhat.   

(3) Domestic financial market conditions have broadly recovered from the 

sharp increase in volatility and the associated withdrawal from risk-taking that 

occurred in late February and the first half of March.  Markets functioned well over 

the intermeeting period, and implied volatilities in various markets retraced all or part 

of their earlier increases.  After several large investment banks with substantial 

exposures to subprime mortgages reported strong first-quarter earnings, equity and 

credit market anxiety about spillovers from that sector appeared to ease.  

Nevertheless, credit default swap (CDS) spreads on some of these investment banks 

remained somewhat above their levels early this year, although well within the range 

observed over the previous three years.  There were other signs that investors had 

reassessed the risk inherent in some positions relative to earlier in the year:  Spreads 

on lower-rated indexes of credit default swaps written on subprime mortgages 
                                           
1 The effective federal funds rate averaged 5.25 percent over the intermeeting period.  During the 
period, System holdings of Treasury coupon securities increased by $7.4 billion.  The volume of 
outstanding long-term RPs decreased by $9 billion, to $12 billion, as the Desk relied on short-term 
operations to address fluctuations in balances due to tax flows.

 fall 
 
Tax Receipts and Open Market Operations 
 

The Desk faced significant reserve management challenges late in the 
intermeeting period, as large individual income tax payments boosted the Treasury’s 
operating cash balance to unusually high levels.  Typically, the Treasury invests the 
bulk of its operating balance in the Treasury Tax and Loan (TT&L) system and 
targets a balance of $5 billion in the Treasury General Account (TGA) at the Federal 
Reserve.  Tax receipts for April and May are estimated to be about 13 percent higher 
than last year, and the Treasury’s operating balance—the dotted line in the chart 
below—exceeded the capacity of the TT&L system—the solid line—on a few days 
beginning on April 30.  As a result, the TGA—the dashed line—rose above its $5 
billion target level, reaching nearly $30 billion.  

In general, an increase in the TGA reduces the banking sector’s balances at the 
Fed.  To maintain the target federal funds rate, the Desk must add balances through 
open market operations, traditionally using repurchase agreements (RPs) because the 
need to add these balances is temporary.  However, propositions from primary 
dealers for RPs can be limited on the month end, so the Desk was confronted with 
the challenge of adding a substantial amount of balances on a day when its ability to 
conduct a short-term adding operation could be limited. 

The Desk addressed this problem in a number of ways.  First, on April 25, the 
Desk arranged a forward repurchase agreement to settle on April 30.  This forward 
operation gave the primary dealers the opportunity to obtain collateral to pledge to 
the Desk that might otherwise have become scarce on the month end.  In addition, 
the Desk performed term RP operations on several days leading up to the month end.  
To avoid providing more balances than demanded on the days immediately preceding 
the month end, the Desk conducted reverse RP operations on April 26 and 27, the 
first such operations since 2004.

remained very high over the intermeeting period, and corporate CDS spreads for a 

number of firms at the low end of the credit-quality spectrum were still quite a bit 

above their levels early in the year.  

(4) Economic prospects abroad brightened relative to those in the United 

States, and the foreign exchange value of the dollar moved down 2 percent on balance 

over the intermeeting period against a trade-weighted index of major foreign 

currencies (Chart 3).  Market participants’ reaction to signs of firmer growth in the 

euro area, most notably in Germany, led the euro to appreciate almost 2 percent 

against the dollar.  Concerns about inflationary pressures in the United Kingdom and 

Canada, and heightened expectations of a policy response, contributed to 

appreciations of 1½ percent and 4½ percent, respectively, for those countries’ 

currencies against the dollar.  Data showing that U.K. inflation exceeded 3 percent in 

the twelve months ending in March required the Governor of the Bank of England to 

submit a letter of explanation to the Chancellor of the Exchequer.  The yen proved to 

be an exception to the general pattern of dollar weakness:  The dollar increased more 

than 2 percent against the yen, reportedly in part on the re-establishment of carry 

trades as market participants’ concerns about volatility waned.  Yields on long-term 

sovereign debt in Europe rose about 30 basis points; increases in Canadian and 

Japanese long-term yields were smaller and closer to those on comparable U.S. 

securities.  Broad stock price indexes in major foreign industrial countries recorded 

gains of 4 to 7 percent over the intermeeting period, except in Japan where the 

TOPIX was down slightly on balance.2   

(5) The dollar fell about 1 percent against an index of currencies of our other 

important trading partners.  Currency values and asset prices in many emerging

market countries appeared to benefit from investors returning to positions with 

greater risk.  EMBI+ spreads in Mexico and Brazil narrowed to record lows during 

the period, and yields on their local currency long-term sovereign securities recorded 

substantial declines.  Mexican-peso yields retraced their decline in recent days after the 

Bank of Mexico surprised the market by tightening in late April, citing concerns about 

inflation.  Most stock price indexes in Latin America and Asia registered hefty gains 

over the intermeeting period, led by an increase of more than 25 percent in China.   

(6) Expansion of domestic nonfinancial sector debt slowed to an annual rate of 

6¾ percent in the first quarter, reflecting a reduced pace of borrowing by businesses, 

households, and state and local governments (Chart 4).  Nonfinancial business debt 

slowed somewhat from its rapid fourth-quarter pace, but still expanded at a 9 percent 

rate in the first quarter as merger and acquisition activity continued to underpin 

substantial bond issuance.  On a period-average basis, strong growth of commercial 

real estate loans partly offset a slowdown in the growth of C&I loans in the first 

quarter.  The pace of C&I lending picked up in April, consistent with the further 

narrowing of spreads on such loans reported in the April Senior Loan Officer 

Opinion Survey.  With house prices likely decelerating a bit further, growth of home 

mortgage debt likely slowed to a 5¾ percent rate in the first quarter.  On net, 

respondents to the April Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey reported a tightening of 

mortgage lending standards, especially for subprime and nontraditional loans, and a 

moderate net weakening in mortgage demand.  Consumer credit growth in the first 

quarter is estimated to have slowed slightly to an annual rate of 4 percent.  The 

Treasury scaled back its regular bill issuance significantly in view of large anticipated 

tax inflows over the latter half of April and early May.  Given favorable deficit trends, 

the Treasury announced, as expected, that it plans to discontinue the three-year note 

from its regular auction schedule beginning with the August refunding.

(7) At a 9 percent annual rate, M2 growth was brisk in March and April.  

Retail money funds surged in March following the financial market volatility at the 

end of February.  Growth of liquid deposits is estimated to have been somewhat 

elevated in April as households accumulated balances in anticipation of making final 

payments of individual nonwithheld taxes.  Overall, growth in M2 has remained more 

robust than historical relationships with opportunity cost and nominal output would 

indicate, and M2 velocity is estimated to have dropped further over the first quarter. 

Economic Outlook through 2008 

(8) The broad contours of the staff’s forecast for economic activity and 

inflation are little changed since the March Greenbook, as the drag of a softer housing 

market and the jump in oil prices about offset the impetus from higher equity prices 

and a weaker dollar.  The pace of economic expansion is projected to pick up from its 

first-quarter soft patch and to match the staff’s estimate of potential output growth by 

2008.  The labor market is anticipated to be slightly tighter than in the March forecast, 

with the unemployment rate not expected to rise to the staff’s estimate of the NAIRU 

of about 5 percent until the end of 2008.  This projection is predicated on the 

Committee holding policy unchanged over the next two years, rather than easing 

slightly in mid-2008 as assumed in the previous Greenbook.  Longer-term yields are 

again projected to firm a bit over the forecast period and equity prices to rise at about 

a 6½ percent annual rate, albeit from a starting point 6½ percent higher than in 

March.  The foreign exchange value of the dollar depreciates gradually as in previous 

forecasts, but along a track that is 1½ percent lower than in March.  The path of oil 

prices has been marked up about $5 per barrel in light of the rise in both spot and 

futures quotes.  The projected flattening out of energy and other commodity prices 

helps to nudge core PCE inflation down from 2¼ percent in 2007 to a little over 

2 percent by the end of 2008—a shade higher than projected in the last Greenbook.  

Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) Page 10 of 36



Headline PCE inflation is expected to run close to 3 percent in 2007, boosted by 

higher energy prices, before slowing to around 2 percent in 2008. 

Update on Medium-Term Strategies 

(9) This section provides an update of the materials on medium-term 

strategies for monetary policy that were presented in the March Bluebook.  As shown 

in Chart 5, in light of the changes to the staff’s outlook, the Greenbook-consistent 

measure of short-run r*—the value that would close the output gap over the next 

twelve quarters—has shifted up about 20 basis points.  This measure of short-run r* 

remains in line with the actual real federal funds rate—constructed as the current 

nominal rate less the average core PCE inflation rate over the past year—and is about 

¾ percentage point above the upper range of model-based estimates.3  

(10) Chart 6 depicts the results of optimal control simulations of the FRB/US 

model that are based on the staff’s extension of the Greenbook forecast beyond 

2008.4  In these simulations, policymakers place equal weights on keeping core PCE 

inflation close to a specified goal, on keeping unemployment close to the long-run 

NAIRU, and on avoiding changes in the nominal funds rate.5  With an inflation goal 

of 2 percent (the right-hand set of charts), the optimal policy prescribes a funds rate 

                                           
3 The measure of the actual real funds rate reported here is 20 basis points higher than  
in the previous Bluebook because the relatively elevated core inflation rate in 2006Q2  
no longer enters into the backward-looking moving average of core PCE inflation used  
in its construction. 
 
4 This extension generally incorporates the same medium-term assumptions used to  
generate the illustrative extension discussed in the March Bluebook.  For further details,  
see the memo to the Committee by Michael Kiley, David Reifschneider, John Roberts,  
and William Wascher, “The Extended Greenbook Forecast,” May 2, 2007. 
 
5  In conducting these simulations, policymakers and participants in financial markets are 
assumed to understand fully the forces shaping the economic outlook (as summarized by  
the extended Greenbook projection), whereas households and firms form their expectations 
using more limited information.

path that remains close to 5¼ percent through mid-2008 and then declines gradually 

to just above 4 percent by the end of 2012.  With an inflation goal of 1½ percent (the 

left-hand set of charts), the optimal path of the funds rate rises to about 6 percent 

over the next few quarters and then declines gradually to about 3¾ percent by 2012.  

For either inflation goal, the optimal funds rate path from mid-2008 through the end 

of 2012 is roughly ¼ percentage point higher than in the March Bluebook, while the 

outcomes for unemployment and inflation are broadly unchanged.  These patterns 

largely reflect the staff’s modest downward revision to potential output and the 

projection of more robust underlying aggregate demand, the same factors that 

generate the upward shift in the Greenbook-consistent measure of short-run r*. 

(11) As shown in Chart 7, the estimated outcome-based rule prescribes a funds  

rate path that stays in a range of 5 to 5¼ percent over the next several years. The 

near-term prescriptions from the simple policy rules proposed by Taylor (1993, 1999) 

are a notch tighter than in March, reflecting the staff’s assessment of a modestly larger 

output gap.  As in March, these rules generally stipulate a downward-sloping path of 

policy, whereas the first-difference rule—which does not involve the level of the 

output gap—now points to a flat or upward-sloping funds rate path, depending on 

the inflation goal. 

Short-Run Policy Alternatives 

(12) This Bluebook presents three policy alternatives for the Committee’s 

consideration, summarized in Table 1.  Under Alternative A, the Committee lowers 

the intended federal funds rate 25 basis points to 5 percent.  Alternative B maintains 

the target for the federal funds rate at 5¼ percent.  Under Alternative C, the 

Committee tightens by 25 basis points, bringing the target rate to 5½ percent.  With 

GDP growth estimated to have been weak in the first quarter, the characterization in 

the March statement that “the economy seems likely to continue to expand at a

Rationale 
3. Recent readings on core inflation 

have been somewhat elevated.  
Although inflation pressures seem 
likely to moderate over time, the 
high level of resource utilization has 
the potential to sustain those 
pressures. 

 

Core inflation remains somewhat

the potential to sustain inflation 
pressures, those pressures seem likely 
to moderate over time. 

Core inflation remains somewhat

inflation pressures seem likely to

Core inflation remains somewhat 
elevated on balance.  Inflation 
pressures seem likely to moderate 
over time, but considerable 
uncertainty surrounds that 
judgment.  Moreover, the high level 
of resource utilization, in 
combination with the recent 
increases in energy and other 
commodity prices, has the potential 
to sustain those pressures. 

Assessment 
of Risk 

4. In these circumstances, the 
Committee’s predominant policy 
concern remains the risk that 
inflation will fail to moderate as 
expected.  Future policy adjustments 
will depend on the evolution of the 
outlook for both inflation and 
economic growth, as implied by 
incoming information.

moderate pace” no longer seems appropriate.  Moreover, given the dip in core 

inflation in March, the reference in the previous statement to recent inflation readings 

being elevated has been replaced with the more general observation that “core 

inflation remains somewhat elevated on balance.”  The formulation used in the March 

risk assessment that “future policy adjustments will depend on the evolution of the 

outlook for both inflation and economic growth” is retained in all three alternatives.  

With the April employment report to be released on Friday, after the Bluebook closes, 

the wording of the draft statements should be viewed as more tentative than usual, 

and there is always the opportunity to combine rows from the different columns of 

the table. 

(13) In March, members apparently judged that maintaining the current target 

federal funds rate provided the best chance of fostering moderate economic growth 

and a gradual ebbing in core inflation.  The incoming data over the intermeeting 

period have not altered significantly the staff’s assessment of the prospects for growth 

and inflation.  If the Committee similarly has not substantially changed its assessment 

of the economic outlook, it may be attracted to Alternative B, under which the 

federal funds rate is maintained at 5¼ percent and the statement continues to 

highlight concern about inflation.  Indeed, members may believe that both the upside 

and downside risks associated with maintaining the current target rate have 

diminished somewhat, given that the turmoil in the subprime market does not appear 

to have spread to the rest of the mortgage market or to have led to a more general 

retrenchment in financial markets and that readings on core inflation in March were 

more favorable.  In the staff’s analysis, the real federal funds rate is close to the 

Greenbook-consistent measure of its equilibrium value, suggesting that the current 

stance of policy, if maintained, is likely to return output to a more sustainable level 

over time.  While members may harbor concerns about the glacial pace of the 

projected moderation in core inflation, they may nevertheless prefer a patient 

Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) Page 17 of 36



approach rather than incur the risks associated with fostering a more rapid disinflation 

in an environment of soft economic growth.  In such circumstances, the Committee 

might wish to be particularly clear that its patience does not represent a down-

weighting of its long-run inflation objective. 

(14) The statement accompanying Alternative B could acknowledge that 

economic growth slowed in the first part of the year, but indicate that the economy 

still seems likely to expand at a moderate pace over coming quarters.  The statement 

would reiterate the risks to inflation posed by the high level of resource utilization and 

conclude, as in March, that the Committee’s predominant policy concern remains the 

risk that inflation will fail to moderate as expected. 

(15) Investors see virtually no chance of a policy change at this meeting.  

Likewise, given the revisions to the language in the statement in March, the Desk’s 

survey suggests that most primary dealers do not expect substantive changes to the 

statement.  Thus, implementing Alternative B is likely to provoke little market 

reaction.   

(16) Even if the Committee views the staff’s central outlook as broadly 

plausible and desirable, members may judge that the risk of persistently weaker 

economic growth is unacceptably large.  If so, the Committee might wish to reduce 

the chance of a more pronounced economic slowdown by easing policy 25 basis 

points as in Alternative A.  The recent disappointing data on home sales and 

inventories of new homes for sale may heighten concern that the extent of the 

ongoing adjustment in the housing market and associated spillovers to household and 

business spending could be greater than currently anticipated.  Moreover, members 

might worry that the economic fundamentals supporting the expansion going forward 

could be less robust than envisaged by the staff.  In particular, the recent weakness in 

business spending may indicate that firms have grown less optimistic about future 

returns, which could continue to weigh on investment plans in coming quarters.  This 

Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) Page 18 of 36



relative pessimism could also conceivably color firms’ hiring decisions—especially if 

the recent strength of employment is a lagging phenomenon reflecting labor 

hoarding—and so damp prospects for households’ income and consumption.  And 

financial conditions might turn less favorable; in particular, long rates may move 

significantly higher if monetary policy is not eased as expected, and equity prices could 

fall short of the Greenbook projection if corporate earnings slow as anticipated by the 

staff.  The possibility that the fundamentals supporting the economic expansion might 

prove to be weaker than expected is explored in the Greenbook alternative simulation 

“Business caution with financial spillovers.”   

(17) The rationale for Alternative A would note that, although the economy 

seems most likely to expand at a moderate pace, the weakness in housing and capital 

spending implies a significant risk that economic activity might grow more slowly than 

anticipated.  Given the moderation in inflation in March, the Committee might wish 

to switch the ordering of the clauses in the second sentence of the inflation paragraph 

to suggest a slightly more benign outlook for inflation.  Even so, with opposing risks 

to activity and inflation, the statement would indicate that the Committee has no clear 

predilection concerning the likely future direction of policy and that policy 

adjustments will depend on the evolution of the economic outlook. 

(18) Although investors apparently expect the Committee to begin easing 

policy later this year, an immediate quarter-point rate cut would catch financial market 

participants unawares, likely leading to a substantial downward revision to the 

expected path for policy.  Long-term yields might also fall if investors surmised that 

the real interest rate consistent with maintaining moderate growth had declined.  But 

that fall might be tempered, or even reversed, if the surprise cut caused investors to 

revise up their expected medium-term path for inflation and economic growth.  The 

foreign exchange value of the dollar likely would weaken in response to the 

unexpected easing, and equity prices probably would rally. 

Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) Page 19 of 36



(19) In contrast, members might be concerned that inflation will not moderate 

as the staff expects, and that the costs of inflation persisting at elevated levels for a 

prolonged period could be substantial.  If so, the Committee might prefer to foster a 

more decisive slowing in inflation by tightening 25 basis points at this meeting, as in 

Alternative C.  Price pressures might not yet be viewed as convincingly on a 

downward trend, and the softening in the dollar and increases in energy and other 

commodity prices since the March meeting may have heightened the Committee’s 

concerns about the inflation outlook.  Moreover, with the staff forecast suggesting 

that the pace of moderation in core inflation might be even slower than previously 

anticipated, members may perceive an increasing risk that long-run inflation 

expectations might drift up, as illustrated by the Greenbook alternative scenario 

“Unanchored inflation expectations.”     

(20) The statement accompanying Alternative C could reiterate the 

Committee’s judgment that the economy seems likely to expand at a moderate pace.  

The Committee’s concern about the prospects for inflation could be stressed by 

noting that “considerable uncertainty” surrounds the judgment that inflation is likely 

to moderate.  The sources of upside risk to inflation could be broadened to include 

reference to the recent increases in energy and other commodity prices.   The 

statement could conclude by noting that, even after the policy tightening, the 

Committee’s predominant concern remains the upside risks to inflation. 

(21) A decision to firm policy at this meeting would stun financial markets, 

particularly given the changes made to the risk assessment in the March statement.  

Market participants would mark up substantially their short-term outlook for policy, 

and similarly increase the uncertainty attached to that outlook.  Short- and 

intermediate-term interest rates would move up significantly.  The response of longer-

term rates would depend on whether the surprise tightening caused participants to 

lower their expected path for medium-term inflation and economic growth, and 

Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) Page 20 of 36



whether that change was sufficient to offset the impact of the upward revision to the 

short-term policy outlook.  The foreign exchange value of the dollar probably would 

increase in response to the hike in short rates, while equity prices likely would fall. 

Money and Debt Forecasts 

(22) Under the Greenbook forecast, M2 is expected to expand about 

5½ percent in 2007 before slowing to 5 percent in 2008.  The forecast implies a 

decline in M2 velocity in each year, consistent with a modest reduction in opportunity 

cost.  The projection for M2 growth this year is a little above that in March, reflecting 

the unexpected strength of incoming data.  Within M2, liquid deposits grow 

moderately, and rapid expansion in retail money funds offsets sluggish advances in 

both small time deposits and currency. 

(23) The growth of domestic nonfinancial sector debt is projected to fall from 

last year’s increase of nearly 8 percent to 6½ percent in 2007 and 5¾ percent in 2008.  

In the household sector, flat housing prices are expected to dampen mortgage 

borrowing over the forecast period.  Corporate borrowing is also anticipated to slow, 

as the recent strong pace of merger-related debt issuance ebbs.  Federal debt growth is 

projected to pick up gradually this year and next.

Appendix A: Measures of the Equilibrium Real Rate 
 

The equilibrium real rate is the real federal funds rate that, if maintained, would be projected to return 
output to its potential level over time.  The short-run equilibrium rate is defined as the rate that would 
close the output gap in twelve quarters given the corresponding model’s projection of the economy.   
The medium-run concept is the value of the real federal funds rate projected to keep output at potential 
in seven years, under the assumption that monetary policy acts to bring actual and potential output into 
line in the short run and then keeps them equal thereafter.  The TIPS-based factor model measure 
provides an estimate of market expectations for the real federal funds rate seven years ahead.  
 
The actual real federal funds rate is constructed as the difference between the nominal rate and realized 
inflation, where the nominal rate is measured as the quarterly average of the observed federal funds rate, 
and realized inflation is given by the log difference between the core PCE price index and its lagged 
value four quarters earlier.  For the current quarter, the nominal rate is specified as the target federal 
funds rate on the Bluebook publication date.  For the current quarter and the previous quarter, the 
inflation rate is computed using the staff’s estimate of the core PCE price index. 
 
Confidence intervals reflect uncertainties about model specification, coefficients, and the level of 
potential output.  The final column of the table indicates the values published in the previous Bluebook. 
  

Measure Description 

Single-equation 
Model  

The measure of the equilibrium real rate in the single-equation model is based on an 
estimated aggregate-demand relationship between the current value of the output gap and 
its lagged values as well as the lagged values of the real federal funds rate. 

Small Structural 
Model 

The small-scale model of the economy consists of equations for five variables: the output 
gap, the equity premium, the federal budget surplus, the trend growth rate of output, and 
the real bond yield. 

Large Model 
(FRB/US) 

Estimates of the equilibrium real rate using FRB/US—the staff’s large-scale econometric 
model of the U.S. economy—depend on a very broad array of economic factors, some of 
which take the form of projected values of the model’s exogenous variables. 

Greenbook-
consistent  

The FRB/US model is used in conjunction with an extended version of the Greenbook 
forecast to derive a Greenbook-consistent measure.  FRB/US is first add-factored so that 
its simulation matches the extended Greenbook forecast, and then a second simulation is 
run off this baseline to determine the value of the real federal funds rate that closes the 
output gap. 

TIPS-based 
Factor Model 

Yields on TIPS (Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities) reflect investors’ expectations of 
the future path of real interest rates, but also include term and liquidity premiums.  The 
TIPS-based measure of the equilibrium real rate is constructed using the seven-year-ahead 
instantaneous real forward rate derived from TIPS yields as of the Bluebook publication 
date.  This forward rate is adjusted to remove estimates of the term and liquidity 
premiums based on a three-factor arbitrage-free term-structure model applied to TIPS 
yields, nominal yields, and inflation.  Because TIPS indexation is based on the total CPI, 
this measure is also adjusted for the medium-term difference—projected at 40 basis 
points—between total CPI inflation and core PCE inflation.

Appendix B: Analysis of Policy Paths and Confidence Intervals 
 

Rule Specifications:  For the following rules, it denotes the federal funds rate for quarter t, while  
the explanatory variables include the staff’s projection of trailing four-quarter core PCE inflation (πt), 
inflation two and three quarters ahead (πt+2|t and πt+3|t), the output gap in the current period and one 
quarter ahead ( *t ty y−  and *1| 1|t t t ty y+ +− ), and the three-quarter-ahead forecast of annual average GDP 
growth relative to potential ( 4 4 *3| 3|t t t ty y+ +Δ − Δ ), and *π  denotes an assumed value of policymakers’ 
long-run inflation objective.  The outcome-based and forecast-based rules were estimated using real-
time data over the sample 1988:1-2006:4; each specification was chosen using the Bayesian information 
criterion. Each rule incorporates a 75 basis point shift in the intercept, specified as a sequence of  
25 basis point increments during the first three quarters of 1998.  The first two simple rules were 
proposed by Taylor (1993, 1999), while the third is a variant of the Taylor (1999) rule—introduced  
in the August Bluebook—with a higher value of r*.  The prescriptions of the first-difference rule do  
not depend on assumptions regarding r* or the level of the output gap; see Orphanides (2003). 
 

Outcome-based rule it =  1.20it-1–0.39it-2+0.19[1.17  + 1.73 πt  + 3.66( *t ty y− )  – 2.72( *1 1t ty y− −− )]

Forecast-based rule it =  1.18it-1–0.38it-2+0.20[0.98 +1.72 πt+2|t+2.29( *1| 1|t t t ty y+ +− )–1.37( *1 1t ty y− −− )]

Taylor (1993) rule it = 2 + πt + 0.5(πt – *π ) + 0.5( *t ty y− ) 

Taylor (1999) rule it = 2 + πt + 0.5(πt – *π ) + ( *t ty y− ) 

Taylor (1999) rule     
with higher r* 

it = 2.75 + πt + 0.5(πt – *π ) + ( *t ty y− )  

First-difference rule it = it-1 + 0.5(πt+3|t – *π ) + 0.5( 4 4 *3| 3|t t t ty y+ +Δ − Δ ) 
 
FRB/US Model Simulations:  Prescriptions from the two empirical rules are computed using dynamic 
simulations of the FRB/US model, implemented as though the rule were followed starting at this FOMC 
meeting.  The dotted line labeled “Previous Bluebook” is based on the current specification of the policy 
rule, applied to the previous Greenbook projection.  Confidence intervals are based on stochastic 
simulations of the FRB/US model with shocks drawn from the estimated residuals over 1986-2005.  
Information from Financial Markets:  The expected funds rate path is based on forward rate 
agreements, and the confidence intervals for this path are constructed using prices of interest rate caps. 
Near-Term Prescriptions of Simple Policy Rules:  These prescriptions are calculated using Greenbook 
projections for inflation and the output gap. Because the first-difference rule involves the lagged funds 
rate, the value labeled “Previous Bluebook” for the current quarter is computed using the actual value  
of the lagged funds rate, and the one-quarter-ahead prescriptions are based on this rule’s prescription for 
the current quarter.

                * For real rates, measures using the Philadelphia Fed Survey employ the ten−year inflation expectations from the
                Blue Chip Survey until April 1991 and the Philadelphia Federal Reserve Bank Survey of Professional Forecasters
                thereafter (median value of respondents).  Measures using the Michigan Survey employ the five− to ten−year
                inflation expectations from that survey (mean value of respondents).

                + For TIPS and nominal corporate rate, denotes the most recent weekly value. For other real rate series, denotes
                the most recent weekly nominal yield less the most recent inflation expectation.
                Note. Blue shaded regions denote NBER−dated recessions.

Appendix C Chart 8

Inflation Indicator Based on M2

Note: P* is defined to equal M2 times V* divided by potential GDP. V*, or long-run velocity, is estimated
using average velocity over the 1959:Q1-to-1989:Q4 period and then, after a break, over the interval from
1993:Q1 to the present. For the forecast period, P* is based on the staff M2 forecast and P is simulated using a
short-run dynamic model relating P to P*. Blue areas indicate periods in which P* is notably less than P.
Gray areas denote the projection period.
