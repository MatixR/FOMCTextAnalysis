1 Federal funds traded over the intermeeting period at an average rate very close to   
1 percent.  The Desk purchased $1.3 billion of Treasury bills from foreign official
institutions and $5.4 billion of Treasury coupon securities in the market.  The outstanding
amount of long-term RPs increased $1 billion, to a level of $21 billion.

2 The May 2013 Treasury note continued to experience an elevated level of fails to
deliver for much of the period.  In its mid-quarter refunding announcement, the Treasury
noted the fails problem but stated its belief in “market participants’ ability to resolve this
matter,” which investors read as all but ruling out a reopening of this note.  In the past few
days, fails in this security have dropped sharply, as foreign central banks reportedly became
more willing to lend their holdings of the security in the RP market.  Although this note
continues to command a premium in cash and repo markets, very recently it has traded at a
slightly positive interest rate for overnight repurchase agreements for the first time in
months.

MONETARY POLICY ALTERNATIVES

Recent Developments

(1) The FOMC’s decision at its October meeting to leave the target federal

funds rate unchanged had been widely anticipated in markets.1  However, the

Committee’s retention of both an unchanged risk assessment and its indication that

policy could remain accommodative for a considerable period, which were apparently

seen as less certain outcomes, sparked a short-lived rally in Treasury markets.  Over

the balance of the intermeeting period, Treasury coupon rates rose on stronger-than-

expected economic releases, but those increases were partly offset by the market

response to several statements by policymakers reiterating that policy could remain

accommodative (chart 1).  On net, most Treasury coupon rates were up 10 to 25 basis

points.2  Yields on Treasury indexed notes increased about in line with those on

comparable nominal issues, leaving inflation compensation about unchanged

following its appreciable rise in earlier months.

3 The narrowing of spreads over Treasuries included those on Federal Home Loan
Bank consolidated obligations even though Standard & Poor’s placed three more FHLBs
under negative credit watch for their counterparty risk ratings.  Meanwhile, Freddie Mac
announced a $5 billion upward revision to earnings for the 2000 to 2002 period but stated
that quarterly and full-year results for 2003 would not be available until the middle of next
year.  Nonetheless, its stock moved up on the day of the restatement, apparently as a result
of the resolution of uncertainty.  

(2) The expected path of the federal funds rate remained essentially flat

through the first quarter of 2004, likely held down by policymakers’ statements, but

steepened somewhat beyond that point on the gathering evidence of a more vigorous

economic expansion.  Judging from interest rate options data, investors’ sense of

uncertainty about the future course of policy rose over the period, especially at longer

horizons.  A recent Desk survey of primary dealers indicated that none anticipates a

change in policy at this meeting and only a few foresee any changes in the balance-of-

risks assessment.  However, about two-thirds of the dealers said that they expect the

reference to a "considerable period" will be removed or modified.  Reportedly, many

believe the considerable period phrase will be replaced with language that provides the

Committee with greater flexibility in adjusting policy going forward.  

(3) The better economic news promoted a narrowing of risk spreads,

particularly for lower-tier instruments (chart 2).3  Market participants appeared

unconcerned about risk and liquidity over year-end, with spreads on money-market

instruments spanning the turn evidencing little of the usual end-of-year rise.  (See box

entitled “(Lack of) Year-End Pressures.”)  Equity markets advanced noticeably over

the intermeeting period, with some indexes touching new highs for the year and

implied volatility remaining very low.  The Wilshire 5000 rose about 4 percent and

indexes of stock prices for smaller and for high-tech firms recorded larger gains.  

(4) The dollar dropped about 1¼ percent on net over the intermeeting

period against an index of major trading partners’ currencies (chart 3).  During the

(Lack of) Year-end Pressures

To date in 2003, year-end pressures in money markets have been negligible.  In the
commercial paper market, the spread of yields on two-month A2/P2 paper over
those on comparable-maturity Treasury RPs was largely unchanged as the maturity
of that paper crossed year-end, a considerable departure from typical behavior in
recent years (left-hand panel of chart below).  Similarly, term federal funds spreads
point to muted year-end pressures in the interbank market (right-hand panel). 
Rates on federal funds futures contracts suggest that the expected deviation of the
effective federal funds rate from its target on December 31 is within historical
norms.

A number of factors may be contributing to the lack of year-end pressures in these
markets.  The recent absence of major adverse credit events in the commercial
paper market, the generally improving credit climate, and the continued
contraction in paper outstanding have reportedly attenuated perceptions of
rollover risk.  Further declines in the volatility of the federal funds rate this year to
a very low level may have helped convince market participants that conditions in
the federal funds market will remain tame around year-end.

System or the Treasury.

first two weeks of the period, the dollar was boosted by better-than-expected U.S.

economic data.  After early November, however, the release of capital flow data

suggesting that private investors’ willingness to finance the U.S. current account

deficit may be diminishing, concerns about escalating trade frictions, developments in

Iraq, and terrorist attacks all weighed on the dollar.  Indications that economic activity

in Europe is firming helped push the dollar to a new low against the euro and to a loss

of more than 2½ percent over the period.  The dollar also weakened somewhat

against the pound but rose slightly versus the Canadian dollar.  Stock markets in

Europe and Canada continued to rally, with prices rising 4 to 7 percent.  The dollar

was about unchanged on balance against the yen as Japanese authorities made large

intervention purchases of dollars.4  With concerns resurfacing about the sustainability

of the Japanese recovery, stock prices in Japan fell back early in the period, but they

later recovered somewhat in part on news that the government is taking forceful

action to resolve a failing regional bank.  Sovereign bond yields in most major foreign

countries rose by modest amounts over the intermeeting period.  Central banks in the

United Kingdom and Australia tightened policy rates, pointing in both cases to the

possibility of increasing inflationary pressures owing to the greater economic strength

at home and abroad.

(5) The dollar edged up against an index of currencies of our other

important trading partners.  The dollar rose more noticeably against the Mexican peso

and the Brazilian real, as recent economic performance in those countries has been

soft.  Nevertheless, financial markets continued to register support for Brazil’s reform

program; its EMBI+ spread narrowed further during the intermeeting period to less



5

than 5 percentage points, the lowest level in more than five years.  Emerging market

economies in Asia continued to benefit from the global high-tech revival and a

bounceback from earlier effects of the SARS epidemic.  In most of these countries,

stock prices recorded modest gains.  In Korea, the won dropped about ¾ percent,

apparently reflecting concerns about the strength of domestic demand, worries about

rising financial strains, and reactions to reports that the Bank of Korea was

conducting intervention sales of won.

(6) Business borrowing has remained subdued in recent months, while

household debt growth appears to have slowed from its earlier rapid pace.  So far in

the fourth quarter, debt growth of nonfinancial businesses seems to have about

matched the 3 percent rate seen in the third quarter.  Although gross bond issuance

has remained brisk, the proceeds reportedly have been earmarked mostly to retire

maturing bonds and to pay down short-term debt, which continued to run off in

October and November.  Spurred by rising stock prices, gross equity issuance has

picked up, with the proceeds also directed, in part, to reducing existing debt. 

Available data suggest that household debt growth has slowed in recent months from

the double-digit expansion over the first three quarters of the year.  A drop in

refinancing activity from the record high levels of the summer has acted to hold down

home mortgage growth, and a scaling back of auto incentive programs probably has

weighed on consumer credit.  With state and local debt growth also moderating some,

and federal debt continuing to advance at about its third quarter pace, expansion of

total domestic nonfinancial sector debt is expected to slow a percentage point to a

7 percent rate in the fourth quarter. 

(7) The falloff in mortgage refinancing from its peak this summer also has

contributed to a contraction of M2 in each of the past three months.  Robust inflows

into stock mutual funds suggest that the declines in M2 may also reflect shifts of

encountered in meeting them.

household portfolio preferences toward equities.5  In contrast, a rebound in currency

growth from the surprisingly weak pace of late summer has provided a little support

to M2 growth.  The outflows from M2 accounts were accompanied by two months of

contraction in bank credit, although bank credit growth rebounded in November.

Policy Alternatives

(8) Stronger-than-expected incoming data have led the staff to mark up its

projection for the level of spending in the current quarter and over the forecast

horizon.  The staff forecast now assumes that policy tightening will begin in the first

quarter of 2005–a half-year earlier than in the October Greenbook–and will push the

funds rate up to 2 percent by the end of that year–50 basis points higher than in the

last round.  Longer-term corporate yields are projected to edge lower next year as

market expectations for policy converge toward the shallower trajectory assumed by

the staff and as the improvement in the economic outlook further narrows risk

spreads.  Over the forecast interval, equity prices are assumed to rise enough from

their current levels to yield risk-adjusted returns in line with those on fixed-income

instruments, while the dollar is assumed to move gradually lower in 2004 at the same

rate as in the last Greenbook.  Given these accommodative financial conditions,

output is projected to expand about 5¼ percent in 2004.  A shift toward fiscal

restraint in 2005, combined with the assumed monetary policy tightening, contributes

to a moderation of the advance in GDP to about 3¾ percent in that year.  Despite the

upward revisions to projected output, the output gap over the forecast interval is only

a touch narrower than in the last round, as the staff has also marked up the paths for

structural productivity and potential output.  With actual growth exceeding that of

potential next year, the civilian unemployment rate is projected to fall substantially by

the end of 2004 before leveling out at about its estimated natural rate in the second

half of 2005.  Lingering resource slack is seen as putting slight further downward

pressure on core PCE inflation, bringing it to a pace just above 1 percent in 2004 and

2005.

(9) If the Committee finds reasonably likely and acceptable the staff forecast

that output growth will run above that of potential for the next several quarters while



8

core PCE inflation stabilizes near 1 percent, it might choose an unchanged target

for the federal funds rate at this meeting.  The Committee might see the recent

strength in overall spending and the apparent waning of business caution evidenced

by the upturn in hiring and pickup in investment as signs that a more robust

expansion is now under way and that the threat of a significant decline in inflation has

receded.  Even if the Committee is somewhat concerned that growth could still falter,

it might see that risk as being balanced by the possibility that the expansion could

outpace expectations, particularly in view of recent data.  And, alternatively, even if

the Committee believes that the next policy move will probably be toward tightening

in view of recent strong growth and the relatively low real federal funds rate (chart 4),

it might also believe that the tightening process need not begin any time soon in light

of the current low level of inflation and substantial degree of resource slack. 

(10) If, however, the Committee is especially concerned that economic

growth may not remain rapid enough to return output to its potential reasonably

promptly and that resource slack may contribute to a significant further decline in

inflation, then it might choose to cut the target for the federal funds rate by

25 basis points at this meeting.  Though most incoming data of late have pointed to

a strengthening in economic activity, the Committee might see this surge in demand as

likely to be only temporary, perhaps along the lines of the “weaker household

spending” simulation in the Greenbook.  Evidence that might be taken as supporting

this view could include the apparent substantial deceleration in personal consumption

expenditures in the current quarter, the contraction in the broad monetary aggregates

and bank credit, continued tepid growth in business debt, and a moderation in

household borrowing.  In such circumstances, a quarter-point easing at this meeting

might be seen as desirable to foster a continuation of brisk growth in output and an

acceptably rapid closing of the output gap.  Furthermore, members may regard the

prevailing rate of inflation as near the bottom of a range that they view as desirable

over the longer run and may wish to implement a policy stance that reduces downside

risks to growth while increasing the scope for inflation to move up somewhat over

time. 

Policy Announcement, Directive, and Assessment of Risks.

(11) If the Committee chooses to maintain its current policy stance, it may

want to adopt language in the rationale paragraph of its announcement generally

similar to that in the statement following the October meeting (see appendix A), with

appropriate revisions to reflect recent economic data.  The rationale paragraph could

again begin by noting that the accommodative stance of policy and vigorous growth in

productivity are providing ongoing support to economic activity.  In view of the

robust performance of the economy in the third quarter and the tenor of the available

indicators for the current quarter, the Committee might now wish to state that

“output is expanding briskly” rather than “spending is firming.”  Consistent with the

labor market report for October and weekly data on unemployment claims, the

Committee may now want to characterize labor market conditions as “improving

modestly,” rather than as “stabilizing,” particularly if, as the staff expects, employment

registers a further gain in November.  (The employment report for that month will be

released on December 5, the day after this Bluebook is finalized.)  The inflation

sentence could again note that price increases remain muted, and it could also indicate

that inflation is expected to remain low.  If the Committee instead elects to ease

policy, the rationale paragraph would presumably need to be augmented to note the

Committee’s desire to help ensure that the economic expansion remains on track and

to guard against a significant further decline in inflation.

(12) In the balance of risks paragraph, there would appear to be two

plausible settings for the assessment of the risks to the outlook for economic growth



10

and two for the risks to the attainment of price stability over the next few quarters. 

Risks to growth might now be seen as balanced or weighted to the upside, and risks to

inflation might now be viewed as weighted to the downside or balanced.  Table 1

displays several possibilities for the overall assessment of risks given alternative

characterizations of the individual risks.

(13) In characterizing the risks to the outlook for sustainable economic

growth, the Committee may view economic growth as likely to moderate from its

third-quarter pace but also likely to remain strong enough to return output to a level

close to potential over the next few quarters.  This outlook might argue for retention

of an assessment that “the upside and downside risks to the attainment of sustainable growth for

the next few quarters are roughly equal.”  Such a judgment would be consistent with an

interpretation of the term “sustainable economic growth” that allows for above-trend

expansion for a time as long as growth appears on track to return to around that of

potential once resource slack has been eliminated.  Under this interpretation, the

Committee might see the risk that economic growth could falter next year as roughly



11

balanced by the risk that economic growth could be quite robust and push the level of

output appreciably above potential.  If the Committee instead interprets sustainable

economic growth as simply denoting the growth rate of the economy’s potential to

produce, then, in view of recent economic data and the low real federal funds rate, it

might be appropriate to indicate that “the risks to growth are tilted to the upside”–unless the

Committee still remains to be convinced that spending growth will stay rapid enough

to support an acceptably robust expansion.

(14) In characterizing the risks to the outlook for inflation, even if the

Committee finds the staff forecast of brisk growth in output and employment

plausible, it might again conclude that “. . . the probability, though minor, of an unwelcome fall

in inflation exceeds that of a rise in inflation from its already low level.”  Such an assessment

would be supported by the expected persistence of an output gap for several more

quarters, a development that presumably would be accompanied by at least some

downward pressure on inflation, as in the staff forecast.  Also, the Committee might

be quite uncertain about the range of possible macroeconomic outcomes and attach

significant probability to those in which economic slack fails to diminish appreciably

next year, perhaps because of continued rapid growth of productivity that fails to

engender corresponding growth in aggregate demand and generates downward

pressures on prices as a result.  In contrast, the Committee may see the odds of such

outcomes for resource utilization as increasingly remote given the strength of

spending and output in recent months and tentative signs of improvement in the

labor market.  Moreover, the Committee might regard the recent depreciation of the

dollar and run-up in market-based measures of inflation compensation since the

summer as raising the odds somewhat that inflation pressures could emerge.  In these

circumstances, the Committee might now see the risks to the inflation outlook as balanced. 



12

An intermediate position may be to modify the existing sentence to indicate that the

risks to inflation are still tilted, but less so than in recent months.

(15) With some combinations of assessments of growth and inflation risks,

the appropriate choice of the overall risk assessment seems obvious, but, with

others, it is less so.  The choice of the overall risk assessment is discussed in the next

three paragraphs.

(16)  As shown in upper left cell of Table 1, if the Committee remains especially

concerned about the possibility of an unwelcome disinflation and still views the risks

to sustainable growth as balanced, then its overall risk assessment would again

presumably point to undesirably low inflation as its predominant concern.  As noted

in the upper right cell, if the Committee views the risks to its outlooks for both inflation

and growth as balanced, it likely would also adopt a balanced overall assessment.

(17) As indicated in the bottom left cell, two possibilities for the overall risk

assessment seem most plausible for the case in which the Committee sees inflation

risks weighted toward an unwelcome decline and risks to sustainable economic

growth weighted to the upside.  If the Committee believes the costs of an unwelcome

decline in inflation would be large relative to those of unsustainably rapid growth, it

might cite undesirably low inflation as its predominant concern.  This combination

would be particularly appropriate if the Committee interprets “sustainable economic

growth” simply as the growth of potential but does not believe that above-trend

expansion over the next several quarters threatens to push the level of output beyond

potential and thus spur inflation.  Alternatively, the Committee might perceive the

overall risks to its dual objectives as roughly balanced if the risk of an unwelcome fall

in inflation–albeit still present–was less of a concern than at recent meetings, while

unsustainably rapid growth posed a risk of pushing output above potential.  Although

concluding that unsustainably rapid growth is the predominant concern is a logical



13

possibility in this cell, it seems unlikely that the Committee would make such a sharp

shift to the overall assessment even while maintaining that the risks to inflation were

still tilted to the downside.  

(18) As shown in the bottom right cell, the Committee would seem to face two

choices for its overall risk assessment in the event that it judges that inflation risks are

balanced and that risks to sustainable growth are weighted to the upside.  If

sustainable growth is interpreted to mean expansion at the same rate as potential

output and the Committee believes that the level of output is unlikely to rise above

potential, then it might view overall risks as balanced.  However, if the Committee

sees some risk that above-trend expansion of economic activity could push the level

of output above potential before very long, it might choose to report that

unsustainably rapid growth is its predominant concern.

(19) The final issue relating to the policy announcement is whether to retain,

modify, or delete the sentence “In these circumstances, the Committee believes that policy

accommodation can be maintained for a considerable period.”  This sentence has been the focus

of much discussion in markets in recent weeks, and its treatment in the Committee’s

statement will influence investors’ assessments of the near-term policy outlook.  In

particular, investors are likely to respond sharply to any change in the sentence that

suggests tightening is becoming imminent.  The Committee might choose to leave the

sentence unchanged if it believes that economic growth will most likely moderate

considerably from the surge in the third quarter and that an appreciable output gap

and attendant risks of an unwelcome decline in inflation from its current low level

remain the dominant considerations, implying that the need to firm policy is still well

in the future.  Even if the Committee sees increasing odds that it will need to begin

tightening policy before too long and that it will thus soon want to modify or drop the

sentence, it might prefer to defer such changes at this meeting pending further



14

evidence on whether an acceptably vigorous economic recovery is likely to be

sustained.  Moreover, the Committee might find it desirable to make any changes to

that sentence in tandem with other adjustments in the statement that might be

implemented following the review of communications policy in January.

(20) The Committee might see a modification or elimination of the

considerable period sentence as warranted by any of several considerations.  It might

simply feel that the need for policy precommitment has diminished and that it is now

appropriate to loosen a potential constraint on policy.  Or, more specifically, it might

anticipate that tighter policy could be needed relatively soon and judge that dropping

or altering the sentence would be advisable in advance of any tightening move.  Or it

might feel that such a change would be especially congruent with a move to upside

risks on growth or to balanced risks on inflation.  One approach to modifying the

sentence slightly at this time, with the intention of dropping it eventually, would be to

declare that the Federal Reserve “. . . can be patient in adjusting the stance of monetary policy.”

Another would be to say that policy accommodation can be maintained “. . . for a

while.”  Still another would be to make continued accommodation contingent on

developments affecting the economic outlook or inflation prospects.  The Committee

could accompany such changes by noting that the real federal funds rate is below its

long-run equilibrium level.  Market participants would likely read any such

modification as the first step in an exit strategy from the Committee’s current highly

accommodative policy stance, and interest rates could back up as investors brought

forward somewhat the anticipated onset of policy tightening, but the increases might

be contained by an implication that tightening is probably still some time off and,

when it did occur, need not be aggressive.

(21)  Should the Committee wish to follow the same procedure as at the last

three meetings, it could vote on the directive and on language providing guidance to



15

the drafters of the announcement regarding the risk assessment.  Draft language with

a range of options is provided below. 

1) Directive Wording

The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and

financial conditions that will foster price stability and promote

sustainable growth in output.  To further its long-run objectives, the

Committee in the immediate future seeks conditions in reserve markets

consistent with maintaining/INCREASING/REDUCING the federal

funds rate at/TO an average of around ___ 1 percent.

(2) Risk Assessment

Against the background of its long-run goals of price stability and

sustainable economic growth and of the information currently available,

the Committee believes the risks to its outlook for sustainable economic

growth over the next several quarters [ARE WEIGHTED TOWARD

THE DOWNSIDE] [are balanced] [ARE WEIGHTED TOWARD

THE UPSIDE]; the risks to its outlook for inflation over the next

several quarters [are weighted toward the downside] [ARE

BALANCED] [ARE WEIGHTED TOWARD THE UPSIDE]; and,

taken together, the balance of risks to its objectives [are weighted toward

the downside] [ARE BALANCED] [ARE WEIGHTED TOWARD

THE UPSIDE] in the foreseeable future. 

Market Reaction

(22) Market participants expect no change in the stance of monetary policy at

this meeting, and most do not foresee an alteration in the three-sentence assessment

of risks.  As noted above, the market’s reaction to the announcement of such a policy

choice would be shaped to an important extent by the Committee’s decision regarding



16

the “considerable period” sentence.  Judging from recent surveys, better-than-

expected economic news has led a majority of market participants to put significant

odds on a modification of this sentence.  Consequently, a statement encompassing no

change in policy, no change in the Committee’s overall risk assessment or its

components, and no change in the considerable-period sentence could well prompt

some drop in yields.  Market participants’ fixation on the last sentence of the

announcement suggests that, if it were kept unchanged, shorter-term yields might not

move much even if the Committee shifted its assessment of inflation risks to balance,

or if it noted risks of unsustainably rapid growth but continued to indicate that

undesirably low inflation remained its predominant concern.  By contrast, interest

rates could rise, perhaps substantially, in response to any statement that completely

eliminated the considerable period sentence, and such increases would probably be

amplified by any accompanying change in the individual or overall balance of risk

assessments that pointed to lessened concerns about disinflationary pressures or

increased concerns about excessively rapid economic growth.  As noted above, the

market reaction probably would be muted by a statement that modified the

considerable period language but retained the sense that tightening was not imminent

and implied that, when it did occur, might well be implemented relatively gradually.

(23) A decision to ease policy at this meeting would surprise investors, and

other short-term interest rates would follow the federal funds rate lower.  The

consequences for longer-maturity yields would depend in part on the market’s reading

of the risk assessment and the considerable period sentence.  If the balance of risks

and the considerable period sentence were left unchanged from those in the October

announcement, it seems likely that intermediate- and longer-term yields would fall as

market participants came to see the Federal Reserve as intent on keeping short-term

rates even lower for some time to counter a significant risk that the economic



17

expansion could falter next year.  Alternatively, longer-term yields could rise if the

announcement led investors to believe that the Federal Reserve wanted to see a higher

long-run level of inflation or was at least willing to tolerate some risk of more inflation

to foster a brisker return of output to its potential.

Monetary and Credit Aggregates

(24) The staff anticipates that M2 will expand a little in December and

accelerate somewhat further over coming months.  Refinancing effects should exert

less drag, and faster growth of nominal income will provide a lift to money growth.

Still, the velocity of M2 is expected to increase modestly as investors continue to favor

capital market instruments at the expense of M2 assets.  On balance, M2 is projected

to expand at a 5½ percent annual rate from November through June.

(25) Growth of total domestic nonfinancial sector debt is projected to

moderate next year but to a pace that still exceeds that of nominal income.  Much of

the deceleration in total debt reflects a slowing in the expansion of mortgage credit, as

mortgage rates are expected to remain close to current levels throughout next year.  

Borrowing by state and local governments is also expected to slow some, largely

reflecting a decline in the pace of advance refundings.  Federal debt growth is

projected to pick up a bit next year but then to drop back substantially in 2005

following an anticipated turn toward fiscal restraint.  Borrowing in the business sector

is expected to strengthen over the forecast horizon, buoyed by an increase in capital

outlays and inventories and a corresponding increase in the business financing gap.

Appendix A:  The October FOMC Announcement

Paragraph Text

1. Policy decision The Federal Open Market Committee decided today to keep
its target for the federal funds rate at 1 percent.

2. Rationale The Committee continues to believe that an accommodative
stance of monetary policy, coupled with robust underlying
growth in productivity, is providing important ongoing
support to economic activity. The evidence accumulated over
the intermeeting period confirms that spending is firming, and
the labor market appears to be stabilizing. Business pricing
power and increases in core consumer prices remain muted.

3. Assessment of
risks

The Committee perceives that the upside and downside risks
to the attainment of sustainable growth for the next few
quarters are roughly equal. In contrast, the probability, though
minor, of an unwelcome fall in inflation exceeds that of a rise
in inflation from its already low level. The Committee judges
that, on balance, the risk of inflation becoming undesirably
low remains the predominant concern for the foreseeable
future. In these circumstances, the Committee believes that
policy accommodation can be maintained for a considerable
period.

4. Vote Voting for the FOMC monetary policy action were: Alan
Greenspan, Chairman; Ben S. Bernanke; Susan S. Bies; J.
Alfred Broaddus, Jr.; Roger W. Ferguson, Jr.; Edward M.
Gramlich; Jack Guynn; Donald L. Kohn; Michael H. Moskow;

Appendix B:  Review of Debt and Money Growth in 2003

Rapid expansion in household and federal debt pushed the growth of total debt of
domestic nonfinancial sectors higher in 2003 despite continued sluggish business borrowing. 
The pattern of nonfederal borrowing within the year was shaped importantly by the path of
longer-term interest rates, which fell over the first half, but then jumped considerably in early
summer in response to evolving views of the economic outlook and changing policy
expectations.

Over the year, the level of business debt rose modestly, as low investment spending
was largely financed internally.  As long-term rates fell through mid-year and credit
spreads–especially for riskier borrowers–narrowed, there was considerable substitution
toward bond financing and away from shorter-term debt.  Household mortgage borrowing
continued at a torrid pace for the year as a whole, although it moderated in the fourth
quarter.  Mortgage rates followed Treasury rates lower in the spring, and both new mortgage
originations and mortgage refinancings surged.  Some of the refinancing activity may have
depressed consumer credit growth as households extracted equity from their homes. 
Nevertheless, consumer debt posted a moderate rise, buoyed by heavy spending on durables,
especially autos.  A substantial widening of the federal deficit, reflecting tax cuts and
increased federal spending, forced the Treasury to increase its borrowing significantly.

Despite a pickup in nominal GDP growth, the expansion of M2 for 2003 as a whole
was somewhat below the pace of last year.  Deposits associated with the refinancing of
mortgages underlying mortgage-backed securities surged in the summer, reflecting record
refinancing activity, but subsequently ran off as refinancing slowed.  In addition, the
improved economic outlook and sustained rally in equity markets may have encouraged
households to limit their accumulation of the safe and liquid assets in M2.

Domestic Nonfinancial Sector Debt

Aggregate debt of domestic nonfinancial sectors grew 8½ percent in 2003,
significantly faster than nominal income and well above last year’s pace.  Nonfederal debt
expanded about 8 percent, a percentage point faster than in 2002.  Business borrowing,
though not robust, was stronger than it had been last year.  Household debt increased
11¼ percent, a bit more than in 2002.  State and local government debt rose 8½ percent this
year, down somewhat from the rapid pace in 2002, while larger deficits caused federal debt
growth to pick up to 11 percent.

Overall demand for business credit was weak and its composition was tilted toward
long-term securities.  Higher profits in concert with subdued investment spending restrained
the growth of business credit, and the decline in long-term interest rates in the first half of
the year made bonds an attractive source of funding for nonfinancial firms.  Moreover,
corporate risk spreads–especially on speculative-grade issues–narrowed significantly,
reflecting the increasing strength of the economic recovery and an apparent rise in investors’



B-2

appetite for risk, perhaps owing as well to the waning influence of recent accounting and
governance scandals.  As a result of lower interest rates and narrowed spreads, corporate
bond issuance was robust, particularly over the first half of the year, and a good deal of the
proceeds was used to pay down short-term debt, including C&I loans and commercial paper. 
The contraction in business loans was concentrated at the largest commercial banks as
demand from larger corporate customers was further restrained by a dearth of merger and
acquisition activity; business lending at small banks, by contrast, grew moderately over the
year.  Firms that issued commercial paper found a very receptive market because of the
relative scarcity of commercial paper outstanding and lower perceived risk resulting from the
restructuring of corporate balance sheets.

Despite persistently high vacancy rates and falling rents, the growth of commercial
mortgages was strong for most of the year.  Because delinquencies remained low and
property values continued to rise, credit ratings for borrowers were well maintained. 
Anecdotal reports suggest that many firms that own real estate tapped this market, issuing
relatively cheap, collateralized debt in lieu of other, more costly debt.  The issuance of
commercial mortgage-backed securities remained correspondingly brisk throughout the year.

The strong growth in household debt reflected both robust home buying and
substantial consumer spending.  Record-low mortgage rates in the first half of the year gave
rise to exceptionally high levels of household mortgage originations for both new purchases
and refinancing activity.  Many households used cash-out refinancings to fund consumer
spending or to pay down other debt.  Nevertheless, consumer credit grew at a moderate rate
over the year, supported by spending on durable goods, especially autos.  Consumer credit
may have been boosted especially by attractive terms on car loans from automakers’ captive
finance companies.

Even with the rapid growth in debt, most measures of the financial condition of
households did not deteriorate over the past year.  With the effects of lower interest rates
offsetting those of higher debts, household debt-service and financial obligation ratios were
little changed, although household filings for bankruptcy were about 7 percent above the
level posted in 2002.  The climb in equity prices over the year, coupled with a continued rise
in house prices, noticeably boosted household assets relative to disposable income.  On net,
gains in assets outstripped the increase in household debt, and the ratio of household net
worth to disposable income rose.

The rally in equity markets was associated with a reallocation of household portfolios
out of bond funds—especially government bond funds—and into equity funds.  Later in the
year, allegations of wrongdoing spurred some investors to withdraw their money from
certain mutual fund companies, but evidently not from the industry as a whole.  Anecdotal
reports suggest that such outflows did not cause a significant cash squeeze for the funds
experiencing withdrawals.



B-3

6 In January, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Interpretation 46
(“Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities”) which required the consolidation of
some variable interest entities onto the balance sheets of banks.  Although
implementation initially was mandated for the first reporting period starting after
June 15, it subsequently was pushed back to the end of the year.  Some institutions
nevertheless did consolidate assets in July, and the reported figures for depository
credit growth have been adjusted to remove the effects of those consolidations.

Gross issuance of debt by state and local governments was robust as municipalities
borrowed for short-term cash needs and for capital expenditures in the face of tax shortfalls. 
Because of widespread financial distress, several states, most notably California, were
downgraded.  Municipal borrowing was strongest earlier in the year, as governments took
advantage of low longer-term rates to fund capital expenditures and to advance refund
existing higher-cost debt.  Later, as interest rates backed up and the pool of debt eligible for
advance refunding dwindled, the rate of growth of municipal debt slowed.

Large tax cuts and increased spending caused the Treasury to ramp up federal
borrowing in 2003.  As had been the case in 2002, the Treasury was forced temporarily to
resort to accounting devices when the statutory debt ceiling became a constraint in the
spring.  However, Congress then raised the ceiling from $6.4 trillion to $7.4 trillion and there
was essentially no disruption to debt markets.  Given the rapid pace of federal borrowing,
the current debt ceiling will likely bind again some time in the spring of 2004.

With large deficits expected to last for the foreseeable future, the Treasury altered its
regular auction cycle to accommodate a greater need for borrowing.  The Treasury re-
introduced the three-year note in its May refunding auctions to ease its reliance on the two-
year note.  In addition, the Treasury increased the frequency of five-year note auctions,
making them monthly, and added a reopening of the ten-year note in the month following
each new quarterly offering.  As a result of these changes, the average maturity of
outstanding Treasury debt, which had reached its lowest level in decades, began to rise in the
latter half of the year.

Depository Credit

Depository credit grew 6-1/4 percent in 2003, quite a bit slower than the overall
expansion in domestic nonfinancial debt.  Growth in depository credit importantly reflected
mortgage lending and the acquisition of mortgage-backed securities at both banks and thrifts. 
Consumer lending was also substantial, reflecting robust spending on durable goods.  In
stark contrast, business loans ran off, as large banks shed far more C&I loans than small
banks added.6  Although banks’ standards and terms on such loans were tightened somewhat
further in the first half of the year before flattening out, the decline in business loans appears



B-4

to have reflected primarily a drop in demand.  The high reported levels of bank capital and
bank profits throughout 2003–as well as banks’ apparent willingness to lend to other
borrowers–support this view.  

Monetary Aggregates

The velocity of M2 declined in the first two quarters of 2003, in part reflecting the
lagged effect of policy easings over the past couple of years.  Nevertheless, the contraction in
money in the fourth quarter pulled growth for the year down to 5½ percent, a bit lower than
the expansion in nominal income.  Much of the robust growth in the aggregate around mid-
year was in liquid deposits and likely owed to the wave of mortgage refinancings, which
boosted M2 as the proceeds were temporarily placed in non-interest-bearing accounts
pending disbursement to the holders of mortgage-backed securities.  As mortgage rates
retraced their decline, however, and the wave of refinancing slowed, this special factor
unwound.  In addition, the sustained rally in equity markets may have caused a substitution
away from money, an interpretation consistent with the rapid inflows into equity mutual
funds.  In the event, M2 contracted for several months in the fall.  Within M2, the low yields
on money market mutual funds caused a reallocation away from such funds and toward
liquid deposits.
