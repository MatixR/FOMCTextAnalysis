MONETARY POLICY ALTERNATIVES 

Recent Developments 

(1) The Committee’s decision at the November meeting—to increase the target 

federal funds rate 25 basis points to 2 percent, to assess the risks to sustainable 

economic growth and price stability as balanced, and to retain the “measured pace” 

language—had been widely anticipated and prompted little reaction in financial 

markets.1  Over the intermeeting period, expectations for the path of policy over the 

next year firmed slightly on net (Chart 1), apparently owing to inflation releases that 

were a bit higher than anticipated, the Chairman’s remarks at the European Banking 

Congress on November 19, dollar depreciation, and the effect of falling oil prices on 

the growth outlook.  This modest firming of near-term policy expectations occurred 

even though data on real activity came in a little softer on balance than the market had 

anticipated.  Beyond next year, the expected trajectory of policy appears to have been 

revised down a bit.  Judging from federal funds futures, investors have almost 

completely priced in a quarter-point tightening at this meeting.  The Desk’s survey of 

primary dealers indicates that they unanimously anticipate a quarter-point tightening 

as well as retention of an assessment of balanced risks and the “measured pace” 

language.  Futures quotes imply that investors expect about 50 basis points of 

cumulative tightening over the first three meetings in 2005 and another 25 basis 

points later in the year. 

                                           
1 The effective federal funds rate averaged 2.00 percent over the intermeeting period.  The Desk 
expanded the System’s outright holdings of securities by $8.6 billion, with purchases of $0.5 billion 
of Treasury bills from foreign official customers and $2.5 billion of Treasury bills and $5.5 billion of 
Treasury coupon securities from the market.  The volume of outstanding long-term RPs increased 
$3.0 billion, to $20 billion.

(2) The small upward revision in policy expectations for the next year 

contributed to a modest rise in yields on shorter-term Treasury coupon securities.2  

However, longer-term Treasury yields, which were buffeted during the period by 

speculation about prospects for foreign official holdings of Treasury securities, 

finished the period 5 to 10 basis points lower, perhaps reflecting in part the weaker-

than-expected data on economic activity.3  Much of the decline in longer-term yields 

was concentrated in forward rates at distant horizons.  The volatility of long-term 

interest rates implied by options prices edged lower over the period.  TIPS yields fell 

5 to 10 basis points.  Inflation compensation for the next five years rose slightly, 

extending its advance of the past several months.  Inflation compensation over the 

subsequent five years, however, remained well anchored, and survey measures of 

long-term inflation expectations were little changed. 

(3) Investment-grade corporate bond yields fell somewhat more than those on 

comparable Treasury securities over the intermeeting period, implying a further 

decline in risk spreads of 5 to 10 basis points (Chart 2).  Speculative-grade spreads 

also edged down.  Market commentary noted sizable inflows to junk bond mutual 

funds and brisk issuance of speculative-grade bonds as evidence of strong investor 

appetite for riskier securities.  Spreads on agency debt narrowed slightly despite 

persisting issues regarding GSE accounting and oversight, apparently in response to 

slowing growth of agency balance sheets and speculation that monetary authorities in 

some foreign countries have begun shifting the composition of their official portfolios 

away from Treasuries and toward agency securities.  Investors noted the steep 

increase over recent weeks in agency securities held in custody at the Federal Reserve 

Bank of New York as evidence in support of this hypothesis.  Year-end pressures in 
                                           
2 The expectations hypothesis of the term structure implies that about half of the rise in the two-year 
yield over this intermeeting period had been expected at the time of the November meeting and so 
does not reflect revisions to policy expectations. 
3 The Treasury debt ceiling was binding early in the intermeeting period, but this had limited market 
repercussions, and the ceiling was subsequently raised on November 18.

money markets have been subdued so far this year (see box).  Major equity indexes 

ended the period up 1½ to 4 percent, buoyed in part by falling oil prices, while 

implied volatility on equities declined a little further.     

 

(4) For most of the intermeeting period, the dollar continued its recent 

downward trend even though new data from major foreign industrial countries 

generally suggested somewhat more tepid economic growth than had been expected 

(Chart 3).   Toward the end of the period, the dollar registered a sharp uptick, but for 

the period as a whole it lost about 1 percent versus a basket of other major currencies.  

Year-end Pressures 

Year-end funding pressures have been subdued so far this year.  These pressures were 
negligible in 2003 but had been substantial in previous years.  As shown in the bottom left 
panel, the spread of yields on thirty-day A2/P2 commercial paper over A1/P1 paper was 
little changed as the maturity of the paper crossed over year-end.  The spread of one-month 
term federal funds over Treasury RP rates (the bottom right panel) rose about 20 basis points 
as the maturity crossed into the new year, but this spread has since come back down.  Quotes 
on federal funds futures imply that the effective federal funds rate over year-end is not 
anticipated to depart much from the market’s expectation of a 2¼ percent target. 

The strengthening of business sector credit quality and the sharp decline in the amount of 
outstanding commercial paper over the last few years have likely reduced the premium  
investors require to hold lower-rated paper over the turn of the year.  Year-end pressures in 
uncollateralized overnight funding markets may have been tempered by the slightly below-
target effective federal funds rates at the end of 2002 and 2003, coupled with the very low 
level of volatility of the funds rate in recent years.

Negative views on the dollar appeared to owe mainly to market participants’ 

increasing focus on the financial implications of the U.S. current account deficit.  

Adding downward pressure were news reports that the monetary authorities in China 

and Russia may be replacing some of their dollar holdings with euros.  The dollar’s 

descent against the euro and yen provoked several statements by European and 

Japanese officials of their readiness to intervene.       

   .  On 

balance, the dollar depreciated about 1¾ percent against the yen and 2¾ percent 

against the euro.  In contrast, the dollar moved up 2¼ percent versus the Canadian 

dollar, reflecting lower oil prices and recent data showing weaker Canadian exports 

and employment.  The signs of slower growth in major foreign industrial countries 

were reflected in declines of about 5 to 30 basis points in yields on most long-term 

government bonds, while stock prices moved in narrow ranges.   

(5) The dollar also depreciated 1¼ percent against currencies of our other 

important trading partners during the intermeeting period.  The dollar fell 5 percent 

versus the Korean won, and the Bank of Korea cut its policy rate 25 basis points.  

Korea reported a large increase in its foreign exchange reserves that was attributed to 

intervention operations aimed at blunting the impact of the won’s rise on domestic 

economic growth.  The dollar also depreciated versus several other Asian currencies, 

notably including the Taiwan dollar and Thai baht.  The Bank of Mexico once again 

tightened monetary policy to restrain inflation, and the dollar fell 1¼ percent against 

the peso.  Although the pace of growth in Brazil appears to have slowed somewhat, 

financial markets continued to reward that country’s improved economic performance 

this year.  Brazilian stock prices climbed 4½ percent more during the intermeeting 

period, and Brazil’s EMBI+ spread narrowed 40 basis points.  Concerns about 

inflationary pressures prompted the Brazilian central bank to tighten monetary policy

in mid-November for the third time in the past four months.  Over the intermeeting 

period, the dollar fell about 1¼ percent against the real. 

(6) Domestic nonfinancial business-sector debt grew at about a 5 percent 

annual rate in the third quarter and appears to have accelerated in the current quarter.  

Net issuance of corporate bonds, especially those with speculative grades, rose smartly 

in November, spurred in part by a pickup in merger and acquisition activity (Chart 4).  

Short-term business borrowing, however, turned negative, with a sizable runoff in 

commercial paper offsetting a modest increase in C&I loans at banks.  Household 

mortgage debt grew at a rapid pace in the third quarter and, given the sustained 

strength in home sales, likely has continued to expand briskly in the current quarter.  

Federal debt is estimated to be surging at a 10 percent pace in the fourth quarter.  

Total domestic nonfinancial sector debt appears to be advancing at about an 8 percent 

annual rate in the fourth quarter, the same pace as in 2004 as a whole.  

(7) M2 rose at about a 6¼ percent annual rate in November, up from  

2½ percent in October.  This aggregate appears to be expanding a bit more slowly 

than nominal income in the fourth quarter, in line with the slight increase in the 

opportunity cost of holding M2 assets.  Retail money funds, in particular, have been 

weak as investors evidently have found alternative investments, such as Treasury bills 

and bond and stock funds, more attractive.  Inflows to equity funds are estimated to 

have picked up in November, following the upward trend in stock prices over the past 

few months.  For 2004 as a whole, M2 is estimated to have expanded 5¼ percent, and 

its velocity appears to have risen about 1 percent as opportunity costs increased.  

Appendix B analyzes the growth of money and the debt of domestic nonfinancial 

sectors this year.

Policy Alternatives 

(8) Since the publication of the November Greenbook, incoming data on 

spending and employment have been a bit stronger on balance than the staff had 

anticipated, and the outlook for near-term economic activity has been marked up as a 

result.4  Moreover, the recent rise in equity prices, declines in oil prices and the foreign 

exchange value of the dollar, and unexpectedly large gains in home prices are carried 

forward in level terms in the projection, providing a noticeable boost to aggregate 

demand.  Equity prices are assumed to rise at a rate yielding risk-adjusted returns 

similar to those on fixed-income investments; oil prices are projected to decline 

somewhat further, in line with futures quotes; the dollar is expected to depreciate 

gradually from its current lower level; and the pace of house price appreciation is 

forecast to slow to more modest rates in coming quarters.  The stimulus to spending 

from these factors is offset, in part, by a higher projected path for the federal funds 

rate, with the Committee now assumed to raise the funds rate to 2¾ percent by the 

end of 2005 and 3¼ percent by the end of 2006, in both cases 50 basis points higher 

than in the November Greenbook.  The projected path for the ten-year Treasury yield 

has been marked up a bit as well.  Long-term yields are expected to be roughly steady 

over the projection period, with the effects of rising short-term rates largely offset by 

reductions in expected future short rates as inflation pressures prove to be more 

subdued than currently anticipated by investors.  Against this financial backdrop, 

GDP growth averages a bit less than 4 percent over 2005 and 2006, about the same as 

for this year.  With potential output expanding at nearly a 3¼ percent pace, the 

unemployment rate edges down to about 5 percent, the staff’s estimate of the 

NAIRU, by the end of 2006, and the output gap is essentially closed.  The effects on 
                                           
4 The discussion in this paragraph is based on developments since the publication of the November 
Greenbook.  Of particular note, the employment report for October, which was released between 
Greenbook publication and the November FOMC meeting, was appreciably more robust than had 
been anticipated in the November staff forecast.

prices of the modest slack in resource markets in the interim are offset by the pass-

through of this year’s rise in energy prices, and core PCE inflation is forecast to 

remain near 1½ percent in 2005 and 2006.  However, with energy prices on a 

downward track, overall PCE inflation falls back from 2½ percent this year to about 

1¼ percent in 2005 and 2006. 

(9) This Bluebook presents three alternatives for the Committee’s consideration 

(see Table 1).  Under Alternative B, the federal funds rate would rise 25 basis points, 

but the statement would imply that the Committee saw a distinct possibility of a pause 

in tightening at an upcoming meeting.  Alternative C also envisions a 25-basis-point 

tightening, but the accompanying statement would give no indication that a pause was 

likely.  In all three cases, the description of labor market conditions in the rationale 

paragraph has been adjusted in light of the incoming data.  In Alternative A, the 

federal funds rate would remain at 2 percent.  Similarly, under all three alternatives, 

the Committee is assumed to retain both an assessment that the risks to its goals of 

stable prices and maximum sustainable growth are balanced and the “measured pace” 

language contained in the last several statements. 

(10) If the Committee views developments over the intermeeting period as 

having provided further evidence that the expansion is solidly on track, then it might 

be inclined to continue removing policy accommodation at a measured pace by 

tightening policy another 25 basis points at this meeting.  Should the Committee also 

expect that substantial further tightening will be desirable fairly soon, then it might 

want to issue a statement such as that in Alternative C, which does not hint at a 

possible pause in tightening at coming meetings.  Despite the four policy moves over 

the past several months, the real federal funds rate remains below the lower end of 

the 70 percent confidence band around the estimates of the short-run equilibrium real 

interest rate derived using the staff’s new methods.  The current rate is also below the 

estimate of the equilibrium rate that is implicit in the Greenbook forecast.  (See the

box entitled “New Estimates of the Equilibrium Real Rate” and Chart 5.)  These 

revised estimates may suggest that a somewhat more rapid and substantial tightening 

than previously perceived may be required to remove policy accommodation and head 

off a buildup of inflationary pressures.  In addition, members may anticipate more 

slowing in the underlying pace of productivity growth than does the staff.  Such a 

development would add to upward pressure on unit labor costs, and hence on overall 

inflation rates.  Also, the Committee may believe that effective labor market slack 

going forward could turn out to be quite limited—for example, if labor market 

participation, which has yet to turn distinctly higher, fails to increase as much as in the 

staff forecast.  In either case, the Committee might anticipate that aggregate demand 

will continue to expand at a pace above that of its potential for some time and 

consequently deem considerable further progress toward a more neutral policy stance 

desirable over coming months.  Alternative C would also seem appropriate if 

members were concerned that longer-term inflation expectations could move higher 

were the Committee not seen as responding sufficiently to inflationary impulses 

emanating from the decline in the dollar and the previous rise in oil prices. 

(11) The statement in Alternative C could be quite similar to that released 

following the November meeting.  In light of the relatively soft employment report 

for November, however, the announcement could indicate that labor market 

conditions “continue to improve gradually.”  Also, in view of the significant decline in oil 

prices in recent weeks, the clause on output could be revised to refer to the “earlier” 

rise in energy prices.  The general similarity of the language to that employed in 

November and the continued characterization of the policy stance as “accommodative” 

would avoid the suggestion that the Committee believes a pause in policy tightening is 

likely in the near term.  As drafted, the statement retains a balanced assessment of 

risks to sustainable growth and price stability—an assessment that some members 

might see as conditioned on an appropriate path for policy going forward—as well as 



  

New Estimates of the Equilibrium Real Federal Funds Rate 

This Bluebook introduces new estimates of the equilibrium real federal funds rate.  
The new estimates were developed to address shortcomings of the earlier measures 
that, as reported in the Bluebook Readership Survey, made them difficult to interpret.1  
One problem with the earlier measures was that the concept underlying the measures 
was not defined clearly.  For example, the time horizon—the period over which the 
output gap would be projected to close if the real funds rate were kept at its 
equilibrium level—differed across measures and was not clearly specified.  Second, the 
chart summarizing the various measures may have given a misleading picture of the 
uncertainty surrounding the point estimates.  Finally, the two-sided estimates that 
were included would seem to be inappropriate for real-time policymaking. 

The new chart reports two kinds of equilibrium rate measures, differing in terms 
of their time horizon.  The short-run equilibrium rate is defined to be the rate that, if 
sustained, would be projected to close the output gap in twelve quarters.  The 
medium-run measure is defined to be the rate projected to prevail in seven years 
under the assumption that monetary policy will act to eliminate economic slack in 
three years and to hold output at potential thereafter.  The new estimates are 
calculated based on three different models: a single-equation model of the output gap, 
a small structural model consisting of equations for five key macroeconomic variables, 
and the staff’s large-scale model (FRB/US).  In addition to the range encompassing 
the point estimates of the three models, the chart also displays confidence bands that 
illustrate the uncertainties surrounding the range of model estimates.  Also shown are 
the Greenbook-consistent measure of the short-run equilibrium rate—which is based 
on a version of the FRB/US model that has been adjusted to match the Greenbook 
forecast—and the medium-run equilibrium rate consistent with TIPS yields.  

The new model-based estimates shown in this Bluebook suggest a higher current 
level for the equilibrium real federal funds rate than did the range based on the old 
methods that was included in the November Bluebook.  This difference occurs mainly 
because we have dropped the measures based on the statistical-filter model, which 
exhibited implausibly large responses to surprises in output.  The Greenbook-
consistent measure currently yields an equilibrium rate lower than model-based 
estimates because the Greenbook projects that the recent weakness in aggregate 
demand will diminish more gradually than the models predict. 

It should be noted that the appropriate stance of policy relative to the equilibrium 
estimates in a given instance will depend on policymakers’ objectives and the 
projected paths for output and inflation.  Thus, these estimates of the equilibrium rate 
should not be interpreted as policy prescriptions, but rather as potential inputs to the 
policy process. 

1. The new estimates are shown in Chart 5.  The chart is accompanied by a brief set of explanatory notes; further 
details are provided in Flint Brayton and David Reifschneider, “Revised Bluebook Estimates of the Equilibrium 
Real Rate – Overview,” and “Revised Bluebook Estimates of the Equilibrium Real Rate – Technical 
Documentation,” memorandums to the FOMC, December 7, 2004.

Equilibrium Real Rate Chart: Explanatory Notes

The equilibrium real rate is the real federal funds rate that, if maintained, would be projected to return
output to its potential level over time.  The short-run equilibrium rate is defined as the rate that would
be anticipated to close the output gap in twelve quarters, and the medium-run concept is the value of
the real funds rate projected to keep output at potential in seven years under the assumption that
monetary policy acts to bring actual and potential output into line in the short run and then keep them
equal thereafter.  With the exception of the TIPS-consistent measure, the real federal funds rates
employ the log difference of the core PCE price index over the previous four quarters as a proxy for
expected inflation, with the staff projection used for the current quarter.  TIPS indexation is based on
the total CPI. 

Measure Description

Single-Equation

Model 

The measure of the equilibrium real rate in the single-equation model is based on an

estimated aggregate-demand relationship between the current value of the output gap

and its lagged values as well as the lagged values of the real federal funds rate.  In light

of this model’s simple structure, the short-run measure of the equilibrium real rate

depends only on the recent position of output relative to potential, and the medium-run

measure is virtually constant.

Small Structural

Model

The small-scale model of the economy consists of equations for five variables: the

output gap, the equity premium, the federal budget surplus, the trend growth rate of

output, and the real bond yield.  Unlike the estimates from the single-equation model,

values of the equilibrium real rate also depend directly on conditions associated with

output growth, fiscal policy, and capital markets.

Large M odel

(FRB/US)

Estimates of the equilibrium real rate using FRB/US— the staff’s large-scale econometric

model of the U.S. economy—depend on a very broad array of economic factors, some of

which take the form of projected values of the model’s exogenous variables.  These

projections make use of several simple forecasting rules which are appropriate for the

three-year horizon relevant for the short-run concept but are less sensible over longer

horizons.  Thus, we report only the short-run measure for the FRB/US model.

Greenbook-

consistent 

Measures of the equilibrium real rate cannot be directly obtained from the Greenbook

forecast, because the Greenbook is not based on a formal model.  Rather, we use the

FRB/US model in conjunction with an extended version of the Greenbook forecast to

derive a Greenbook-consistent measure.  FRB/US is first add-factored so that its

simulation matches the extended Greenbook forecast, and then a second simulation is

run off this baseline to determine the value of the real federal funds rate that closes the

output gap.  The medium-run concept of the equilibrium real rate is not computed

because it requires a relatively long extension of the Greenbook forecast.

TIPS-consistent Yields on TIPS (Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities) incorporate investors’

expectations of the future path of real interest rates.  The seven-year instantaneous real

forward rate derived from TIPS yields reflects the short-term real interest rate expected

to prevail in seven years as well as any applicable term premium.  The term premium is

assumed to be 70 basis points.

the “measured pace” language.  If the Committee nonetheless thought the margins of 

unused capacity could be relatively narrow and wanted to convey somewhat greater 

concern about the inflation outlook, it might do so by noting in the rationale 

paragraph that labor market conditions “continue to improve,” without indicating that 

the improvement was gradual, and that “the earlier rise in energy prices and an 

escalation of business costs have the potential to contribute to upward pressure on 

prices.”     

(12)     Market participants have essentially priced in a 25-basis-point rise in the 

federal funds target at this meeting and anticipate only relatively small changes in the 

statement.  As a result, an announcement like that in Alternative C would likely have 

little effect on financial markets.  However, a statement that included a reference to 

possible inflation pressures would presumably lead investors to boost their expected 

path for the federal funds rate, increasing real and nominal interest rates and weighing 

on stock prices.  Such a statement would also likely raise the sensitivity of market 

participants to inflation news over the intermeeting period.  

(13) The Committee may believe that, as in the Greenbook forecast, fostering 

sustainable economic growth and price stability will likely involve continued policy 

tightening but at a less rapid pace going forward than has been the case over the past 

six months.  For example, members may expect only gradual diminution of the 

business caution that has damped the economic expansion over the last few years 

despite unusually accommodative monetary policy.  If the Committee held such a 

view, it might want to couple a 25-basis-point move at this meeting with a statement 

like that in Alternative B, which is intended to signal the possibility of a pause in the 

adjustment of policy before long.  While an additional hike in rates at this meeting 

would be consistent with a number of standard policy rules (Chart 6), some of those 

rules also suggest a pause fairly soon if output and inflation evolve as projected in the 

Greenbook.  Indeed, another 25 basis points of tightening at this meeting would bring

the real federal funds rate to the lower edge of the 70 percent confidence band for the 

model-based estimates of the short-run equilibrium rate and only about ½ percentage 

point below the equilibrium measure consistent with the Greenbook.  Money market 

futures rates suggest that market participants already place some probability on a 

slowing in the rate of policy tightening, but if the Committee saw a pause before long 

as fairly likely it might want to convey that expectation at this meeting.   

(14) The possibility of a pause in the tightening process could be signaled by 

noting in the statement that “the Committee’s policy actions since mid-2004 have resulted in a 

significant reduction in the degree of monetary policy accommodation.” 5  The statement could go 

on to say that “Nonetheless, . . . the stance of policy remains somewhat accommodative” rather 

than characterizing the current stance of policy simply as “accommodative” as in the 

November statement.  The reference to the reduction in policy accommodation 

would suggest to investors that Committee members were considering the effects of 

the cumulative policy adjustment to date, and that, with policy now viewed as only 

“somewhat” accommodative, policymakers might be ready to slow the pace of 

firming.  However, a statement along these lines would leave open the option of 

tightening again at the February meeting if incoming information suggested that 

another move was appropriate.  For example, the Committee pointed to the 

cumulative easing of policy in its June 2001 statement, but it nonetheless eased policy 

further at its August meeting. 

                                           
5 Another option under Alternative B would be for the Committee to indicate that “The Federal 
Open Market Committee decided today to raise its target for the federal funds rate by 25 basis 
points to 2¼ percent, bringing the cumulative increase in the target rate over the past several 
months to 1¼ percentage point.”  (Analogous language was presented in the November Bluebook.)  
Such a quantification of the cumulative increase in the funds rate would be another means of 
suggesting that the FOMC was considering an adjustment to the policy trajectory going forward, and 
indeed the Committee adopted such an approach in its June 2001 statement.  A disadvantage of this 
wording is that on its face it would appear to be nothing more than a simple arithmetic statement.  
Also, if the Committee elected not to pause in February, it would be necessary either to update the 
arithmetic by changing the reference from 1¼ percentage points to 1½ percentage points or to 
rewrite the statement more substantially.  



 - 11 -

(15) The release of the announcement for Alternative B would likely lead to 

some easing of financial conditions.  Although investors have priced in a 25-basis-

point increase in the target federal funds rate at this meeting, they do not anticipate 

that the statement will signal the possibility of a pause.  As a result, the statement 

could well induce investors to mark down their expected path for the federal funds 

rate over coming quarters.  Short- and intermediate-term interest rates would decline 

some, and the foreign exchange value of the dollar would probably also fall.  Stock 

prices would likely rise a bit.    

(16) If the Committee were concerned that maintenance of current financial 

conditions could risk a return to subpar economic performance, it might want to 

consider a pause in the tightening cycle at this meeting, as in Alternative A.  Recent 

data and anecdotal reports suggest that businesses remain unusually cautious in 

expanding payrolls.  In addition, the expiration of the partial expensing provision at 

year-end could slow investment spending more than in the Greenbook.  Moreover, 

household saving rates remain very low by historical standards, and a larger-than-

expected rebound in saving propensities could damp household spending 

considerably.  Given these uncertainties, and with 100 basis points of tightening 

already in place, the Committee might consider it prudent to stand pat at this meeting 

to foster easier financial market conditions and weigh incoming data before 

considering the appropriate course for policy in February.  

(17) The announcement of Alternative A could look much like the one released 

following the November meeting.  However, in view of the concerns about renewed 

economic weakness that presumably would motivate policymakers to adopt this 

alternative, the Committee might wish to characterize the current stance of policy as 

only “somewhat accommodative” and indicate that “labor market conditions have been improving 

only gradually, apparently evidencing continued business caution.”  The statement could also 

note policymakers’ obligation to promote “sustainable growth” as well as price stability.  



 - 12 -

The announcement of this policy choice would surprise investors, and real and 

nominal interest rates would likely decline, especially at shorter maturities, putting 

downward pressure on the dollar.  Stock prices might rise, although the sense that 

aggregate demand might be weaker than investors had perceived could lead them to 

revise down their outlook for profits, tending to offset the positive effect of lower 

interest rates on equity prices. 

Money and Debt Forecasts 

(18)  Under the staff forecast, M2 decelerates from 5¼ percent growth this year 

to 2 percent in 2005, reflecting slower expansion in nominal income as well as the 

effects of past and projected policy tightening on the opportunity cost of holding M2 

assets.  With the pace of policy tightening assumed to slow through 2005 and 2006, 

and nominal income growth steady at 5½ percent, M2 advances at a 3½ percent pace 

in 2006.  Domestic nonfinancial sector debt is expected to decelerate over the forecast 

period, primarily reflecting some slowing in household debt growth as diminishing 

gains in home prices damp the increase in residential mortgage debt.  By contrast, 

business debt growth is projected to rise to a moderate pace next year as capital 

spending expands and to remain near that rate in 2006.  Federal debt growth slows 

next year but rebounds in 2006, reflecting in part the introduction of Medicare 

prescription drug coverage.

Directive and Balance-of-Risks Statement 

(19) Draft language for the directive and draft risk assessments identical to those 

presented in Table 1 are provided below. 

(1) Directive Wording 
The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and financial 

conditions that will foster price stability and promote sustainable growth 

in output.  To further its long-run objectives, the Committee in the 

immediate future seeks conditions in reserve markets consistent with 

MAINTAINING/increasing/REDUCING the federal funds rate 

AT/to an average of around _______ 2 percent. 

(2) Risk Assessments  

A. The Committee perceives the upside and downside risks to the 

attainment of both sustainable growth and price stability for the next few 

quarters to be roughly equal.  With underlying inflation expected to be 

relatively low, the Committee believes that policy accommodation can be 

removed at a pace this is likely to be measured.  Nonetheless, the 

Committee will respond to changes in economic prospects as needed to 

fulfill its obligation to promote price stability and sustainable growth. 

B. The Committee perceives the upside and downside risks to the 

attainment of both sustainable growth and price stability for the next few 

quarters to be roughly equal.  With underlying inflation expected to be 

relatively low, the Committee believes that policy accommodation can be 

removed at a pace that is likely to be measured.  Nonetheless, the 

Committee will respond to changes in economic prospects as needed to 

fulfill its obligation to maintain price stability.

Inflation Indicator Based on M2 and Two
Estimates of V*

Note. P* is defined to equal M2 times V* divided by potential GDP. Long-run velocity (V*) is estimated from
1959:Q1 to 1989:Q4. V* after 1992 is estimated from 1993:Q1 to present. For the forecast period, P* is based
on staff M2 forecast and P is simulated using a short-run dynamic model relating P to P*. Vertical lines
mark crossing of P and P*. Shaded areas denote projection period.

Appendix B: Review of Debt and Money Growth in 2004 

 
 Total debt of domestic nonfinancial sectors expanded about 8 percent in 2004, 

somewhat faster than nominal income.  Growth was strongest in the household and 
federal sectors, both of which posted almost 10 percent gains.  The rapid pace of 
household borrowing in 2004 reflected a sharp rise in mortgages that was supported 
by substantial increases in home prices and continued low levels of long-term interest 
rates.  The sizable increase in Treasury debt was needed to finance the federal deficit, 
while state and local governments again issued a considerable volume of securities.   

 
Nonfinancial business borrowing, while not quite as weak as in 2003, continued 

to be restrained this year, as corporations again relied heavily on elevated profits and 
substantial cash holdings to finance increased fixed and inventory investment.  Over 
the year as a whole, nonfinancial corporations are estimated to have raised only 
enough funds in credit markets to offset the cash drain from equity retirements.  M2 
expanded roughly in line with nominal GDP in the first half of the year, but growth 
slowed over the second half, owing in part to a decline in mortgage refinancing 
activity and increased opportunity costs of holding M2.   
 
Domestic Nonfinancial Sector Debt 
 

Credit supply conditions in the business sector seemed quite accommodative 
amid signs of improving credit quality of nonfinancial firms.  With strong corporate 
earnings, the delinquency rate on C&I loans declined further, and the six-month 
trailing default rate on outstanding bonds fell to historically low levels.  Also, the pace 
of net upgrades of bond ratings by Moody’s for both investment- and speculative-
grade debt showed some improvement compared to 2003 on balance.  Expected year-
ahead default rates calculated by KMV remained steady this year after falling from 
their 2002 peak last year.  Against this backdrop, spreads of investment-grade 
corporate yields over comparable Treasury yields remained at low levels, while spreads 
on speculative-grade debt declined further on net.  

 
According to results from the Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey over the 

course of the year, commercial banks eased terms and standards on business loans, 
reflecting an improved economic outlook as well as increased competition among 
banks and nonbank lenders.  Survey responses also indicated that increased demand 
for C&I loans was driven by the need to fund rising accounts receivable, inventories, 
capital expenditures, and merger activity.  In the syndicated loan market, spreads on 
leveraged deals edged down and remained low, apparently reflecting moderating 
concerns over loan quality. 



 - 16 -

 
The timing of gross bond issuance during 2004 was influenced by interest rate 

movements during the year, as firms took advantage of dips in longer-term yields to 
issue bonds.  Firms used a large portion of the proceeds to pay down existing debt, 
and some of the funds raised were also reportedly used to repurchase shares or 
finance mergers.  Net corporate bond issuance was sluggish for the year, as firms 
evidently relied heavily on profits and liquid assets to fund investment in fixed capital 
and inventories. 

 
Short-term business borrowing revived in 2004 after three years of sharp 

contraction.  Commercial paper outstanding expanded in the first half and continued 
to grow later in the year, reflecting increased merger activity.  Business loans at banks 
also rebounded in 2004.  Loans outstanding fell early in the year, albeit at a noticeably 
slower pace than in 2003, edged up in the second quarter for the first time in more 
than three years, increased solidly in the third quarter, and appear likely to post 
another gain in the current quarter.   

 
Even though vacancy rates for nonresidential commercial properties remained 

high and rents continued to fall, commercial mortgages grew at a rapid pace in 2004.  
Some firms reportedly continued to find mortgages an attractive source of long-term 
funding.  Considerable gains in commercial real estate prices increased owners’ equity 
and largely kept pace with the sizable increase in mortgage debt obligations.  
Delinquency rates on commercial mortgages held by banks and insurance companies 
remained very low throughout the year.  Delinquencies on commercial-mortgage-
backed securities (CMBS) fell during 2004, and yield spreads of CMBS over 
comparable Treasury securities remained low, suggesting that investors have limited 
concerns about loan quality.  Reflecting in part the favorable pricing, issuance of 
CMBS reached near-record levels.   
 

Household debt rose at a robust pace this year.  Mortgage debt grew quite 
rapidly again, as activity remained strong in housing markets and home prices 
continued to rise briskly.  The share of new mortgages with adjustable interest rates, 
including hybrids, rose on balance.  Consumer credit growth remained moderate and 
was probably restrained by paydowns using proceeds from cash-out mortgage 
refinancing this year, even though the pace of such transactions has fallen off from 
the near-record pace set early in 2003.  Interest rates on consumer loans began to rise 
in the middle of the year, a development that may have damped consumer debt 
growth over the past few months. 
 

Nonetheless, historically low interest rates and strong growth in disposable 
personal income have apparently helped to keep financial obligations manageable for 



 - 17 -

most households, as credit quality measures remained solid.  The aggregate household 
financial obligations ratio was steady, on balance, over the first three quarters of 2004.  
Meanwhile, delinquency rates on various types of household loans at commercial 
banks declined over the same period, while those on auto loans at captive finance 
companies changed little.  Household bankruptcy filings have been running about 5 
percent below the elevated levels in 2003, although they remain above the rates 
posted in previous years. 
 

Strong increases in home prices continued to boost household net worth, while 
stock prices rose on balance for the year.  Gains in assets about matched the increase 
in household debt, and the ratio of household net worth to disposable income rose a 
bit further above its long-run average.  After surging in the first quarter, inflows to 
equity mutual funds moderated before ticking up in November.  The assets of retail 
and institutional money market mutual funds continued to decline in the second half 
of the year, as their yields lagged increases in market interest rates.  On balance, 
inflows into mutual funds were roughly consistent with staff models that link flows to 
asset returns.   

 
With budget positions improving, net debt issuance by state and local 

governments edged down from the rapid pace set in 2003.  Following widespread 
financial distress and downgrades over the previous two years, the credit quality of 
municipal borrowers stabilized in early 2004 and began to improve later in the year, as 
upgrades of municipal bonds outpaced downgrades beginning in February.   
 

After borrowing heavily in 2003, owing to higher spending and large tax cuts, 
the pace of Treasury borrowing moderated this year.  As was the case in debt-ceiling 
episodes in the previous two years, the Treasury was forced to resort to accounting 
devices and suspended issuance of state and local government series (SLGS) securities 
when the statutory debt ceiling became a constraint in the fall.  Apart from a 
postponed four-week bill auction, there was little disruption in financial markets, and 
Congress raised the ceiling from $7.4 trillion to $8.1 trillion shortly after the 
November 2 elections.   
 

The average maturity of outstanding Treasury debt continued to increase, as 
the Treasury tilted its issuance toward longer-term securities.  The Treasury also 
boosted issuance of inflation-indexed securities by introducing a new twenty-year 
inflation-protected bond in July and a five-year inflation-protected note in October.  
Indirect bidding at Treasury auctions, which includes bidding by the Federal Reserve 
Bank of New York on behalf of foreign official institutions, remained robust over the 
year.  Indeed, Treasury securities held in custody at the Federal Reserve Bank of New 
York on behalf of foreign official institutions increased about $200 billion through

November.  Also, Treasury International Capital data through the end of the third 
quarter showed a steady increase in holdings of Treasury securities by foreign official 
and private investors, particularly those in Japan.  
 
Bank Credit 
 
 Commercial bank credit is estimated to have grown about 9 percent in 2004, a 
brisker pace than last year.  Bank credit growth outpaced that of total domestic 
nonfinancial debt.  Growth in mortgage and home equity loans on banks’ books 
remained brisk.  Following several years of runoffs, business loans began to expand in 
the second half of the year.  Underlying growth of consumer loans was sluggish, but 
was boosted by a reclassification of securities in the third quarter.  Correspondingly, 
the expansion of banks’ securities portfolios slowed during the second half of the 
year.   
 
Monetary Aggregates 
 

M2 advanced at a pace roughly in line with nominal GDP during the first half 
of the year.  A resurgence of mortgage refinancing following the first-quarter decline 
in mortgage rates likely boosted liquid deposit growth, as proceeds from refinancing 
were temporarily placed in deposit accounts pending disbursement to the holders of 
mortgage-backed securities.   

M2 growth slowed in the second half of the year in response to a decline in 
mortgage refinancing activity and the increased opportunity cost of holding M2 assets 
that resulted from higher short-term market interest rates.  On balance, M2 growth 
from the fourth quarter of 2003 to the fourth quarter of this year is estimated at about 
5¼ percent.  The velocity of M2 edged up, on net, over the year, roughly in line with 
the historical relationships among money, income, and opportunity cost.
