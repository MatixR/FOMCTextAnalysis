MONEY MARKET AND RESERVE RELATIONSHIPS

Recent developments

(1) The relatively firm conditions prevailing in money and

short-term credit markets around the time of the last Committee meeting

were generally maintained in the ensuing four week period dominated by

"even keel." With money markets firm, international financial markets

in flux, and with a large volume of new demands on the credit markets

from Federal and private sectors, most long- and short-term interest

rates rose further over the period.

(2) The 3-month Treasury bill rate, however, did not show any

sustained upward movement since the last Committee meeting. In fact, as

of the close of business Friday, the 3-month bill was yielding around 5.42

per cent, down a few basis points from its level four weeks earlier.

Over that interval, the bill fluctuated in a fairly narrow range,

generally in the upper half of the 5.25-5.60 per cent range specified

in the previous Blue Book. Longer-term bill rates, however, rose about

10 basis points over the interval, as did certain other short-term market

rates, such as yields on certificates of deposits and bankers' acceptances.

Offering rates by banks for CD's in the 3-month area generally moved up

to the 6 per cent Regulation Q ceiling rate, and some banks are reported

to be offering the 6-1/4 per cent ceiling for six-month money. The one

leading bank whose prime loan rate was relatively low moved that rate up

to 6-1/4 per cent.

(3) The disparate movement of the 3-month bill rate relative

to other short-term rates reflected in part the development of a shortage

in the trading supply of such bills in the face of heavy demand from

foreign and other sources. Net purchases of bills in the market by

foreign accounts (through the agency of the System) have totalled

around $850 million since the beginning of November, mostly in the short-

term area. The increased spread of longer-term over short-term bill rates

also appeared to reflect general market uncertainties, including a view

that evolving credit conditions were on the tight side as compared with

earlier anticipations. However, the Treasury's recently announced offering

of only $2 billion in June tax bills--at the lower end of the range ex-

pected in the market--helped to moderate pressures affecting longer-term

bills.

(4) During the first three weeks since the last meeting of the

Committee the Federal funds rate mostly tended to be around 6 per cent or

above, as compared with a neighborhood of 5-7/8 - 6 per cent in October. In

recent days, however, the funds market has eased sharply, reflecting in the

main reserve gluts around the end of the statement week just past, when

float turned out to be unexpectedly high, when banks accummulated reserves

in excess of need early in the week, and when foreign funds became temporarily

more available in the Federal funds market. Rates on new loans to dealers

were firm at 6-3/8 per cent or above for the bulk of the period since the

previous FOMC mmeting.

(5) In the four statement weeks ending November 20, member bank

excess reserves have averaged $286 million, somewhat higher than in the

previous four weeks, while member bank borrowings have averaged $519

million, also somewhat higher than earlier. Net borrowed reserves during

the past four statement weeks have been in a $150-350 million range.

(6) Current estimates of the bank credit proxy for November show a

10-1/2 per cent annual rate of increase on average. Euro-dollar borrowints

may add about 1/2 percentage point to the proxy on average. With one week

still to go in the month, the bank credit estimate is, of course,



-3-

subject to change in either direction by a percentage point or two.

In the course of November, week-by-week estimates of the credit proxy

varied throughout the 9-12 per cent average annual rate range projected

for the last Committee meeting, as there were wide fluctuations in

reported weekly deposit figures. It should be noted, however, that

after mid-month the range originally projected had to be adjusted to

8-11 per cent because the earlier assumption as to timing of the Treasury

tax bill financing was not borne out; in the previous Blue Book the

financing had been assumed for payment on November 27, whereas it has

now been announced for payment on December 2 (in the amount of $2 billion).

(7) Growth in bank credit in November was accompanied by only

about a 1 per cent annual rate of expansion in nonborrowed reserves on

current estimates. With the cost of reserve funds in the Federal funds

and Euro-dollar markets generally higher than in the previous month,

banks--to sustain credit expansion--increased their borrowings from the

Federal Reserve more than seasonally, and they also appear to have

economized further on excess reserves after adjusting for past seasonal

patterns. (The increase in excess reserves noted in paragraph (5) would

represent a less than seasonal rise.)

(8) The reception of the Treasury's November refunding

operation turned out to generate somewhat more total attrition than

assumed by the staff; about 25 per cent of the November maturities and

50 per cent of the December maturities were not exchanged. But the

interest in the re-opened 5-3/4 per cent 6-year note was greater than

many in the market had anticipated, with public subscriptions reaching

$1.3 billion. Dealers took around $250 million, net, of this issue into

position, and sold out about one-third by payment date. Their total



position in securities maturing in more than 5 years was around $630

million on Thursday, November 21, or about $100 million higher than such

positions on October 29, just before books were closed on the mid-November

refunding. Dealers appear to have rather mixed attitudes toward these

positions; on balance they are not pressing them actively onto the market

at this time.

(9) Time deposit growth in November is estimated at a 12 per

cent annual rate, in line with earlier projections. However, growth in

the money supply, estimated at a 10 per cent annual rate, is slightly in

excess of earlier projections, mainly because of an unanticipated bulge in

currency in circulation.

Prospective Developments.

(11) Prevailing money market conditions might be taken to

encompass a Federal funds rate fluctuating in the neighborhood of

5-7/8--6 per cent, member bank borrowings averaging in a $400-$600

million range, and net borrowed reserves fluctuating widely, probably

in a $100-$400 million area. These specifications assume banks may be

somewhat more willing to borrow at a given Federal funds rate than

they were in most of November, as they move into the December period

of traditional seasonal pressures. Maintenance of the above money

market conditions between now and the next meeting of the Committee on

December 17 may be associated with some moderate further upward

pressures on short-term interest rates, and with a slower growth in

bank credit (as measured by the proxy on a daily average basis for

the month.)

(12) Under these money market conditions, it would appear

that the 3-month Treasury bill rate may be expected to be in a 5.30-

5.60 per cent range between now and mid-December. However, the bill

rate could be pushed to or even somewhat beyond either end of this

range depending on the way in which international exchange market

uncertainties are resolved (unknown by Friday 6:30 p.m.). Effects

will stem both from shifts in market attitudes and also from the

extent and timing of foreign purchases or sales of Treasury bills,

as well as use of swap facilities.



-6-

(13) Apart fron international influences, there will be seasonal

upward pressures on the bill rate that might be accentuated by enlarged

corporate tax payments around mid-December. It is also possible that

the Treasury may have to maintain a relatively low cash balance at the

Federal Reserve until mid-December tax payments begin coming in, with

the result that commensurately less Federal Reserve open market purchases

would be made. On the other hand, these interest rate pressures may be

offset to some extent because the market is likely soon to begin focusing

on the probability that the Treasury will be able to repay some debt in

the first half of next year.

(14) In projecting a slowing of bank credit growth in December--

to a 5-8 per cent, annual rate, ranges/--the staff has assumed that CD

attrition will be around $800 million, or no more than seasonal proportions.

This projection assumes that the 3-month bill rate begins to decline in

1/ As noted earlier, the staff estimates for November are based
on partial data. If final numbers for November turn out to be
significantly lower (or higher), then the present projection for
December's annual rate of growth would have to be commensurately

higher (or lower) for the average December level herein projected
to be achieved. Euro-dollar borrowings would add 1/2 percentage
point to the projection, assuming little change in such borrowings
from their current level.



the latter part of December from a seasonal peak. It presumes that

maintenance of a Federal funds rate consistently in a 5-7/8--6 per

cent area will encourage the market in the view that any upward move-

ment of bill rates that may develop is likely to be temporary and that,

therefore, banks will be able to count on a relatively normal recovery

from mid-December CD attrition. If the 3-month bill rate were to

reach or exceed the upper end of the range cited, it might become

extremely difficult for banks, except for a few prime banks, to avoid

more than seasonal attrition of outstanding CD's. There is somewhat

more scope under the Regulation Q ceilings for banks to issue longer-

term CD's, but the availability of such funds will probably be limited,

particularly for seasonal reasons, next month.

(15) As of the end of October, CD's maturing in December

totalled $5.4 billion, of which about $1 billion matured on the tax

date. It is difficult to tell how much banks will have added to these

liabilities by the end of November, although a comparison of market

rates with Q ceiling rates would suggest that they would have sold

relatively little more of December maturities. Assuming no substantial

build-up in December CD maturities over the last few weeks, the attri-

tion rate of around 15 per cent which we have assumed is not likely

to require banks to undertake significant liquidity adjustments that

would immediately alter lending attitudes, although banks are likely

to add to portfolio investments at a reduced pace.

(16) Growth in time and savings deposits other than negotiable

CD's is likely to slow down further in December, given the higher level



-8-

of market interest rates that has emerged and an anticipated moderation

in the growth of personal income. Taking into account both CD's and

other time and savings deposits, the total of banks' time deposits may

be expected to rise in an 8-11 per cent, annual rate, range in December.

Money supply growth next month may be in a 6-9 per cent, annual rate,

range, reflecting for the most part a relatively sharp drop in U.S.

Government deposits during the month, given the small size of the new

tax bill financing and the substantial cash redemptions of the mid-

December Treasury bond maturities that were not exchanged in November.

(17) Over the near-term, some further upward pressure on

long-term interest rates remains possible. It would appear that banks

would have to be considerably less active purchasers of securities,

particularly of State and local Government obligations. And, while

dealers have made progress in distributing the most recent longer-term

Treasury note, their total positions in the over 5 year area (including

the fairly sizable unsold balances from the August refunding) remain

fairly large. In addition, a relatively large calendar of corporate bond

issues may be developing for January, although this may have been dis-

counted by the recent sharp rise of long-term interest rates.

(18) Policy alternative. If the Committee wishes to intensify

the degree of monetary restraint at this time, it may wish to consider a

constellation of money market conditions including a Federal funds rate

fluctuating around 6-1/8 per cent, member bank borrowings in a $550-

$700 million range, and net borrowed reserves of $300-$500 million. In

view of the relatively firm money and short-term credit market conditions

of recent weeks, and given anticipations of seasonal tightness by market

participants, these money market variables would probably have to be rather



consistently toward the tight ends of the indicated ranges for the

market to become aware of a shift in policy over the next three weeks.

(19) As the market absorbs the impact of a consistently

tighter funds market and higher level of borrowings, there may be

greater upward effects on longer-term bill rates and on bond yields

than on the 3-month bill. The relatively small dealer holdings of

short bills may tend to limit the rise in the 3-month bill rate. Longer-

term bill rates are likely to be affected by banks' efforts to nail down

whatever CD funds prove available in the maturity area beyond three

months. Even so, banks could become uncertain about their ability to

recoup December CD attrition, and would likely cut back participation

in the municipal and U.S. Government securities markets fairly sharply.

They are also likely to increase demands on the Euro-dollar market.

Assuming existing ceiling rates, CD attrition in December might be in

the order of $1--$1-1/4 billion--depending in part on the speed of

adjustment of bill and other short-term market rates to the change in

policy stance--and bank credit growth might slow to a 3-6 per cent

annual rate.

MONEY MARKET AND RESERVE RELATIONSHIPS

Recent developments

(1) The relatively firm conditions prevailing in money and

short-term credit markets around the time of the last Committee meeting

were generally maintained in the ensuing four week period dominated by

"even keel". With money markets firm, international financial markets

in flux, and with a large volume of new demands on the credit markets

from Federal and private sectors, most long- and short-term interest

rates rose further over the period.

(2) The 3-month Treasury bill rate, however, did not show any

sustained upward movement since the last Committee meeting. In fact, as

of the close of business Friday, the 3-month bill was yielding around 5.42

per cent, down a few basis points from its level four weeks earlier.

Over that interval, the bill fluctuated in a fairly narrow range,

generally in the upper half of the 5.25-5.60 per cent range specified

in the previous Blue Book. Longer-term bill rates, however, rose about

10 basis points over the interval, as did certain other short-term market

rates, such as yields on certificates of deposits and bankers' acceptances.

Offering rates by banks for CD's in the 3-month area generally moved up

to the 6 per cent Regulation Q ceiling rate, and some banks are reported

to be offering the 6-1/4 per cent ceiling for six-month money. The one

leading bank whose prime loan rate was relatively low moved that rate up

to 6-1/4 per cent.
