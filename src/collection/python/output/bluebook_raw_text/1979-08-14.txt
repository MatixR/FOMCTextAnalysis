Prefatory Note 

 
 

The attached document represents the most complete and accurate version 
available based on original copies culled from the files of the FOMC Secretariat at the 
Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System.  This electronic document was 
created through a comprehensive digitization process which included identifying the best-
preserved paper copies, scanning those copies,1 and then making the scanned versions 
text-searchable.2  Though a stringent quality assurance process was employed, some 
imperfections may remain. 
 

Please note that this document may contain occasional gaps in the text.  These 
gaps are the result of a redaction process that removed information obtained on a 
confidential basis.  All redacted passages are exempt from disclosure under applicable 
provisions of the Freedom of Information Act.    

 

                                                 
1 In some cases, original copies needed to be photocopied before being scanned into electronic format.  All 
scanned images were deskewed (to remove the effects of printer- and scanner-introduced tilting) and lightly 
cleaned (to remove dark spots caused by staple holes, hole punches, and other blemishes caused after initial 
printing). 
2 A two-step process was used.  An advanced optimal character recognition computer program (OCR) first 
created electronic text from the document image.  Where the OCR results were inconclusive, staff checked 
and corrected the text as necessary.   Please note that the numbers and text in charts and tables were not 
reliably recognized by the OCR process and were not checked or corrected by staff.

Recent developments

(1) M-1 expanded at about a 10 percent annual rate in July and, though

growth is apparently slowing markedly in August, for the two months it is

still expected to be above the upper end of the 2½ to 6½ percent range

specified by the FOMC. M-2 growth over July and August is projected at an

annual rate of about 11 percent, also above the upper end of its FOMC range.

Savings deposits increased somewhat more rapidly in July than in June, after

having declined almost without interruption over the preceding eight months.

The time deposit component of M-2 continued to grow at about its strong

second-quarter pace in July, as large time deposits included in M-2

increased for the first time since late last year. Growth in small time

deposits remained strong by historical standards, but slowed from other

recent months. At thrifts, however, deposit expansion decelerated

from June's relatively strong pace.

1/ On July 27 the FOMC voted to raise the upper limit of the intermeeting
range for the Federal funds rate from 10½ percent to 10 percent.



(2) With growth in loans slowing somewhat, commercial bank

credit increased at a 12½ percent annual rate in July, below the average

pace for the first half of the year. Given the strong growth in demand

and consumer-type time and savings deposits last month, banks reduced

reliance on managed liabilities to finance credit expansion. In particular,

over the course of the month banks tapped their foreign affiliates for only

a minimal additional amount of funds, reflecting a relative firming of

interest rates in the Durodollar market associated with weakness in the dollar.

(3) The Account Management continued to aim for a Federal funds

rate in the 10 percent area during the days immediately following the July

FOMC meeting. On July 20, however, as projections suggested that over the

July-August period M-1 and M-2 would grow at rates moderately above and about

equal to the upper limits of their respective short-run ranges, the Manager

began to aim for a weekly average Federal funds rate at about the 10

percent upper limit specified by the Committee. On the same morning the

Board announced an increase in the discount rate from 9½ percent to 10

percent. On July 27, as projections suggested that growth in both M-1 and

M-2 over July and August would exceed the upper limits of their respective

ranges, the Committee raised the upper limit of the intermeeting range

for the Federal funds rate to 10¾ percent and instructed the Manager to

aim for a rate within a range of 10 to 10¾ percent, depending on sub-

sequent behavior of the aggregates and conditions in foreign exchange markets.

Initially, the Desk aimed for a rate around 10-5/8 percent. Most recently,

however, with the aggregates continuing strong and with renewed pressure

on the dollar in foreign exchange markets following publication of the

July producer price index, the Desk has sought a funds rate a shade higher

than 10-5/8 percent.



(4) Total reserves, after declining at a 4 percent annual rate in

the first half of the year, are projected to expand at about an 8¼ percent

annual rate in the July-August period as strengthening deposit flows have

been accompanied by increases in required reserves. Growth in the monetary

base is projected to rise at about a 10¼ percent annual rate over July and

August as currency in circulation continues to expand at a brisk pace.

(5) Short-term interest rates have generally increased about 20

to 50 basis points since the July FOMC meeting, with the largest increases

on private instruments. Bond yields have changed little on balance over

the intermeeting period, however, as a light corporate and municipal

financing calendar and widespread views that the economy is moving into

recession have tended to damp reactions to the System's policy actions.

Against this general background, the Treasury offerings of $2.75 billion

of 3-year notes, $2.5 billion of reopened 7 -year notes, and $2 billion

of reopened 29 -year issues--to refund $4.8 billion of maturing issues

and raise $2.4 billion of new money--were well bid for in their respective

auctions. The two shorter issues are currently trading at or close to their

average prices in the auction, after having been at premiums in the days

immediately after the offering, while the longer issue is now at a signifi-

cant discount. Average primary market rates on conventional home loans

have edged down a few basis points, perhaps reflecting some slackening in

housing credit demand and the attraction of diversified investors to this

market by the wide spread between mortgage and bond yields.

(6) The dollar was under heavy selling pressure the first two

weeks following the July FOMC meeting, reflecting market participants'

apprehension over the course of U.S. economic policy, particularly in the

wake of the Cabinet reshuffle. These pressures abated with the naming

of the new Federal Reserve Chairman, but pressures have resumed in recentdays

as noted in paragraph (3). Since the last FOMC meeting the United States

has purchased $2 billion in support of the dollar,

rates of change, in percent, for related monetary and financial flows

Prospective developments

(8) The table below presents for the Committee's consideration

three alternative specifications for the monetary aggregates and the Federal

funds rate for the August-September period. The Federal funds rate

specifications of alternative B are centered on the currently prevailing

10½ to 10¾ percent range. Alternatives A and C would ease or tighten,

respectively, money market conditions in coming weeks. (More detailed

and longer-term data are contained in the tables on pages 7 and 8.)

Alt. A Alt. B Alt. C

Ranges for August-September

M-1 5½ to 9½ 5 to 9 4½ to 8½

M-2 8½ to 12½ 8 to 12 7½ to 11½

Federal funds rate 9¾ to 10½ 10¼ to 11 10 to 11½
(intermeeting period)

(9) Under alternative B, M-1 would be expected to expand in a

5 to 9 percent annual rate range over the August-September period. This

would represent a noticeable deceleration from the 11 percent average pace

of the preceding four months, but would still leave M-1 growth for the

current quarter at a 9 percent annual rate. With nominal GNP projected

to rise at a 7 percent rate, velocity would decline by about a 2 percent

annual rate, following a 1 percent decline in the second quarter.1/ Because of

the lags that ordinarily characterize the public's adjustment of its cash

balances to changes in economic circumstances, some weakening in velocity would

have been expected in light of the sharp deceleration of nominal GNP growth

1/ These figures somewhat understate the weakness in velocity since the

shifting of demand deposits to ATS/NOW accounts is estimated to have

depressed M-1 growth--and raised velocity--by about 1¼ percentage points

in the second quarter, and is expected to have about ¾ percentage point

impact in the current quarter. Quarterly velocity figures are shown in

Appendix I.

in the spring. However, the continued strength of M-1 suggests the

possibility of a precautionary accumulation of liquid balances in

response to unusual economic uncertainties. Such a pattern would not

be expected to persist for an extended period, and the staff anticipates

a return to somewhat weaker demands for M-1 over the remainder of the

year--although not to the marked weakness observed in the past fall and

winter.

(10) Under alternative B, M-2 growth is projected to expand at

about a 10 percent annual rate during the August-September period, a some-

what slower growth rate than in June and July. In addition to the

slowing in growth of the M-1 component, it is unlikely that savings

deposits will continue to expand at their recent rate, given the high level

of market interest rates. Nonetheless, growth in small time deposits should

remain brisk, with banks continuing to attract a substantial amount of MMC

deposits in the absence of an inter-institutional ceiling rate differential.

(11) As shown in the upper panel of the chart on page 10,

under alternative B M-1 in September would be above the level implied by the

upper end of the Committee's 1½ to 4½ percent growth range for the QIV '78

to QIV '79 period. This would also be true under alternatives A and C.

However, as is indicated in the lower panel of the chart, if the longer-run

range is adjusted to reflect the downward revision in the staff's estimate

of the ATS/NOW effect from the original 3 percent to the current 1 percent,

the projected September level (under alternative B) is within, though in the

upper half, of the adjusted 3 to 6 percent range. For M-2, growth indicated

by the alternative B range would place the aggregate in September well

into the upper half of the 5 to 8 percent range established by the Committee

for the period QIV '78 to QIV '79.

(12) The table on page 13 indicates the annual rates of growth

of M-1 and M-2 required to reach the high ends, low ends, and midpoints of

their respective longer-run ranges within certain periods. It may be noted

that, assuming ATS retards M-1 growth by 1½ percentage points over the

year, M-1 would need to rise at a 4.1 percent annual rate between July

and the fourth quarter to hit the midpoint of its longer-run range. Growth

in M-2 would have to be at a 5.3 percent annual rate over the same period

to achieve the midpoint of its longer-run range.

(13) With Federal funds continuing to trade around 10½ to 10¾

percent, the midpoint of alternative B, other interest rates would likely

change little in the near term. Credit markets are not likely to be

subject to demand pressures over the next few weeks. The Treasury's

net borrowing activities during the intermeeting period may be limited to

an early September cash management bill to carry it through the mid-month

tax date, although the sale of a 5-year note is a possible alternative.

Market participants likely will be focusing more on the greater cash needs

confronting the Treasury in the fourth quarter. The forward calendars

in the corporate and municipal bond markets are moderate. Loan demands

at commercial banks may edge off, as inventory investment declines and

household spending continues weak. Use of bank credit lines, and there-

fore bank demands on the money markets, could be increased, however, by

any adverse developments in the commercial paper market associated with the

Chrysler situation. At thrift institutions, growth of deposits subject to

rate ceilings likely will remain sluggish, leading to continued borrowing

from Home Loan Banks and market sources.

(14) Alternative A involves a decline in the Federal funds rate

to the midpoint of a 9-3/4 to 10-1/2 percent range. Growth in M-1 and M-2

over the August-September period would likely be in annual rate ranges of

5-1/2 to 9-1/2 and 8-1/2 to 12-1/2 percent, respectively. Other short-

term market rates could decline rather considerably, since the market at

present does not expect an easing in the System's posture. Given the

recent data on inflation and unemployment, and the prevailing state of

expectations regarding monetary policy, such a movement in domestic rates

would likely lead to an appreciable weakening of the dollar on foreign

exchange markets. Purchases of Treasuries by foreign official institutions

associated with any substantial intervention activity might result in

relatively larger declines in Treasury bill rates than in private rates.

In long-term debt markets, bond yields would probably also decline, though

such tendencies would be limited if an easing in the funds rate were to

strengthen inflationary expectations. Thrift deposit flows would benefit

from the decline in market rates, especially if bill yields fell enough

to reopen a ceiling rate differential, and mortgage rates might edge

downward.

(15) Alternative C calls for an increase in the Federal funds

rate to the midpoint of a 10-3/4 to 11-1/2 percent range. Over the August-

September period, M-1 probably would grow in a 4-1/2 to 8-1/2 percent

annual rate range and M-2 between 7-1/2 and 11-1/2 percent. A further

tightening action at this juncture would reinforce the view that the

Federal Reserve is giving relatively heavy weight to domestic inflation

and the performance of the dollar abroad in formulating its policies.



The dollar likely would strengthen on foreign exchange markets, and while a

rise in short-term rates could be anticipated, bond yields might increase

rather little, if at all. Given the already wide spread between bond

yields and mortgage rates--and the minor impact of the assumed short-term

rate increase on thrift institution deposit flows--mortgage rates probably

might increase only moderately.

(16) As noted in paragraph (9), the staff currently expects

that the public's demand for M-1 will be significantly weaker over the

remainder of the year than it has been in recent months. Given the out-

look for nominal GNP, and assuming that the Committee adopts short-run

alternative B, the projected behavior of money demand would permit a

decline in the Federal funds rate to around 9-1/2 percent by year-end with

M-1 growth for the QIV '78 to QIV '79 period ending up close to the mid-

point of the longer-run range (of 3 to 6 percent, assuming 1-1/2 percent

ATS adjustment). However, should the public's demand for M-1 not exhibit

the anticipated weakening, M-1 growth might be well into the upper half

of the longer-run range even if the funds rate were held at its current

level.

Directive language

(17) Given below are suggested operational paragraphs for

the directive in the customary form, with alternative language related

to the short-run specifications presented in the preceding section.

Alternative language is also provided for placing main emphasis either on

monetary aggregates or on money market conditions. The specifications

adopted last month are shown in strike-through form.

In the short run, the Committee seeks to achieve bank

reserve and money market conditions that are broadly consistent

with the longer-run ranges for monetary aggregates cited above,

while giving due regard to [DEL: the program for supporting the foreign

exchange value of the dollar and to] developing conditions in

FOREIGN EXCHANGE AND domestic financial markets. Early in the

period before the next regular meeting, System open market

operations are to be directed at maintaining the (or ATTAINING A)

weekly average federal funds rate

(A) SLIGHTLY BELOW THE CURRENT LEVEL.
(B) at about the current level.
(C) SLIGHTLY ABOVE THE CURRENT LEVEL.

Subsequently, operations shall be directed at maintaining the

weekly average federal funds rate within the range of 9¾-to-10¾ 1/

____ TO ____ percent. In deciding on the specific objective

for the federal funds rate the Manager shall be guided mainly by

the relationship between the latest estimates of annual rates of

growth in the July-August AUGUST-SEPTEMBER period of M-1 and M-2

and the following ranges of tolerance: 2½-to-6½ ____ TO ____

percent for M-1 and 6½ to 10½ ____ TO ____ percent for M-2. If
