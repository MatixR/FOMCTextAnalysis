MONETARY AGGREGATES AND
MONEY MARKET CONDITIONS

Recent developments

(1) The adjusted money supply in October rose only slightly,

thus falling considerably short of the 4-1/2 per cent rate of increase

expected at the time of the last meeting of the Committee. While spread

throughout the banking system, the greater portion of the weakness in the

money supply appears to have been at reserve city banks and to be associated

with the weakness in demands for short-term credit, perhaps in large part

related to the auto strike. As shown in the table in paragraph (3), since

mid-October the weekly data have, without exception, run below the path

indicated in the last Blue Book; and in the week of November 4 the short-

fall amounted to some $1-1/2 billion.

(2) Growth in the adjusted bank credit proxy in October fell

even further below expectations than the money supply. Currently the proxy

is estimated to have increased at only about a 1/2 of 1 per cent rate over

the month, compared with a 7 per cent rate expected at the time of the

Committee meeting. In addition to the weakness in private demand deposits,

the increase in the proxy was held down by a slightly more rapid pace of

runoff of non-deposit sources of funds than allowed for, a slower growth

in time deposits than earlier anticipated, and a greater decline in U.S.

Government deposits. The October rate of increase in time deposits is

estimated at 22 per cent, compared with a projection of 26-1/2 per cent,

reflected some slowing in net inflows of both CD's and other time and

savings deposits. Like the weakness in the money supply, this slowing

was concentrated at reserve city banks,

(4) In view of the shortfall in monetary growth rates in

October, as well as in the fourth quarter, the Desk has encouraged more

comfortable money market conditions than those generally prevailing around

the time of the October 20 meeting. With the "even keel" constraint

lessened after the auction date of the new note, Federal funds began to

trade more frequently below 6 per cent and in the last day or two have

been trading around the new 5-3/4 per cent discount rate. Net borrowed

reserves over the statement weeks since the last meeting have fluctuated

in a $120 to $290 million range while average member bank borrowings have

remained quite stable around $430 million.

(5) Short-term interest rates have declined markedly since the

Committee meeting, particularly in the Treasury bill market where the

rate on 3-month issues has dropped about 50 basis points to around 5.45

per cent. The fall in bill rates was influenced by anticipation of a

near-term cut in the discount rate and the commercial bank prime rate

(both of which subsequently were reduced by 1/4 point),by reinvestment

of the proceeds of the heavy recent volume of capital market offerings,

and, also, by reduced demands for short-term credit partly as a result

of the prolonged auto strike. These same influences have worked to re-

duce rates on private short-term market instruments as well, and most of

these rates are about 25--50 basis points below their levels as of

October 20. Bond markets have rallied in the last two weeks, bringing

yields somewhat below those prevailing around the time of the last FOMC

meeting.

(6) On October 23, the Treasury announced a rights exchange

for the $7.7 billion of maturing 5 per cent notes, $6.0 billion of which

were publicly held. Holders of the maturing notes were given the option

of an exchange into either a 3-1/2-year, 7-1/4 per cent note at par or

a 5-3/4-year, reopened 7-1/2 per cent note priced to yield 7.39 per cent.

The exchange was very successful with an attrition rate of only 11 per

cent, or about $650 million, of the public's holdings. These two new

issues were most recently trading at premiums of 1-3/4--2 points. In

conjunction with the October 30 announcement of the results of the rights

exchange, the Treasury announced a $2.0 billion cash financing in the

form of an auction on November 5 of a 6-3/4 per cent, 18-month note, with

50 per cent tax and loan credit allowed for banks. The note auction was

very successful, and an average issuing rate of 6.21 per cent resulted,

a rate considerably below earlier market expectations.

rates of change in major financial aggregates for selected periods:

Prospective developments

(8) The recent weakness in demand deposits, and also to a

degree in time deposits, suggests that the fourth quarter target growth

rate for the money supply of 5 per cent (and the anticipated attendant

bank credit growth rate of 9 per cent) are not likely to be attained,

even with money market conditions similar to the easier conditions

most recently prevailing. The latter might be taken to include a

Federal funds rate around the new 5-3/4 per cent discount rate and a net

reserve position for banks in a +$50 to -$200 million range. Given

these money market conditions, the staff's current projections of likely

growth in money supply, bank credit, and total reserves are shown below.

As may be seen the money supply over the quarter would be expected to

grow at a 3 per cent annual rate, with growth expected to accelerate

from the very low recent rates as economic activity picks up in connection

with the ending of the auto strike. The adjusted bank credit proxy

is expected to grow at only a 3-1/2 per cent annual rate for the quarter,

partly as U.S. Government deposits show a substantial decline.

excluding commercial paper reserves.

2/ 2.5 per cent annual rate for fourth-quarter average over third-quarter
average.

With these aggregates and money market conditions, the staff would expect

the 3-month bill rate to be in a 5-1/4--5-3/4 per cent range. It is

possible that the bill rate could rise in the last few weeks of the year

as the result of an expected $2 billion Treasury bill offering for new

cash to be announced shortly, of usual seasonal pressures, and of some

renewed short-term credit demands following settlement of the auto strike,

A back-up in short-term rates, should it develop, would tend to limit,

though perhaps not completely halt, further declines in long-term interest

rates.

(9) In light of the staff's estimate of the outlook for

monetary aggregates noted above for the fourth quarter the Committee

may wish to consider a further easing in money market conditions in an

effort to move back to its previously desired track. But since

it seems likely that some of the recent deposit weakness

may have been related to diminished short-term credit and cash working



balance needs as a result of the auto strike, the Committee may also

wish to consider settling for a somewhat slower aggregate growth in the

fourth quarter than previously desired. This approach might then allow

for a counterbalancing growth in the money stock at a rate above 5 per

cent in the first quarter when the economy will be doing most of its

catching up from strike effects. For example, the Committee may not

wish to ease money market conditions, and other interest rates, as much

as now seems likely to be required to attain a 5 per cent money stock

growth in the fourth quarter, and then have to turn around and tighten

money market conditions in the first quarter in order to keep money

growth to 5 per cent at a time when transactions demands for cash will

likely be accelerating. One alternative would be for the Committee to

strive for, say, a 4 per cent money growth rate in the fourth quarter

and a compensating 6 per cent rate in the first, thus maintaining the

annual rate over the fourth and first quarters together at around 5 per

cent.

(10) The following table summarizes relationships between

money market conditions, typified for convenience by the Federal funds

rate, and rates of increase in monetary aggregates thought at the

moment to be consistent for the fourth quarter.

Annual rates of increase
Federal funds rate! /  Money supply Bank credit

(a) 5-3/4 3 3-1/2

(b) 5 4 4-1/2

(c) 3-1/2 5 6

1/ Between now and year-end.



Needless to say, these relationships are, at best, approximate, are no

doubt subject to considerable error, and should be considered as mid-

points of fairly wide ranges, But they are presented so that the

Committee might have some basis for expressing its preferences with

respect to trade-offs over the near-term between monetary aggregates

and money market conditions.

(11) The choice to be made among the range of alternatives

summarized in paragraph (10) would appear to depend to an important

extent on the trend rate of growth that the Committee desires for money

and bank credit over a longer period of time. As earlier noted, if the

FOMC wished to remain on a 5 per cent growth trend for money stock, it

might accept a slower rate in the fourth quarter and a more rapid rate

in the first quarter in the interest of not unduly wrenching money and

credit markets. If the FOMC's basic desired path, on the other hand,

were to move up to a trend rate of growth that was about 6-7 per cent

for money in the fourth and first quarters taken together, the Committee

might then wish to be more aggressive with respect to reserve provision

in the fourth quarter in order to effect a smooth adjustment to the more

rapid money supply growth path. Two broad alternatives are discussed in

the next two subsections: one (alternative A) calls for maintaining the

target for money growth for the fourth and first quarters taken together

at a 5 per cent annual rate; the other (alternative B) calls for a higher

average rate of growth over that time span.

Policy alternative A. (12) If the Committee wishes to stay

on a 5 per cent growth path for the money supply, but is wiling to



-10-

permit some shortfall in the fourth quarter which would be made up in

the first quarter, it might consider the following language for the

second paragraph of the directive:

"To implement this policy, the Committee seeks to

promote some easing of conditions in credit markets and

moderate growth in money and attendant bank credit expan-

sion over the months ahead, WITH ALLOWANCE FOR TEMPORARY

SHIFTS IN MONEY AND CREDIT DEMANDS RELATED TO THE AUTO

STRIKE. System open market operations until the next

meeting of the Committee shall be conducted with a view

to maintaining bank reserves and money market conditions

consistent with those objectives-[DEL:taking account of the

forthcoming Treasury financings."]

This alternative might be best achieved if the Federal funds rate were

permitted to move progressively downward in a 5-3/4 - 5 per cent range

over the weeks ahead in the interest of attaining the Committee's longer-

run money supply and bank credit objectives. As noted earlier, our

estimates would suggest that a 5 per cent funds rate may be required to

achieve 4 per cent money growth over the fourth quarter. At such a

funds rate, it would be expected that this money growth shortfall might

be made up in the first quarter without any very substantial further

alteration of money market conditions. But in view of uncertainties

about the funds rate-deposit relationship and given the possibility of

exaggerated market reactions, it may be prudent to work the funds rate

down gradually between now and the next meeting while checking incoming

data to determine whether expected relationships are in fact developing.

-12-

If it proved necessary to push the Federal funds rate to around the low

end of a 5 - 5-3/4 per cent range over the next few weeks, the 3-month

Treasury bill rate would be likely to move into a lower range than the

5-1/4 - 5-3/4 per cent specified in paragraph (8). It might well drop

to 5 per cent, or below, partly on expectations that the discount rate

would soon be reduced again. And longer-term interest rates would tend

to decline more rapidly than otherwise as banks continued to acquire

securities even as loan demands picked up.

(15) It is most difficult to specify the net reserve position

of banks likely to be consistent with a Federal funds rate in the 5 -

5-3/4 per cent range, particularly a rate around the bottom end of the

range. Member bank borrowings would likely average in a $300-$400

million range (with the lower end of the range respesenting largely

necessitous long-term borrowing from the window by two banks). But it

is very unclear as to how banks' demands for excess reserves are likely

to change as the Fed funds rate drops further. One would expect that

banks would want to hold somewhat more excess reserves as the Fed funds

rate declined, but at a rate still as high as 5 per cent the level of

excess reserves desired over time may be only $50 - $100 million above

recent experience. This would mean that over a period of several weeks

sizable net free reserves are not likely to be prevalent. But, with

required reserves in a given week fixed by the lagged reserve scheme,

the banking system as a whole (with borrowings at minimal levels) would

have no way in any particular statement week to dispose of excess reserves



-13-

created when open market operations supply nonborrowed reserves in

excess of current required reserves in order to encourage bank credit

and deposit expansion. Individual banks could, of course, reduce their

own excess reserves, and the rapidity and eagerness with which they did

so would affect the Federal funds rate. In practice, though, banks may

be slow to realize that the System is easing the money market and thus,

at least for a while, may be sluggish in selling off excess reserves in

the Federal funds market. This could mean that at the beginning of an

effort significantly to ease the money market it would take fairly

sizable excess reserves in the banking system to lower the Federal funds

rate to, say, a 5 per cent average for a statement week. But once

indivdual banks realized that it did not pay to be slow in disposing of

excess reserves, a lower average level of excess reserves for the banking

system would result for any given Fed funds rate.

Policy alternative B. (16) This alternative is presented in

the event that the Committee may wish to consider a more aggressive

easing in the money market than under alternative A in order to increase

the likelihood of moving closer to a 5 per cent money growth rate (and

around 6 per cent bank credit) in the fourth quarter, partly as a way

station to moving on to a 6 - 7 per cent growth path for money for the

fourth and first quarters taken together. Suggested language for such a

directive is shown below.

"To implement this policy, the Committee seeks to promote

some FURTHER easing of conditions in credit markets and moderate



-14-

SOMEWHAT GREATER growth in money THAN SOUGHT EARLIER and

attendant bank credit expansion over the months ahead. System

open market operations until the next meeting of the Committee

shall be conducted with a view to maintaining bank reserves

and money market conditions consistent with those objectives;

[DEL: taking account of the forthcoming Treasury financings."]

(17) To achieve a 5 per cent money growth in the fourth quarter

(with the quarter already half over) the staff would expect the Federal

funds rate to have to drop well below 5 per cent, and probably also below

4 per cent, as indicated in line (c) of paragraph (10). One might,

however, expect that a Federal funds rate in a 4--5 per cent range would

prove consistent with a money growth rate somewhere in a 4--5 per cent

annual rate range. The weekly patterns of money supply and bank credit

in the inter-meeting period consistent with a 5 per cent growth rate in

money are shown in the following table:

(18) Over this period member bank borrowings would be expected

to be at minimal levels (apart from the necessitous borrowing noted

earlier) and net free reserves might consistently emerge, although it is

very difficult, for reasons noted earlier, to predict how large net free

reserves may be. The 3-month Treasury bill rate might drop to around

4-1/2 per cent, at least temporarily, and a very substantial and sus-

tained rally in bond markets would likely be generated. With short-term

market rates low, Euro-dollar borrowings of banks would tend to drop

significantly further as banks would be willing and able to obtain

domestic CD's in volume; moreover, as markedly lower interest rates

developed, banks would begin to lengthen CD maturities to lock up rela-

tively low interest cost funds, and short-term Euro-dollars (maturing

within thirty days) would become relatively less attractive.

(19) If a 5 per cent growth rate in money supply were attained

in the fourth quarter, the Federal funds rate could likely remain in a

4 - 5 per cent range to achieve a 7 - 8 per cent money growth in the

first quarter, assuming GNP in nominal terms rises in the first quarter

by about the 9 per cent annual rate that is projected. If money growth

were less than 5 per cent in the fourth quarter, money market conditions

probably would have to be eased somewhat further in the first quarter

since it would take a larger than 7 - 8 per cent money growth rate in

that quarter to compensate for the shortfall from 5 per cent in the

fourth quarter.
