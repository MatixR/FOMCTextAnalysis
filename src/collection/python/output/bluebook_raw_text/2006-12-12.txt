MONETARY POLICY ALTERNATIVES 

Recent Developments 

(1) Neither the FOMC’s decision at the October meeting to keep its target for 

the federal funds rate at 5¼ percent nor its policy statement surprised market 

participants.1  As a result, the market reaction to the announcement was muted, as 

was the response to the subsequent publication of the minutes of the meeting.  Over 

the intermeeting period, investors continued to anticipate that the FOMC will leave 

policy unchanged at this meeting.  However, partly in response to several weaker-

than-expected economic data releases, they built in some odds of an easing at the 

January meeting and significantly lowered their expectations for the path of policy 

further ahead.  Futures quotes indicate that market participants now expect more than 

75 basis points of easing during 2007, almost 50 basis points more than they 

anticipated before the October meeting (Chart 1).  However, on average, respondents 

to the Desk’s survey of primary dealers expect somewhat less policy easing in 2007—

about 50 basis points.  The primary dealers generally also anticipate the December 

FOMC statement to be broadly similar to that in October.  Although some dealers 

think that the Committee will allude to some softening in the economic outlook, most 

believe that the Committee will continue to emphasize inflation risks.  According to 

options prices, market participants’ uncertainty about the near-term path of monetary 

                                           
1 The effective federal funds rate averaged 5.25 percent over the intermeeting period.  
During the period, the Desk purchased $6.2 billion of Treasury coupon securities in the 
market and redeemed $335 million of coupon securities.  The volume of outstanding long-
term RPs increased by $4 billion, to $19 billion, primarily to accommodate seasonal increases 
in currency.  The changes to the guidelines for per-issue holding limits by the System Open 
Market Account that were discussed at the October FOMC meeting were implemented 
uneventfully during this intermeeting period.

policy increased somewhat over the intermeeting period—though it remained low by 

historical standards—and their outlook for the funds rate became more skewed 

toward lower outcomes.  

(2) Yields on Treasury securities also fell notably over the intermeeting period.  

The yield curve shifted downward in a nearly parallel fashion, with yields on two- 

through ten-year nominal Treasury notes dropping about 35 basis points.   These rate 

declines apparently reflected, at least in part, a less optimistic economic outlook 

among investors.  Both expected future short-term interest rates and term premiums 

are estimated to have declined (see box on the next page).  After adjusting for carry 

effects, TIPS-based inflation compensation for the next five years was essentially 

unchanged over the intermeeting period, and inflation compensation for the 

subsequent five years edged somewhat lower on balance.  According to the Michigan 

survey, households’ short- and long-term inflation expectations moved down a bit.   

(3) Major stock price indexes rose between 2 and 3 percent, on net, over the 

intermeeting period (Chart 2).  The decline in bond yields and the continued positive 

tone of the final batch of reports on third-quarter corporate earnings evidently offset 

the negative effects of the weaker macroeconomic news.  Implied volatility of the 

S&P 500 rose somewhat, though it remained near historical lows, and a rough 

measure of the equity risk premium widened somewhat.  Spreads of yields on 

investment- and speculative-grade bonds over those on comparable-maturity 

Treasuries were about unchanged.  Measures of the credit quality of nonfinancial 

firms stayed solid, supported by robust earnings and by strong and liquid balance 

sheets. 

(4) The trade-weighted value of the dollar versus major foreign currencies fell 

2¾ percent on balance over the intermeeting period, with a particularly steep slide in 

late November (Chart 3).  Although the drop did not appear to be triggered by 

specific events, it occurred in the context of both weaker-than-expected U.S. 

Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) Page 3 of 40



  Interpreting the Decline in Treasury Yields over the Intermeeting Period 
 
Nominal Treasury yields declined about 35 basis points over the intermeeting period, with the drop 
spread across the forward rate curve.  To put the size of this move into some historical perspective, 
the average absolute intermeeting change in two- and ten-year Treasury yields since 1994 is 29 and 
27 basis points, respectively.  Judging from TIPS yields, the decline in near-term nominal rates over 
the intermeeting period has been mostly concentrated in real yields.  Further out the term structure, 
a small portion of the decline in nominal forward rates owes to a modest decline in inflation 
compensation. Various estimates suggest that both expected future short-term interest rates and 
term premiums declined, with the latter reflecting, in particular, lower compensation for real interest 
rate risk.   This broad pattern was also evident, albeit somewhat less pronounced, in global bond 
markets as nominal and real rates moved lower in a number of industrialized countries.   
 
To a degree, the drop in yields seems to have been prompted by weaker-than-anticipated indicators 
of aggregate demand against the backdrop of relatively benign inflation data.  To be sure, the initial 
market reaction to recent spending data, as gauged by yield changes in narrow intervals around their 
releases, falls well short of explaining the full movement in yields.  However, market reports suggest 
that incoming information spurred a broader revision to investors’ views regarding the 
macroeconomic outlook.  Primary dealers, for example, have lowered their forecasts of real GDP 
growth in the fourth quarter about ½ percentage point, and to a lesser extent going forward, which 
is consistent with the fall in real interest rates, particularly at the front end of the curve.  And some 
dealers have marked down their estimates of potential output growth, which might help to explain 
some of the decline in real rates at distant horizons.  
 
On balance, the drop in yields over the intermeeting period seems to accord reasonably well with a 
sense that investors may perceive greater downside risks in the outlook for spending and economic 
growth.  Nonetheless, some aspects of recent yield curve developments do not appear to fit so 
neatly with changes in economic fundamentals.  The sizable drop in estimated term premiums, for 
example, seems to run counter to the uptick in some measures of interest rate uncertainty. 
 
Market analysts have offered several other special stories for the drop in yields, but these 
explanations also are not completely satisfying.  For example, some analysts have focused on 
anecdotal reports of strong foreign demand for Treasury securities.  However, available indicators 
do not point to a large increase in such demand.  Similarly, while some market participants have 
suggested that the recent declines in yields have been amplified by mortgage-related hedging flows, 
staff analysis indicates that the current level of rates would be expected to prompt only fairly modest 
hedging demands for longer-duration assets.  Finally, a few commentators have suggested that the 
outcome of the Congressional elections may have played a role in lowering longer-term interest 
rates, perhaps because investors expect federal budget deficits to be reduced.  Although yields 
declined modestly on the day after the election, little evidence can be adduced to support this 
hypothesis. 
 
In summary, while the direction of interest rates over the period seems consistent with changing 
perceptions of economic fundamentals, the magnitude of these changes remains somewhat 
surprising.

economic data and relatively strong economic indicators for Europe.  On balance, the 

dollar fell 5¼ percent against the euro, 4¼ percent versus sterling, and about 

3¼ percent against the yen.  By contrast, the dollar rose about 2 percent against the 

Canadian dollar, as data on Canadian economic activity were unexpectedly soft.  

Yields on long-term government securities in foreign industrial countries registered 

declines of 10 to 30 basis points, generally somewhat less than those on comparable-

maturity U.S. Treasury issues.  Major foreign stock markets recorded small net 

changes over the intermeeting period.  To combat inflation pressures, the Bank of 

England, the Riksbank, the Reserve Bank of Australia, and the European Central 

Bank raised their policy rates 25 basis points during the intermeeting period.2 

(5) The dollar declined about 1¼ percent on net against an index of currencies 

of our other important trading partners.   

 

  The dollar’s slow decline 

versus the Chinese renminbi accelerated a bit, leaving the dollar about 1 percent lower 

by the end of the intermeeting period.  Despite signs of continued strong Mexican 

economic performance, the peso weakened because of ongoing political turmoil 

surrounding the change in the Mexican presidency; on balance, the dollar gained 

about ¾ percent against the peso over the intermeeting period.  Stock prices in 

Mexico and Brazil climbed roughly 11 and 8 percent, respectively, and their EMBI+ 

spreads remained steady near low historical levels.

(6) The debt of the domestic nonfinancial sectors grew at about a 6¾ percent 

annual rate in the third quarter and appears to be expanding at nearly that pace in the 

current quarter (Chart 4).  Net issuance of investment- and speculative-grade 

corporate bonds surged in November, supported by the continued elevated level of 

mergers and acquisitions and the decline in yields.  Short-term business borrowing, by 

contrast, appears to have moderated somewhat, with C&I loans slowing notably in the 

fourth quarter from their rapid pace earlier in the year.  Growth of home mortgage 

debt is estimated to have stepped down significantly in the third quarter, about in line 

with the sustained deceleration in house prices.  Consumer credit again expanded at a 

moderate pace in the third quarter, and data for consumer loans at commercial banks 

suggest continued modest growth in the current quarter.       

(7) Reflecting the pattern of expansion in liquid deposits, M2 growth jumped in 

October but fell back to a 6 percent annual rate in November.  By contrast, small time 

deposits and retail money funds—two components of the aggregate whose yields tend 

to follow short-term market rates fairly closely—continued to expand briskly.  For the 

fourth quarter as a whole, M2 growth appears to be outpacing that of nominal 

income, the first decrease in the velocity of M2 in more than two years.  Appendix A 

analyzes the growth of money and the debt of domestic nonfinancial sectors this year.

Economic Outlook Through 2008 

(8) The staff’s forecast for both real GDP and inflation is largely unchanged 

from that presented in the October Greenbook.  The underlying pace of economic 

growth in the second half of this year is judged to be a touch weaker than had been 

anticipated; further out, however, the forecast for real activity is little different, with 

growth projected to pick up gradually during 2007 to a rate broadly in line with the 

staff’s estimate of sustainable output growth.  As in October, the forecast assumes 

that the Committee maintains the current stance of policy through mid-2008 and then 

eases slightly.  Longer-term Treasury yields start from a lower level than in the 

previous forecast, but rise almost 50 basis points over 2007 as investors come to 

realize that policy is unlikely to be eased next year.  Stock prices climb at about a 

6½ percent annual rate from a starting point that is around 4 percent higher than 

projected in the October Greenbook.  The real trade-weighted dollar is again assumed 

to depreciate gradually, but from a level about 2 percent lower than assumed in 

October.  Oil prices edge somewhat higher over the forecast horizon, in line with 

futures quotes.  Reflecting the unexpected drop in the unemployment rate earlier this 

autumn, the labor market is projected to be slightly tighter through 2007 than had 

been anticipated in October, but the higher level of the markup implied by the 

downward revision to compensation suggests that firms will largely absorb the 

increased cost pressures emanating from the labor market.  Core PCE inflation is 

again projected to edge down to about 2 percent by the end of 2008, primarily 

reflecting a further waning of the effects of the earlier run-up in the prices of energy 

and imported goods and a fall in the rate of increase of shelter costs.  Overall PCE 

inflation is expected to be about 2¾ percent in 2007 and 2 percent in 2008.

Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) Page 10 of 40



Update on Medium-Term Strategies 

(9) Charts 5 to 7 provide an update of the materials on medium-term strategies 

that were presented in the October Bluebook.  The Greenbook-consistent measure  

of the short-run equilibrium real federal funds rate (r*)—the value that would close 

the output gap over the next twelve quarters—remains at about 2¾ percent, reflecting 

the modest changes to the staff’s outlook for aggregate demand over the intermeeting 

period (Chart 5).  The actual real funds rate is just above the Greenbook-consistent 

measure and at the upper end of the range of model-based estimates of short-run r*.  

Optimal control simulations of the FRB/US model prescribe policy paths that are 

virtually identical to those presented in the October Bluebook (Chart 6).3  With an 

inflation goal of 2 percent, the optimal funds rate remains near 5¼ percent through 

2008; in contrast, with an inflation goal of 1½ percent, optimal policy prescribes a 

funds rate path that peaks at about 6 percent late next year.  The estimated outcome-

based rule prescribes a nearly constant funds rate of about 5¼ percent through the 

end of 2008—a path that is substantially tighter than that embedded in financial 

market prices (Chart 7).  Options prices continue to suggest noticeably less 

uncertainty about the future course of policy among market participants than implied 

by FRB/US model simulations.  The near-term prescriptions of several simple rules—

such as those proposed by Taylor (1993, 1999)—have not changed significantly over 

the intermeeting period. 

 

 

                                           
3 The FRB/US model was employed—together with judgmental adjustments—to construct an illustrative extension of 
the Greenbook forecast beyond 2008 that served as a baseline for these simulations.  This extension was based on the 
same medium-term assumptions that were described in the October Bluebook.  In the optimal control exercises, 
policymakers and participants in financial markets are assumed to understand fully the forces shaping the economic 
outlook (as summarized by the extended Greenbook projection), whereas households and firms form their expectations 
using more limited information.  The optimal policies shown in Chart 6 assume that policymakers place equal weights on 
three stabilization objectives: keeping core PCE inflation close to a specified goal of either 1½ or 2 percent; keeping 
unemployment close to the long-run NAIRU of 5 percent; and avoiding sharp changes in the nominal funds rate.

Short-Run Policy Alternatives 

(10) This Bluebook presents three policy alternatives for the Committee’s 

consideration, associated with the draft statements in Table 1.  Under Alternatives A 

and B, the Committee would leave the stance of monetary policy unchanged at this 

meeting; Alternative A would imply that the risks to economic growth and inflation 

were now judged to be broadly balanced, whereas Alternative B would again indicate 

that the risks to inflation remained of greatest concern.  Under Alternative C, the 

Committee would increase the target rate 25 basis points at this meeting and continue 

to emphasize the presence of upside risks to inflation.  The employment report for 

November will be published the day after this document is completed; a revised draft 

of Table 1 will be circulated if warranted by those data.   

(11) If the Committee views a combination of near-trend growth and a gradual 

ebbing of core inflation over the next two years as the best attainable outcome in 

current circumstances and continues to judge that the current stance of policy is 

broadly consistent with achieving such an outcome, it might be attracted to 

Alternative B.  With the real federal funds rate at the upper end of the range of 

model-based estimates of its equilibrium value and a bit above the Greenbook-

consistent measure, policy might be viewed as applying slight restraint on economic 

activity, helping to foster a reduction of inflation.  Some tentative signs suggest that 

core inflation may be starting to moderate, and incoming data suggest that near-term 

economic expansion may be a bit further below growth of potential output than had 

previously been anticipated.  Even so, the possibility that inflation might not slow as 

expected may remain the dominant concern for policy going forward.  The substantial 

uncertainty regarding the dynamics of inflation implies a risk that recent rates of 

inflation might persist even if output grows at only a moderate pace and energy prices 

are broadly unchanged.  Moreover, the current tightness of the labor market—

evidenced both by the low unemployment rate in October and by widespread reports

Rationale 

3.  Readings on core inflation have 
been elevated, and the high level of 
resource utilization has the potential 
to sustain inflation pressures.  
However, inflation pressures seem 
likely to moderate over time, 
reflecting reduced impetus from 
energy prices, contained inflation 
expectations, and the cumulative 
effects of monetary policy actions 
and other factors restraining 
aggregate demand. 
 
 

Readings on core inflation have 
improved modestly since the spring but 
remain elevated. The high level of 
resource utilization has the potential to 
sustain inflation pressures.  However, 
inflation pressures seem likely to 
moderate over time, reflecting reduced 
impetus from energy prices, contained 
inflation expectations, and the 
cumulative effects of monetary policy 
actions and other factors restraining

Readings on core inflation have 
been elevated, and the high level of 
resource utilization has the potential 
to sustain inflation pressures.  
Inflation pressures seem likely to 
moderate over time, but the extent 
and speed of that moderation are 
uncertain.  In these circumstances, 
the Committee believed that an 
additional firming of policy was 
appropriate to foster the 
achievement of price stability. 

In these circumstances, future policy 
adjustments will depend on the evolution 
of the outlook for both inflation and 
economic growth, as implied by 
incoming information.

Assessment of 
Risk 

4.  Nonetheless, the Committee 
judges that some inflation risks 
remain.  The extent and timing of 
any additional firming that may be 
needed to address these risks will 
depend on the evolution of the 
outlook for both inflation and 
economic growth, as implied by 
incoming information. 

Although the Committee both seeks 
and expects a gradual reduction in 
inflation, it continues to view the 
risks to that outcome as to the 
upside.  The extent and timing of 
any additional firming that may be 
needed to address these risks will 
depend on the evolution of the 
outlook for both inflation and 
economic growth, as implied by 
incoming information. 

Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) Page 16 of 40



of labor shortages for a range of occupations—might be seen as posing an upside risk 

to the Committee’s desired moderation in inflation.  Even if the likelihood of a 

deterioration in inflation performance relative to expectations is not thought to be 

significantly greater than that of a corresponding deterioration in economic growth, 

the Committee might judge that an erosion in inflation outcomes would be more 

costly and thus view the upside risks to inflation as the greater concern for policy.   

(12) In light of the recent data and the revision to the staff’s projection for near-

term growth, the Committee may wish to make two changes to the discussion of 

economic growth in the policy statement accompanying Alternative B.  First, the 

extent of the decline in housing activity in recent quarters means that it may now be 

more appropriate to refer to the cooling of the housing market as “substantial.”   

Second, the statement could acknowledge that “the recent pace of growth appears to 

have been somewhat more subdued than anticipated…”  Even so, the Committee 

could note that “the economy seems likely to expand at a moderate pace on balance 

over coming quarters.”  The inclusion of the phrase “on balance” allows for the 

possibility that measured GDP growth in the current and subsequent quarter may be 

notably below trend before rebounding thereafter.  With the prospects for inflation 

largely unchanged, there appears to be little reason to alter the inflation paragraph 

from that in the October statement.  Likewise, the statement could conclude by 

repeating the risk assessment from the previous statement.  

(13) An announcement along the lines of Alternative B is unlikely to prompt a 

significant market reaction.  Money market futures and options indicate that investors 

assign essentially no probability to a change in the target rate at the December 

meeting.  And the Desk’s survey indicates that the majority of primary dealers expect 

that the accompanying statement will not differ significantly from the October 

announcement apart from some modest updating of the paragraph characterizing 

economic growth, though a minority anticipate language that points to some 

Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) Page 17 of 40



downside risks to the growth outlook while still citing upside risks to inflation.  

Although the statement proposed for Alternative B does not explicitly recognize risks 

to growth, it seems consistent with the broad thrust of these expectations. 

(14)  If the data released over the intermeeting period have caused members to 

revise their assessment of the distribution of possible outcomes for inflation and 

economic growth such that the risks are now thought to be more balanced, the 

Committee may prefer the policy choice and wording of Alternative A.  The sharper 

adjustment in residential investment implied by the incoming data, combined with the 

continuing high level of inventories in the auto sector and the softer tone of recent 

spending and production indicators more generally, might be seen as increasing the 

downside risks to economic growth.  Members may also see some possibility that the 

recent easing of financial conditions, and the associated stimulus to economic growth, 

could be short lived, as illustrated in the “Tighter financial conditions” scenario 

presented in the Greenbook.  Moreover, the staff’s projection of relatively sluggish 

near-term expansion might cause the Committee to worry that such downside risks, if 

they materialized, could lead to a disproportionate slowdown in growth.  At the same 

time, the Committee’s confidence that core inflation will decline may have been 

boosted by the improvement in some measures of core inflation, the downward 

revisions to data on increases in hourly compensation and unit labor costs earlier this 

year, and the absence so far of substantial renewed upward pressure on oil prices.  

The Committee may also place some weight on the possibility that inflation could 

slow more quickly than in the staff forecast, either because the general persistence of 

inflation may have declined over the past decade or because the recent pickup in core 

inflation was associated importantly with increases in shelter costs, which might fall 

back relatively sharply if the ongoing adjustment of the housing market leads to a 

marked increase in the supply of rental accommodation.  Finally, as noted earlier, 

maintaining the federal funds rate at 5¼ percent over the next few quarters would be 

Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) Page 18 of 40



broadly consistent with the Committee’s past behavior as captured in the estimated 

policy rules. 

(15) To acknowledge the downside risks to growth, the statement accompanying 

Alternative A would note that the ongoing adjustment of the housing market could 

have a “more pronounced effect on growth in coming quarters than anticipated.”  

The Committee may also wish to recognize the slight decline in some measures of 

core inflation in recent months by noting that “Readings on core inflation have 

improved modestly since the spring.”  Even so, the statement would stress that 

readings on core inflation “remain elevated.”  Given the competing risks to inflation 

and growth, the risk assessment would simply note that “In these circumstances, 

future policy adjustments will depend on the evolution of the outlook for both 

inflation and economic growth, as implied by incoming information.”   

(16) Although market participants expect the current target for the federal funds 

rate to be maintained at this meeting, they generally do not expect a statement that 

suggests that the Committee views the risks to economic growth and inflation as 

balanced and is no longer predisposed towards policy firming.  Market participants are 

likely to interpret such a statement as boosting the likelihood that the Committee will 

begin easing the stance of policy early next year.  Short- and intermediate-term yields 

would probably decline moderately, but any drop in long-term yields would likely be 

relatively small.  The recent slide in the foreign exchange value of the dollar could be 

extended, and stock prices might rally.     

(17) In contrast, the Committee may now see it as unlikely that inflation will 

decline at an acceptable pace should the current stance of policy be maintained and 

hence judge it necessary to take further policy action, as in the 25 basis point firming 

of Alternative C.  In particular, members may believe that the tightness in labor 

markets means that inflation may fail to decline, and could even rise, as illustrated in 

the “Greater wage acceleration” scenario presented in the Greenbook.  In addition, 

Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) Page 19 of 40



the recent easing of financial conditions could impart significant stimulus to aggregate 

demand, augmenting pressure on resources.  Also, some members may judge that 

long-term inflation expectations are higher than would be consistent with an 

appreciable decline in inflation from recent rates and that monetary policy needs to 

tighten to help foster a reduction in these expectations.  Even if members think that 

the staff’s forecast for core inflation to edge gradually lower is reasonable, they may 

consider the extent and pace of that expected decline, in which core PCE inflation is 

projected to remain above 2 percent through 2008, to be unacceptable, and hence see 

further policy firming as necessary.  In the medium-term strategies presented earlier, 

the optimal policy path associated with an inflation objective of 1½ percent involves 

raising the federal funds rate to about 6 percent over the next year.   

(18) The description of the prospects for growth in the statement associated 

with Alternative C could be identical to that suggested for Alternative B.  However, in 

the inflation paragraph, rather than listing the various factors contributing to the 

expected moderation in inflation, the Committee could indicate that “Inflation 

pressures seem likely to moderate over time, but the extent and speed of that 

moderation are uncertain.”  The discussion of inflation could conclude by stating that 

“In these circumstances, the Committee believed that an additional firming of policy 

was appropriate to foster the achievement of price stability.”  And if, despite the 

firming in policy, the Committee remained concerned that inflation would not 

moderate as desired, it could underscore its commitment to price stability by 

modifying the first sentence of the risk assessment to note that “Although the 

Committee both seeks and expects a gradual reduction in inflation, it continues to 

view the risks to that outcome as to the upside.” 

(19) The firming of the stance of policy envisaged under Alternative C and the 

accompanying statement would come as a considerable surprise to the markets.  

Investors would likely revise up sharply their expectations for the path of policy over 

Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) Page 20 of 40



the next year or so.  Short- and intermediate-term nominal and real yields would rise 

markedly.  Longer-term nominal yields would likely rise by less or could even fall if 

investors concluded that the FOMC had a lower objective for inflation than they had 

previously thought.  With real rates higher, the foreign exchange value of the dollar 

would likely rise, and equity prices would decline.    

Money and Debt Forecasts 

(20) Under the Greenbook forecast, M2 is projected to grow about 5 percent in 

both 2007 and 2008, largely unchanged from the October forecast.  Given the flat 

path assumed for the federal funds rate, the restraining effects on money demand of 

previous policy tightenings will probably have run their course by early 2007.  As a 

result, M2 is projected to rise broadly in line with nominal income.  Liquid deposits—

the largest share of M2—are expected to accelerate gradually as deposit rates on these 

assets continue to catch up with the earlier increases in market rates.  Small time 

deposits and retail money funds, which have been growing rapidly because their yields 

follow market rates closely, are forecast to decelerate noticeably.  Currency is 

projected to continue to expand moderately. 

(21) Growth of domestic nonfinancial sector debt is expected to slow to an 

annual rate of around 6½ percent in 2007 and 2008, down from about 7½ percent in 

2006.  This deceleration largely reflects a marked step-down in the growth of home 

mortgage debt, mirroring the ongoing adjustment in the housing market.  The growth 

of business debt is also expected to ease slightly, owing to some slowing in net equity 

retirements.  Federal debt is projected to expand at a 6 percent pace over the next two 

years.

Appendix A: Review of Debt and Money Growth in 2006 

Total debt of the domestic nonfinancial sectors expanded an estimated 
7½ percent in 2006, below its pace in 2005, but faster than nominal income.  
Debt growth slowed markedly in the household and government sectors, while 
business debt expanded faster than in 2005.   

The slowdown in household borrowing in 2006 was accounted for by a 
decline in home mortgage borrowing, reflecting a substantial cooling in the 
housing market.  Meanwhile, strong tax receipts held down borrowing by the 
federal government, and continued improvement in the fiscal situation of state 
and local governments, as well as a drop in advance refunding issues, helped to 
reduce borrowing in that sector.   

Nonfinancial business borrowing picked up to finance greater capital 
spending, inventory investment, and equity retirements from share repurchases 
and mergers and acquisitions.  Net bond issuance in 2006 was quite a bit 
stronger than in the previous several years, while commercial paper outstanding 
and C&I loans also expanded at a faster pace.  Business borrowing decelerated 
slightly in the second half of the year but remained robust on the whole.  
Leverage of nonfinancial businesses stayed near the lows of the past two 
decades, with profits strong and balance sheets liquid.  

M2 grew about 5 percent this year, a slight pickup from 2005.  Money 
growth again was restrained relative to nominal income by the increase in 
opportunity costs associated with the tightening of monetary policy.   

Domestic Nonfinancial Sector Debt 

Business debt expanded 8½ percent in 2006, a considerable acceleration 
relative to the previous several years.  A substantial fraction of borrowing 
proceeds for the year reportedly financed mergers and acquisitions as well as 
investment in plant and equipment.  Net bond issuance proceeded at a good 
clip, with offerings above those seen since 2001.  Similarly, commercial paper 
issuance was the strongest it has been since 2000.         

C&I lending by banks expanded rapidly through much of the year, 
supported by an accommodative lending environment.  In the Federal 
Reserve’s Senior Loan Officer Opinion Surveys in April and July, a significant 
net fraction of respondents indicated that they had eased credit standards and 
terms on C&I loans, pointing to more-aggressive competition from other 

Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) Page 24 of 40



lenders as the most important reason for having done so.  Notable net fractions 
of respondents to these surveys also cited greater liquidity in the secondary 
market for such loans and increased tolerance for risk as reasons for moving 
toward a more accommodative lending posture.  By October, however, this 
easing margin had disappeared, and C&I loans outstanding expanded at a 
somewhat more moderate rate towards the end of the year.     

Gross equity issuance by nonfinancial corporations in 2006 was similar 
to that seen over the past several years but was dwarfed by equity retirements, 
producing large negative net equity issuance overall.  Massive equity retirements 
resulted from an elevated level of cash-financed mergers and record share 
repurchases amid strong profits and ample cash on corporate balance sheets.  

The expansion of commercial mortgage debt in 2006 remained rapid by 
historical standards but came in below last year’s torrid pace, likely reflecting 
the rise in commercial mortgage rates and a net tightening of credit standards 
for these loans consistent with responses to the July and October Senior Loan 
Officer Opinion Surveys.  With rents climbing and vacancy rates falling, 
delinquency rates on commercial real estate loans have been low, and spreads 
on investment-grade commercial-mortgage-backed securities remain quite 
narrow.   

Overall, the credit quality of nonfinancial firms has generally remained 
very solid.  Corporate earnings have stayed strong, and balance sheet liquidity, 
although a bit less than last year, continues to be high.  Corporate leverage is 
near multi-decade lows, and the six-month trailing bond default rate is near 
zero.  The delinquency rate on business loans is extremely low, as is the 
expected year-ahead default rate measured by the KMV index.     

Household debt is estimated to have expanded about 8 percent in 2006, 
considerably slower than the robust 12 percent increase seen in 2005.  Growth 
of home mortgage debt dropped about 5 percentage points to a rate of just 
under 9 percent, as house prices decelerated substantially and home purchases 
and residential investment slowed.  Nonetheless, homeowners continued to 
extract equity from their homes, as home equity lending remained active and 
the volume of gross cash-out refinancing exceeded 2005 levels.  Mortgage 
borrowing likely continued to take the place of some other forms of 
borrowing, and consumer credit expanded only 5 percent in 2006.       

The financial obligations ratio rose to new highs this year as household 
debt grew more rapidly than disposable personal income and as rising interest 

Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) Page 25 of 40



rates contributed to an associated increase in debt service payments.  To date, 
evidence suggests that most households have been able to meet their 
obligations, although there are indications of growing strain among some 
groups.  Delinquency rates on consumer loans and prime mortgages have 
remained on the low side, but delinquency rates on subprime residential 
mortgages—in particular, those with variable interest rates—have increased 
markedly.  Meanwhile, household bankruptcy filings continue to run at a pace 
well below the average of recent years.  Bankruptcies were likely damped by the 
decisions of some households in the fall of 2005 to accelerate their filings to 
avoid more onerous requirements of the new bankruptcy law. 

The ratio of household net worth to disposable personal income is 
estimated to have increased a little, on net, over 2006, as the value of household 
assets was boosted by double-digit gains in equity prices.  Personal saving 
remained at a historically low level.  After substantial inflows in the first 
quarter, investors withdrew funds, on net, from domestic equity mutual funds 
in the second and third quarters.  Meanwhile international equity funds saw 
substantial inflows over the course of the year, and inflows to bond funds were 
on pace to reach highs not seen for several years.    

Borrowing by state and local governments dropped below its rapid 2005 
pace amid improved budgets and fewer advance refunding issues.  That said, 
bond issuance for new capital expenditures in the education, transportation, 
and housing sectors rose over the second half of the year and supported a rise 
in overall borrowing.  Credit quality in the state and local sector improved 
substantially, as the number of credit rating upgrades far exceeded the small 
number of downgrades.   

The Treasury borrowed about 20 percent less from the public on net 
during this calendar year than it did in 2005.  A 12 percent increase in tax 
receipts outpaced a 7 percent rise in outlays, leading to a substantial decline in 
the federal deficit.  In February, the Treasury auctioned thirty-year bonds for 
the first time since 2001; the offering was well received.  Average participation 
by foreigners in Treasury coupon security auctions this year was similar to that 
in 2005 but below its peak in 2004.     

Bank Credit 

Commercial bank credit expanded at a 10½ percent annual rate over the 
first three quarters of the year, supported by brisk growth in loans to both 
businesses and households.  C&I loans increased at a very rapid pace over this 

Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) Page 26 of 40



period, reportedly fueled by vigorous merger and acquisition activity, rising 
outlays for investment goods, ongoing inventory accumulation, and an 
accommodative lending environment.  Growth in commercial real estate loans 
was also quite elevated, supported by strong fundamentals and favorable 
lending conditions.  Similarly, supportive housing market conditions lifted real 
estate lending to households over this period, and consumer loans held by 
banks grew relatively briskly.  However, bank credit is estimated to have 
decelerated sharply in the fourth quarter, driven by a reduction in growth in all 
major loan categories as well as a contraction in securities holdings.1  The 
stepdown in C&I loan growth in the fourth quarter appears to have been 
concentrated at small banks.  Growth in loans backed by residential real estate 
is estimated to have come to a halt in the fourth quarter, likely reflecting in part 
the cooling in the housing market.   

M2 Monetary Aggregate 

The effects of the rise in short-term interest rates associated with 
monetary policy tightenings held M2 growth equal to or below that of nominal 
income for the first three quarters of the year, but the aggregate is estimated to 
have grown robustly in the fourth quarter.  Retail money market mutual funds 
and small time deposits, components of M2 whose yields rise with market 
rates, grew rapidly all year.  In contrast, liquid deposits, whose yields adjust 
more gradually, declined on net over the first three quarters, but rebounded in 
the fourth quarter.  Currency has grown only moderately, as it did in 2005, 
reflecting weak demand both domestically and internationally.  For the year as a 
whole, M2 is estimated to have expanded about 5 percent.  The velocity of M2 
rose ½ percentage point, a considerably smaller increase than would be 
expected based on its empirical relationship with opportunity cost since the 
early 1990s. 

 

                                                 
1 Data on bank credit and its components discussed here have been adjusted to remove the effects of a 
consolidation of a sizable amount of assets from affiliated thrift institutions onto a commercial bank’s 
books in October 2006.

Appendix B: Measures of the Equilibrium Real Rate 
 

The equilibrium real rate is the real federal funds rate that, if maintained, would be projected to return 
output to its potential level over time.  The short-run equilibrium rate is defined as the rate that would 
close the output gap in twelve quarters given the corresponding model’s projection of the economy.   
The medium-run concept is the value of the real federal funds rate projected to keep output at potential 
in seven years, under the assumption that monetary policy acts to bring actual and potential output into 
line in the short run and then keeps them equal thereafter.  The TIPS-based factor model measure 
provides an estimate of market expectations for the real federal funds rate seven years ahead.  
 
The actual real federal funds rate is constructed as the difference between the nominal rate and realized 
inflation, where the nominal rate is measured as the quarterly average of the observed federal funds rate, 
and realized inflation is given by the log difference between the staff’s estimate of the core PCE price 
index and its lagged value four quarters earlier.  For the current quarter, the nominal rate is specified as 
the target federal funds rate on the Bluebook publication date.  
 
Confidence intervals reflect uncertainties about model specification, coefficients, and the level of 
potential output.  The final column of the table indicates the values for the current quarter based on  
the estimation for the previous Bluebook, except that the TIPS-based measure and the actual real funds 
rate are the values published in the previous Bluebook. 
  

Measure Description 

Single-equation 
Model  

The measure of the equilibrium real rate in the single-equation model is based on an 
estimated aggregate-demand relationship between the current value of the output gap and 
its lagged values as well as the lagged values of the real federal funds rate. 

Small Structural 
Model 

The small-scale model of the economy consists of equations for five variables: the output 
gap, the equity premium, the federal budget surplus, the trend growth rate of output, and 
the real bond yield. 

Large Model 
(FRB/US) 

Estimates of the equilibrium real rate using FRB/US—the staff’s large-scale econometric 
model of the U.S. economy—depend on a very broad array of economic factors, some of 
which take the form of projected values of the model’s exogenous variables. 

Greenbook-
consistent  

The FRB/US model is used in conjunction with an extended version of the Greenbook 
forecast to derive a Greenbook-consistent measure.  FRB/US is first add-factored so that 
its simulation matches the extended Greenbook forecast, and then a second simulation is 
run off this baseline to determine the value of the real federal funds rate that closes the 
output gap. 

TIPS-based 
Factor Model 

Yields on TIPS (Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities) reflect investors’ expectations of 
the future path of real interest rates, but also include term and liquidity premiums.  The 
TIPS-based measure of the equilibrium real rate is constructed using the seven-year-ahead 
instantaneous real forward rate derived from TIPS yields as of the Bluebook publication 
date.  This forward rate is adjusted to remove estimates of the term and liquidity 
premiums based on a three-factor arbitrage-free term-structure model applied to TIPS 
yields, nominal yields, and inflation.  Because TIPS indexation is based on the total CPI, 
this measure is also adjusted for the medium-term difference—projected at 40 basis 
points—between total CPI inflation and core PCE inflation.

Appendix C: Analysis of Policy Paths and Confidence Intervals 
 
Rule Specifications:  For the following rules, it denotes the federal funds rate for quarter t, while  
the explanatory variables include the staff’s projection of trailing four-quarter core PCE inflation (πt), 
inflation two and three quarters ahead (πt+2|t and πt+3|t), the output gap in the current period and one 
quarter ahead ( t*ty y−  and *1| 1|t t t ty y+ +−

4 4 *
), and the three-quarter-ahead forecast of annual average GDP 

growth relative to potential ( 3| 3|t t t ty yΔ − Δ+ + ), and *π  denotes an assumed value of policymakers’ 
long-run inflation objective.  The outcome-based and forecast-based rules were estimated using real-
time data over the sample 1988:1-2005:4; each specification was chosen using the Bayesian information 
criterion.  Each rule incorporates a 75 basis point shift in the intercept, specified as a sequence of  
25 basis point increments during the first three quarters of 1998.  The first two simple rules were 
proposed by Taylor (1993, 1999), while the third is a variant of the Taylor (1999) rule—introduced  
in the August Bluebook—with a higher value of r*.  The prescriptions of the first-difference rule do  
not depend on assumptions regarding r* or the level of the output gap; see Orphanides (2003). 
 

Outcome-based rule it =  1.17it-1–0.37it-2+0.20[1.04  + 1.76 πt  + 3.32( *t ty y− )  – 2.37( *1 1t ty y− −− )] 

Forecast-based rule it =  1.16it-1–0.36it-2+0.20[0.89+ 1.74 πt+2|t+2.32( *1| 1|t t t ty y+ +− )–1.40( *1 1t ty y− −− )] 

Taylor (1993) rule it = 2 + πt + 0.5(πt – *π ) + 0.5( *t ty y− ) 

Taylor (1999) rule it = 2 + πt + 0.5(πt – *π ) + ( *t ty y− ) 

Taylor (1999) rule     
with higher r* 

it = 2.75 + πt + 0.5(πt – *π ) + ( *t ty y− )  

First-difference rule it = it-1 + 0.5(πt+3|t – *π ) + 0.5( 4 4 *3| 3|t t t ty y+ +Δ − Δ ) 
   
FRB/US Model Simulations:  Prescriptions from the two empirical rules are computed using dynamic 
simulations of the FRB/US model, implemented as though the rule is followed starting at this FOMC 
meeting.  This quarter’s prescription is a weighted average of the actual value of the federal funds rate 
thus far this quarter and the value obtained from the FRB/US model simulations using the timing of this 
meeting within the quarter to determine the weights.  Confidence intervals are based on stochastic 
simulations of the FRB/US model with shocks drawn from the estimated residuals over 1986-2005.  
  
Information from Financial Markets:  The expected funds rate path is based on federal funds  
and Eurodollar futures quotes.  The confidence intervals for this path are obtained from prices of  
at-the-money options contracts that are traded on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. 
 
Near-Term Prescriptions of Simple Policy Rules:  These prescriptions are calculated using Greenbook 
projections for inflation and the output gap.  The first-difference rule’s one-quarter-ahead prescription is 
computed using that rule’s prescription for the current quarter.

Inflation Indicator Based on M2

Note: P* is defined to equal M2 times V* divided by potential GDP. V*, or long-run velocity, is estimated
using average velocity over the 1959:Q1-to-1989:Q4 period and then, after a break, over the interval from
1993:Q1 to the present. For the forecast period, P* is based on the staff M2 forecast and P is simulated using a
short-run dynamic model relating P to P*. Blue areas indicate periods in which P* is notably less than P.
Gray areas denote the projection period.
