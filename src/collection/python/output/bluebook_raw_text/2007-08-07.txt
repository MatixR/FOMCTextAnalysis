MONETARY POLICY ALTERNATIVES 

Recent Developments 

(1) Increased concerns among investors about further deterioration in the U.S. 

subprime mortgage market appear to have prompted a broad-based reassessment of 

risk in financial markets over the intermeeting period.  In part, the reassessment seems 

to have reflected greater uncertainty about the appropriate valuation of some U.S. 

structured credit instruments, including collateralized debt obligations (CDOs) and 

collateralized loan obligations (CLOs) used to fund both mortgage and business 

credits.  Over the period, some corporate credit spreads widened substantially, equity 

indexes were quite volatile, and safe-haven demands reportedly boosted government 

bond prices in many industrialized countries.  Investors marked down their expected 

path for U.S. monetary policy.      

(2) Concern about signs of further deterioration in the quality of subprime 

credits, and uncertainty about the extent and incidence of associated losses, gripped 

investors over much of the intermeeting period.  Market participants reacted to 

announcements by rating agencies of downgrades of some residential-mortgage-

backed securities and CDO tranches, the publication of significantly lower-than-

expected second-quarter earnings at a large mortgage originator, the release of 

remittance data associated with subprime mortgage pools that pointed to a further rise 

in delinquencies, and news that a mortgage lender had difficulty meeting margin calls 

that were triggered by a decline in the value of its subprime mortgage collateral.  

Weaker-than-expected data on recent home sales also appeared to contribute to 

mounting expectations of losses on subprime loans.  Investors responded by pushing 

up spreads on indexes of credit default swaps (CDS) on subprime mortgage 



instruments and premiums on CDS of firms active in the sector (Chart 1).  (See box 

entitled “Recent Developments in the Subprime Mortgage Market.”)   

(3) Against this backdrop, and with an exceptionally large calendar of relatively 

low-rated corporate financing deals related to leveraged buy-outs (LBOs), credit 

concerns spread to encompass other risky instruments, and some corporate credit 

spreads, especially in the high-yield sector, widened markedly.  Elevated market 

volatility and uncertainty about valuations contributed to, and may have been 

reinforced by, the delay or withdrawal of several leveraged loan deals and speculative-

grade bond issues and led to heightened jitters about the availability of LBO-related 

financing going forward.  On balance over the intermeeting period, spreads of yields 

on speculative-grade corporate bonds over those on comparable-maturity Treasury 

securities increased more than 100 basis points, while those on investment-grade 

securities rose about 35 basis points.  Even so, these spreads generally remained 

moderate by historical standards, and investment-grade yields were little changed over 

the period.  Late in the period, there were reports of unsettled conditions in the asset-

backed commercial paper (ABCP) market, although ABCP issuance and published 

ABCP yields did not appear to be much affected.  (See box entitled “Recent 

Developments in Corporate Credit Markets.”)  Despite second-quarter earnings 

reports that were generally solid, broad equity price indexes declined about 2½ 

percent, on net.  Stock prices of financial firms and homebuilders fell considerably 

more, and CDS premiums on obligations of large investment banks and some major 

mortgage insurers widened sharply.  The option-implied volatility of equity prices 

jumped to levels that were above its long-run historical average.       

(4) Federal Reserve communications left little imprint on market prices, on net, 

over the period.  The FOMC’s decision at its June meeting to keep the target federal 

funds rate unchanged at 5¼ percent was widely anticipated, but its assessment that 

“sustained moderation in inflation pressures has yet to be convincingly demonstrated”

Recent Developments in the Subprime Mortgage Market 
 
Conditions in the subprime residential mortgage sector continued to deteriorate over the intermeeting 
period.  Rating agencies downgraded lower-rated tranches of a considerable number of subprime residential 
mortgage-backed securities (RMBS) deals and also some higher-rated tranches of collateralized debt 
obligations (CDOs) backed by recently issued subprime mortgages—including some AAA tranches that 
investors had believed to be very safe.  In addition, the rating agencies announced changes to their rating 
and surveillance methodologies for RMBS and CDOs.  Investors took note of the fact that the criteria to 
assign high ratings to future structures will be more stringent and apparently also interpreted the 
announcements as an indication that further downgrades of existing deals might be forthcoming.  As a 
consequence, spreads on even the AAA segments of the most recent vintages of the ABX subprime 
mortgage indexes, which previously had been largely immune from the negative news affecting the sector, 
jumped to levels well above 150 basis points—as shown in the left panel below.  ABX spreads also widened 
in response to remittance reports issued at the end of July showing that delinquency rates and defaults on 
the underlying pools of subprime residential mortgages had accelerated more than some had expected. 
 
The poor performance of existing loans negatively affected the second quarter earnings of firms active in 
both the subprime and Alt-A sectors.1  Countrywide reported second-quarter earnings well below 
expectations and indicated that delinquencies and defaults were rising in all its mortgage business lines, 
including second loans to households with relatively strong credit histories.  Earnings of other lenders and 
of investment banks that securitize and warehouse subprime mortgage loans also suffered.  With the market 
value of subprime and Alt-A MBS declining sharply, some well-known issuers of securities faced heavy 
margin calls and uncertain prospects.  In addition, several more hedge funds announced a steep drop in 
value. 
 
Large mortgage lenders, including Countrywide, Washington Mutual, and Wells Fargo, announced that they 
will stop offering some of the more popular and riskier subprime loan products, including those extended 
with limited or no documentation and those with low initial “teaser” rates.  Even before these 
announcements, issuance of subprime RMBS had slowed to a trickle in July—the right panel below.  
Reportedly, investors have sharply marked down their estimates of subprime RMBS issuance over the rest 
of the year.  With an estimated one million subprime borrowers facing substantial increases in mortgage 
payments before the end of the year as the teaser periods on their mortgages expire, the expected slowdown 
in subprime mortgage activity appears likely to put further upward pressure on delinquency and foreclosure 
rates.  
___________________ 
1 On June 29, 2007, the federal financial regulatory agencies issued their final statement on subprime mortgage lending to address issues relating 
to certain adjustable-rate mortgage products.

Recent Developments in Corporate Credit Markets 
 
The continued deterioration of the subprime mortgage sector appeared to prompt a substantial 
tightening in conditions in speculative-grade corporate credit markets over the intermeeting period.  
Even though delinquency rates on lower-quality corporate credits remained low, spreads on a traded 
index comprising 100 relatively liquid speculative-grade CDS on corporate names rose about 180 basis 
points, as investors reassessed business credit risk and pulled back from riskier assets.  Spreads on CDS 
and loan CDS (LCDS) were also reportedly boosted by elevated hedging demands from market 
participants with exposure to the large pipeline of leveraged deals.  In cash markets, spreads on a broad 
index of speculative-grade bonds increased less, but still widened about 110 basis points.  Average bid 
prices on leveraged loans (particularly on riskier covenant-lite and second-lien loans) declined notably.  
Investment-grade credit markets were significantly calmer; nonetheless, CDS and bond spreads in that 
sector rose between 30 and 40 basis points.  Both speculative- and investment-grade bond spreads are 
now at the top of their ranges over the past few years, but they are still below their highs posted earlier 
this decade.  Even so, investment-grade yields are little changed over the intermeeting period.  Judging 
from options on CDS, uncertainty about the future level of corporate spreads has spiked since late June.  
   
In addition to the large pipeline of leveraged deals, one factor that may have contributed to the 
widening of spreads is investors’ increased uncertainty regarding the valuation of structured products 
such as CLOs and CDOs, perhaps in reaction to the recent ratings downgrades of CDOs backed by 
subprime RMBS.  Spreads on the lower-rated tranches of such products have widened considerably of 
late, and issuance apparently slowed substantially in July.  Such adjustments, if they persist, could sharply
reduce the supply of funds to the leveraged loan market, as CLOs and CDOs reportedly hold a 
substantial fraction of all leveraged loans outstanding.  In addition, asset price moves may have been 
exacerbated at times during the intermeeting period by concerns regarding possible forced sales by 
investors facing substantial liquidity pressures.  
  
To date, the impact of tighter conditions in corporate credit markets has been concentrated in 
financings slated for LBOs.  A number of high-yield bond and leveraged loan issues that were intended 
to finance LBOs, some of which were quite large, were delayed or restructured over the intermeeting 
period, reportedly due to investor demands for tighter terms.  In some cases, underwriters have 
provided bridge loans to finance large deals that could not be sold to investors.  Overall, issuance of 
high-yield bonds and, reportedly, of leveraged loans has slowed sharply recently.  Financings of higher-
rated firms appeared little affected, though one investment-grade firm postponed a deal scheduled to 
take place on July 26 amid volatile market conditions.

was reportedly interpreted by market participants as suggesting that the Committee 

remained quite concerned about the upside risks to inflation.1  As a result, the 

anticipated path of monetary policy for the second half of 2008 increased a few basis 

points that day.  Policy expectations beyond the near term declined noticeably 

following the Chairman’s semiannual monetary policy testimony, reportedly in 

response to the downward revision to the FOMC’s central tendency projections for 

real GDP growth in 2007 and 2008.  The subsequent publication of the minutes of 

the June meeting elicited little market reaction.    

(5) Concerns about the potential macroeconomic implications of a more 

restrictive credit environment led investors to revise down the trajectory for the 

federal funds rate implied by futures contracts, including in the near term.  Futures 

quotes now imply about 30 percent odds of a 25 basis point easing in monetary policy 

by the September meeting and put the expected funds rate at the end of 2007 at 

around 5 percent (Chart 2).  Further out, policy expectations were lowered more; the 

expected policy rate at the end of 2008 fell about 35 basis points to a bit above 4½ 

percent.  In the Desk’s recent survey, however, primary dealers indicated that they 

anticipated little change in policy through the end of 2008, and their forecasts for 

GDP growth were about the same as at the time of the June meeting.  Option-implied 

measures of uncertainty around the expected path for policy widened considerably, 

and the implied distribution of future federal funds rates became more skewed toward 

the downside.    

(6) Yields on two- and ten-year nominal Treasury coupon securities declined 

around 30 basis points, on balance.  The drop in longer-term yields was concentrated 

in one-year forward rates two to three years ahead.  Term structure models attribute 

much of the decline to a reduction in term premiums, possibly indicating a heightened 
                                           
1 The effective federal funds rate averaged 5.26 percent over the intermeeting period.   
During the period, System holdings of Treasury securities were unchanged.  The volume of 
outstanding long-term RPs decreased by $1 billion, to $10 billion.

preference on the part of investors for the safety and liquidity of Treasuries.  

Measures of uncertainty about Treasury yields rose markedly over the period.  Despite 

a rise in the spot price of oil of more than $7 per barrel, TIPS yields moved down 

about in line with their nominal counterparts, leaving TIPS-based measures of 

inflation compensation little changed at both medium- and long-term maturities.  The 

Reuters-Michigan survey-based measure of short-term inflation expectations was 

unchanged, but the long-term measure increased slightly.   

(7) Foreign financial markets, especially in Europe, also were affected by 

heightened credit concerns.  The spread on the iTraxx Crossover index, a traded 

index of fifty of the most liquid CDS on mainly sub-investment-grade nonfinancial 

corporations in Europe, climbed about 165 basis points over the period to around 

400 basis points.  Amid noticeably higher volatility, share prices in most major foreign 

industrial countries dropped between 4 and 5 percent (Chart 3).  Yields on long-term 

sovereign securities in these countries fell 10 to 30 basis points, somewhat less than 

the declines recorded on comparable U.S. Treasury securities.  Policy expectations 

generally moved down less as well; market participants appeared to interpret the upset 

in financial markets as less likely to undermine foreign economic growth and thus less 

likely to prompt a monetary policy response abroad.  Worries about credit quality in 

U.S. markets weighed on the foreign exchange value of the dollar over much of the 

intermeeting period, but amid reports that many market participants were seeking to 

reduce risky positions late in the period, the dollar retraced some of its earlier declines.  

On balance, the dollar declined about 1¾ percent against a trade-weighted index of 

major foreign currencies.  Against individual currencies, the dollar fell about 3 percent 

against the yen, 1¾ percent versus the euro, and 1 percent versus the Canadian dollar.

During the period, the Bank of England and the Bank of Canada raised their policy 

interest rates 25 basis points.2   

(8) Financial markets in emerging market economies were affected unevenly by 

the bout of credit concerns in the United States and Europe.  In Mexico and Brazil, 

spreads on EMBI+ and CDS premiums on sovereign debt widened, and stock prices 

were little changed on balance.  In many Asian economies, by contrast, equity prices 

recorded strong net gains over the period, including a 12½ percent rise in Chinese 

stock prices.  The dollar moved down slightly over the intermeeting period versus an 

index of currencies of our other important trading partners.  A 1¼ percent 

appreciation of the dollar against the Mexican peso was more than offset by a nearly 

¾ percent depreciation versus the Chinese renminbi and small declines in the dollar’s 

value against many other emerging market currencies.  The People’s Bank of China 

increased its policy rate another 27 basis points in July and raised reserve requirements 

further.     

(9) Despite the heightened volatility, most financial markets around the globe 

generally functioned well over the intermeeting period.  In the United States, trading 

volumes in corporate CDS markets were reportedly very high but volumes in 

corporate bond markets were about normal; bid-asked spreads in both markets 

appeared to widen somewhat, especially in the market for single-name CDS.  Liquidity 

in subprime credit derivatives markets, including those for the ABX indexes, was 

reportedly poor, as most investors sought to buy credit protection.  Volumes were 

very high in equity and Treasury markets, but trading was reportedly orderly, with bid-

asked spreads in their usual ranges.  Liquidity premiums for on-the-run Treasury 

securities were little changed.  By contrast, in the interest-rate swap market, spreads 

                                           
2

over Treasuries increased substantially, and price movements were discontinuous at 

times, but on the whole the market continued to operate well.  Implied volatilities rose 

significantly in all markets.3  In foreign exchange markets for the major currency pairs, 

trading volumes were considerably elevated—especially for dollar-yen—but bid-asked 

spreads remained in normal ranges and trading was orderly.  In corporate markets, 

investment-grade bond issuance seemed to be little affected by the turmoil in other 

segments of the capital markets.  C&I loans overall appear to have expanded at a brisk 

pace during July, while commercial paper outstanding rose modestly.  Some 

speculative-grade corporate bonds were also issued last month, but, as mentioned 

above, a number of corporate financing deals, often related to LBOs and share 

repurchase programs, were postponed or restructured, and the outlook for deals 

planned for the next few weeks is unclear.  New issuance of CDOs, CLOs, and some 

types of subprime mortgage-backed securities dropped off sharply.  Both seasoned 

and initial public equity offerings continued at a moderate pace.   

(10) The debt of domestic nonfinancial sectors is estimated to have expanded at 

a 6¼ percent pace in the second quarter, a bit slower than in the first quarter and 

down substantially from 2006 (Chart 4).  This diminished growth trajectory is mainly 

attributable to an ongoing moderation in household mortgage debt stemming from 

the softening in house prices, higher mortgage rates, sluggish home sales, and tighter 

mortgage lending standards.  By contrast, growth of the debt of nonfinancial 

businesses is estimated to have picked up to about a 10¾ percent rate last quarter, 

supported by substantial bond issuance, hefty growth in C&I loans, and a rise in 

commercial paper outstanding; borrowing continued to be spurred by a large volume 

of merger and acquisition activity.    

                                           
3 The increases in various spreads and implied volatilities were rapid and highly correlated in 
recent weeks.  The recent movements in these measures are broadly comparable to those 
seen during the summer of 2002, a time when markets were roiled by several high-profile 
corporate defaults and scandals.

(11) M2 growth slowed to a modest 3 percent average annual rate over June and 

July, reflecting a sharp deceleration of liquid deposits following surprisingly strong 

growth earlier in the year.  Retail money funds continued to advance rapidly, while the 

expansion of small time deposits slowed.  Currency growth remained modest, as 

moderate expansion in domestic demand offset ongoing weakness in foreign demand.  

In the second quarter of 2007, the velocity of M2 declined for the fourth straight 

quarter, in part reflecting slightly narrower opportunity costs of holding M2.  

However, M2 continued to expand more rapidly than would be expected based on its 

historical relationship with income and opportunity costs.    

Economic Outlook through 2008 

(12) The Greenbook forecast continues to be predicated on the assumption that 

the federal funds rate will be held at 5¼ percent through 2008.  Longer-term yields 

are projected to climb about 25 basis points next year as investors’ policy expectations 

come into line with staff assumptions and term premiums rise.  Equity prices are 

expected to rise at a rate sufficient to generate risk-adjusted returns comparable to 

those on fixed-income investments, but from a starting point 5½ percent below that 

in the June Greenbook.  The trade-weighted foreign exchange value of the dollar is 

assumed to depreciate at roughly a 2 percent annual rate over the forecast period.  

The staff assumes that recent developments in financial markets will restrain growth 

in aggregate demand by about ¼ percentage point at an annual rate over the period, 

but significant uncertainty surrounds this assessment.   

(13) The staff’s forecasts for resource utilization and core inflation are nearly 

identical to those presented in the June Greenbook, although its projection for output 

growth is noticeably lower.  The annual revisions to the National Income and Product 

Account (NIPA) data released in July revealed somewhat less rapid output growth 

from 2004 through the first quarter of 2007 than shown by previous data, implying 

Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) Page 13 of 43



that productivity growth also was less rapid.  Accordingly, the staff lowered its 

estimate of potential GDP growth over the past few years and carried that adjustment 

forward.  Developments in financial markets in recent weeks, along with weaker-than-

expected housing indicators received during the intermeeting period, led the staff to 

trim its forecast for growth in demand for goods and services somewhat more than 

implied by the supply-side adjustments alone.  The staff now projects that real GDP 

will expand at an average rate just under 2 percent through 2008, somewhat below its 

revised estimate of 2.2 percent potential growth.  As in the June Greenbook, the 

unemployment rate edges up to 4¾ percent next spring and then levels out, remaining 

below 5 percent―the staff’s estimate of the NAIRU―throughout the forecast period. 

With regard to the price outlook, the staff again expects core PCE inflation to average 

a bit above 2 percent in the second half of 2007 and first half of 2008, and to edge 

down to 2 percent in the second half of 2008, reflecting well-anchored inflation 

expectations, a waning of feed-through from the recent run-up in energy and other 

commodity prices, and some easing of pressures on resource utilization.  The staff 

projects that total PCE inflation will slow from an average of nearly 4 percent in the 

first half of this year to slightly more than 2 percent in the second half as oil prices 

flatten out, and to just above 1¾ percent next year as oil prices start to edge down.  

As usual, the assumed path of oil prices follows futures prices. 

Update on Medium-Term Strategies 

(14) This section provides an update of the materials on medium-term strategies  

for monetary policy that were presented in the June Bluebook.  As shown in Chart 5,  

the Greenbook-consistent measure of short-run r* remains about in line with the 

actual real federal funds rate of 3.3 percent, reflecting the staff’s view that the current 

real funds rate will induce aggregate demand to grow a bit more slowly than potential

GDP, thereby closing the small positive output gap over the next twelve quarters.4   

In contrast, both the single-equation model and the FRB/US model imply estimates 

of about 2½ percent for short-run r*, fairly close to the average value of the real  

funds rate over the past few decades.  The small structural model yields an even  

lower estimate of about 1¾ percent, mainly because this model embeds the staff’s 

assessment of current potential GDP growth—which is a full percentage point below 

its historical average—but does not incorporate other offsetting factors such as the 

relatively high wealth-to-income ratio and ongoing real dollar depreciation. 

(15) Chart 6 depicts optimal control simulations of the FRB/US model using  

the staff’s extension of the Greenbook forecast beyond 2008.5  In these simulations, 

policymakers place equal weights on keeping core PCE inflation close to a specified 

goal, on keeping unemployment close to the long-run NAIRU, and on avoiding 

changes in the nominal funds rate.6  With an inflation goal of 2 percent (the right-

hand set of charts), optimal policy is nearly identical to that shown in the June 

Bluebook:  The funds rate path remains just above 5 percent through 2008 and  

then declines gradually to 4¼ percent by the end of 2012.  With an inflation goal  

of 1½ percent (the left-hand set of charts), the optimal path of the funds rate rises  

a notch less than in June—reaching a peak of about 6 percent in mid-2008—and  

then declines gradually to about 3¾ percent over the following half-decade.  For  

each inflation goal, the outcomes for unemployment and core inflation are broadly 

unchanged from June. 

                                           
4 The actual real funds rate is constructed as the current nominal rate less the average core 
PCE inflation rate over the past year. 
5 The characteristics of the extension are described in the memo to the Committee  
by Rochelle Edge, “The Extended Greenbook Forecast,” August 2, 2007. 
6  In conducting these simulations, policymakers and participants in financial markets are 
assumed to understand fully the forces shaping the economic outlook (as summarized by  
the extended Greenbook projection), whereas households and firms form their expectations 
using more limited information.

(16) As shown in Chart 7, the outcome-based policy rule prescribes a funds rate 

path that remains close to 5 percent through the remainder of the decade and  

then declines to about 4¼ percent by the end of 2012, whereas forward contracts  

indicate that financial market participants expect the funds rate to decline to about  

4½ percent by late 2008 and then rise gradually to a plateau of about 5 percent.  

Confidence intervals derived from interest rate caps exhibit somewhat greater 

downward skewness than in the June Bluebook, and the upper bounds of these 

intervals are noticeably lower than those implied by stochastic simulations of the 

FRB/US model, especially over the next two years or so.  The simple policy rules 

proposed by Taylor (1993, 1999)—as well as a variant of the Taylor (1999) rule with  

a higher intercept—prescribe current settings of the funds rate that are about 10 to  

20 basis points higher than in June, reflecting the modest upward revision in the 

staff’s estimate of the current level of the output gap.  By contrast, the first-difference 

rule does not involve the staff’s assessment of the current level of the output gap  

but instead responds to the projected one-year change in the output gap at a  

three-quarter forecast horizon; this rule’s current prescriptions are a notch lower  

than in the June Bluebook, mainly because the output gap is now expected to decline 

a bit more quickly. 

Short-Run Policy Alternatives 

(17) This Bluebook presents three options, summarized in Table 1, for the 

Committee’s consideration.  Alternative A would lower the target federal funds rate 

25 basis points to 5 percent.  Alternative B would maintain the target for the federal 

funds rate at 5¼ percent.  Alternative C envisions raising the target to 5½ percent.  

The draft language to characterize recent information on economic activity differs 

across the three options:  Alternatives A and B refer explicitly or implicitly to recent 

moderate economic expansion, while Alternative C emphasizes the second-quarter

Overall economic activity seems likely 
to continue to expand at a moderate

increased weakness in the housing 
sector, along with reduced availability 
and higher cost of credit to some 
households and businesses, has raised 
the risk that economic activity might 
grow less than anticipated. 

Economic growth was moderate 
during the first half of this year.  The 
adjustment in the housing sector is 
continuing, and credit conditions have 
become tighter for some households

Economic growth picked up in the 
second quarter.  The economy seems

moderation in inflation pressures 
has yet to be convincingly 
demonstrated.  Moreover, the high 
level of resource utilization has the 
potential to sustain those

Assessment 
of Risk 

4. In these circumstances, the 
Committee’s predominant policy 
concern remains the risk that 
inflation will fail to moderate as 
expected.  Future policy 
adjustments will depend on the 
evolution of the outlook for both 
inflation and economic growth, as 
implied by incoming information. 

After this action, the Committee 
judges that the downside risk to 
economic growth is roughly balanced 
by the upside risk to inflation.  Future 
policy adjustments will depend on the 
evolution of the outlook for both 
inflation and economic growth, as 
implied by incoming information.

rebound.  All three alternatives reiterate the view that the economy is likely to expand 

at a moderate rate in coming quarters.  With regard to recent financial developments, 

Alternative A cites tighter credit conditions for some borrowers as a source of greater 

downside risk to growth, Alternative B notes the change in credit conditions without 

explicitly stating that it is a cause of increased risk, and Alternative C is silent.  Data 

received during the intermeeting period confirmed that core inflation has been fairly 

low in recent months but also indicate that core inflation has not extended the decline 

that occurred earlier.  Accordingly, all the alternatives refer to “relatively subdued” 

readings on core inflation in recent months rather than repeating the June language 

that core inflation “improved modestly in recent months.”  The alternatives differ in 

their assessment of the severity of the upside risks to the outlook for inflation.  As 

always, the Committee could combine elements from different alternatives.  

(18) If the Committee continues to view the current stance of policy as likely to 

foster sustainable growth and an acceptable trajectory for inflation, then it may wish 

to choose Alternative B, under which its target for the federal funds rate would 

remain at 5¼ percent for the time being.  The real federal funds rate is close to its 

Greenbook-consistent equilibrium value (Chart 5), supporting a view that the current 

stance of policy is likely to promote a gradual easing of pressures on resources.  

Additionally, the current target for the funds rate remains close to prescriptions for 

near-term policy obtained from optimal policy simulations with a 2 percent inflation 

goal (Chart 6) and some of the policy rules shown in Chart 7.  The Committee might 

agree with the staff’s assessment that recent developments in financial markets are 

unlikely to impose substantial restraint on aggregate demand, given that credit remains 

readily available to most households and businesses.  The Committee might also agree 

with the staff’s view that, after a relatively brief interruption as the markets reassess 

credit risk, normal flows of credit probably will resume, though with risk spreads 

above the unusually low levels seen in the past few years.  Even if the Committee is 

Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) Page 21 of 43



less sanguine than the staff, members might decide that more concrete information 

about the economic effect of less readily available credit would be needed to warrant a 

change in the stance of monetary policy.  Moreover, the Committee might judge that 

maintaining its current policy stance would provide a reasonable weighting of the risks 

to its dual objectives:  On the one hand, weakness in housing and strains in credit 

markets could have a more pronounced effect on overall economic activity than 

foreseen in the staff forecast; on the other, the moderation in inflation may not be 

sustained.     

(19) The draft statement for Alternative B reiterates the view that the economy is 

likely to continue expanding at a moderate pace over coming quarters.  However, by 

citing tighter credit conditions for some households and businesses, it also suggests 

somewhat greater downside risk to growth.  The draft acknowledges recent favorable 

readings on core inflation, characterizing them as “relatively subdued.”  At the same 

time, it points to continued upside inflation risk by repeating language from the June 

statement that “a sustained moderation in inflation pressures has yet to be 

convincingly demonstrated” and that “the high level of resource utilization has the 

potential to sustain those pressures.”  Even if members judge that downside risks to 

growth have increased in recent weeks and that upside risks to inflation have 

diminished, they may still see the risks as unbalanced and thus want to indicate that 

the Committee’s predominant policy concern remains the risk that inflation will fail to 

moderate as expected.  Taken as a whole, the language in Alternative B is slightly 

softer than the June statement, but it also suggests that the Committee does not 

expect the less accommodative conditions in credit markets to have a significant 

adverse effect on the economic expansion. 

(20) Market participants see substantial odds of an easing of monetary policy in 

coming months but little chance of a rate cut at this meeting.  In responding to the 

Desk’s survey, most primary dealers said they expect no more than minor 

Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) Page 22 of 43



modifications to the text of the accompanying statement, although one-third indicated 

they expect the Committee to mention deteriorating financial conditions.  Alternative 

B seems generally consistent with those expectations, so a sizable market reaction to a 

statement such as that suggested in Alternative B appears unlikely.  But markets might 

interpret the reference to tighter credit conditions for some households and 

businesses as a first step toward a possible easing, in which case the perceived 

probability of a rate cut in September would increase.  

(21) The Committee might instead view recent data and developments as 

indicating that the balance of risks has shifted enough to warrant cutting the target 

federal funds rate by 25 basis points, as in Alternative A.  The housing market 

appears to be weakening further, indicators of private spending outside of the housing 

sector have been mixed of late, and credit spreads have widened—perhaps suggesting 

that downside risks to growth have increased.  Moreover, members might be 

concerned that recent financial strains could intensify, further reducing the availability 

of credit to households and businesses and weakening consumer and investment 

spending, as in the “Greater housing correction with spillovers to confidence and 

financial markets” scenario in the Greenbook.  At the same time, recent subdued 

readings on core inflation may have increased the Committee’s confidence that 

inflation pressures are gradually ebbing.  Furthermore, with growth in labor 

compensation remaining moderate, the Committee might think that the equilibrium 

unemployment rate could be lower than currently estimated by the staff, as in the 

“Lower NAIRU” Greenbook alternative scenario, suggesting that core inflation could 

decline a bit more than in the staff forecast.  In these circumstances, the Committee 

may judge that a slightly lower federal funds rate would more appropriately balance 

the increased risk of sluggish economic growth against the reduced upside risk to 

inflation.   

Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) Page 23 of 43



(22) The draft statement in Alternative A continues to note that the economy 

seems likely to expand at a moderate pace, but it also explicitly recognizes that greater 

weakness in the housing sector and the diminished availability and higher cost of 

credit to riskier borrowers have raised the odds that the economy will grow less than 

expected.  In the inflation paragraph, the draft language not only indicates that core 

inflation has been subdued in recent months, it also states that core inflation “is 

expected to be moderate over coming quarters” rather than repeating the view that “a 

sustained moderation in inflation pressures has yet to be convincingly demonstrated.”  

But the statement would continue to indicate that the high level of resource utilization 

poses an upside risk to inflation.  The statement could conclude by noting that, after  

the 25 basis point easing, the Committee views the downside risk to growth as roughly 

balanced by the upside risk to inflation.  Such an assessment would imply that the 

Committee does not see the easing as likely to be the first of a sequence of moves. 

(23) Although market participants think policy is likely to be eased in coming 

months, they would be quite surprised by a rate cut at this meeting, and shorter-term 

Treasury yields could decline somewhat.  Investors may be so worried about credit 

exposures and downside risks to growth that they might interpret a rate cut and the 

statement’s reference to tighter credit conditions as signaling that the Federal Reserve 

is quite concerned about financial strains and their implications for the economy.  If 

so, credit spreads might continue to widen, equity prices might fall, and investors 

might anticipate further policy easing, causing medium-term Treasury yields to drop 

more than shorter-term yields.  However, the statement’s relatively upbeat assessment 

of growth prospects, and the implication that the Committee judges that the risk of 

adverse macroeconomic consequences stemming from recent developments in credit 

markets can be adequately mitigated by a modest rate cut, might reassure investors.  If 

so, credit spreads might narrow and equity prices might increase.   

Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) Page 24 of 43



(24) Even if the Committee does not believe that a policy easing is warranted at 

this meeting, it might judge, in light of the further weakening of the housing sector 

and the recent deterioration in financial conditions, that downside risks to growth 

have increased appreciably.  And given the continued subdued readings on core 

inflation and moderate wage growth, the Committee might also see the upside risks to 

inflation as having diminished slightly in recent weeks.  If the Committee judges that 

the downside risks to growth and the upside risks to inflation are now roughly 

balanced, it might wish to leave the stance of policy unchanged at this meeting but 

release a statement that combines the Alternative A language on real activity (A.2) 

with the Alternative B language on inflation (B.3) and the balanced risk assessment of 

Alternative A (A.4)—of course, it would be necessary to drop the phrase, “After this 

action.”  Investors likely would conclude from such a statement that the Federal 

Reserve now sees significant downside risks to growth and is preparing to ease.  

Yields on Treasury securities likely would decline.  If investors found the prospect of 

an early easing reassuring, credit spreads could narrow and equity prices could rise.  

But credit spreads could widen and equity prices could fall if the statement’s explicit 

recognition of downside risks to growth were to make investors more worried about 

the outlook.   

(25) Although recent readings on core inflation have been subdued, overall 

inflation has been elevated, boosted by increases in the prices of oil and other 

commodities.  Members may be concerned that high headline inflation might soon 

begin to boost inflation expectations, augmenting the upward pressure on core 

inflation that is already emanating from the pass-through effects of higher energy and 

commodity prices and perhaps from relatively tight labor and product markets.  If so, 

the Committee might prefer to raise the funds rate 25 basis points at this meeting, as 

in Alternative C.  Even under the baseline outlook, the optimal policy path shown in 

Chart 6 indicates that policy would need to be tightened about 1 percentage point 

Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) Page 25 of 43



over the next year should the Committee wish to bring core inflation down to 1½ 

percent.  Moreover, members might interpret the fairly strong rebound in second-

quarter real GDP growth and the solid job gains seen through the spring as 

indications that there could be greater strength in aggregate demand going forward 

than suggested in the staff forecast.  Another possible reason for expecting greater 

strength in aggregate demand is that the NIPA revisions revealed that the personal 

saving rate has been higher than previously estimated, perhaps suggesting, as in the 

“Flat saving rate” alternative in the Greenbook, that households feel less need to 

restrain growth in spending than envisioned in the staff forecast.  If members expect 

stronger growth in aggregate demand than projected in the Greenbook, they may be 

concerned that pressures on resource utilization will intensify—especially if they share 

the staff’s view that the revised GDP data indicate that trend productivity growth and 

the economy’s sustainable growth rate are lower than previously estimated.   

(26) The statement accompanying Alternative C could reiterate the assessment 

that the economy seems likely to expand at a moderate pace, but reorder the clauses 

to underscore the view that the adjustment in the housing sector appears unlikely to 

derail the economic expansion.  It could also point to the rebound in growth in the 

second quarter rather than to moderate growth in the first half.  The inflation 

paragraph could note the subdued readings on core inflation in recent months but 

repeat June’s message that a few months of good inflation news does not convincingly 

demonstrate a sustained moderation in inflation pressures.  The statement could also 

point to the elevated level of overall inflation, in effect providing an additional 

rationale for the Committee’s policy decision.  The statement could conclude by 

noting that, even after the increase in the funds rate, the Committee’s predominant 

policy concern remains the upside risk to inflation. 

(27) A tightening of monetary policy at this meeting would come as a complete 

surprise to market participants.  Shorter-term market interest rates would rise, but 

Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) Page 26 of 43



forward yields could fall as the announcement likely would lower investors’ outlook 

for medium-term inflation and economic growth.  The net effect on longer-term 

Treasury yields is thus ambiguous.  The foreign exchange value of the dollar would 

probably appreciate, spreads on private credit obligations likely would widen, and 

equity prices likely would decline.  Given the apparent reduction in investors’ appetite 

for risky assets in recent weeks, and the large movements in asset prices in response to 

news that suggested greater downside risk, the market reaction to a tightening move at 

this time could well be unusually sharp. 

Money and Debt Forecasts 

(28) Under the Greenbook forecast, M2 is projected to expand about 

5¼ percent this year and 4½ percent next year.  Those growth rates are about ¼ 

percentage point slower than in the June forecast, reflecting the downward revision in 

the Greenbook forecast for nominal GDP growth.  Opportunity costs of holding 

money are expected to edge down further over the remainder of this year, as deposit 

rates continue to catch up with earlier increases in short-term interest rates, and 

accordingly M2 grows a bit faster than nominal GDP.   

(29) Growth of domestic nonfinancial sector debt is projected to slow from 

8 percent in 2006 to 6½ percent this year and about 5¼ percent in 2008.  These 

projections are a shade below those in the June forecast, primarily reflecting the 

downward revisions to residential investment and business fixed investment in the 

staff forecast.  Growth of household debt is projected to slow from 8¾ percent 

during 2006 to 5¼ percent in 2007 and 4½ percent in 2008.  Flat house prices, higher 

mortgage rates, and tighter credit standards all are expected to contribute to slower 

growth of mortgage debt this year and next.  As in June, the staff predicts that 

corporate borrowing will slow in the second half of this year, as the pace of funding 

for merger and acquisition activity and share repurchases moves down from its recent

elevated level.  Even so, corporate debt is projected to rise at an average 6½ percent 

annual rate over the forecast period, as companies are anticipated to rely less on 

profits and more on credit markets to finance moderate growth in capital 

expenditures.  The staff projects that higher credit spreads will have some restraining 

effect on growth in corporate debt, and that recent turmoil in financial markets will 

result in some debt issuance being postponed to later this year, but it does not expect 

these developments to hold back business investment appreciably.

Directive and Balance of  Risks Statement 

Draft language for the directive and draft risk assessments identical to those presented 

in Table 1 are provided below. 

Directive Wording 
The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and financial 

conditions that will foster price stability and promote sustainable growth 

in output.  To further its long-run objectives, the Committee in the 

immediate future seeks conditions in reserve markets consistent with 

maintaining/INCREASING/REDUCING the federal funds rate at/TO 

an average of around ________ 5¼ percent. 

Risk Assessments  

 A.   After this action, the Committee judges that the downside risk to 

economic growth is roughly balanced by the upside risk to inflation.    

Future policy adjustments will depend on the evolution of the outlook 

for both inflation and economic growth, as implied by incoming 

information.  

 B.   In these circumstances, the Committee’s predominant policy concern 

remains the risk that inflation will fail to moderate as expected.  Future 

policy adjustments will depend on the evolution of the outlook for both 

inflation and economic growth, as implied by incoming information. 

 C.   Even after this action, the Committee’s predominant policy concern 

remains the risk that inflation will fail to moderate as expected.  Future 

policy adjustments will depend on the evolution of the outlook for both 

inflation and economic growth, as implied by incoming information.

Appendix A: Measures of the Equilibrium Real Rate 
 

The equilibrium real rate is the real federal funds rate that, if maintained, would be projected to return 
output to its potential level over time.  The short-run equilibrium rate is defined as the rate that would 
close the output gap in twelve quarters given the corresponding model’s projection of the economy.   
The medium-run concept is the value of the real federal funds rate projected to keep output at potential 
in seven years, under the assumption that monetary policy acts to bring actual and potential output into 
line in the short run and then keeps them equal thereafter.  The TIPS-based factor model measure 
provides an estimate of market expectations for the real federal funds rate seven years ahead.  
 
The actual real federal funds rate is constructed as the difference between the nominal rate and realized 
inflation, where the nominal rate is measured as the quarterly average of the observed federal funds rate, 
and realized inflation is given by the log difference between the core PCE price index and its lagged 
value four quarters earlier.  For the current quarter, the nominal rate is specified as the target federal 
funds rate on the Bluebook publication date.  For the current quarter and the previous quarter, the 
inflation rate is computed using the staff’s estimate of the core PCE price index. 
 
Confidence intervals reflect uncertainties about model specification, coefficients, and the level of 
potential output.  The final column of the table indicates the values published in the previous Bluebook. 
  

Measure Description 

Single-equation 
Model  

The measure of the equilibrium real rate in the single-equation model is based on an 
estimated aggregate-demand relationship between the current value of the output gap and 
its lagged values as well as the lagged values of the real federal funds rate. 

Small Structural 
Model 

The small-scale model of the economy consists of equations for five variables: the output 
gap, the equity premium, the federal budget surplus, the trend growth rate of output, and 
the real bond yield. 

Large Model 
(FRB/US) 

Estimates of the equilibrium real rate using FRB/US—the staff’s large-scale econometric 
model of the U.S. economy—depend on a very broad array of economic factors, some of 
which take the form of projected values of the model’s exogenous variables. 

Greenbook-
consistent  

The FRB/US model is used in conjunction with an extended version of the Greenbook 
forecast to derive a Greenbook-consistent measure.  FRB/US is first add-factored so that 
its simulation matches the extended Greenbook forecast, and then a second simulation is 
run off this baseline to determine the value of the real federal funds rate that closes the 
output gap. 

TIPS-based 
Factor Model 

Yields on TIPS (Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities) reflect investors’ expectations of 
the future path of real interest rates, but also include term and liquidity premiums.  The 
TIPS-based measure of the equilibrium real rate is constructed using the seven-year-ahead 
instantaneous real forward rate derived from TIPS yields as of the Bluebook publication 
date.  This forward rate is adjusted to remove estimates of the term and liquidity 
premiums based on a three-factor arbitrage-free term-structure model applied to TIPS 
yields, nominal yields, and inflation.  Because TIPS indexation is based on the total CPI, 
this measure is also adjusted for the medium-term difference—projected at 40 basis 
points—between total CPI inflation and core PCE inflation.

Appendix B: Analysis of Policy Paths and Confidence Intervals 
 

Rule Specifications:  For the following rules, it denotes the federal funds rate for quarter t, while  
the explanatory variables include the staff’s projection of trailing four-quarter core PCE inflation (πt), 
inflation two and three quarters ahead (πt+2|t and πt+3|t), the output gap in the current period and one 
quarter ahead ( *t ty y−  and *1| 1|t t t ty y+ +− ), and the three-quarter-ahead forecast of annual average GDP 
growth relative to potential ( 4 4 *3| 3|t t t ty y+ +Δ − Δ ), and *π  denotes an assumed value of policymakers’ 
long-run inflation objective.  The outcome-based and forecast-based rules were estimated using real-
time data over the sample 1988:1-2006:4; each specification was chosen using the Bayesian information 
criterion. Each rule incorporates a 75 basis point shift in the intercept, specified as a sequence of  
25 basis point increments during the first three quarters of 1998.  The first two simple rules were 
proposed by Taylor (1993, 1999), while the third is a variant of the Taylor (1999) rule—introduced  
in the August Bluebook—with a higher value of r*.  The prescriptions of the first-difference rule do  
not depend on assumptions regarding r* or the level of the output gap; see Orphanides (2003). 
 

Outcome-based rule it =  1.20it-1–0.39it-2+0.19[1.17  + 1.73 πt  + 3.66( *t ty y− )  – 2.72( *1 1t ty y− −− )]

Forecast-based rule it =  1.18it-1–0.38it-2+0.20[0.98 +1.72 πt+2|t+2.29( *1| 1|t t t ty y+ +− )–1.37( *1 1t ty y− −− )]

Taylor (1993) rule it = 2 + πt + 0.5(πt – *π ) + 0.5( *t ty y− ) 

Taylor (1999) rule it = 2 + πt + 0.5(πt – *π ) + ( *t ty y− ) 

Taylor (1999) rule     
with higher r* 

it = 2.75 + πt + 0.5(πt – *π ) + ( *t ty y− )  

First-difference rule it = it-1 + 0.5(πt+3|t – *π ) + 0.5( 4 4 *3| 3|t t t ty y+ +Δ − Δ ) 
 
FRB/US Model Simulations:  Prescriptions from the two empirical rules are computed using dynamic 
simulations of the FRB/US model, implemented as though the rule were followed starting at this FOMC 
meeting.  The dotted line labeled “Previous Bluebook” is based on the current specification of the policy 
rule, applied to the previous Greenbook projection.  Confidence intervals are based on stochastic 
simulations of the FRB/US model with shocks drawn from the estimated residuals over 1986-2005.  
Information from Financial Markets:  The expected funds rate path is based on forward rate 
agreements, and the confidence intervals for this path are constructed using prices of interest rate caps. 
Near-Term Prescriptions of Simple Policy Rules:  These prescriptions are calculated using Greenbook 
projections for inflation and the output gap. Because the first-difference rule involves the lagged funds 
rate, the value labeled “Previous Bluebook” for the current quarter is computed using the actual value  
of the lagged funds rate, and the one-quarter-ahead prescriptions are based on this rule’s prescription for 
the current quarter.

Inflation Indicator Based on M2

Note: P* is defined to equal M2 times V* divided by potential GDP. V*, or long-run velocity, is estimated
using average velocity over the 1959:Q1-to-1989:Q4 period and then, after a break, over the interval from
1993:Q1 to the present. For the forecast period, P* is based on the staff M2 forecast and P is simulated using a
short-run dynamic model relating P to P*. Blue areas indicate periods in which P* is notably less than P.
Gray areas denote the projection period.
