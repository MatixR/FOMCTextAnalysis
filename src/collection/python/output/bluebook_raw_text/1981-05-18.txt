Prefatory Note 

 
 

The attached document represents the most complete and accurate version 
available based on original copies culled from the files of the FOMC Secretariat at the 
Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System.  This electronic document was 
created through a comprehensive digitization process which included identifying the best-
preserved paper copies, scanning those copies,1 and then making the scanned versions 
text-searchable.2  Though a stringent quality assurance process was employed, some 
imperfections may remain. 
 

Please note that this document may contain occasional gaps in the text.  These 
gaps are the result of a redaction process that removed information obtained on a 
confidential basis.  All redacted passages are exempt from disclosure under applicable 
provisions of the Freedom of Information Act.    

 

                                                 
1 In some cases, original copies needed to be photocopied before being scanned into electronic format.  All 
scanned images were deskewed (to remove the effects of printer- and scanner-introduced tilting) and lightly 
cleaned (to remove dark spots caused by staple holes, hole punches, and other blemishes caused after initial 
printing). 
2 A two-step process was used.  An advanced optimal character recognition computer program (OCR) first 
created electronic text from the document image.  Where the OCR results were inconclusive, staff checked 
and corrected the text as necessary.   Please note that the numbers and text in charts and tables were not 
reliably recognized by the OCR process and were not checked or corrected by staff.

Recent developments

(1) Adjusted for estimated shifts of funds from nontransactions

to NOW accounts, growth in M-1B accelerated in April to about a 14 percent

annual rate.1/ To some extent, this pick-up in M-l growth may reflect

a realignment in the public's stock of money holdings toward more

normal relationships with income and interest rates following the near-

record increase in velocity earlier this year. Growth of M-lB in April

was substantially more rapid than the pace implicit in the Committee's

5 percent target for the March to June period. Even so, given the weak

performance of M-1B in the winter, the level of M-1B in April was well

within the Committee's longer-run range--about at the midpoint. Growth

of M-2 remained relatively rapid last month, and its level continued to

be above the upper end of its longer-run range. Growth in the nontrans-

action component of M-2 slowed markedly, however. The total of savings

and small time deposits did not expand in April, and MMMF growth slowed

as market rates rose substantially above average MMMF yields around mid-

month. M-3 in April expanded at almost a 10 percent rate, and its level

remains above the upper end of the Committee's longer-run range.

(2) Nonborrowed reserves declined sharply in April, as banks

were forced to borrow more to meet their reserve needs; they also reduced

their excess reserves by a sizable amount. By the statement weeks ending

April 29 and May 6 average borrowings had increased to the $2.3 to $2.5

billion area, and the funds rate had moved higher--by late April and early

May tending to exceed the upper end of the 13 to 18 percent range for

consultation adopted at the March meeting. After consultation in early

May, the Committee agreed to adhere to the previously adopted money

targets, recognizing that the federal funds rate would probably fluctuate

above the upper limit of the funds rate range.1 / Most recently, the rate

has been in the 18 to 19 percent area. The basic discount rate and the

surcharge were raised 1 percentage point each, effective May 5.

term market rates generally rose sharply over the intermeeting period.

While still below their December highs, Treasury bill rates have increased

2 3/4 to 4 percentage points since the March FOMC meeting, and rates on

private money market obligations have risen by even larger amounts. The

bank prime rate was raised in steps from 17 percent at the end of March

to 19 percent, but these increases lagged the rising commercial paper

and Eurodollar rates, contributing to a shift of credit demands toward

U.S. offices of large banks in late April and early May.

(4) Treasury and corporate bond yields have risen about 1

percentage point since late March to record levels. Despite the increase

in longer-term yields, and an increase in the number of postponements,

public offerings of corporate and municipal notes and bonds have remained

relatively large. The Treasury has raised about $8 billion in note and

bond sales, including around $2 billion in its recently completed quarterly

refunding auctions. The average commitment rate on primary conventional

mortgages at S&Ls increased to more than 16 percent in the intermeeting

period.

(5) Since the last FOMC meeting, the dollar has risen against

all major currencies, increasing on a weighted-average basis by 9 percent

to the highest level since late 1977.

U.S. authorities have not been

in the market. The dollar's strength over this period primarily reflected

the sharp rise in U.S. interest rates.

(6) The table on the next page shows seasonally adjusted annual

rates of change, in percent, for selected monetary and financial flows

over various time periods. M-1A and M-lB data in parentheses are not

Prospective developments

(7) Shown below for Committee consideration are three alternative

policy strategies for the current quarter. The upper panel of the table

shows growth rates for the two-month April to June period, and the lower

panel gives consistent growth rates for the March to June interval covered by

the Committee's short-run target adopted at the last meeting. The M-1B

growth targets abstract from the estimated impact of nationwide NOW

accounts, as do the Committee's longer-run targets.1/ (More detailed

and longer-run data for the aggregates, on both an adjusted and unadjusted

basis, including those for M-1A, are shown in the tables on pp. 6 and 7.)

The last line of the table indicates federal funds rate ranges thought

by the staff to be consistent with the three alternatives.

Alt. A Alt. B Alt. C

Growth from April to June

M-1B 7¾ 6½ 5½
M-2 9 8¼ 7½

Intermeeting federal funds
rate range 15 to 20 16 to 21 17 to 22

1/ The estimated portion of NOW growth coming from demand deposits is 72.5
percent in March and April. This ratio for April is slightly higher
than earlier expected. With no evidence of a drop in the ratio for
the past three months, as noted in appendix IV, the staff has assumed
that the ratio will remain between 70 and 75 percent over the balance of
the year. In addition to more of the increase in NOW accounts coming
out of demand deposits, the total increase in NOW accounts thus far
this year is proceeding at a faster pace than had been assumed when the
Committee set its long-run target for 1981 in February. At that time,
the observed increase in M-1B consistent with the shift-adjusted M-1B
target for the year of 3 to 6 percent was expected to be 6 to 8½ per-
cent (assuming an increase above trend in NOW related accounts of about
$40 billion, close to the increase that has already occurred). We would
now estimate that the longer-run range for observed M-1B may have to be
increased by about 1 percentage point to 7 to 9½ percent for 1981 (with
an increase in NOW and related accounts for the year of about $55
billion). The consistent observed M-1A range will probably be reduced

by about 2 percentage points to a range of -7 to -4 percent for 1981.

(8) Alternative C is based on continuation of the 5 percent

annual rate of growth for M-1B over the March to June period targeted by

the Committee at its last meeting--a growth rate which, as shown in

chart 1, would result in a June level about at the lower end of the

Committee's longer-run range. To achieve this short-run target would

require growth of narrow money at a 1¼ percent annual rate on average in

May and June, with June probably needing to show a contraction in the

outstanding level of money.

(9) Given the sharp rise of M-1B in April the Committee may

wish to consider alternatives that in effect avoid squeezing out all of

the excess April growth over the balance of the quarter. Alternative A

targets M-1B growth in May and June at the 4¾ percent midpoint of its

longer-run range, a rate of growth that would keep the level of M-1B

just below its midpoint by June. Alternative B calls for a growth rate

of 3 percent over the two months, which would bring the level of M-1B well

into the lower half of its range by June.

(10) All of the alternatives contemplate slower growth in M-2

than expected at the time of the Committee's previous meeting, when a

March to June M-2 target of 10 percent was considered acceptable.

We would now expect growth of M-2 at about a 7 to 8 percent annual rate

over the March-June period for alternative C. Somewhat higher growth

rates would be expected under alternatives A and B. The slower

March-June growth projected for M-2 essentially reflects the unexpectedly

sharp deceleration recently in growth of its nontransactions component,

including both small time and savings deposits and money market funds.

Money market fund growth is expected to remain weak over the near-term,

and particularly so if market interest rates rise and thereby temporarily



-9-

widen their spread over MMMF yields. As shown in chart 2, the level of M-2

in June would be at the upper bound of its longer-run range for the year

under alternative C, while it would remain somewhat above the range under

the other two alternatives.

(11) The projected slowing of real and nominal GNP this quarter,

as well as the recent increases in interest rates, should tend to retard

narrow money growth from the extremely rapid April pace. However, money

demand may remain fairly strong, and interest rates under upward pressure,

unless the economy is considerably weaker than the staff now anticipates

or unless the current level of interest rates induces another shift to

more intensive cash management. Even under alternative A--which involves

growth in total reserves from April to June at an 8 percent annual rate--

the federal funds rate seems likely to remain in a 17 to 20 percent range

over the balance of the quarter.1/ Assuming the present discount rate

structure, adjustment borrowing would probably be around $1 to $2 billion.

Continued high long-term rates may tend to induce firms to focus their

growing credit demands on banks and other sources of short-term credit

over the near term--although the limited flexibility of many borrowers

and a desire to stem the deterioration of balance sheets likely will

maintain bond issuance at a high level.

(12) Alternatives B and C would call for a growth in total

reserves over the April to June period at annual rates of 6 and 4 percent,

respectively. A federal funds rate around 20 percent or a bit higher is

1/ Projections of federal funds rates for the year 1981 under all three
alternatives are shown in appendix II.



-10-

likely to emerge over the next few weeks under alternative B, while the

funds rate under C could rise further. Given current discount rates,

borrowing at the discount window might rise to around the $2 billion

area under alternative B and to around $3 billion under alternative C.

Of course, any increase in the present discount rate level and structure

would work to reduce the demand for borrowing. Other short-term rates

would probably rise substantially further under these alternatives, with

upward pressures particularly intense under alternative C. Long-term

interest rates would also rise further over the weeks ahead, probably

inducing a large volume of postponements and cancellations of bond

financings.

(14) The outlook for interest rates under all three alternatives

suggests continued weakness in mortgage demands and also intense earnings

pressures on thrift institutions, with alternative C implying a higher

probability of a number of failures this summer. Moreover, with their

deposit flows weak--and less than they may have anticipated--some institu-

tions may find it necessary to draw down their stock of liquid assets.

Although the new mortgage instruments recently approved by the FHLBB are

likely to be translated into an increased willingness of thrifts to make

mortgage loans, their impact on interest income will be modest for some

time.



-11-

Directive language

(15) Given below is a suggested operational paragraph for

the directive consistent with the form of the directives adopted at

recent meetings. The specifications adopted at the meeting on March 31

are shown in strike-through form.

In the short run the Committee seeks behavior of reserve

aggregates consistent with A SUBSTANTIAL DECELERATION OF growth in

M-1B from [DEL: March] APRIL to June [DEL: at] TO an annual rate of [DEL: 5½] ____ percent

[DEL: or somewhat less,] after allowance for the impact of flows into NOW

accounts, and WITH growth in M-2 at an annual rate of about [DEL: 10½]

____ percent. It is recognized that shifts into NOW accounts will

continue to distort measured growth in M-1B to an unpredictable

extent, and operational reserve paths will be developed in the

light of evaluation of those distortions. If it appears during the

period before the next meeting that fluctuations in the federal

funds rate, taken over a period of time, within a range of [DEL: 13] ____

to [DEL: 18] ____ percent are likely to be inconsistent with the monetary

and related reserve paths, the Manager for Domestic Operations is

promptly to notify the Chairman, who will then decide whether the

situation calls for supplementary instructions from the Committee.

APPENDIX III

NEW SEASONAL ADJUSTMENT PROCEDURE

Seasonal adjustment factors for the monetary aggregates recently

were updated on the basis of data available through 1980. In the process,

other checkable deposits (OCD) were put on a seasonally adjusted basis

for the first time.1 In calculating the new seasonal factors, observa-

tions for several components over the spring and summer of 1980 were pre-

adjusted by a time series modeling technique to eliminate the effect of

the unusual-and likely nonrecurrent--patterns of deposit flows that ac-

companied the imposition and subsequent removal of the Special Credit Re-

straint Program.2

Revised seasonally adjusted M1-B in 1981 is constructed by adding

the following seasonally adjusted components: currency; the sum of de-

mand deposits and of OCD (apart from trend growth) estimated to have

3
been shifted or diverted from demand deposits; OCD (apart from trend

growth) estimated to have come from sources other than demand deposits;

and a relatively small trend growth in OCD, amounting to an increase of

1. The new seasonal factors were published as appendix tables to the H.6
Federal Reserve statistical release on May 1, 1981.
2. A preadjustment technique also was applied to the demand deposit com-
ponent of M1-A to remove the distortions in early 1979 caused by the in-
troduction of ATS nationwide and NOW accounts in New York State.
3. Based on information currently available from a number of sources--
such as samples of depository institutions and households and econometric
cross-section analysis--the share of not seasonally adjusted OCD growth
apart from trend since the beginning of the year attributable to demand
deposits is estimated to be: about 75 to 80 percent in January, and 70
to 75 percent in February, March, and April.

$200 million per month in the first several months of the year. Trend

growth represents the expansion in OCD balances associated with accounts

in existence prior to the nationwide extension of NOW accounts on Decem-

ber 31, 1980 and is reflected in the FOMC's percent differential in

the shift adjusted 1981 growth ranges for M1-A and M1-B. Shift-adjusted

M1-B is derived by subtracting from seasonally adjusted M1-B an estimate

of seasonally adjusted inflows into OCD (apart from trend growth) from

non-demand deposit sources. Seasonally adjusted OCD equals seasonally

adjusted M1-B less seasonally adjusted M1-A.

Table 1 compares seasonally adjusted M1-B on the previous and re-

vised basis. Differences mainly reflect the seasonal adjustment of OCD

for the first time, rather than updated seasonal adjustment factors for

other components. The December and April levels were both revised down-

ward a bit and average growth over this period was only moderately af-

fected. However, the monthly growth pattern has been affected more sig-

nificantly. Growth in January and February of this year has been raised

while growth in April, and to a lesser extent March, has been lowered.

Growth in shift-adjusted M1-B in the first quarter--shown on the right-

hand side of the table-was slightly in excess of 1 percent at an annual

rate under the new procedure, about 1¾ percentage points more than under

the previous one.

1. Such amounts are derived by cumulating monthly inflows from non-
demand deposit sources (not seasonally adjusted). These amounts in turn
are estimated by multiplying the monthly increase in OCD (not seasonally
adjusted) in excess of trend in end-of-year OCD balances (not seasonally
adjusted) by the mid-points of the monthly ranges for the share estimated
to have come from non-demand deposits. Cumulative amounts are then sea-
sonally adjusted by applying the seasonal factor for commercial bank sav-
ings deposits.



III-3

Table 2 presents revisions to M-2. Changes in M-2 reflect revi-

sions to M1-B as well as changes in seasonal adjustment factors for non-

transaction deposits at banks and thrifts. Growth in the first four

months of 1981 is smoother under the revised procedure, as relatively

slow growth in January and February has been boosted while growth in

March and April has been lowered.

APPENDIX IV

ESTIMATES OF THE SOURCES OF GROWTH IN OTHER CHECKABLE DEPOSITS

To put recent movements in the transaction component of the narrow

money stock in an economically meaningful perspective requires that ob-

served data for M1-A and M1-B be adjusted for the distorting effects of

the public's response to the authorization of nationwide NOW accounts.

The magnitudes of the adjustments each month are computed on the basis

of estimates of the sources of funds deposited in other checkable depos-

its (OCD). Available evidence suggests the following fractions of net

inflows to OCD were shifted or diverted from demand deposits: 75 to 80

percent in January and 70 to 75 percent in February, March, and April.

Application of the midpoints of the estimated ranges to observed deposit

flows for each month yields an adjusted measure of M-1B in the first

quarter of 1981 that rose 1 percent at an annual rate from the observed

level of the preceding quarter (Table 1).1

The estimated proportion of growth in OCD coming from demand depos-

its may be viewed as a weighted average of that fraction applicable to

inflows at commercial banks and that applicable at thrifts, with the

weights being the institutions' respective shares of growth in OCD. Ta-

ble 2 displays key results of sample surveys conducted by the Federal

Reserve Banks and the Federal Home Loan Bank Board and results of cross-

1. To derive seasonally adjusted M1-B that abstracts from shifts in
1981 into OCD from non-demand deposit sources, an estimate of seasonally
adjusted inflows to OCD from these sources must be subtracted from M1-B.
For a description of this procedure, see Appendix III.



IV-2

section regression analyses of deposit flows. The figures in the final

column provide the primary basis for the range of the estimated propor-

tions of inflows to OCD that originated in demand deposits.

Both regression analysis of deposit flows at individual commercial

banks and special surveys of commercial banks conducted by the Reserve

Banks suggest a slight drop in the proportion of OCD growth at commer-

cial banks coming from demand deposits after January. On the other hand,

the FHLBB surveys indicate that the proportion of growth in OCD at

thrifts coming from outside such institutions rose somewhat-from 59 per-

cent in January to 66 percent in March. Assuming the composition of

these funds from outside thrifts is the same as the overall composition

of inflows to OCD at commercial banks, the estimated fraction of OCD at

thrifts coming from demand deposits appeared to stay in the vicinity of

50 percent. Consideration was also given to results of three surveys of

households conducted by the Survey Research Center of the University of

Michigan in February, March, and April. Taking combined results of the

three surveys, households estimated on average that about 71 percent of

1. The sample surveys elicited estimates by commercial banks and sav-
ings and loan associations of the sources of inflows to their new NOW
accounts. Respondents consisted of 9 banks in each Federal Reserve dis-
trict and 8 S&Ls in each Federal Home Loan Bank district. In the re-
gression analyses, estimates of the proportion of OCD growth coming from
demand deposits were obtained by regressing (across commercial banks)
changes in demand deposits on changes in OCD, using data from about 9,000
banks that report weekly for reserve requirement purposes. The estima-
ted slope coefficient represents the share of OCD growth accounted for
by intrabank shifts from demand deposits. A similar technique was used
to estimate intrabank shifts from savings deposits. The regression re-
sults were combined with information from the sample surveys to obtain
estimates of the proportion from interbank and other sources.



IV-3

the funds used to open new interest-bearing transaction accounts in 1981

originated in demand deposits.

1. Although about 700 households were interviewed in each survey, the
number of new interest-bearing transaction accounts opened since year-
end by the respondents in the three surveys combined was only 170. In
light of the small sample size, less weight was given to the household
surveys than to other results. Current plans are to conduct an expan-
ded one-time survey in June that will include about 5,000 households,
likely providing a sample of about 500 NOW accounts opened this year.

i/ The adjusted growth rates in January reflect changes from the observed Decenber 1980 levels (unadjusted for
the impact of shifting to ATS accounts last year) to January levels adjusted to eliminate the estimated effects
of shifts to new NOW accounts. Such adjustment facilitates consistent comparison with target ranges for growth
in 1981, which are expressed in terms of changes from observed (unadjusted) levels outstanding in the fourth
quarter of 1980 to adjusted levels in the fourth quarter of 1981.

1. S&Ls provided estimates for the proportion of growth in OCDs that
came from outside their institutions, but they did not estimate the frac-
tion coming specifically from demand deposits. Each method below assumes
the proportion of these funds from outside thrifts that came from demand
deposits to be equal to the overall fraction estimated for commercial
banks. For example, in January S&Ls estimated that 59 percent of their
new OCDs came from outside their institutions. Thus, the thrift fraction
used in the top line of the table-48.7-is the product of 59 percent and
the 82.5 percent fraction at commercial banks.
2. Commercial bank surveys were conducted for the January period, for
the February to early March period, and for the April period; S&L surveys
were conducted for January and for March.
3. For inflows to OCDs at commercial banks estimated to have come from
other commercial banks, this method assumes all were shifted or diverted
from demand deposits.
4. For inflows to OCDs at commercial banks estimated to have come from
other commercial banks, this method assumes the same proportion was
shifted or diverted from bank deposits as was the case for shifts within
the banks.

NOTE: Government securities dealer cash positions consist of securities already delivered, commitments to buy (sell) securities on an outright basis
for immediate delivery (5 business days or less), and certain "when-issued" securities for delayed delivery (more than 5 business days). Futures and

forward positions include all other commitments involving delayed delivery; futures contracts are arranged on organized exchanges. Underwriting

syndicate positions consist of issues in syndicate, excluding trading positions.

Weekly data are daily averages for statement weeks, except for corporate and municipal issues in syndicate, which are Friday figures. Monthly

averages for excess reserves and borrowing are weighted averages of statement week figures. Monthly data for dealer futures and forwards are end-of-

month figures for 1980.
