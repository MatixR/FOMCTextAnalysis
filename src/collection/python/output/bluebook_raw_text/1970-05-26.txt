MONETARY AGGREGATES AND
MONEY MARKET CONDITIONS

Recent Developments

(1) In the first three weeks of May, figures for both the money

supply and the adjusted credit proxy appear, on balance, to have run

significantly above the paths targeted in the last blue book. As a result,

for the month of May the money supply is now estimated to grow at about

a 9-1/2 per cent annual rate on average, and the adjusted credit proxy to

decline at only about a 1-1/2 per cent annual rate, compared with rates

of plus 3-1/2 and minus 7-1/2 per cent specified earlier. The higher

May growth rates reflect in some part, and particularly for the money

supply, shortfalls of the aggregates in April from their targets. Still,

taking April and May together, the growth in both the money supply and

bank credit is running about 2 - 3 percentage points (annual rate) more

rapidly than targeted. It should be pointed out, however, that this

estimate is based on data for May which are relatively firm for only

the first half of the month, with figures partial for the third week.

(2) The faster-than-expected increase in the money supply for

May has reflected a considerably stronger than targeted performance of

private demand deposits. Consumer cash balances have probably been

augmented by the receipt of lump-sum retroactive increases in social

security benefits and Federal pay, and probably also by a build-up in

liquidity associated with the sharp decline of the stock market. But this may

also have been partly due to the active reserve supplying operations under-

taken by the System to lend support to the Treasury's May financing. With

respect to the adjusted credit proxy, its smaller-than-targeted decline

Adjusted

in May has also been influenced by the fact that the Treasury received

more cash than expected in its mid-May refunding, partly paid through

credits to tax and loan accounts.

(3) Commercial bank time deposits rose moderately in the last

half of April, but thus far in May growth has been at a very slow pace,

possibly influenced by withdrawals from consumer-type time deposits to

pay for the recent AT&T and Treasury offerings. Moreover, at recent

relatively high levels of short-term market rates, the earlier fairly rapid

net expansion in outstanding CD's has come to a halt. In May, time

deposits are now estimated to rise at an 8-1/2 per cent annual rate, on

average, mainly reflecting rapid growth in the last half of April. With

respect to nondeposit sources of funds, Euro-dollar borrowings through

foreign branches have shown little net change on balance over recent

weeks, as expected, but growth in bank-related commercial paper has been

considerably more than anticipated.

(4) Desk operations since the last meeting were shaped by

"even-keel" considerations as the Treasury financing was imperilled by

market reactions to Cambodian and related developments. During the

statement week ending May 6--when books were open on the financing--net

borrowed reserves declined to about $425 million, about $400 million

below the average of the preceding three statement weeks. In the

following two statement weeks net borrowed reserves rose to $790 million



-4-

and $1,064 million, respectively. In terms of the flow of reserves,

there was a sizable $420 million rise (seasonally adjusted) in the

daily average of nonborrowed reserves during the week ending May 6--a

period in which the System bought $1.2 billion of securities (on a

daily average basis)--but outstanding nonborrowed reserves were reduced

sharply in the ensuing two weeks partly as a result of action to increase

substantially the Treasury balance of the Federal Reserve in the week

ending May 13. Over the past three statement weeks, the effective

weekly average Federal funds rate has fluctuated bttween 7-7/8 and

8-1/2 per cent, and member bank borrowings have fluctuated between $770

million and $1.2 billion.

(5) The Treasury's May financing raised about $2 billion in new

money from the public, or about $1 billion more than expected. This was

almost entirely the result of lower-than-expected cash redemptions of

publicly-held "rights" to the exchange. The cash offering of 18-month

notes required a highly unusual 100 per cent allotment rate to obtain

full coverage. Dealers have been rather reluctant to rebuild their

reduced positions from the levels to which they had been reduced after

the recent sizable System bill purchases. With the market supply of

bills thin, bill rates have fluctuated widely in response to shifting

short-run market pressures. The 3-month bill has ranged from 6.56 to

7.09 per cent since the last Committee meeting and was most recently

bid at around 6.85 per cent. Long-term interest rates have edged higher

in the inter-meeting period, carrying yields on corporate and municipal

bonds to levels slightly above their previous highs of late December.

And stock market prices have dropped sharply further.

anhual rates of change in major reserve deposit, and credit aggregates in

Prospective

(7) If the Committee decides to aim at a continuation of the

policy course adopted at the previous meeting, it may wish to renew the

directive issued then, excluding the reference to the Treasury financing,

as follows:

To implement this policy, the Committee desires

to see moderate growth in money and bank credit over

the months ahead. System open market operations until

the next meeting of the Committee shall be conducted

with a view to maintaining bank reserves and money

market conditions consistent with that objective;-taking

[DEL: account of the current Treasury financing;] provided,

however, that operations shall be modified as needed to

moderate excessive pressures in financial markets, should

they develop.

(8) The following table compares the target paths for money

supply and the adjusted bank credit proxy adopted at the last FOMC meeting

for the second quarter with current estimates and projections. The pro-

jections are based on an assumption of a Federal funds rate around the

8--8-1/8 per cent average of the past three weeks, and also assume a

seasonal decline in the 3-month bill rate during the next four weeks into

a 6-3/8--6-5/8 per cent range.

1/ March includes 4 days in which transactions through foreign agencies and

June will not include such a period. An adjustment to remove the resulting
bias in the rate of change over the second quarter would add about 1 percentage
point to the quarterly rates shown in table.

Some analysts prefer to view quarterly changes in the money stock as

measured by the average daily amount outstanding during the current quarter

over the average daily amount outstanding in the preceding quarter. On

this basis the second quarter increase in the money stock consistent with

the 4 per cent target shown in the table above would be at a 6-1/2 per cent

annual rate, while the figure consistent with the 7 per cent projected

increase would be around 7-1/2 per cent. The first quarter rise in the

money stock on a quarter-over-quarter basis was around 2-1/2 per cent.

(10) An extrapolation into the third quarter of the moderate

growth path for the monetary aggregates voted by the FOMC on May 5 might

look as follows:

Credit Proxy Supply Reserves

June 309.2 203.5 27.8

September 314.6 205.6 27.8

Annual 7 rate of change:
September over

June 7 4 1/2

The path for the adjusted proxy allows for sizable Treasury third quarter

cash financing, with about $8-1/2 billion of new cash raised in July and

August. Staying with this path, however, would probably mean that a

substantial part of the Treasury cash requirements would have to be financed

outside the banking system, assuming that business and other loan demands on

banks pick up from their recent depressed pace as would be consistent with

staff projections of renewed expansion in real GNP.



-9

(11) Since both the bank credit proxy and the money supply

are currently running above target, it seems clear that the Manager

would have to provide less reserves and to tighten up money market

conditions in order to move back toward the targeted path. One of the

factors the Committee may wish to take into account in determining the

speed with which the Manager attempts to move back toward the path

presumably would be the fragility of market conditions. Assuming the

excess of projections over targets shown in paragraph (8) is roughly

correct, a gradual movement back toward the moderate growth path might

be fostered, between now and the next meeting of the Committee, with a

Federal funds rate around 8-1/2 per cent or somewhat above, member bank

borrowing averaging about $1 to $1.1/4 billion, and net borrowed reserves

averaging around $900 million to $1 billion. Such a movement in the

money market would inhibit, at the least, potential seasonal downward

pressures on bill rates during June, and would probably add to upward

pressures on long-term rates over the short-run. As the System holds

back on the provision of nonborrowcd reserves, a slower rate of deposit

growth can be expected, with time deposits becoming even less competitive

relative to securities and holders of cash balances moving into high-

yielding market instruments.



–10-

Alternative

(12) Should the Committee--for example, because it wishes

to accommodate what appears to be increased liquidity demands in the

economy--wish to move onto a path that allows for somewhat greater

rates of growth in the monetary aggregates than Alternative A, the

following language for the second paragraph might be considered:

To implement this policy, the Committee desires to

see [DEL: moderate] SOMEWHAT GREATER growth in money and bank

credit over the months ahead THAN PREVIOUSLY SOUGHT.

System open market operations until the next meeting of

Committee shall be conducted with a view to maintaining

bank reserves and money market conditions consistent with

that objective, [DEL:taking account of the current Treasury

financing;] provided, however, that operations shall be

modified [DEL: as needed to moderate] IF excessive pressures

DEVELOP in financial markets, [DEL: should they devlop OR

IF IMPLEMENTING ACTIONS ARE LEADING TO UNDULY EASY MONEY

MARKET CONDITIONS.

(13) A target path that fosters somewhat greater growth in

money and bank credit over the months ahead might be as follows:

Movement onto this path might temporarily--over the next few weeks--require

keeping money markets toward the tight end of recently prevailing ranges,

although not as tight as in paragraph (11), perhaps with a Federal funds

rate averaging around 8-1/4 per cent, member bank borrowings averaging

a little under $1 billion, and net borrowed reserves falling in a $650

million to $900 million range. Money market conditions such as contemplated

here might well mean that there would be only a quite moderate decline in

the 3-month bill rate in June to a level averaging somewhere in a 6-1/2 -

6-3/4 per cent range. As the third quarter progressed, such a policy in

relation to the aggregates should help to moderate upward short-term rate

pressures resulting from the Treasury's larger-than-usual July-August

financing operations. Long-term interest rates also would be under less

upward pressure, and might actually decline, as banks were put in a better

position to purchase municipal securities and if the size of the corporate

calendar were to abate as expectations of rising interest rates faded.
