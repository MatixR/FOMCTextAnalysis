The attached document represents the most complete and accurate version 
available based on original copies culled from the files of the FOMC Secretariat at the 
Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System.  This electronic document was 
created through a comprehensive digitization process which included identifying the best-
preserved paper copies, scanning those copies,1 and then making the scanned versions 
text-searchable.2  Though a stringent quality assurance process was employed, some 
imperfections may remain. 
 

Please note that this document may contain occasional gaps in the text.  These 
gaps are the result of a redaction process that removed information obtained on a

1 In some cases, original copies needed to be photocopied before being scanned into electronic format.  All 
scanned images were deskewed (to remove the effects of printer- and scanner-introduced tilting) and lightly 
cleaned (to remove dark spots caused by staple holes, hole punches, and other blemishes caused after initial 
printing). 
2 A two-step process was used.  An advanced optimal character recognition computer program (OCR) first 
created electronic text from the document image.  Where the OCR results were inconclusive, staff checked

MONETARY POLICY ALTERNATIVES

Recent developments

(1) In April M2 grew slowly--at about a 3 percent annual rate--

held down in part by enlarged shifts to IRA and Keogh accounts in advance

of the April tax date. M2 growth is picking up in May, but expansion to

date appears still to be falling short of a pace consistent with the 9 per-

cent rate from March to June expected by the Committee. Growth in MMDAs

has slowed further in recent weeks--though not quite to the rate expected

at the time of previous FOMC meetings--and appears to have added about

1 percentage points or so to M2 growth in April and May. M3 behavior

generally has paralleled that of M2--with growth relatively slow in April

and picking up, though less sharply, in May--and its expansion for the

quarter to date seems to be below the 8 percent annual rate indicated by

the Committee for the second quarter.

(2) M1 declined at a 3 percent annual rate in April; however,

data for early May indicate a very sharp rebound in growth of this

aggregate. The uneven pattern of growth may be attributable in some part

to problems with seasonal factors, but examination of seasonally unadjusted

data for early May suggest unusual strength in the month in any event.

For April and May combined, M1 growth appears as if it may be running

about 4 percentage points above the 6 to 7 percent annual rate of growth

from March to June that the FOMC thought was consistent with its expecta-

tions for the broader aggregates.

(3) Debt of domestic nonfinancial sectors is estimated on the

basis of preliminary data to have grown at about a 9½ percent annual rate

in April, about the same as the rate of advance from December to March. The

latest estimate places this debt measure a bit below the midpoint of the

FOMC's 8½ to 11½ percent annual range. In addition to continued heavy

borrowing by the federal government, tax-exempt financing and mortgage

formation have been strong so far this year and consumer installment

borrowing has picked up as well. Nonfinancial businesses also have issued

a substantial volume of long-term debt, but this has been partly offset

by weakness in short-term business borrowing in the commercial paper

market and at banks. Total bank credit growth in April was at an 8¾ per-

cent annual rate, somewhat below the first quarter pace; business loans

declined in April and at large banks have remained weak in early May,

but banks have continued to acquire large amounts of Treasury securities.

(4) After the abatement of statement date pressures at the

end of the first quarter, restraint on bank reserve positions has been

associated with a federal funds rate generally in an 8½ to 8¾ percent

area. The level of borrowing since the last meeting has averaged higher

than the $250 million set for reserve path purposes at the last Committee

meeting, mainly because of distortions around the end-of-quarter statement

date and special influences in two other weeks. Excess reserves have con-

tinued to be volatile and to run relatively high on average. With demand

for required reserves slowing in lagged response to a weakness in trans-

actions deposits over much of March and through April, growth in the various

aggregate reserve measures has slowed in April and May relative to the

previous two months. The growth rate of the monetary base has, however,

accelerated in May along with renewed strengthening of currency growth.

(5) Since the last Committee meeting, short-term rates have

declined ¼ to ½ of a percentage point, while bond rates have shown mixed



changes. Rates had fallen considerably in the first few weeks of the inter-

meeting period, as the market reacted to weak money supply figures in April

and to renewed expectations of a discount rate cut in the not-too-distant

future. However, most recently rates have backed up, as strong incoming

economic data and signs of renewed rapid growth in M1 caused hopes for a

near-term discount rate cut to fade. Spurred by lower interest rates and

improved prospects for economic growth, stock prices reached new record

levels in May, although most recently they have eased off with the backup

in interest rates.

(6) The dollar is essentially unchanged on a weighted average

basis since the March FOMC meeting, despite the modest decline in U.S.

short-term interest rates relative to a weighted average of foreign rates.

The dollar depreciated substantially against sterling and by a lesser

amount against the yen, but these declines were offset by an increase

against the mark and other EMS currencies.



Long-term targets

(7) In establishing its long-term growth ranges for the

aggregates for 1983, the Committee indicated that the ranges for M1 and

M2 would be "reviewed in the spring and altered, if appropriate, in the

light of evidence at that time." Economic issues with respect to M1

would appear to involve mainly whether its velocity--or, expressed other-

wise, the demand for money--is becoming more predictable and consistent

with past history. A principal issue raised by the Committee's targeting

procedure for M2 would appear to -revolve around whether the bulk of

shifts associated with introduction of MMDAs is indeed behind us, as was

expected in establishing both the February-March base and the 7 to 10 per-

cent range covering the period from that base to QIV '83 (a range that

assumed that growth would be boosted over that period by only about 1 per-

centage point or so at an annual rate from further shifting to MMDAs from

non-M2 sources).

(8) The staff has employed a variety of econometric tests, in-

cluding experimentation with new money demand models, in an effort to

evaluate the recent behavior of Ml, particularly since late 1981--as is

explained in some detail in the paper circulated with this blue book. In

brief, the results suggest that there has been a noticeable increase in the

responsiveness of M1 to changes in open market yields, with the implica-

tion that in a period of declining short-term interest rates Ml could be

expected to grow more rapidly than had previously been the case (given

income)--as, of course, took place in the latter part of 1982 and early

1983. The apparent increase in interest sensitivity of M1 recently seems

to be associated at least in part with the growing importance over the



-6-

last couple of years of fixed ceiling-rate NOW accounts--which have both

savings and transaction characteristics--as a component of Ml.

(9) Thus, the most recent staff research supports the view that

the strong growth of M1 in late 1982 and early 1983 can be explained in

large measure by lagged responses to the decline in short-term market

rates that began last summer. That lagged effect is virtually dissipated

by now, and, assuming little further change in short-term interest rates,

demand for M1 over the balance of the year would therefore depend mainly

on its responsiveness (for both transaction and savings purposes) to

income growth. Our present estimates suggest that M1 growth over the

balance of the year, given projected GNP, would slow markedly from its pace

over the first five months of the year, but that the odds are fairly high

that the slowing will still leave M1 by year-end somewhat above the upper

end of its present longer-run range.

(10) A number of uncertainties make such a conclusion no more

than tentative at this point, however--and indeed make it likely that

assessment of M1 behavior may be little further advanced by July, when

the FOMC's full-scale mid-year review of monetary and credit aggregates is

scheduled. First, experience with nationwide NOW accounts has been limited,

so that estimates of interest- and income-elasticities should be construed

as having a wider-than-usual margin of error around them. Moreover, they

may be distorted by inability to allow precisely for one-time transitional

effects on money demand from the public's and depository institutions'

responses to availability of new instruments. Second, the apparent higher

interest-elasticity of recent years may, in any event, be in process of

reversing. As super-NOWs become more prevalent, and over the longer term

as regular NOWs are deregulated, deposit rates will move more closely in



line with market rates, thereby likely reducing the response of money-

holders to changes in market rates. Thus, it would seem that, while the

period of sharp decline in the income velocity of M1 may be behind us,

the behavior of M1 velocity over the balance of the year still is subject

to considerable uncertainty--as it also may well be over longer periods.

(11) With regard to the longer-run range for M2, the recent

behavior of MMDAs is consistent with the assumption used in setting the

range that the bulk of shifts from non-M2 sources into M2 would be completed

by March. The average weekly growth in MMDAs declined from $33 billion in

January to $17 billion in February and $8 billion in March. Growth since

the end of March has averaged less than $4 billion per week. Some further

deceleration from this pace can in all likelihood be expected, and thus

we would see little reason to alter the earlier assumption about the modest

impact of MMDA growth on M2 over the long-run target period. Moreover, since

March, growth in the nontransactions component of M2 as a whole has been

generally moderate, even after rough allowance for shifts in April out of

M2 deposits into IRA-Keogh accounts. In general, there is little in the

statistical evidence to date to suggest that the longer-run M2 range needs

modification--though M2 is currently running lower relative to the range

than had earlier been expected in part because of large shifts into IRA-

Keogh accounts.



Policy alternatives for the short run

(12) The table below shows, in the top two panels, alternative

specifications for the monetary aggregates and the federal funds rate for

the upcoming intermeeting period. The third panel indicates the implied

growth from March to June of these alternatives. (More detailed data for

the alternatives, including their relation to the longer-run ranges, are

shown in the charts and table on the following pages. The quarterly

interest rate path consistent with the staff's GNP projection is shown

in Appendix I).

M2 7½ 7 6¾

(13) As may be seen from the lower panel of the table, all of

the alternatives indicate that M2 and M3 over the second quarter would run

below the annual growth rates of 9 and 8 percent, respectively, expected

by the Committee at its previous meeting. It should be pointed out, though,

that about one-half percentage point of the weakness of M2 and M3 growth over

the second quarter relative to earlier March-to-June expectations may be

attributed to unexpectedly large shifts of funds into IRA-Keogh accounts in

April prior to the tax date. There are only small differences in growth

rates shown among the alternatives because of the limited time remaining

-10-

in the second quarter, the relatively low interest-elasticity of the

broad aggregates, and the comparatively modest interest rate differences

assumed across the alternatives. With regard to M1, the alternatives

indicate a more rapid growth in that aggregate over the second quarter

than the 6 to 7 percent anticipated earlier, given the unexpected surge

in May.

(14) While estimates of the relationship between the aggregates

and bank reserve positions are subject to considerable uncertainty, the

money supply specifications of alternative B are expected to be consistent

with little change in the current degree of restraint on bank reserve

positions--that is, with borrowing at the discount window fluctuating

around $250 million, associated with a federal funds rate generally just

above the current 8½ percent discount rate. Nonborrowed reserves in June

would be expected to expand at about a 9 percent annual rate, and total

reserves by about 6 percent.

(15) Under alternative B, there is little reason to believe

that interest rates in general would change much from current levels, given

the recent back-up in interest rates. The 3-month Treasury bill rate

would probably trade in the vicinity of 8¼ percent. The bond market is

likely to remain able to absorb a large supply of corporate, tax exempt,

and Treasury offerings at around present rate levels, although those rates

could come under upward pressure should signs of more vigorous economic

recovery emerge, particularly if doubts intensified about prospects for

fiscal restraint. After edging down recently mortgage rates may tend to

stabilize. The total debt of domestic nonfinancial sectors is expected to

increase at about a 9 to 9½ percent annual rate over the second quarter--



-11-

little different from the first--as federal government credit demands

remain large and private credit demands stay moderate.

(16) The staff does not expect the bulge in M1 growth in May to

presage continued rapid growth in double digits in June or the months

beyond. Both our (refurbished) quarterly and monthly money demand models

would project expansion in a 6 to 7 percent annual rate area at around

current interest rates, given projected GNP. M1 growth in June seems

likely to be in that area, or perhaps lower considering the unwinding

of special influences that may be inflating growth in May--such as seasonal

adjustment problems and possible effects from an unusually sharp decline

in the Treasury balance after the first week of May. Given the moderate

June growth expected under alternative B, M1 on a quarterly average

basis would expand at about an 11 percent annual rate, which would imply

a 2 percent decline in its income velocity--a much smaller decline than

in the first quarter but still in sharp contrast to the increases that

have usually been registered in the early stages of business cycle upturns.

(17) M2 growth under alternative B is anticipated to be around

a 9 percent annual rate over May and June on average. Growth in the non-

transactions component of that aggregate is expected to pick up, after

having been depressed in April by IRA-Keogh transfers. Growth in M3 is

likely to be held down by CD run-offs at banks, as loan demand--particu-

larly from businesses--remains soft, and by declines in the assets of

institution-only money market funds, though at a slower pace than in

recent months.

(18) Alternative A envisions an easing in bank reserve positions

that would help move the broader aggregates more in the direction of the

short-run path expected at the last Committee meeting, but at the same time



-12-

would probably cause M1 to move even further above the Committee's

previously held expectations for the second quarter. The alternative

envisions a drop in borrowing to near minimal levels--perhaps $100 million,

which would bring the federal funds rate down to around 8 percent. A

similar easing of money market conditions could be attained with a drop

in the discount rate to 8 percent, and borrowing to about $200 million.

(19) The approach of alternative A, particularly if it also

involved a cut in the discount rate, could lead to fairly sizable declines

in short-term interest rates, partly because it would tend to confirm that

the Committee was discounting the recent behavior of M1. A 3-month bill

rate around 7½-7¾ percent might be anticipated, and the prime loan rate

should come down another notch. A moderate decline in long-term rates is

also probable. There is a possibility, though, of some adverse effect on

long-run inflation expectations, given the recent strong economic and

monetary data--which would have a negative impact on bond markets. In

foreign exchange markets, a drop in short rates here would help reverse

the rise in the dollar of recent days, but it is doubtful that the dollar

would drop very substantially, given the continuing attractiveness of

dollar assets and the probability of some easing action by foreign central

banks.

(20) Over the longer run, looking toward the year as a whole,

alternative A would, with greater probability, involve M1 growth above

the FOMC's longer-run range, unless interest rates moved up again in the

second half of the year. M2 growth would be raised for the year, but the

direct effect of lower market rates on demand for M2 may be quite modest

given the relatively low interest-elasticity of that aggregate. Whether

M2 growth would be strongly affected, with some risk of overshooting the



-13-

present long-run range, would depend mainly on the degree of upward impact

on GNP growth (relative to our current forecast of 8 percent at an annual

rate over the second half) of some easing in interest rates now. Since

the contemplated interest rate declines are small,a substantial impact on

spending would seem to be contingent on whether the easing engendered a

significant improvement in business and consumer confidence.

(21) Alternative C, which contemplates an increase in the federal

funds rate to the 9 to 9½ percent area, would imply a level of adjustment

borrowing between $500 and $700 million at the current discount rate. With

an increasing amount of reserve demands met at the discount window, non-

borrowed reserves over the next month would decline at an annual rate of

around 2 percent. The 3-month bill rate would probably rise into the 8½

to 9 percent area, and the prime rate would come under upward pressure.

Bond rates, too, would rise, perhaps sharply initially, but subsequent

investor willingness to acquire long-term assets in light of improved

inflationary expectations would tend to blunt such increases.

(22) This alternative would be consistent with an effort to

ensure that M1 growth moves back closer to the Committee's longer-run tar-

get. At the same time, though, the higher interest rates involved would

work to restrain M2 growth. The direct impact on M2 of the interest rates

themselves would be relatively minor in the short run. The principal con-

straint on growth of M2 and broader aggregates generally is more likely to

come as the year progresses from any slower expansion in income that might

emerge from the higher interest rates associated with the alternative.

Directive language

(23) Given below are two suggested operational paragraphs for

the directive. Alternative I is the current directive, with quantitative

specifications adopted at the previous meeting shown in strike-through

form and with a possible language deletion shown in brackets. Given

the likelihood that the earlier specifications are not reasonably attainable,

the Committee may wish to consider either changing the specifications in

the current directive or adopting a somewhat different approach suggested

by alternative II. That alternative does not provide numerical specifica-

tions, though the possibility of including them for the broader aggregates

is indicated in bracketed language.

Alternative I

For the short run, the Committee seeks to maintain generally

the existing degree of restraint on reserve positions, anticipating

that would be consistent with a slowing from March to June in

growth of M2 and M3 to annual rates of about [DEL: 9] ____ and 8 ____ percent,

respectively. The Committee expects that M1 growth at an annual

rate of about [DEL: 6] ____ to [DEL: 7] ____ percent would be consistent with its

objectives for the broader aggregates. [Lesser restraint would be

acceptable in the context of more pronounced slowing of growth in

the monetary aggregates relative to the paths implied by the long-

term ranges (taking account of the distortions relating to the

introduction of new accounts), or indications of a weakening in the

the pace of economic recovery.] The Chairman may call for

Committee consultation if it appears to the Manager for Domestic

Operations that pursuit of the monetary objectives and related



-15-

reserve paths during the period before the next meeting is likely

to be associated with a federal funds rate persistently outside

a range of [DEL: 6] ____ to [DEL: 10] ____ percent.

Alternative II

For the short-run, the Committee seeks to (maintain generally/

increase/decrease) the existing degree of reserve restraint, antici-

pating that growth rates of M2 and M3 over May and June will accelerate

from their reduced April pace [to annual rates of ____ and ____ per-

cent, respectively] while remaining in conformance with their

longer-run ranges. Consistent with these objectives, the Committee

anticipates that M1 would remain above its longer-run range, but

that its growth would be substantially reduced in the period

immediately ahead. The Chairman may call for Committee consulta-

tion if it appears to the Manager for Domestic Operations that

pursuit of the monetary objectives and related reserve paths

during the period before the next meeting is likely to be associ-

ated with a federal funds rate persistently outside a range of [DEL: 6]

____ to [DEL: 10] ____ percent.
