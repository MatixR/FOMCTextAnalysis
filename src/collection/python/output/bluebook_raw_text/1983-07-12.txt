Prefatory Note 

 
 

The attached document represents the most complete and accurate version 
available based on original copies culled from the files of the FOMC Secretariat at the 
Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System.  This electronic document was 
created through a comprehensive digitization process which included identifying the best-
preserved paper copies, scanning those copies,1 and then making the scanned versions 
text-searchable.2  Though a stringent quality assurance process was employed, some 
imperfections may remain. 
 

Please note that this document may contain occasional gaps in the text.  These 
gaps are the result of a redaction process that removed information obtained on a 
confidential basis.  All redacted passages are exempt from disclosure under applicable

1 In some cases, original copies needed to be photocopied before being scanned into electronic format.  All 
scanned images were deskewed (to remove the effects of printer- and scanner-introduced tilting) and lightly 
cleaned (to remove dark spots caused by staple holes, hole punches, and other blemishes caused after initial 
printing). 
2 A two-step process was used.  An advanced optimal character recognition computer program (OCR) first 
created electronic text from the document image.  Where the OCR results were inconclusive, staff checked 
and corrected the text as necessary.   Please note that the numbers and text in charts and tables were not

MONETARY POLICY ALTERNATIVES

Recent developments

(1) M2 is estimated to have increased at a 10 percent annual

rate in June, bringing its growth for the March-to-June period to just

around 8½ percent at an annual rate--a bit below the objective for

these months established by the Committee in March. By June, M2 had grown

about 9 percent from its February-March '83 base, and was somewhat above

the midpoint of this year's longer-run range for the aggregate. Shifts

into MMDA balances from outside M2 appear to have slowed markedly, at

least as judged by the recent cessation of growth in MMDAs. With issuance

of CDs by banks and thrift institutions stronger than expected, M3 is

estimated to have expanded at around a 10¼ percent annual rate in June,

and at an 8 percent annual rate from March to June, somewhat above the

FOMC's 8 percent objective for these months set in March. By June, M3 was

at the upper end of the Committee's 6½ to 9½ percent range for 1983.

(2) M1 expanded at about a 10½ percent annual rate in June,

and growth from the fourth quarter to June was at about a 13¾ percent

annual rate, well above the FOMC's range of 4 to 8 percent for the year.

Although M1 velocity continued to decline substantially in the first

quarter, more recently in the second quarter M1 velocity showed only a

relatively small decline, as the upward impact on M1 demand of reductions

in interest rates in 1982 faded. In May and June, all major components of

this aggregate, including demand deposits, increased substantially,

suggesting that recent strength has in some degree reflected growing

transactions needs for money balances.

the Monetary Control Act.

3. Includes special borrowing and other extended credit from the Federal
Reserve.



(3) The debt of domestic nonfinancial sectors is estimated to

have grown at about a 13 percent annual rate in June. The acceleration

of growth from the 10¼ percent average rate of April and May was due to a

surge in federal borrowing, as the Treasury sought not only to cover large

continuing needs for funds but also to build up its cash balance. The

debt of private nonfinancial sectors increased at almost an 8 percent

annual rate in June, a bit above the pace of earlier this year. For the

year to date, total domestic nonfinancial debt has increased at around a

10½ percent annual rate, a little faster than GNP, but just above the

midpoint of the FOMC's 8½ to 11½ percent long-run range. Bank credit

increased at almost a 10 percent annual rate in June, close to the average

of the previous two months. Loan growth picked up somewhat in June from

the pace of April and May; real estate lending strengthened further and

business loans showed the first substantial increase since January.

(4) After declining in May, total reserves grew at a 15 percent

annual rate in June, reflecting primarily robust expansion in required

reserves needed against transactions deposits and also some growth in

excess reserves. However, nonborrowed reserves (including extended

credit 1/) increased less--rising by 8 percent--as adjustment plus seasonal

borrowing rose to an average of $679 million. The federal funds rate

traded in an 8 to 9 percent range for most of the period since the last

meeting, up only slightly from earlier weeks. Most recently, funds have

been trading around 9 to 9-1/8 percent, though higher rates have been

associated with temporary pressures related to the semi-annual statement

of $513 million in May to $958 million in June. This borrowing was

repaid in early July.



date and long holiday weekend. The level of borrowing incorporated in the

reserve paths had been set at $350 million initially following the FOMC

meeting, and was later raised to $400-500 million. Nonetheless, the demand

for borrowing has remained unusually strong--as has the demand for excess

reserves--relative to the prevailing spread of the funds rate over the

discount rate, and borrowing has consistently exceeded these levels (and

was particularly large over the period encompassing the statement date and

long holiday weekend).

(5) Other short-term market interest rates have risen about 75

basis points further over the intermeeting period, in part reflecting the

tightening in the reserve market but also in some degree in anticipation

of a further such tightening given the strength of incoming data on money

and economic activity. Long-term taxable bond rates have also risen about

75 basis points since the May FOMC meeting, while the rate on conventional

fixed-rate mortgages has increased one-half of a percentage point.

(6) The weighted average value of the dollar has risen by 2 1/2

percent on balance since the May FOMC meeting, mainly in association with

increases in dollar interest rates. At its peak in mid-June the dollar

on a weighted average basis was slightly above its previous November 1982

peak.

. The announce-

ment of a record U.S. trade deficit for May has had little apparent effect

on dollar exchange rates.



Monetary and credit targets for 1983 and 1984

(7) A major issue in the re-evaluation of the longer-run monetary

and credit ranges earlier established for 1983 is the probable inconsistency

between the range for M1 and those for the other monetary and credit

aggregates. It would take virtually zero growth from June to December for

M1 expansion over the year 1983 to come in around the upper limit of its

current 4 to 8 percent longer-run range. The projected strength of nominal

GNP suggests considerably stronger demand for M1 than that, given something

like present interest rate levels, or even rates somewhat higher.

(8) Against that background, two alternatives are shown below

for the monetary and credit aggregates in 1983. Alternative I reproduces

the present ranges. Alternative II differs only by including an M1 range

that has greater odds of being consistent with the broader aggregates.

Upward adjustments in growth ranges are not suggested for the broader

aggregates, even though recent experience suggests the possibility that

expansion of M2 and particularly M3 over the year is more likely to be

in the upper half of their ranges rather than near their midpoints as

earlier anticipated. It is not expected that the recent decision by DIDC

to eliminate ceiling rates on time deposits (but not on regular NOW and

savings accounts) by October 1 will have any very significant impact on

growth of M2 and M3, since time deposit expansion has for some time already

been in forms either without ceiling or with ceilings indexed to market

rates.

M2 1/ 7 to 10 7 to 10

M3 6½ to 9½ 6½ to 9½

Total credit 8½ to 11½ 8½ to 11½



(9) The implications of these targets for annual growth rates

of the aggregates over the second half of 1983 are shown in the last two

columns of the table below. It should be noted that a considerable slowing

in M1 growth over the balance of the year is needed if even the upper end

of the alternative II M1 range is to be achieved. Growth in the broader

monetary and credit aggregates would not need to be as different in the

second half of this year relative to the first half for growth to fall

within their present longer-run ranges. The table below shows second half

growth rates consistent with expansion of M2 and M3 for the year in the

upper half of their ranges and expansion of total credit at its midpoint.

2/ Total credit growth rates are calculated using the last month of each

period.

(10) At this meeting the Committee will also be considering

tentative target ranges for 1984. The principal question would appear to

be whether to retain current ranges or lower them. It is not expected

that financial innovations or regulatory changes will tend to increase the

demand for the broader aggregates (given income and interest rates) next



year. Indeed, M2 may grow a little less relative to income than is expected

during the 1983 longer-run target period as residual shifts into MMDAs

become negligible next year. Against that background, and with an unusually

large and rising high employment federal deficit for the second year of an

economic recovery in prospect, and increase in monetary growth ranges would

probably raise the odds on a strengthening in inflationary pressures and

expectations.

(11) The current longer-run ranges for the aggregates are wide

enough to encompass lower actual growth rates in 1984 than in 1983. Thus,

one option (Alternative I in the table below) for the Committee--in addition

to simply retaining the present ranges--would be to retain the ranges but

indicate that actual growth for 1984 was expected to be lower in the ranges

than it had been in 1983. Our staff GNP projections for 1984--which show

slower growth in nominal and real GNP--presume that expansion of M2 next

year is ½ percentage point slower than the 8½ percent or so assumed for this

year (from the February/March '83 base). Yet another option (Alternative II)

would be to lower all of the longer-run ranges for the broader aggregates

by ½ percentage point. A variant on this option (Alternative III) would be to

lower only the upper limits of the ranges by ½ point (or possibly 1 point),

on the thought that reductions in the lower limits would tend to bring

them to "unrealistic" rates in relation to the economic outlook.

M3 6½ to 9½ 6 to 9 6½ to 9

Total credit 8½ to ll½ 8 to 11 8½ to 11



(12) Alternative II does not include a lower M1 range than is

currently in place. But the 4 to 8 percent range would represent a con-

siderable reduction from likely growth this year, or from this year's

range if the Committee chose to raise it. M1 demand this year was augmented

by the upward adjustment of cash balances induced by the lower level of

market rates that developed as inflation ebbed; such a lagged effect is not

anticipated next year, and the velocity of M1 may develop along lines

more consistent with earlier post-war cyclical and secular patterns. Of

course, there are still large unknowns. Super NOW accounts bearing market

rates may come increasingly to affect the behavior of M1, and we remain

uncertain about how the public's attitudes toward these accounts as well

as regular NOW accounts are being influenced by transactions needs, interest

rates, and broad considerations of wealth and liquidity. It should also

be noted that if a sizable further decline in short-term interest rates

happens to occur, a large further rise in M1 could develop, involving

growth rates higher than in the alternatives presented, as market rates

come near to the regulatory ceiling on regular NOW accounts.1/

(13) The credit aggregate next year is likely to grow a little

more slowly than this year. This moderation is consistent with the staff's

forecast of slightly slower nominal GNP growth, but as in 1983, credit

growth is likely to exceed the expansion of nominal income. The growth

in federal debt is expected to slow next year (the dollar volume of

net Treasury borrowing should remain about the same as 1983), while

private credit expansion remains close to this year's pace. Credit usage

by nonfederal sectors is expected to be moderated by a drop-off in

1/ Factors influencing the income velocity of M1--and also M2--are
analyzed in a staff memorandum accompanying this blue book.

borrowing by state and local governments, whose bond issuance in recent

quarters has been boosted by the effects of the decline in interest rates

and the anticipation of bond registration requirements. Household borrowing

is expected to expand about as rapidly as in 1983, but business borrowing

is expected to increase substantially from its depressed pace of this

year, as the rise in spending for fixed capital and inventories outpaces

a fairly strong profit performance.

Monetary strategies over the next few years

(14) To provide additional perspective for longer-run policy

decisions, the table on the next page shows projected impacts on real

GNP, prices, and interest rates of alternative approaches to the monetary

aggregates over the next several years. Strategy 1 reproduces the staff's

basic GNP forecast for this year and next (assuming 8½-percent M2 growth

this year and 8 percent next) and also shows projections through 1985 and

1986 that assume successive ½ point reductions in M2 growth. Strategy 2

assumes more rapid money growth over the period through 1986, in this

case a continued 8½ percent M2 growth. Strategies 3 and 4 represent an

effort to depict policy approaches that show contrasts in the timing of

restraint and ease over the course of economic recovery. Strategy 3 aims

at a relatively stringent policy over the balance of this year and next

while easing off in 1985 and 1986; strategy 4 aims at the reverse

approach of easing over the balance of this year and next, and tightening

in the last two years shown. Strategy 3 assumes a reduction in M2 growth

to around 7¾ percent in 1983 and 1984 and an acceleration to around 8½

percent on average over the next two years, while strategy 4 assumes an

acceleration of M2 growth to around 9 percent in 1983 and 1984 and a decel-

eration to around 7½ percent in the next two years; in both strategies M2

growth was constrained to average a little over 8 percent over the 4-year

period. Differences between GNP, prices, and interest rates in strategy 1

and those in other strategies are based largely on model results, as is

the extension of strategy 1 into 1985 and 1986.

(15) The steady ½ point reduction of M2 growth under strategy 1

is accompanied by a gradual deceleration in growth of real GNP and some

further improvement in price performance. The 3-month Treasury bill rate

declines over 1984, following a small rise during the second half of this

year, but shows no further decline subsequently. By contrast, the faster M2

growth of strategy 2 promotes further declines in the bill rate and faster

growth in real GNP than strategy 1 over the whole 4-year period. No

significant pick-up in inflation from the current rate is indicated, given

the structural characteristics of our model, but one may question whether

the more rapid drop in the unemployment rate and rise in plant capacity

utilization under this alternative would not induce a more prompt re-

emergence of wage and price pressures, given the degree of economic

inefficiency in much marginal plant capacity, desires by labor to make up

for recent wage concessions, and general fears of re-emerging inflation

on the part of consumers and business.

(16) Strategies 3 and 4 depict alternative courses of events

depending on whether monetary policy is front-loaded or not. The earlier

imposition of restraint under strategy 3 appears to involve no less real

growth over the 4-year period than does the front-loading of ease under

strategy 4. However, strategy 3 entails a better price performance through-

out the period. Interest rates decline under this strategy after a

substantial further rise in the latter half of 1983 and by 1985 and 1986

are lower than under strategy 4. Of course, looking beyond 1986, a slowing

in monetary growth would be needed under strategy 3 to avoid a later

acceleration in price increases.

Policy alternatives for the short run

(17) The table below shows alternative specifications for the

monetary aggregates and federal funds rate ranges for the June to

September period. (More detailed data for the alternatives, including

their relation to the current longer-run ranges, are shown in the charts

and table on the following pages. The quarterly interest rate path

consistent with the staff's GNP projection is shown in Appendix I.)

M2 9 8½ 8

M3 8½ 8 7½

M1 7 6 4½

Federal funds rate range 6 to 10 7 to 11 8 to 12

(18) The specifications of Alternative A contemplate no further

tightening of money market conditions over the next few months. A federal

funds rate range of 6 to 10 percent is shown for this alternative, the

same as in the directive adopted at the last meeting. However, a federal

funds rate in the upper half of that range--around 9 percent or a little

higher--would be contemplated. Recent experience with borrowing at the

discount window would suggest that borrowing would tend to be in the

$450 to 600 million range. From June to September, nonborrowed and total

reserves would be expected to expand at annual rates of about 5½ and 4

percent, respectively.

(19) M2 growth under this alternative will probably slow from

the rapid May-June pace, but should remain in the upper part of the FOMC's

longer-run range for that aggregate. The small increases in interest rates

that have developed since early May may act to restrain M2 growth a little,

despite the projected relatively strong expansion in personal income and

nominal GNP, but in addition M2 growth may be restrained by the further

slowing of shifts into MMDA accounts that appear to be signaled by data

of recent weeks. Mainly reflecting the behavior of M2, M3 growth is

also expected to slow from the pace of the last two months. Banks and

thrift institutions may continue to rely more heavily than in the early

part of this year on issuance of large CDs, as loan demands tend to

strengthen in reflection of the more rapid pace now evident in economic

recovery.

(20) Under alternative A, M1 growth is anticipated to slow much

more substantially than growth in the other aggregates. In large part,

this is because M1 demand is no longer expected to be buttressed by the

lagged impact of last year's sharp declines in interest rates. Indeed, the

recent rise in short-term rates should begin to have a restraining effect

on M1. The assumed M1 growth in this alternative would be consistent,

given our GNP projection, with about no change in its income velocity

in the third quarter,1/ in contrast to the declines in velocity that have

generally characterized the past several quarters. Such a turn-around

in velocity would not be unexpected during the course of a cyclical expan-

sion. However, as noted earlier, large uncertainties surround estimates

of M1 demand, given the change in its composition as NOW accounts have

become an increasingly important component of the aggregates. Should the

public continue to place a substantial amount of savings in components of

M1, and over the next few weeks some of the tax cut may well be lodged

alternative A would be around 10¾ percent at an annual rate.



-16-

growth faster--at current levels of interest rates. On the other

hand, the large build-up in M1 balances of the past several quarters could

well support a rapid expansion in GNP without much further increase in M1

should confidence generated by continuing favorable economic news entail

a substantial reduction in demand for liquidity.

(21) Given recent market rate adjustments, it would seem most

likely that interest rates would generally remain near current levels

under alternative A or decline some. In large degree, market rate increases

in recent days seem to have been in anticipation of a further tightening

of monetary policy. The 3-month Treasury bill rate might be in an 8¾ to

9¼ percent range over the next several weeks. Markets will remain ex-

ceptionally sensitive, however, given the unexpected strength of the

economy, and the level of rates will be strongly influenced by assessment

of the meaning for monetary policy over the next few months of incoming

economic news and the Federal Reserve's decisions about longer-run targets.

If and as short-term interest rates tend to stabilize, long-term rates

may tend to decline from current levels.

(22) The total debt of domestic nonfinancial sectors is ex-

pected to increase at about a 9 percent rate over the third quarter, less

than in the second quarter. While actual Treasury offerings will be

larger in the third quarter, they are expected to slow on a seasonally

adjusted basis from the very rapid second-quarter pace, when the Treasury

built up its cash balances by a substantial amount. Tax exempt offerings

are expected to remain well below the second-quarter pace, which had been

influenced by the desire to avoid registration requirements that took

effect on July 1. Business borrowing is likely to fall more on banks



-17-

relative to bond markets than it had in the second quarter. However, some

pick-up in bond offerings from the relatively moderate June pace might

be expected, particularly if the bond market shows signs of a decline in

yields.

(23) Alternative B encompasses a further increase in pressures

on bank reserve positions in an effort to increase the-odds that growth

in the broad monetary aggregates will remain within their longer-run

target ranges and to exert even more restraint on growth of M1. This

alternative would involve borrowing from the discount window in the $850

million to $1 billion range (given the present discount rate), and the

federal funds rate might be expected to move well into the 9½ to 10 percent

area. Total reserves are likely to expand at about 2¼ percent annual rate

over the June to September period. Nonborrowed reserves would be about

flat if the level of borrowing rose to the range specified.

(24) Although market interest rates have probably to some

extent discounted the further tightening in policy envisioned by this

alternative, the 3-month Treasury bill rate would likely rise further to

the 9¼ to 9¾ percent area, and longer-term rates would move still higher,

at least in the short run. The rise in long-term rates would tend to

discourage bond market financing, diverting additional loan demand to

short-term market sectors. This, together with the rise in short-term

market rates, would put substantial upward pressure on the prime loan

rate. Mortgage loan rates would probably advance further to the neighbor-

hood of 13½ percent, which would be a new high for the year.

(25) M1 growth could be expected to slow to about 6 percent

from June to September under this approach and, assuming the market pressures

of alternative B were maintained through year-end, to expand at a somewhat



-18-

slower pace in the final months of the year. If this occurred, M1 growth

for the year (QIV '82 to QIV '83) would be in the vicinity of 10½ percent.

M2 is expected to grow at an 8½ percent annual rate from June to September

under this alternative--which would bring this aggregate back toward the

midpoint of its longer-run range. While thrift deposit flows might be

about the same as under alternative A, higher deposit costs would once

again begin to eliminate the earnings of a large number of S&Ls and MSBs,

exerting upward pressure on mortgage rates.

(26) Alternative C involves an approach that would exert

relatively strong restraint on the aggregates and credit markets over the

near-term. M1 growth might be lower than 10 percent for the year and

growth of M2 over the year would probably be somewhat below the midpoint

of its longer-run range. Under this approach, federal funds would

be expected to rise to 10½ percent or so over the near-term. With the

level of borrowing at the discount window expanding to about $1¼ billion

and market interest rates rising, the current level of the discount rate

would be called into question, as indeed it also would under alternative B.

Total reserves would change little from June to September, and nonborrowed

reserves would drop by about 5 percent at an annual rate if borrowing

rose as specified.

(27) Under this alternative, given the restraint on reserve

positions, M1 would be expected to expand at only a 4½ percent annual rate,

while M2 and M3 would both increase at 8 percent rates, over the June to

September period. The 3-month bill rate would rise substantially--to

about 10 to 10½ percent--and the bank prime rate might move up to perhaps

12 percent. Longer-term yields would also show marked increases. The

dollar would probably tend to rise substantially in foreign exchange markets,



-19-

and the viability of international debt positions of a number of major

borrowing countries would come further into question. Earnings pressures

on thrifts would be very substantial. However, the projected interest

rate levels producing these pressures would probably slow the economy and

credit demands substantially by winter, so that a drop in interest rates

would be expected at least by the early part of next year consistent with

tentative longer-run monetary and credit targets for that year.

Directive language

(28) Given below is draft directive language related to the

Committee's decisions on the longer-run ranges (draft language for the

operating paragraph is shown in paragraph (29)). Suggested deletions

of language are shown in strike-through form with suggested additions in

caps and certain alternatives bracketed.

The Federal Open Market Committee seeks to foster monetary
and financial conditions that will help to reduce inflation further,
promote [DEL: a resumption of] growth in output on a sustainable basis,
and contribute to a sustainable pattern of international trans-
actions. At its meeting in February the Committee established
growth ranges for monetary and credit aggregates for 1983 in
furtherance of these objectives. The Committee recognized that
the relationships between such ranges and ultimate economic goals
have been less predictable over the past year; that the impact of
new deposit accounts on growth ranges of monetary aggregates cannot
be determined with a high degree of confidence; and that the
availability of interest on large portions of transaction accounts,
declining inflation, and lower market rates of interest may be re-
flected in some changes in the historical trends in velocity. [DEL: A
substantial-shift of-funds-into-M2-from-market instruments, in
eluding- large-certificates of deposit not included in M2, in
association with-the-extraordinarily rapid build-up-of money
market-deposit accounts, distorted growth in that aggregate during
the-first-quarter.]

In establishing growth ranges LAST FEBRUARY for the aggregates
for 1983 against this background, the Committee felt that growth
in M2 might be more appropriately measured after the period of
highly aggressive marketing of money market deposit accounts had
subsided. The Committee also felt that a somewhat wider range was
appropriate for monitoring M1. [DEL: These growth ranges were to be
reviewed in the spring, and altered, if appropriate, in the light
of evidence at that time. The Committee reviewed the ranges at
this meeting and decided not to change them at this time, pending
further review at the July meeting.] With these understandings,
the Committee established the following growth ranges: for the
period from February-March of 1983 to the fourth quarter of 1983,
7 to 10 percent at an annual rate for M2, taking into account the
probability of some residual shifting into that aggregate from non-
M2 sources; and for the period from the fourth quarter of 1982 to
the fourth quarter of 1983, 6½ to 9½ percent for M3, which appeared
to be less distorted by the new accounts. For the same period a
tentative range of 4 to 8 percent was established for M1, assuming
that Super NOW accounts would draw only modest amounts of funds



-21-

from sources outside M1 and assuming that the authority to pay
interest on transaction balances was not extended beyond pre-
sently eligible accounts. An associated range of growth for
total domestic nonfinancial debt was estimated at 8½ to 11
percent. THESE RANGES WERE REVIEWED AT THE MAY MEETING AND
LEFT UNCHANGED, PENDING FURTHER REVIEW IN JULY.

AT THIS MEETING, THE COMMITTEE REAFFIRMED THE LONGER-RUN
RANGES ESTABLISHED EARLIER FOR GROWTH IN M2, M3, [M1?], AND TOTAL
DOMESTIC NONFINANCIAL DEBT IN 1983 [WITH GROWTH IN THE BROADER
MONETARY AGGREGATES EXPECTED TO BE IN THE UPPER PART OF THEIR
RANGES]. [WITH REGARD TO M1, THE COMMITTEE, TAKING ACCOUNT OF
THE RAPID GROWTH IN THE FIRST HALF OF 1983 ASSOCIATED WITH THE
CONTINUED DECLINE IN VELOCITY AND ANTICIPATING A DECELERATION
IN GROWTH OVER THE SECOND HALF OF THE YEAR, ESTABLISHED A RANGE
OF ____ TO ____ PERCENT FOR THE YEAR AS A WHOLE.] THE COMMITTEE ALSO
AGREED ON TENTATIVE GROWTH RANGES FOR THE PERIOD FROM THE FOURTH
QUARTER OF 1983 TO THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 1984 OF TO PERCENT
FOR M2, ____ TO ____ PERCENT FOR M3. AND ____ TO ____ PERCENT FOR M1.
THE ASSOCIATED RANGE FOR TOTAL DOMESTIC NONFINANCIAL DEBT FOR NEXT
YEAR WAS SET AT ____ TO ____ PERCENT.

In implementing monetary policy, the Committee agreed that
substantial weight would continue to be placed on behavior of the
broader monetary aggregates, [DEL: expecting that distortions in M2
from the initial adjustment to the new deposit accounts will
abate.] The behavior of M1 will continue to be monitored, with
the degree of weight placed on that aggregate over time dependent
on evidence that velocity characteristics are resuming more
predictable patterns. [or THE COMMITTEE ALSO AGREED TO INCREASE
THE WEIGHT OF M1 IN POLICY IMPLEMENTATION WITH THE DEGREE OF
WEIGHT DEPENDENT ON THE STRENGTH OF EVIDENCE THAT THIS AGGREGATE
WAS RESUMING A MORE PREDICTABLE RELATIONSHIP TO OTHER KEY ECONOMIC
MAGNITUDES]. Debt expansion, while not directly targeted, will
be evaluated in judging responses to the monetary aggregates.
The Committee understood that policy implementation would involve

continuing appraisal of the relationships between the various
measures of money and credit and nominal GNP, including evalua-
tion of conditions in domestic credit and foreign exchange markets.

(29) Draft language for the operational paragraph is shown

below. Since the proposed language refers to alternative approaches for

a new quarter, the old language (which referred to the second quarter)

is not shown.

The Committee seeks in the short run to [increase (alt. C),

increase somewhat (alt. B), or maintain (alt. A)] the existing

degree of reserve restraint. The action is expected to be



-22-

associated with growth of M2 and M3 at annual rates of about

____ and ___ percent respectively from June to September. The

Committee anticipates that a deceleration in M1 growth to an

annual rate of around ____ percent will be consistent with its

third-quarter objectives for the broader aggregates. [Depending

in part on evidence about the strength of economic recovery,

lesser restraint would be acceptable in the context of a signi-

ficant shortfall in growth of the aggregates from current

expectations, while somewhat greater restraint would be

acceptable should the aggregates expand more rapidly.] The

Chairman may call for Committee consultation if it appears

to the Manager for Domestic Operations that pursuit of the

monetary objectives and related reserve paths during the period

before the next meeting is likely to be associated with a

federal funds rate persistently outside a range of ____ to ____

percent.
