MONETARY POLICY ALTERNATIVES

Recent developments

(1) Ml, which continued to expand rapidly in December, grew only

a little in January. On average over the two months, M1 has increased at

about a 7 percent annual rate, the lower end of the 7 to 9 percent short-run

range for growth from November to March set by the Committee at its last

meeting.1 M2 grew at a 4-1/4 percent annual rate over the past two months,

and M3 at 6-3/4 percent, as compared with their 6 to 8 percent ranges for the

short-run period. With regard to experience in 1985 relative to long-run

ranges for the aggregates, M1 grew well above its range for the second half

of last year, while M2 and M3 were in the upper portion and near the midpoint

of their respective ranges, as shown in the last column of the table on the

following page (with the long-run ranges for last year shown in parentheses).

(2) The slowing of M1 growth in January was entirely attributable

to a decline in demand deposits, following their unusually strong expansion

during the final two months of last year. In January OCDs grew near the more

moderate December pace; the removal of the regulatory minimum balance on

Super NOW accounts did not have much effect on OCD growth, as depository

institutions generally have not liberalized terms on Super NOW accounts to

any significant extent. M2 growth was restrained by a sizable runoff of

overnight RPs that likely reflected a rundown in collateral stemming from

reductions in bank holdings of Treasury securities and a continued high level

1. These growth rates and all subsequent data on the monetary aggregates in
this Bluebook incorporate annual benchmark and seasonal factor revisions.
The revised series are confidential until release around mid-February. The
revisions and their effects on growth of M1, M2, and M3 over recent years are
described in Appendix A.

of Treasury balances. Hwever, M3 growth picked up, as banks' funding needs

remained sizable, and their CD issuance accelerated.

(3) The total debt of domestic nonfinancial sectors continued to

advance exceptionally rapidly late last year, paced by the explosion of tax-

exempt debt issuance in advance of proposed tax law changes. Over the year,

debt grew about 13-1/2 percent; a little more than one percentage point of

this total represented the effects of unusual credit demands associated with

the retirement of equity in mergers and other corporate restructurings, and

about three-fourth of a percentage point is estimated to have resulted from

the acceleration of tax-exempt borrowing before year-end. After the turn of

the year, tax-exempt issuance virtually came to a halt. Federal government

debt issuance, which was enlarged late last year by investment of the proceeds

from advance refunding issues of state and local governments, also dropped

off in January. However, credit demands by households and nonfinancial

firms appear to have been relatively well maintained in the early weeks of

the year.

(4) Total reserves increased at a 13 percent pace over the Decem-

ber-January period, as transactions accounts continued to grow fairly rapidly,

on balance, and excess reserves were unusually high, especially around year-

end. With discount window borrowing declining since November, nonborrowed

reserves grew at an 18-1/2 percent annual rate on average over the last two

months (adjusted for borrowing by Bank of New York in November). The non-

borrowed reserves path was constructed over the intermeeting period on the

assumption of $350 million of adjustment plus seasonal borrowing. Window-

dressing pressures were unusually strong around year end, and both excess

reserves and borrowing spiked in the reserve maintenance period ended



January 1. In the two complete maintenance periods in 1986 borrowing

averaged around $260 million, and through the first eight days of the

current statement period it has averaged $225 million.

(5) The federal funds rate moved lower once year-end pressures

subsided, with trading in recent weeks generally in the 7-3/4--7-7/8 percent

area, somewhat below its level at the time of the last FOMC meeting. However,

other short-term rates rose 15 to 20 basis points since that time, mainly

reflecting the very recent market response to stronger than expected employment

figures. In longer-term markets, bond yields fluctuated fairly widely over

the intermeeting interval, showing little net change. They responded to oil

price developments and the cut in the Bank of Japan's discount rate, on the

one side, and to the strong employment figures of the past two months and

doubts about Gram-Rudman's constitutionality on the other. Tax-exempt bond

yields were down rather substantially, reflecting the dearth of issuance

early this year. Rates for both fixed and variable rate mortgage commitments

also fell below their levels at the time of the December FOMC meeting, in

lagged response to earlier market rate declines.

(6) The trade-weighted average foreign exchange value of the

dollar has fallen 3 percent further on balance since the last FOMC meeting,

for a total drop of 12-1/2 percent since the G-5 announcement of September

22. On a bilateral basis, the dollar has depreciated 4-1/4 percent vis-a-vis

the mark and 5-1/2 percent in terms of the yen since mid-December, bringing

its net decline since the G-5 announcement to about 15-1/2 percent against the

mark and 20 percent against the yen. Part of the dollar's intermeeting drop

against these currencies may be attributable to statements by some G-5 authori-

ties since their January consultation suggesting that a further depreciation



-5-

of the dollar might be acceptable and perhaps welcome. Sterling, however,

depreciated 2-1/2 percent against the dollar in the intermeeting period in

response to falling oil prices.



Long-run targets

(7) Shown below for Committee consideration are alternative

longer-run ranges for the year 1986. Alternative I represents the tentative

ranges established at the July meeting. The ranges in alternative II are

generally higher, while those in alternative III are lower for M1 and M2.1

Alt. I Alt. II Alt. III

M1 4 to 7 4 to 8 3 to 7

M2 6 to 9 6 to 9-1/2 5-1/2 to 8-1/2

M3 6 to 9 6 to 9 6 to 9

Debt 8 to 11 9 to 12 8 to 11

(8) The ranges of alternative I are roughly consistent with the

staff's current GNP projection on the assumption that interest rates, if

they decline, drop only moderately. With such a decline in rates, M1 seems

likely to grow near the upper limit of the 4 to 7 percent range, and the

velocity of M1 again to drop, though only a bit and much less than last

year. The expectation that M1 expansion will slow substantially this year,

despite some projected pick-up in GNP growth, is based partly on a smaller

upward effect on the amount of M1 demanded because of interest rate behavior.

But it also depends on the thought that the substantial portion of the quite

rapid demand deposit growth of last year unexplained by usual interest rate

or income relationships will not be repeated. M1 growth could tend to be

reduced further in the degree that velocity shows more strength than expected,

either because interest rates turn out to be higher or the public's prefer-

ences for cash diminish appreciably following last year's exceptional build-

up in balances. We have assumed that the removal of minimum balances on MMDAs

monetary ranges recently adopted by key foreign industrial countries.



and Super NOWs and, at the end of March, the lifting of ceiling rates on

savings and NOW accounts will have only minimal effects, given the wide-

spread availability for a number of years of other ceiling-free accounts

and the relatively small size of previous minimum balance requirements.

(9) Growth of M2 and M3 this year should be reasonably well

within their alternative I ranges, given the GNP projection. While slowing

from last year's pace, the growth of debt from Q4 1985 to Q4 1986 is

projected a little above the upper limit of its 8 to 11 percent range. A

range of 8-1/2 to 11-1/2 percent would include an upper limit about at the

staff's projection using quarterly averages. The moderation this year in

credit demands by domestic sectors reflects a slowing in tax-exempt bor-

rowing following last year's surge; some projected abatement of corporate

debt financing, including for mergers and buyouts, that may in part be a

product of the improved stock market; and a deceleration in U.S. government

borrowing as fiscal restraint begins to take hold.

(10) The width of the tentative ranges adopted by the Committee

last July is the same for M1 as for the other aggregates. However, experi-

ence with Ml in recent years and continuing uncertainties about its behavior

in varying circumstances, given institutional changes, suggest that consider-

ation be given to making the M1 range somewhat wider than for M2 or M3.

Also, more technically, M1 for now appears to be more interest elastic than

the broader aggregates. Thus, more scope for variation would be required

should exogenous factors--such as fiscal policy, attitudes toward the dollar,

or inflationary expectations--affect the demand for goods and services and

interest rates by more or less than anticipated. (The potential impact of

some of these elements is discussed in paragraphs (13) to (15) below.)

Assuming little need to reduce the width of other monetary ranges, a



symmetrical widening of the tentative M1 range suggests 3-1/2 to 7-1/2

percent, or possibly a range of 3 to 8 percent. The latter is the same as

that adopted for the second half of 1985, but would of course produce twice

the leeway in dollar terms over a full year than for a half year.

(11) Alternative II--with ranges allowing more growth for M1, M2,

and debt--may be viewed as consistent with a more stimulative approach to

aggregate demand than is embedded in the staff's projection. Whether such

a policy would risk leading to a significant acceleration of inflation, if

not later this year then next, depends in part on how close the present rate

of unemployment is to the so-called natural rate--the rate below which

wage pressures will increase with feedback effects on prices. It would

also depend on the growth potential of the economy. If the nation's growth

potential were below, say, 3 percent per annum--taking account of labor

force expansion and productivity--a more stimulative monetary policy that

led to higher growth would run a greater risk of setting in motion upward

price pressures, with assessment of the timing and extent of risk depending

on one's view of the level of the natural rate of unemployment.

(12) The third alternative--with lower ranges for M1 and M2--

may be thought of as consistent with taking advantage of a relatively sharp

drop in oil prices to secure greater progress in moving toward reasonable

price stability. A significant drop in oil prices would tend for a time

both to increase real growth and to curtail general upward price pressures.

If the price of imported oil declines to the $20 per barrel assumed in the

GNP projection, the policy enbodied in alternative III would probably lead

to somewhat higher real interest rates and lower real growth than under

alternative I, but with improved price performance. It would, however,

exert more pressure for a time on international and domestic debtors (and



-9-

indirectly on their creditors) by holding interest rates higher than

otherwise. Should oil prices drop noticeably more than currently assumed,

the alternative III approach might well achieve the real growth projected

by the staff, or a bit more, as well as better anti-inflationary gains,

along with downward pressure on interest rates particularly as inflationary

expectations lessen.

(13) In assessing the appropriateness of the monetary alterna-

tives for this year, account also needs to be taken of the possibility that

fiscal policy or the behavior of the dollar on exchange markets will differ

from staff assumptions, as well as the oil price. The budget stance for

fiscal year 1986 implicit in Granm-Rudman looks more certain and achievable

than is the case for later years. For fiscal 1987, the staff has assumed

a budget deficit somewhat higher than the Gramm-Rudman limit, but which

implies roughly the same swing toward fiscal restraint in terms of the

structural deficit (the bulk of the higher actual deficit level stems from

a projection of lower GNP growth). With regard to the exchange value of

the dollar, the staff has assumed a further 5 percent annual rate of decline

from its level at the end of January.

(14) If the fiscal policy and exchange rate assumptions turn out

to be wrong, the odds at this time would appear to favor their being wrong

on the side of greater upward price and interest rate pressures. The

Gramm-Rudman process could break down in practice, particularly if the

unconstitutionality of certain aspects is upheld by the Supreme Court. And

if we are in fact in the midst of an underlying downward adjustment in the

dollar to a level more consonant with something like eventual balance in

the current account, there would evidently be the potential for a greater

dollar decline this year. Both developments would, if they occurred, exert



-10-

more upward pressure on prices than in the staff projection--a larger

decline in the dollar rather directly and lesser fiscal restraint through

enhanced demand pressures. These effects would be muted if the oil price

at the same time happened to drop by more than currently anticipated.

(15) In general, to the degree that uncertainties about exogenous

fiscal and exchange market developments are more in an inflationary rather

than a deflationary direction, this would tend to argue for restraint on

the upper limits of the aggregates. Moreover, should interest rates tend

to rise over the year because of stronger demand and price pressures, the

velocity of M1 would probably increase somewhat. Thus, money growth lower in

the ranges would be required to contain excessively strong demand pressures.

On the other hand, if uncertainties were to be resolved in a deflationary

direction putting interest rates naturally under downward pressure, the

maintenance of economic growth would require greater monetary expansion.

In particular, a relatively high upper limit for M1 growth may be needed,

given its apparently enlarged interest elasticity of demand and the likeli-

hood under those circumstances of a greater decline in its velocity this

year than currently anticipated.

Short-run policy alternatives

(16) The table below presents three alternative specifications

for growth in the monetary aggregates through March, together with associated

federal funds rate ranges. Growth rates are shown from a November base, as

chosen at the last meeting. Detailed data, including growth rates from

December to March, are shown on the table and charts on the following pages.

Alt. A Alt. B Alt. C

Growth from November
to March

Ml 7-3/4 7 6-1/2

M2 6 5-3/4 5-1/2

M3 7 6-3/4 6-1/2

Associated federal
funds rate range 5 to 9 6 to 10 6-1/2 to 10-1/2

(17) Given recent behavior of the aggregates, alternatives A and

B are reasonably consistent with the short-run ranges from November to March

adopted at the last meeting-7 to 9 percent annual rate of growth for M1 and

6 to 8 percent for M2 and M3--although the aggregates of B are somewhat lower

than A relative to those ranges. The differences in the alternatives in

that context would be reflected in the degree of near-term bank reserve

pressures--with alternative B assuming unchanged pressures and alternative A

some easing--and implications for the trajectory of money growth over the

months ahead relative to longer-run ranges. In the tightening alternative C,

both M1 and M2 would be expected to fall short of the December meeting ranges.

(18) The specifications of alternative B envision a continua-

tion of discount window borrowing in a range of $300 to $400 million, with

federal funds likely to trade around 7-3/4 percent or a little higher.

Growth in M1 would be expected to pick up to near a 7 percent annual rate in

February and March, about the same as its December-January average. By March

M1 would be a little under the upper bound of its tentative 4 to 7 percent

1986 range.

(19) A pickup in M2 growth is expected under alternative B in

February and March, after its sluggish performance in January, as RP behavior

ceases to be a drag and core deposits advance more in line with income.

Nonetheless, M2 in March would remain somewhat below the lower bound of its

tentative growth cone for 1986. Growth in M3 over the remainder of the

quarter is expected to slow a bit from its January pace as bank credit expan-

sion moderates. M3 in March would be somewhat above the lower end of its

tentative range for this year.

(20) With current reserve pressures unchanged as assumed in alter-

native B, the 3-month Treasury bill rate would trade around 7-1/4 percent,

the yield area reached following release of January's employment figures.

Bond yields, too, would be likely to fluctuate around very recent levels,

though still sensitive to incoming news about oil prices or the strength

of economic activity. Underlying demand pressures on credit markets are

expected to show little net change this quarter. A sharp drop in the growth

of domestic nonfinancial debt is in train, but most of the slowing represents

cessation of unusual borrowing activity late last year connected with the

special situation in the tax-exempt market. The recent pace of decline in

the exchange value of the dollar may not continue under alternative B,

though if the dollar is fundamentally tending downward, a significant rise

in the exchange rate is unlikely.

(21) Alternative A assumes a reduction in reserve pressures

associated with adjustment plus seasonal borrowing at the discount window



-14-

lowered to around $150 million. Federal funds would probably trade around

the present 7-1/2 percent discount rate or a little less, and expectations

of a discount rate cut would probably revive. The 3-onth Treasury bill

rate would fall to around 6-3/4 percent or so, and long-term rates would

drop. Rates on large CDs might decline by even more if concerns about bank

asset quality--recently reinforced to a degree by the drop in oil prices--are

relieved a little by the general decline of interest rates. Also, bank CD

issuance would be more muted under this alternative by heavier inflows of

core deposits and some diversion of business credit demands away from banks

as long-term markets become more attractive. Additional downward pressure on

the dollar would emerge, with the extent depending in part on whether the

market comes to anticipate even further easing action--and particularly if

key foreign countries do not lower their interest rates.

(22) Under alternative A, M1 growth would be expected to pick up

to about an 8-1/2 percent annual rate over February and March, as interest

rates decline. Growth from the fourth quarter to March in this aggregate

would be at an annual rate of about 7-1/2 percent--somewhat above the

tentative longer-run range--and the lower rates would work to sustain money

growth in the ensuing months. The 7-3/4 percent growth of M2 for February

and March under this alternative would be bring this aggregate to around the

lower bound of its tentative range by quarter-end.

(23) The exact response of these monetary aggregates, especially

M1, to the lessening of reserve pressures under alternative A is somewhat

difficult to assess. There would seem to be some risk of a more pronounced

upward thrust to M1 (and perhaps also M2) growth than specified as market

rates decline under this alternative. A further decline of market rates

could bring the spread between short-term market instruments and checkable



-15-

accounts to quite low levels depending on institutional reactions, with the

potential for strong inflows as the opportunity cost of liquidity and safety

becomes less practically significant.

(24) Alternative C encompasses a modest firming in reserve condi-

tions, with discount borrowing increasing to $450 to $500 million and federal

funds trading consistently somewhat above 8 percent. The tightening assumed

under this alternative would come as something of a surprise to participants

in foreign as well as domestic markets. Short-term rates would back up

appreciably, and the exchange value of the dollar would partly reverse some

of its recent decline. Long-term rates would also rise, at least in the

short-run, particularly if the current Treasury refunding were not well

distributed.

(25) Growth in the monetary aggregates through March under this

alternative would be low relative to the short-run ranges adopted at the

previous meeting. M1 would move further down in its tentative long-run

range, and M2 would remain below its range. The restraint on the aggregates

would probably continue to some degree into the spring, assuming the higher

interest rates were sustained. Thus, this alternative might be viewed as

most consistent with the long-run ranges of alternative III.

Directive language

1986 Ranges

(26) Shown below is draft directive language relating to the

Committee's decisions on the longer-run ranges (draft language for the

operating paragraph is shown in (27) below). Suggested deletions from the

current directive are indicated in strike-through form. Proposed additions,

shown in caps, refer to M1 uncertainties and the role of the aggregates in

policy implementation.

The Federal Open Market Committee seeks to foster monetary

and financial conditions that will help to reduce inflation

further, promote growth in output on a sustainable basis, and

contribute to an improved pattern of international transactions.

[DEL: In furtherance of these objectives the Committee at the July-meet-

ing reaffirmed ranges for the year of 6 to 9-percent for M2 and

6 to 9-1/2 percent for M3. The associated range for total domestic

nonfinancial debt was reaffirmed at 9 to 12 percent. With respect

te M1, the base was moved forward to the second quarter of 1985

and a range was established at an annual growth rate of 3 to 8

percent. The range takes account of expectations of a return of

velocity growth toward more usual patterns, following the sharp

decline in velocity during the first half of the year, while also

recognizing a higher degree of uncertainty regarding that behavior.

The appropriateness of the new range will continue to be re-examined

in the light of evidence with respect to economic and financial

developments including developments in foreign exchange markets.

More generally, the Committee agreed that growth in the aggregates

may be in the upper parts of their ranges, depending on continuing



-17-

developments with respect to velocity and provided that inflationary

pressures remain subdued.] In furtherance of these objectives [DEL: for

1986] the Committee agreed [DEL: on tentative] TO ESTABLISH ranges [DEL:of] FOR

monetary growth, measured from the fourth quarter of 1985 to the

fourth quarter of 1986, of [DEL: 4 to 7] ____ TO ____ percent for M1, [DEL:6 to 9]

____ TO ____ percent for M2, and [DEL: 6 to 9] ____ TO ____ percent for M3. The

associated range for growth in total domestic nonfinancial debt was

[DEL: provisionally] set at [DEL: 8 to 11] ____ TO ____ percent for THE YEAR 1986.

THE COMMITTEE RECOGNIZED THAT, BASED ON THE EXPERIENCE OF RECENT

YEARS, M1 WAS SUBJECT TO SUBSTANTIAL UNCERTAINTIES, PARTICULARLY

WITH REGARD TO THE RESPONSIVENESS OF INSTITUTIONS AND DEPOSITORS TO

CHANGING MARKET AND ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, INCLUDING THE FINAL PHASE

OF DEPOSIT RATE DEREGULATION. THE COMMITTEE UNDERSTOOD THAT POLICY

IMPLEMENTATION WOULD REQUIRE CONTINUING APPRAISAL OF THE RELATION-

SHIPS AMONG THE VARIOUS MEASURES OF MONEY AND CREDIT, THEIR VELOCITY

TRENDS, AND INDICATORS OF ECONOMIC ACTIVITY AND PRICES, AS WELL AS

CONDITIONS IN DOMESTIC CREDIT AND FOREIGN EXCHANGE MARKETS. [DEL: With

respect to M1 particularly, the Committee recognized that uncertain-

ties surrounding recent behavior of velocity would require careful

reappraisal of the target range at the beginning of 1986. Moreover,

in establishing ranges for next-year, the Committee also recognized

that account would need to be taken of experience with institutional

and depository behavior in response to the completion of deposit rate

deregulation early in the year.]



-18-

OPERATIONAL PARAGRAPH

(27) The proposed format follows that used at the December meeting.

It includes reference to the uncertainty surrounding the behavior of M1 and

retains the November base since subsequent developments have not been far

off expectations at that meeting. If that base is retained, the ranges

adopted at the last meeting would be generally consistent with expectations

of growth under alternatives A or B (although M1 and M2 would be near the

bottom or in the lower half of the ranges). If the base were shifted for-

ward to December, growth expectations for M1 consistent with the two

alternatives, would be lower--5 to 6 percent.

In the implementation of policy for the immediate future, the

Committee seeks to decrease somewhat (Alt. A)/MAINTAIN (Alt. B)/

INCREASE SLIGHTLY (Alt. C) the existing degree of pressure on reserve

positions. This action is expected to be consistent with growth in

M2 and M3 over the period from November to March at annual rates of

about [DEL: 6 to 8] ____ percent [____ PERCENT AND ____ PERCENT,

RESPECTIVELY]; while the behavior of M1 continues to be subject to

unusual uncertainty, growth at an annual rate of [DEL: 7 to 9] ____

percent over the period is anticipated. Somewhat greater reserve

restraint might (WOULD), and somewhat lesser reserve restraint would

(MIGHT), be acceptable depending on behavior of the aggregates, the

strength of the business expansion, developments in foreign exchange

markets, progress against inflation, and conditions in domestic and

international credit markets. The Chairman may call for Committee

consultation if it appears to the Manager for Domestic Operations that

reserve conditions during the period before the next meeting are



-19-

likely to be associated with a federal funds rate persist-

ently outside a range of [DEL:6 to 10]____ TO ____ percent.



Appendix A

Money Stock Revisions

Measures of the money stock have been revised to incorporate

annual benchmark and seasonal adjustments. This appendix discusses the

revisions and presents tables comparing growth rates of the old and new

series. These revisions are to be regarded as strictly confidential until

their release planned for around mid-February.

Benchmark Revisions

Deposits of commercial banks and thrifts have been benchmarked

through the June 1985 call reports and incorporate data revisions. In

addition, RPs have been benchmarked to the new quarterly and annual RP

surveys. The benchmark revisions on net had a relatively small positive

impact on M1 growth over 1985 and a negligible effect on M2; M1 growth was

raised by 0.3 percentage point for the second half of the year and 0.2

percentage point for the year as a whole. M3 growth over 1985 was lowered

by 0.5 percentage point, reflecting primarily large revisions to term RPs at

thrifts.

Seasonal Revisions

The seasonal factor review employed the same X-ll ARIMA procedures

that were used last year. Although revisions to seasonal factors had little

effect on the broad patterns of growth in 1985 for the monetary aggregates,

some redistributions of growth occurred between the first and second halves.

On a quarterly average basis, the seasonal factor revisions raised M1 growth--

by about 0.3 percentage point--in the second half of last year, while lowering

that for M2 and M3.

Appendix B

Foreign Money Growth Targets

Several foreign industrial countries have announced targets for

growth of monetary aggregates during 1986 that are not far different from

the targets or actual experience of 1985, as shown in the table on the

next page. Switzerland is the only country shown (abstracting from a

definitional change in France) that has lowered its target growth rate

fran that adopted for last year. In France, however, achievement of the

new target would entail a deceleration from experience in 1985 as so far

reported.

Growth of the foreign targeted monetary aggregates was generally

moderate last year. The major exception was growth in the United Kingdom

of £M3, which has been rapid during the past ten months, apparently as a

result of financial innovation and regulatory change.

In Germany, central bank money (CBM) accelerated in the second

half of 1985. As a result, growth of that aggregate over the target

interval was in the upper half of its 1985 3-5 percent target range.

The 1986 target has been set at 3.5-5.5 percent growth in CBM. Bundesbank

officials have described this range as allowing CBM to continue at approxi-

mately its rate of growth during the second half of 1985.

In France, the introduction of new deposit forms and related

financial innovation has led authorities to redefine the monetary aggre-

gates as of the beginning of this year. The 1986 target calls for 3-5

percent growth of the newly redefined M3 and has been characterized by

French authorities as effectively unchanged from last year's target.

The 1985 target called for M2R growth of 4-6 percent. Through September

money was growing at a rate somewhat above this range.

Definitions of Foreign Targeted Aggregates:

France:

Germany:

Japan:

Switzerland:

United
Kingdom:

M3 (newly redefined) -- currency plus all deposits at banks in France plus deposits at the Post Office,
Treasury, Bank of France and Special Savings Institutions plus all non-negotiable short-term financial
instruments plus short-term bond mutual funds.
M2R -- currency plus deposits at banks in France plus deposits at the Post Office, Treasury, and Bank of
France held by residents.
central bank money -- currency plus reserves against banks' monetary liabilities when computed at 1974
reserve ratios.
M2+CDs -- currency plus deposits at banks in Japan and installment accounts at mutual loan and savings
banks.
adjusted central bank money -- currency plus deposits of banks, commercial and industrial firms at the
Swiss National Bank (SNB) less deposits borrowed from the SNB for short-term end-of-period window dressing.
MO -- currency plus banks' Operational Deposits at the Bank of England.
£M3 -- currency plus all sterling deposits held by residents at banks in the United Kingdom less public
sector deposits.

SForecast growth of M2; targets are not set.
** In May 1985 U.K. officials changed the interpretation to be placed on the current target to refer to the percentage

change over the preceding 12 months for each month's observation until the new target is announced. Previously
target ranges were set for annual growth of the aggregates from February each year.



B-2

Swiss adjusted central bank money averaged 2.3 percent growth

through November, slightly below the 3 percent target set for 1985. The

target of 2 percent growth for this year is intended to be consistent with

reduction of the rate of inflation below the 1985 rate of 3 percent.

In the United Kingdom rapid growth of the broad oney aggregates

has continued since the spring of 1985, in part as a result of financial

innovation and regulatory change. In January, £M3 was 14.3 percent above

its year-earlier level. In response to the sustained rapid growth of this

aggregate and the perception of structural change as a major explanatory

factor, officials effectively suspended the target for £M3 growth set in

the March budget announcement. The target range for growth of monetary

base, MO, was consistently met through 1985; and in January that aggregate

was near the middle of its 3-7 percent growth range. The upcoming budget

announcement in March is expected to include new target ranges for money

growth in 1986.

Targets for money growth are not set in Japan. The Bank of Japan

does forecast growth of M2+CDs each quarter from the same quarter one year

earlier. Over the year ending in the fourth quarter of last year growth of

that aggregate rose to an estimated 8.9 percent frn the 8 percent rate of

preceding four-quarter intervals, as firms adjusted portfolios and increased

borrowing from banks in anticipation of higher interest rates by the end of

the year. The forecast for growth over the four quarters ending in the

first quarter of this year is 9 percent.

The setting of a target for M1 growth in Canada was ended in late

1982 as financial innovation within the banking system was perceived to

have greatly reduced the usefulness of that aggregate as an indicator for

monetary policy. In 1985 the Canadian narrow monetary aggregates grew



B-3

rapidly, as adjustment to innovation appeared to continue. The Bank of

Italy sets rates of desired growth for several monetary aggregates ranging

from the narrow monetary base to the broad aggregate total domestic credit.

Data through August revealed that money growth was generally exceeding the

targets set for 1985, and their targets were revised upwards in consequence

so as to allow for somewhat more growth for the year as a whole than

originally planned, but still implying slowing of money growth during the

remainder of 1985.
