Prefatory Note 
 
 
The attached document represents the most complete and accurate version available 
based on original copies culled from the files of the FOMC Secretariat at the Board 
of Governors of the Federal Reserve System.  This electronic document was created 
through a comprehensive digitization process which included identifying the best-
preserved paper copies, scanning those copies,1 and then making the scanned 
versions text-searchable.2   Though a stringent quality assurance process was 
employed, some imperfections may remain. 
 
Please note that some material may have been redacted from this document if that 
material was received on a confidential basis.  Redacted material is indicated by

format.  All scanned images were deskewed (to remove the effects of printer- and scanner-introduced 
tilting) and lightly cleaned (to remove dark spots caused by staple holes, hole punches, and other 
blemishes caused after initial printing).

first created electronic text from the document image.  Where the OCR results were inconclusive, 
staff checked and corrected the text as necessary.  Please note that the numbers and text in charts and

MONEY MARKET CONDITIONS

Recent developments

(1) M1 grew at a 5.1 per cent annual rate in October, and

data for early November suggest that the growth rate in prospect

for the October-November period is 5½ per cent,1/ slightly below

the midpoint of the tolerance range adopted by the FOMC at its October

meeting. Growth in M2 for the two months appears likely to exceed the

upper end of its tolerance range; flows into time and savings deposits

other than money market CD's have responded much more than expected to

the sharp decline in interest rates since late August. Deposit inflows

at S&L's and mutual savings banks also improved significantly in

October and early November, but less markedly than at commercial banks.

1/ These figures are based on the money supply series before revision.
The revised series, which reflects mid-year benchmarks and seasonal
factor review, will be published Thursday, November 21. The revised
money supply figures are used in the table on page 5, in the
section of this blue book covering prospective developments, and
in appendix tables IV and V. Changes in the old and revised series
are compared in appendix table VI.

(2) The adjusted credit proxy declined at about a 1.5 per cent

annual rate in October, the first monthly decline in this series since

early 1970. This reduction was largely attributable to a sharp decline in

U.S. Treasury deposits. In addition, with loans and investments increasing

little, banks were less aggressive bidders for large CD's.and allowed non-deposit

liabilities to decline. RPD's were much weaker than expected and appear to

be declining over the two-month period.

(3) Following the last FOMC meeting, the Account Manager

lowered the funds rate from somewhat above 10 per cent to around 9¾ per

cent, the midpoint of the range adopted by the Committee at its October

meeting. By the end of October, incoming data indicated that M1 and M2

were expanding at rates near the midpoint and upper end of their respective

tolerance ranges. A literal reading of the aggregates would have led the



-3-

Manager to shade the funds rate slightly on the high side of 9¾ per cent,

to the extent consistent with even keel. But, in view of the evidence of

additional weakness in economic activity, restraint in the lending policies

of banks and other institutions, and the severe financial problems of the

construction industry, Chairman Burns recommended, on October 31, that

the funds rate target be reduced to 9½ per cent for the time being. The

majority of Committee members concurred in this recommendation. With

Federal funds trading around 9½ per cent in the past two statement weeks,

member bank borrowing has declined markedly further to an average of

around $1.1 billion.

(4) Short-term market interest rates have generally declined

from 30 to 100 basis points further since the October FOMC meeting, and

bank prime rates have continued to follow the downward course of these

market rates but with a lag. Downward pressures on short rates were

fostered in part by the decline in the funds rate and expectations of

further declines associated with growing evidence of economic weakness.

Such expectations were reinforced by the Board's November 13 announcement

of a change in reserve requirement regulations. Treasury bill rates

had tended to resist the general trend until quite recently because

of pressures created by actual and prospective additions to the

supply of bills. The Treasury has been adding $200 million to

the weekly bill auction since October, and on November 14 announced

that it will raise $4½ billion more in the bill area by early December.



The 3-month bill closed at 7.32 per cent on Friday, about 30 basis

points below its level at the time of the previous FOMC meeting.

(5) Long-term yields have also been under downward pressure

since the October Committee meeting, particularly in the corporate market,

where yields have fallen by more than a full percentage point despite the

continuation of an exceptionally heavy financing schedule. Mortgage

market rates have begun to decline in response to the general downtrend

in other interest rates and the improvement of deposit flows at thrift

institutions. Treasury note and bond yields dropped moderately even

though the Treasury conducted three cash auctions totalling $4.9 billion,

mainly to refund $4.3 billion of publicly-held debt maturing on November 15.

Dealers were awarded nearly half of these offerings and have made

relatively good progress in distributing their awards.

(6) The table on the following page shows (in percentage annual

rates of change) selected monetary and financial flows over various recent

time periods; monetary aggregate figures in this table are on a revised

basis. Appendix table IV compares money supply growth rates computed

on a quarterly-average basis with those computed on a last-month-of-

quarter basis. Projected figures on the two bases are shown in

appendix table V for the three alternatives presented in the next section.

Prospective developments

(7) Three alternatives are summarized below for Committee

consideration (with additional detail presented in the table on the

following page). The longer-run targets shown continue to encompass the

seven-month period from August 1974 to March 1975, and the shorter-run

ranges of tolerance cover the November-December period.

(8) Alternative B continues the 5¾ per cent annual growth rate

for M1 previously adopted by the Committee. The Federal funds rate range

shown for this alternative between now and the next meeting is centered

on 9¼ per cent, and thus represents a slight further easing in money

market conditions. This easing appears to be required because the

rebound in M1 growth this fall has thus far been somewhat more modest

than expected; moreover, projected growth in nominal GNP has been

weakened slightly. In the two-month November-December period, M1 growth

is indicated to be in a 7-9 per cent annual rate range under this

alternative, reflecting the cumulative impact of the monetary easing

that has already occurred and an expected sharp, temporary spurt in M1

growth late in the year when U.S. Government deposits are projected to

decline substantially (after seasonal adjustment).

(9) Alternative A provides for the greater easing in money

market conditions over the near term that would be needed if the Committee

were to adopt higher longer-run targets for the monetary aggregates,

indexed by a 6½ per cent growth rate for M1 . The funds rate range for

this alternative centers on 8½ per cent. Alternative C provides for the

tightening of money market conditions that would be required if the

Committee were to lower its longer-run target for M 1 to 5 per cent.

(10) As indicated earlier, credit market participants appear

to expect a further easing in monetary policy and a continued decline

in the Federal funds rate. U.S. Government security dealers have

built up positions substantially in the recent refunding and will

probably participate heavily in the forthcoming Treasury bill offerings.

The recent very large sales of corporate bonds at sharply declining

yields also seem to reflect market sentiment that interest rates

have peaked. If the Federal funds rate were to remain around 9½

per cent, however, expectations of further rate declines would tend to

weaken and market rates might well back up. If the funds rate

were to edge lower, averaging around 9¼ per cent, the 3-month Treasury

bill rate might fluctuate in a 7-7½ per cent range, and the 3-month commercial



paper rate could decline slightly further (by an 1/8 or 1/4 percentage

point). Corporate bond yields, however, probably will not decline much,

if any, further from their present sharply reduced levels. The volume

of new offerings is expected to remain strong and the recent surge of

investor interest is likely to moderate at current yield levels, given

continuing inflationary expectations.

(11) Under alternative B, net inflows at banks of time and

savings deposits other than money market CD's would probably remain

fairly substantial. With offering rates on small-denomination deposits at

Regulation Q ceilings, we have assumed that the new reserve requirement

structure will not at present have a significant impact on the growth

of consumer-type time and savings deposits. The position of mutual

savings banks and savings and loan associations should continue improving

over the period ahead, as their deposit flows continue to recover. The

recovery in thrift institution flows, in combination with reduced bond

yields, would be likely to encourage some further easing in mortgage

market conditions. Mortgage markets would ease at a more rapid pace

under alternative A, since there would be a more substantial rebound

in deposit inflows at thrift institutions as market interest rates

dropped further.

(12) Bank credit growth over the months ahead is likely to

be moderate. In view of concerns about liquidity and capital, banks

have become quite cautious in their lending and investment policies.

While the prime loan rate could be expected to decline further under

either alternative A or B, it would still probably remain high relative



to market rates in the weeks ahead. This would work to temper business

loan growth at banks. Growth in mortgages and consumer loans is likely

to remain weak, as demands remain slack and banks scrutinize loan

applications carefully. Banks may, however, show more interest in

security acquisitions in the period ahead than they have most recently,

particularly under alternative A but also to some extent under

alternative B, to take advantage of the apparent opportunity for

capital gains. We have assumed that banks would be willing in the

months ahead to expand their outstanding CD's at a moderate pace partly

in order to acquire investments.



-10-

Proposed directive

(13) Presented below are three alternative formulations for

the operational paragraph of the directive, which are intended to

correspond to the similarly lettered policy alternatives discussed in

the preceding section. In all three alternatives, it is proposed to

delete the reference to Treasury financing because the quarterly

refunding announced on October 30 has been completed.

Alternative A

To implement this policy, while taking account of [DEL: the

forthcoming Treasury financing and of] developments in domestic

and international financial markets, the Committee seeks to

achieve bank reserve and money market conditions consistent

with [DEL: resumption of moderate] SUBSTANTIAL growth in monetary

aggregates over the months ahead.

Alternative B

To implement this policy, while taking account of [DEL: the

forthcoming Treasury and of] developments in domestic

and international financial markets, the Committee seeks to

achieve bank reserve and money market conditions consistent

with [DEL: resumption of] moderate growth in monetary aggregates over

the months ahead.

Alternative C

To implement this policy, while taking account of [DEL: the

forthcoming Treasury financing and of] developments in domestic

and international financial markets, the Committee seeks to

achieve bank reserve and money market conditions consistent

with [DEL: resumption of moderate] RELATIVELY SLOW growth in monetary

aggregates over the months ahead.

still in syndicate, excluding trading positions. The basic reserve deficit is excess reserves less borrowing at Federal Reserve less net Federal funds

purchases. Weekly data are daily averages for statement weeks, except for corporate and municipal issues in syndicate which are Friday figures.

* STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL ** Monthly averages for excess reserves and borrowings are weighted averages of statement week figures.
