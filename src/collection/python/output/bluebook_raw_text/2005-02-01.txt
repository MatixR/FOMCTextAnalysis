MONETARY POLICY ALTERNATIVES 

Recent Developments 

(1) The Committee’s decision at its December meeting to increase the target 

federal funds rate 25 basis points to 2¼ percent, to assess the risks to both sustainable 

economic growth and price stability as balanced, and to retain the “measured pace” 

language had been widely anticipated.  Nonetheless, the expected path of policy 

shifted down a little following the announcement as investors had apparently put 

some odds on a firmer tone to the statement.  That decline was more than reversed 

over the intermeeting period, however, following economic data releases that were 

read as confirming that the expansion remains on track and the publication of the 

minutes of the December FOMC meeting (see box), on the new, expedited schedule. 1  

As to the minutes, market participants reportedly focused on the concerns about 

inflation expressed by some at the December meeting as well as comments about 

possible excessive risk-taking in asset markets.  Judging from federal funds futures 

quotes and the Desk’s most recent survey of primary dealers, investors are virtually 

certain of a 25 basis point increase in the target federal funds rate at the upcoming 

meeting and apparently place high odds on similar hikes at the two subsequent 

meetings (Chart 1).  Currently, futures quotes suggest an expected federal funds rate 

                                           
1 The effective federal funds rate averaged close to 2¼ percent over the intermeeting period.  The 
Desk expanded the System’s outright holdings of securities by about $200 million through purchases 
of Treasury bills from customer accounts.  The Desk made no purchases of Treasury bills or coupon 
securities in the market.  The volume of outstanding long-term RPs decreased $4 billion, to $16 
billion, as seasonal demand for currency ebbed.  In recent days, reserve demands have once again 
been shifted forward in the maintenance period given near-universal expectations of an increase in 
the target funds rate.  This shift has been associated with some upward pressure on the federal funds 
rate. 



of about 3¼ percent at the end of 2005, but primary dealers reported an average 

expectation about ¼ percentage point higher.   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Expedited Release of the December FOMC Minutes 
 

The minutes of the December 2004 FOMC meeting were published on January 4, the 
first release of minutes on the new expedited schedule.  Market participants were reportedly a 
bit surprised by the extent of the discussion of upside risks to inflation and, in response, 
marked up the expected pace of policy tightening somewhat.  The discussion of “excessive 
risk-taking” also garnered some attention from market participants.  Two-year yields rose 
about 6 basis points in a narrow window around the release of the minutes, while inflation 
compensation measured from TIPS fell a touch.   

The figure below shows the change in two-year yields around the release of minutes 
over the last eight years.  The December minutes had an effect that was among the larger 
reactions to minutes releases over the last eight years, but it is hard to know if this is because 
they provided more information than usual, because they were more timely, or because the 
press and the public paid particularly close attention given the novelty of the expedited 
release.  The effect of the December minutes was in any case well within the range of 
responses to previous FOMC minutes releases.  Going forward, the expedited schedule may, 
to some extent, speed up the dissemination of information about the FOMC’s outlook that 
was previously provided incrementally.  If so, market responses to speeches delivered after the 
minutes release, and even to the statement at the subsequent FOMC meeting may become 
more muted.

(2) The upward revision to the anticipated path of monetary policy contributed 

to a rise in yields on short- and intermediate-term Treasury notes.  In contrast, the 

ten-year Treasury yield was little changed, on net, implying that longer-horizon 

forward rates declined notably.  Much of the drop in these forward rates appears to be 

attributable to declines in real rates, judging from TIPS yields and flat survey measures 

of long-term inflation expectations.  The reasons for the decline in far-ahead nominal 

forward rates are not entirely evident.  Higher oil prices may have led investors to trim 

their assessment of the cumulative amount of monetary policy restraint required to 

foster sustainable economic growth.  Moreover, actual and implied volatility of 

interest rates declined further, possibly contributing to a narrowing of term premiums 

embedded in longer-term rates.   

 

. 

(3) Yields on investment- and speculative-grade corporate bonds generally 

followed those on Treasuries, and as a result, risk spreads on such securities barely 

budged (Chart 2).  Spreads in both sectors remain thin by historical standards, no 

doubt in part because default rates are quite subdued and corporate balance sheets are 

generally healthy.  Broad equity indexes, weighed down by higher oil prices and 

lackluster earnings announcements and guidance, ended the period down about  

2 percent. 

(4) The value of the dollar against a broad index of currencies moved over a 

wide range, but ended the intermeeting period about unchanged (Chart 3).  Ongoing 

concern about the U.S. current account deficit pushed the dollar toward record lows 

in December, but the dollar subsequently rolled back those losses as focus shifted to 

the continuing strength of the U.S. economic expansion and a firmer outlook for 

monetary policy in the United States.  Markets were volatile at times following a 

variety of comments by officials that were interpreted as offering differing views on

the inclinations of foreign officials to intervene to stabilize currency values.2  Against 

individual major foreign currencies, the dollar fell 2¼ percent versus the Japanese yen 

and very slightly against the Canadian dollar.  However, the dollar firmed almost 

2 percent against the euro and sterling over the period.  Yields on longer-term 

government bonds generally were little changed during the intermeeting period, while 

foreign stock prices rose between 1 and 4 percent. 

(5) Against several other Asian currencies, the dollar fell about 2 percent, and 

monetary authorities in Korea and Taiwan were said to be intervening heavily in 

foreign exchange markets to stem upward pressure on their currencies.3  Rates on 

forward contracts on the Chinese renminbi fluctuated amid conflicting comments by 

Chinese officials about future changes in China’s currency peg and on speculation that 

the Chinese currency regime would be a topic at the G-8 meeting in early February.  

In Brazil, the central bank increased its policy rate 50 basis points in late December 

and another 50 basis points in mid-January in response to inflationary pressures; the 

real appreciated almost 4 percent against the dollar, but Brazilian stocks lost about 5 

percent over the intermeeting period. 

(6) Domestic nonfinancial business sector debt is estimated to have risen at a 

6¼ percent rate in the fourth quarter, up somewhat from its third-quarter pace, 

supported by a pickup in net bond issuance and a sizable increase in C&I loans 

(Chart 4).  According to the latest Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey, commercial 

banks again eased terms and standards for lending to businesses in recent months, 

and loan demand from households weakened slightly.  Nevertheless, household debt 

appears to have continued to grow briskly in the fourth quarter.  Federal debt 

accelerated to a 7¼ percent annual rate in the final quarter of 2004, and total domestic 

nonfinancial debt also expanded at a 7¼ percent pace.

(7) M2 increased at about a 4¼ percent annual rate in December and appears 

to be accelerating to about a 5¾ percent pace in January.4  Within this aggregate, 

growth in small time deposits—returns on which tend to track market rates closely—

was particularly brisk, although apparently at the expense of liquid deposits—whose 

return tends to lag market interest rates.  Smoothing through monthly fluctuations, 

M2 appears to be growing a bit below the pace of nominal income, a pattern 

consistent with its rising opportunity cost as monetary policy tightens.

until their release, which is planned for February 3.

Economic Outlook 

(8) The basic contours of the staff forecast have changed little since the 

December Greenbook, with real GDP growth again expected to average around 

3¾ percent this year and next.  The staff has taken on board the upward revision to 

market expectations of policy action observed over the intermeeting period and now 

envisions that the federal funds rate will reach 3½ percent by the end of 2006, a 

quarter-point higher than in the December Greenbook.  Long-term yields are 

anticipated to remain fairly steady this year and next, as the effects of rising short-term 

rates are offset over time by reductions in market participants’ expectations for future 

inflation and the path of policy.  As in previous forecasts, the stock market is assumed 

to generate risk-adjusted returns similar to those on fixed-income investments, 

although prices launch off a slightly lower base, reflecting the recent sell-off in shares.  

The foreign exchange value of the dollar is assumed to depreciate this year and next at 

about the same gradual pace as in the December Greenbook.  Oil prices are now 

higher than the staff had expected and, in line with futures prices, are projected to 

come down a little more steeply.  On net, financial conditions still seem quite 

supportive of growth, and aggregate demand is seen as expanding at a rate a bit above 

that of potential output, putting the unemployment rate on a shallow downward 

trajectory that by the end of 2006 nearly reaches 5 percent—the staff’s estimate of the 

natural rate of unemployment.  Core PCE inflation is expected to remain near 1½ 

percent this year and next, with the waning influence of resource slack about offset by 

the diminished pass-through from oil prices and the dollar.   

Longer-Run Strategy 

(9) To analyze strategies and risks for monetary policy, several sets of 

simulations were conducted using a version of the FRB/US model with the following 

Strictly Confidential (FR) Class I FOMC Page 10 of 41



properties:  policymakers have perfect foresight about the entire economy; financial 

markets have perfect foresight regarding the future path of the federal funds rate, 

thereby ensuring that the policy path is not associated with systematic forecast errors 

by investors; and households and firms form their expectations using more limited 

information, as in the standard version of the model.  One set of simulations was 

oriented toward evaluating the implications of alternative values of a long-run 

inflation objective for the core PCE price index, while other simulations were used to 

investigate different assumptions about productivity growth and the personal saving 

rate.  Each of the latter scenarios was simulated under the assumption of a 

1½ percent long-run inflation goal.  For each simulation, an “optimal” path of the 

funds rate was computed by assuming that policymakers have an equal distaste for 

deviations of unemployment from its natural rate, deviations of inflation from a long-

run goal, and changes in the federal funds rate.5   

(10) The baseline for these simulations was prepared using the FRB/US model 

(with judgmental adjustments) to extend the staff forecast through the end of the 

decade.  On the supply side, structural labor productivity growth is assumed to 

moderate toward historical norms, declining from 3 percent last year to 2¾ percent 

during 2005 and about 2½ percent by 2010.  Adjusting for trend movements in the 

labor force and other factors, these productivity gains are sufficient to keep potential 

output growing at a fairly steady pace of about 3¼ percent per year during the rest of 

the decade, while the NAIRU is assumed to remain at 5 percent.  As for aggregate 

demand, the personal saving rate is expected to rise gradually back toward its 

historical average, while the unified federal budget deficit stays at around 2½ percent 

of nominal GDP during the remainder of the decade.  Although the foreign exchange 
                                           
5 More precisely, the federal funds rate path is chosen to minimize the equally weighted sum of three 
components:  the squared deviations of unemployment from its natural rate; the squared deviations 
of core PCE inflation from target; and squared changes in the funds rate.  The last term helps ensure 
that the optimal funds rate path in the simulation exhibits the smooth adjustment observed in the 
historical record. 

Strictly Confidential (FR) Class I FOMC Page 11 of 41



value of the dollar is assumed to depreciate at an average annual rate of about 

3 percent after 2006, the current account deficit is projected to widen to almost  

7½ percent of nominal GDP.  Monetary policy is assumed to adjust to keep core PCE 

inflation close to 1½ percent throughout the decade while facilitating the return of 

unemployment to its natural rate.  In particular, the nominal federal funds rate rises to 

4 percent as the real federal funds rate settles in at about 2½ percent.   

(11) The first set of simulations analyzes the implications of alternative 

specifications of the long-run objective for core PCE inflation.  The solid line in each 

panel of Chart 5 denotes the scenario in which policymakers desire that the core PCE 

inflation rate eventually settle at 1½ percent.  The optimal path of monetary policy in 

this case is not much above that assumed in the Greenbook:  The funds rate, shown 

in the upper-left panel, rises steadily over the next three years, peaking at about  

4 percent.  With that financial backdrop, the unemployment rate and core PCE 

inflation rate—shown in the lower two panels—also follow trajectories similar to 

those in the Greenbook extension.  The dashed line in each panel corresponds to a 

long-run inflation objective of 1 percent.  The optimal policy aims to achieve this 

outcome by tightening only a bit more rapidly than under the 1½ percent inflation 

objective and then holding the real funds rate at a somewhat elevated level over an 

extended period (upper-right panel).  Given the tighter path of policy, the 

unemployment rate stays around 5¼ percent through the remainder of the decade, 

while inflation declines gradually toward the long-run objective.  In contrast, a higher 

inflation objective of 2 percent (dotted line) allows policymakers to pause on the road 

to further tightening until the end of this year, and the real funds rate remains a bit 

below its value in the benchmark scenario through 2010.  This policy fosters a gradual 

pickup in inflation, while unemployment declines somewhat more quickly than in the 

benchmark case and then remains below the NAIRU throughout the remainder of the 

decade.

(12) The second set of simulations highlights the implications of different 

assumptions about aggregate supply, under the maintained assumption that the 

inflation objective is 1½ percent. 6  The solid lines in Chart 6 are identical to those in 

the previous chart, depicting the benchmark scenario (as in the extended Greenbook 

baseline) in which structural productivity growth gradually moderates toward 

historical norms.  The dashed lines in this chart depict an alternative scenario in which 

structural productivity continues to grow at a pace close to that experienced in recent 

years (similar to the scenario in the Greenbook “Faster Productivity Growth”).  In 

this case, the real funds rate settles to a value that, because of higher levels of wealth 

and permanent income, is about 60 basis points higher than in the benchmark 

scenario.  Given the benchmark inflation objective of 1½ percent and in light of the 

substantial response of aggregate demand to the faster productivity growth, the 

assumed policy preference function is maximized with a steeper path for the nominal 

funds rate, which peaks at nearly 5 percent in mid-2007 and then declines a bit in 

subsequent years.  Core PCE inflation remains stable at a rate slightly below  

1½ percent, while unemployment falls to just over 4½ percent by 2007 and stays 

below the NAIRU for several years thereafter.  In contrast, under the assumption that 

productivity growth runs along a lower track than the benchmark (dotted lines), the 

real funds rate stabilizes at a level that is about 50 basis points lower than in the 

benchmark scenario.  In this case, the optimal policy prescribes a somewhat flatter 

path for the nominal funds rate, which reaches about 3½ percent by mid-2007.  

                                           
6 An important aspect of an examination of a change in the rate of growth of productivity is the 
specification of when the public and policymakers learn of the shift.  A change in productivity 
growth leaves its imprint on aggregate supply (by tilting the path of potential output over time), on 
aggregate demand (by altering wealth and permanent income when households come to recognize 
the shift), and on monetary policy (by affecting the central bank’s view of resource slack and the 
equilibrium real rate).  If monetary policymakers, for instance, catch on to a step-up in structural 
productivity growth relatively slowly, they will act on a mistaken notion that the output gap is 
narrower than actual for a time.  In these perfect-foresight simulations, policymakers do not make 
such mistakes.

Nevertheless, the unemployment rate remains about ¼ percentage point above the 

NAIRU, and core PCE inflation around ¼ percentage point above the inflation 

objective, through the rest of the decade.   

(13) The third set of simulations illustrates the policy implications of alternative 

assumptions about aggregate demand, again assuming a 1½ percent inflation 

objective.  The solid lines in Chart 7 are identical to those in the previous two charts, 

depicting the benchmark scenario in which the personal saving rate gradually rises 

toward its long-run historical average.  In contrast, the dashed lines depict an 

alternative scenario in which the saving rate remains at a relatively low level (similar to 

the simulation referred to in the Greenbook as the “Stronger Consumption” 

scenario).  In this case, the long-run equilibrium value of the real funds rate is about 

50 basis points higher than in the benchmark scenario.  With a 1½ percent inflation 

objective, the optimal policy essentially matches this increase in the equilibrium rate 

by prescribing a steeper funds rate path that reaches near 4½ percent by late 2007.  

This policy response largely offsets the shift in aggregate demand, so that the 

trajectories of unemployment and inflation are essentially the same as in the 

benchmark scenario.  The dotted lines in this chart depict the alternative scenario in 

which the personal saving rate rises even faster than in the benchmark scenario.  In 

this case, the optimal policy prescribes a somewhat lower path for the real funds rate 

and thereby prevents the negative aggregate demand shock from having a noticeable 

impact on unemployment or inflation.  

Short-Run Policy Alternatives 

(14) The universal expectation of a quarter-point policy firming at the upcoming 

meeting makes it more challenging than usual to write down plausible policy 

alternatives that could help to inform the Committee’s deliberations.  Alternative B, as 

presented in Table 1, squarely represents the conventional wisdom, in that it envisions

raising the federal funds rate target to 2½ percent at this meeting and the release of a 

statement little changed from that in December.  Alternative A presents a stance of 

policy that is easier in multiple dimensions, in that the federal funds rate is held at its 

current level, the assessment of the current degree of accommodation is softened, and 

language that could be associated with a pause is offered.  In stark contrast, 

Alternative C envisions a half-point rate hike accompanied by a darker assessment of 

inflation risks and the removal of the “measured pace” language.  No doubt, the 

extremes are extreme, but they contain elements of statement language that the 

Committee might find more appealing than the wording of Alternative B.  In addition, 

these alternatives may be helpful in informing potential changes in the policy 

announcement over the next few meetings.  All the alternatives suggest stating that 

“Output appears to be growing at a moderate pace despite the rise in energy prices,” 

which differs from the December announcement only by dropping the word “earlier” 

in recognition of recent increases in oil prices. 

(15) If the Committee believes that continued policy firming will likely prove 

sufficient to check inflationary pressures while allowing economic slack to be worked 

down in an acceptable manner, it might be inclined to raise the target funds rate 

another 25 basis points at this meeting, as in Alternative B.  Such an increase would 

further unwind the unusual degree of policy accommodation prevailing over the past 

several years, seen in Chart 8 as the movement of the real funds rate closer to 

estimates of its equilibrium, which themselves moved back to a more typical range in 

the last year or so.  It would also be consistent with the long-run scenario of 

maintaining a 1½ percent objective for core PCE inflation, as discussed above, and 

with several policy rules based on that objective (Chart 9).  While the Committee may 

be concerned that financial markets will remain accommodative even after this move, 

perhaps encouraging excessive risk-taking, it might also believe that a larger action at

Equilibrium Real Rate Chart: Explanatory Notes 
 

The equilibrium real rate is the real federal funds rate that, if maintained, would be projected to return 
output to its potential level over time.  The short-run equilibrium rate is defined as the rate that would 
close the output gap in twelve quarters given a model’s projection of the economy, and the medium-run 
concept is the value of the real funds rate projected to keep output at potential in seven years under the 
assumption that monetary policy acts to bring actual and potential output into line in the short run and 
then keep them equal thereafter.  With the exception of the TIPS-consistent measure, the real federal 
funds rates employ the log difference of the core PCE price index over the previous four quarters as a 
proxy for expected inflation, with the staff projection used for the current quarter.  TIPS indexation is 
based on the total CPI.  
        

Measure Description 

Single-Equation 
Model  

The measure of the equilibrium real rate in the single-equation model is based on an 
estimated aggregate-demand relationship between the current value of the output gap and 
its lagged values as well as the lagged values of the real federal funds rate.  In light of 
this model’s simple structure, the short-run measure of the equilibrium real rate depends 
only on the recent position of output relative to potential, and the medium-run measure is 
virtually constant. 

Small Structural 
Model 

The small-scale model of the economy consists of equations for five variables: the output 
gap, the equity premium, the federal budget surplus, the trend growth rate of output, and 
the real bond yield.  Unlike the estimates from the single-equation model, values of the 
equilibrium real rate also depend directly on conditions associated with output growth, 
fiscal policy, and capital markets. 

Large Model 
(FRB/US) 

Estimates of the equilibrium real rate using FRB/US—the staff’s large-scale econometric 
model of the U.S. economy—depend on a very broad array of economic factors, some of 
which take the form of projected values of the model’s exogenous variables.  These 
projections make use of several simple forecasting rules which are appropriate for the 
three-year horizon relevant for the short-run concept but are less sensible over longer 
horizons.  Thus, we report only the short-run measure for the FRB/US model. 

Greenbook-
consistent  

Measures of the equilibrium real rate cannot be directly obtained from the Greenbook 
forecast, because the Greenbook is not based on a formal model.  Rather, we use the 
FRB/US model in conjunction with an extended version of the Greenbook forecast to 
derive a Greenbook-consistent measure.  FRB/US is first add-factored so that its 
simulation matches the extended Greenbook forecast, and then a second simulation is run 
off this baseline to determine the value of the real federal funds rate that closes the output 
gap.  The medium-run concept of the equilibrium real rate is not computed because it 
requires a relatively long extension of the Greenbook forecast. 

TIPS-consistent Yields on TIPS (Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities) incorporate investors’ 
expectations of the future path of real interest rates.  The seven-year instantaneous real 
forward rate derived from TIPS yields reflects the short-term real interest rate expected to 
prevail in seven years as well as any applicable term premium.  The term premium is 
assumed to be 70 basis points.

this time would sow confusion about its assessment of the economy or its objectives, 

and perhaps roil financial markets. 

(16) The draft statement offered in Alternative B is quite similar to that released 

following the December meeting in its evaluation of recent economic conditions, 

assessment of balanced risks to the goals of stable prices and sustainable growth, and 

retention of the familiar “measured pace” language.  Futures market quotes suggest 

that investors are confident of quarter-point policy steps at this meeting and the next, 

and primary dealers responding to the Desk’s survey were unanimous in expecting no 

change in the Committee’s assessment of the balance of risks at this meeting.  The 

minutes of the December meeting, however, may have led analysts to expect a sign of 

heightened worries about the inflation outlook, which is missing from the draft 

statement provided in Table 1, and its release probably would be accompanied by an 

edging lower of yields, a bit of a rally in equity markets, and a small decline in the 

exchange value of the dollar.   

(17) If the Committee believes that a more rapid return to a neutral policy stance 

is needed to prevent output overshooting its potential and putting upward pressures 

on inflation down the road, it may choose one or all of the components included in 

the statement under Alternative C.  A 50 basis point increase in the target funds rate 

at this meeting might be selected if members believe that a more gradual tightening, 

along the lines of the Greenbook assumption or the expectations of market 

participants, could promote excessive risk-taking, unsustainable spending, and an 

increase in inflation.  Private forecasters continue to anticipate a higher rate of 

inflation than the staff, and the Committee may share such a forecast under the policy 

paths implied by market prices or assumed in the Greenbook.  Members may place 

high odds on aggregate demand being stronger than in the staff forecast because they 

believe that the saving rate will stay persistently low or that investment spending will 

not slip with the end of the partial expensing tax provisions.  Similarly, a less 

Strictly Confidential (FR) Class I FOMC Page 24 of 41



optimistic outlook for aggregate supply and the attendant consequences for inflation 

might incline the Committee to pick up the pace of policy firming.7 

(18) Even if the Committee prefers a 25 basis point tightening at this meeting, it 

may wish to couple such a move with some of the changes in the announcement 

listed under Alternative C in Table 1.  For instance, to suggest greater uncertainty 

about the pace of structural productivity growth, the announcement could simply 

speak of “the underlying growth in productivity” as helping to support economic 

activity, without characterizing productivity growth as “robust.”  To signal a relatively 

greater concern about the inflation outlook, the Committee could note in the rationale 

paragraph that labor market conditions “continue to improve,” without indicating that 

the improvement was gradual, and also mention that “rising business costs have the 

potential to put upward pressure on prices.”  The Committee could also drop the 

“measured pace” language, although, in the absence of other changes in the balance-

of-risks framework, that would place a greater burden on the rationale paragraph to 

guide market participants’ expectations for policy, at least until release of the minutes 

three weeks later.  If the Committee did choose to firm 50 basis points at this 

meeting, the draft language in Table 1 would serve to clarify that the larger move was 

not intended to presage a pause. 

(19) A 50 basis point policy firming and an announcement like that indicated 

under Alternative C would lead to a sharp rise in short-term interest rates and a 

decline in bond and stock prices.  Market participants would likely mark up the 

amount of cumulative tightening expected over the next year or so.  At the same time, 

uncertainty about future policy moves might increase substantially, and market prices 

probably would respond more forcefully to data releases and especially to news on 

inflation.  The direction of the market moves would be the same, but the amounts 

                                           
7 Referring back to the discussion of a productivity shock in paragraph 12, the implicit concern 
presumably would be that the Committee is late in appreciating that structural productivity growth 
had ratcheted down some time ago so that the true output gap is smaller than suspected. 

Strictly Confidential (FR) Class I FOMC Page 25 of 41



attenuated, if the Committee married a quarter-point rate firming with some of the 

drafting language of Alternative C. 

(20) If the Committee wanted to pause in the process of removing policy 

accommodation at this meeting, it might adopt Alternative A.  The Committee may 

believe that more of the increases in productivity in recent years have been structural 

than assumed by the staff, leaving the economy with more resource slack currently 

and raising the odds of a lower inflation rate prospectively under the Greenbook 

policy path.  In addition, members may foresee a continuation of labor market slack, 

rather than the gradual elimination forecasted by the staff, because of continued 

business caution, a faster return to the trend rate of labor force participation, or a 

lower NAIRU.  The Committee may also harbor some suspicions about the resilience 

of aggregate demand, perhaps on the thought that the saving rate could rise more 

rapidly or the drag from net exports intensify more substantially than in the staff 

forecast. 

(21) Even if concerns about the vigor of the expansion or confidence in the 

prospects for aggregate supply were not, on balance, significant enough to dissuade 

the Committee from tightening at this meeting, it might wish to signal in its 

announcement that such a possibility may come soon.  This could be accomplished, 

for instance, by adding after the first sentence of the announcement, “The 

Committee’s policy actions since mid-2004 have materially reduced the degree of 

monetary policy accommodation.”  The Committee could emphasize the extent to 

which policy has firmed since June by stating that “the stance of policy remains 

somewhat accommodative” rather than simply “accommodative.”  It might also 

include a note of uncertainty about improvements in the labor market by commenting 

that “labor market conditions seem to be improving gradually.”  Finally, it could 

allude to both its policy objectives by mentioning “sustainable growth” along with 

price stability in the last sentence of the announcement. 

Strictly Confidential (FR) Class I FOMC Page 26 of 41



(22) Adoption of all aspects of Alternative A—that is, keeping the funds rate 

unchanged and softening the cast of the statement language—would come as a 

considerable surprise to market participants, especially after the release of the minutes 

of the December meeting.  If the Committee chose a more limited number of the 

changes in that column of Table 1, investors would probably mark down their 

expectations for the path of policy, causing a decline in short- and longer-term 

interest rates, a stock market rally, and a drop in the foreign exchange value of the 

dollar.  The decline in longer-term interest rates would be larger and the rise in stock 

prices would be smaller to the degree that investors responded to the surprising 

FOMC statement by marking down their outlook for economic activity.  

Money and Debt Forecasts 

(23)  Under the staff forecast, M2 is expected to expand about 4 percent this 

year, 1½ percentage points slower than nominal GDP growth, owing to the lagged 

response of money demand to increases in short-term interest rates and associated 

opportunity costs.  Under the financial assumptions in the Greenbook, potential 

substitutability of M2 assets with capital market instruments could have offsetting 

effects:  Households may shift out of deposits if they gain confidence in higher 

returns on stocks, but the flattening of the yield curve could increase the 

attractiveness of the short-term instruments in M2 relative to bonds.  With fewer 

policy tightenings in 2006, M2 is expected to expand 4½ percent, only ¾ percentage 

point slower than nominal spending.  The growth of domestic nonfinancial sector 

debt is expected to fall from the 7¾ percent pace of 2004 to around 7¼ percent this 

year and 6½ percent in 2006, reflecting a moderation of government and household 

borrowing.  Rising interest rates and less rapid home price increases finally temper the 

accumulation of mortgage debt by households.  Business debt growth is projected to

Directive and Balance-of-Risks Statement 

(24) Draft language for the directive and draft risk assessments identical to those 

presented in Table 1 are provided below. 

(1) Directive Wording 
The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and financial 

conditions that will foster price stability and promote sustainable growth 

in output.  To further its long-run objectives, the Committee in the 

immediate future seeks conditions in reserve markets consistent with 

MAINTAINING/increasing/REDUCING the federal funds rate 

AT/to an average of around _______ 2¼ percent. 

(2) Risk Assessments  

A. The Committee perceives the upside and downside risks to the 

attainment of both sustainable growth and price stability for the next few 

quarters to be roughly equal.  With underlying inflation expected to be 

relatively low, the Committee believes that policy accommodation can be 

removed at a pace that is likely to be measured.  Nonetheless, the 

Committee will respond to changes in economic prospects as needed to 

fulfill its obligation to promote price stability and sustainable growth. 

B. The Committee perceives the upside and downside risks to the 

attainment of both sustainable growth and price stability for the next few 

quarters to be roughly equal.  With underlying inflation expected to be 

relatively low, the Committee believes that policy accommodation can be 

removed at a pace that is likely to be measured.  Nonetheless, the

Inflation Indicator Based on M2 and Two
Estimates of V*

Note. P* is defined to equal M2 times V* divided by potential GDP. Long-run velocity (V*) is estimated from
1959:Q1 to 1989:Q4. V* after 1992 is estimated from 1993:Q1 to present. For the forecast period, P* is based
on staff M2 forecast and P is simulated using a short-run dynamic model relating P to P*. Vertical lines
mark crossing of P and P*. Dashed areas denote projection period.
