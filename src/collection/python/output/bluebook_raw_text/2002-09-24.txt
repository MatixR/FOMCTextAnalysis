The attached document represents the most complete and accurate version 
available based on original copies culled from the files of the FOMC Secretariat at the 
Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System.  This electronic document was 
created through a comprehensive digitization process which included identifying the best-
preserved paper copies, scanning those copies,1 and then making the scanned versions 
text-searchable.2  Though a stringent quality assurance process was employed, some 
imperfections may remain. 
 

Please note that this document may contain occasional gaps in the text.  These 
gaps are the result of a redaction process that removed information obtained on a

1 In some cases, original copies needed to be photocopied before being scanned into electronic format.  All 
scanned images were deskewed (to remove the effects of printer- and scanner-introduced tilting) and lightly 
cleaned (to remove dark spots caused by staple holes, hole punches, and other blemishes caused after initial 
printing). 
2 A two-step process was used.  An advanced optimal character recognition computer program (OCR) first 
created electronic text from the document image.  Where the OCR results were inconclusive, staff checked

STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL (FR) CLASS II FOMC

SEPTEMBER 19,2002

MONETARY POLICY ALTERNATIVES

PREPARED FOR THE FEDERAL OPEN MARKET COMMITTEE
BY THE STAFF OF THE BOARD OF GOVERNORS OF THE FEDERAL RESERVE SYSTEM



1 The federal funds rate averaged close to 1-3/4 percent over the intermeeting
period.  The slowing growth of currency implied that the Desk purchased only
$4.6 billion of Treasury securities in outright operations: $3.6 billion of Treasury
coupon securities in the market and $1.1 billion of bills from foreign official
institutions.  The outstanding volume of long-term System RPs fell $1 billion, to $11
billion.

Strictly Confidential (F.R.) September 19, 2002
Class II – FOMC

MONETARY POLICY ALTERNATIVES

Recent Developments

(1) Investors’ view of the economic outlook seemed to be colored by the

FOMC’s announcement following the August meeting of no change in the target

funds rate and a shift in the assessment of the balance of risks toward economic

weakness.  Over the remainder of that day, near-term interest rate futures edged

higher as those expecting imminent ease were disappointed, but rates several months

ahead dropped as much as 20 basis points and broad equity indexes were off about

2-1/2 percent as the tilt and the wording of the announcement were taken to signal

weaker economic prospects.  Spirits were lifted briefly by the uneventful passing of

the August 14 deadline for the recertification of corporate financial statements; equity

markets rallied for several days, pulling Treasury yields up in tow.  Since then,

however, the softer tone to incoming data on production and employment,

heightened tensions over Iraq, and a gloomier assessment of the path for business

profits seem again to have left investors marking down their outlook for the economy. 

On balance over the intermeeting period, the expected path of the federal funds rate

embedded in futures rates rose slightly at near maturities, largely reflecting the absence

of an easing at the August meeting and statements by Federal Reserve officials that

appeared to convey lower odds on near-term policy action (Chart 1).1  Current quotes

suggest that investors see only a small likelihood of policy easing at this meeting, and

2  Market attention focused in particular on the hedging activities of Fannie
Mae, which announced that the average duration of its assets was substantially shorter
than that of its liabilities.  Over the intermeeting period, Fannie Mae’s share price fell
10.3 percent compared with a 2.7 percent decline in that of Freddie Mac, which had
announced a rough balance between assets and liabilities. 

recent surveys of market participants have indicated that most anticipate the

Committee will retain a balance of risks toward economic weakness.  Futures rates

suggest that investors think it likely that the Federal Reserve will respond to weaker

economic outcomes with additional easing at some point in the next few months. 

Moreover, the futures curve beyond midyear 2003 dropped 15 to 45 basis points and

now points to a more gradual expected tightening of policy than previously

anticipated.

(2) In keeping with the revisions to policy expectations, short-term Treasury

yields were about unchanged to up slightly while intermediate- and long-term Treasury

yields shed 35 to 40 basis points.  The decline in longer-term Treasury yields

reportedly was amplified by hedging demands from mortgage-backed securities

investors.  Those investors apparently purchased longer-term Treasuries to offset the

shortening in the duration of their portfolios stemming from the jump in prepayments

on mortgage-backed securities that accompanied the surge in mortgage refinancings.2 

At the ten-year maturity, yields on Treasury indexed securities fell a bit less than those

on their nominal counterparts–perhaps because indexed securities did not experience

increased hedging demands to the same degree–but also probably suggestive of a

slight decline in inflation compensation and a downward revision to economic

prospects.  The absence of any major new accounting scandals was a palliative for the

corporate bond market.  Issuers returned to the market after mid-August, though

gross issuance was still light, and anecdotal reports suggest that market liquidity has

Credit Market Conditions

On net, it appears that credit market conditions improved marginally over the
intermeeting period.  The dimunition of event risk following the passing of both the
August 14 recertification date and September 11 without major incident seemed to
contribute to an improved climate in capital markets.  Anecdotal reports suggest that
bid-asked spreads and market depth for investment-grade credits have returned close to
normal.  Transaction volumes in corporate securities reported by primary dealers moved
higher over the period (Chart 3), and the drop in long-term interest rates prompted a
pickup in bond issuance.  In the high-yield bond market, spreads remain at very high
levels and issuance has been anemic.  By some measures, however, risk spreads for
speculative-grade bonds narrowed a little over the intermeeting period and, very recently,
liquidity in this market segment reportedly has improved somewhat.  These recent
stirrings in the speculative-grade sector may have been occasioned by the sizable net
inflows to high-yield bond funds recorded in late August and early September. 
 

Market pressures on major broker-dealers may be a factor hindering further
improvement in capital market conditions.  Credit default swap spreads for broker-dealers
increased substantially this summer and, although narrowing a touch in recent weeks,
remain quite wide.  Major banks have also been under some market pressure recently. 
The well-publicized troubles of JP Morgan Chase and Citigroup led to a widening in their
subordinated debt spreads in recent months, and subordinated debt spreads gapped wider
for a number of other major banking institutions after mid-year as well.  Late in the
period, JP Morgan Chase’s risk spread ticked higher after the firm was downgraded by one
of the two major ratings agencies.  However, spreads for most other banks narrowed over
the intermeeting period.  In the syndicated loan market, market participants have noted a
pickup in new deals in early September and a growing forward calendar.  The sense of
continued availability of business credit from banks seemed to apply to smaller firms as
well.  The most recent survey by the National Federation of Independent Businesses
suggested a marginal improvement in credit availability for such firms.

largely returned to normal, at least for higher-tier credits.  Yields on highly rated issues

kept pace with declining Treasury yields, but risk spreads for speculative-grade bonds

were unchanged to a bit narrower (Chart 2).  (More detail on credit market conditions

is provided in the following box.)  Major equity price indexes finished the period

down about 6-1/4 to 8-1/2 percent, on balance, moving the forward earnings-price

ratio for the S&P 500 further above measures of long-term risk-free real interest rates. 

Judging by option-implied volatility on stock index futures, investors remain quite

uncertain about the path of equity prices.

(3) On balance, the trade-weighted value of the dollar against other major

currencies appreciated slightly over the intermeeting period as concerns emerged

about other industrial countries, particularly Germany and Japan, regarding the

momentum of economic recovery that were even more pronounced than in the

United States.  The dollar generally moved in narrow ranges against individual

currencies, ending the period about unchanged against most, but it appreciated almost

2-1/4 percent on balance against the yen.  Policy rates in foreign industrial countries

were left unchanged, and most foreign long-term government bond yields declined

20 to 25 basis points.  Political pressure intensified on the Bank of Japan to employ

unconventional means to spur the economy and aid banks, including by stepping up

purchases of government bonds.  Yesterday, the Bank of Japan surprised market

participants by announcing that it would explore ways to purchase equities from

banks.  Japanese stocks rallied after the announcement, but JGB yields rose about

15 basis points to end the intermeeting period down only slightly on net.  Foreign

stock prices extended prior declines, on balance, in often volatile trading; share prices

in Germany sank 15 percent, pulled down by the poor performance of the insurance

and technology sectors.           

      .   The Desk did not intervene during the

period.

(4) The dollar’s value against the currencies of other important trading

partners rose 1-1/2 percent over the intermeeting period.  Brazilian financial markets

were buoyed by final IMF approval of a financial support package, but concerns

remain about the potential victory of an opposition candidate in next month’s



5

Brazilian presidential election.  The Brazilian real declined nearly 9 percent on balance

against the dollar, but Brazil’s EMBI+ spread narrowed almost 240 basis points–to a

still-high level.  The Mexican peso depreciated about 2-1/4 percent against the dollar,

and Mexico’s sovereign yield spread widened a bit.  In emerging Asia, equity prices in

Taiwan, Singapore, and Malaysia fell 3 to 7 percent amid questions about prospects

for continued expansion of the technology sector.  Stock prices posted small gains in

Korea, where domestic demand continued to show strength, and the Korean won

appreciated slightly versus the dollar.

(5) Borrowing by businesses appears to have remained weak (Chart 4), as

external financing needs apparently are very low this quarter.  In recent weeks, the

improved tone in the corporate bond market has prompted a modest step-up in gross

bond issuance, but the proceeds appear to have been used primarily to pay down

short-term debt and maturing or called bonds.  As a result, commercial paper

outstanding has continued to fall, although the pace of the runoff has slowed, and

bank business loans have been basically flat since the end of July.  In the household

sector, consumer credit growth has been supported by the recent round of incentives

offered by the major auto makers.  Mortgage debt continued to expand briskly as low

rates have propelled both home buying and mortgage refinancing. 

(6) M2 growth remained elevated last month with much of the strength

concentrated in its liquid components.  In part, the advance in M2 likely reflects the

impact of the recent surge in refinancing activity and the accompanying boost to

liquid deposits associated with the temporary placement of prepayments on mortgage-

backed securities in escrow deposits at banks.  In addition, demands for M2 assets

probably have been boosted by investors seeking a safe haven from the volatility in

equity markets.  Net outflows from equity mutual funds continued last month, albeit

at a much slower pace than in July, and apparently halted in early September.  With

current estimates suggesting that M2 growth in the third quarter will be in the

Policy Alternatives

(7) The staff has read incoming data over the intermeeting period as

suggesting stronger final demand in the current quarter than projected at the time of

the August FOMC meeting but as providing little reason to change its longer-term

outlook.  In the Greenbook, economic growth is anticipated to rise a bit above that of

potential by the middle of next year and by more in 2004, leading to a gradual ebbing

of the slack in resource use.  In this environment, the staff has retained the

assumption of an unchanged stance of monetary policy through 2003, followed by

some unwinding of monetary ease in 2004.  As the economy picks up steam and the

onset of policy tightening approaches, Treasury yields edge higher, and corporate risk

spreads narrow.  Share prices rise in line with risk-adjusted returns on bonds, and the

dollar is assumed to depreciate at around a 1 percent annual rate in real terms over the

forecast period.  The unemployment rate moves up to just above 6 percent by early

next year and then gradually returns to 5-3/4 percent by the end of 2004, noticeably

above the staff’s 5 percent estimate of the natural rate throughout the forecast period. 

The effect of this ongoing slack on domestic inflation is expected to be partly offset

by accelerating import prices as the dollar depreciates and by lagged impetus from this

year’s runup in energy prices.  On net, core PCE price inflation is projected to edge

lower to a 1-1/4 percent pace in 2004.

(8) If the Committee is still of the view that the current stance of policy is

likely to be sufficient to foster an improving business climate over time, it may want to

keep the intended funds rate unchanged.  The Greenbook projects that the current

setting of the funds rate would support economic expansion that gains strength over

the next year or so.  The sense that considerable monetary accommodation has been in

place for some time is reinforced by the sustained low level of the real federal funds

rate relative to estimates of its equilibrium (Chart 5).  Indeed, the Committee may read

the robust purchases of autos and other items by households and heavy mortgage

activity as suggesting that aggregate demand will run stronger than in the staff forecast,

implying that excess capacity will be worked down more quickly than in the

Greenbook.  Even if the Committee accepts the Greenbook assessment of aggregate

demand as likely, it would interpret the attendant gradual decline in the unemployment

rate as implying less slack in labor markets than in the staff outlook should it also have

a less favorable assessment of the sustainable level of resource utilization.  

(9) If the Committee views the downside risk of economic weakness to be

substantial at the current setting of the federal funds rate, especially when compared

with the seemingly low odds of a pickup in inflation, it probably would wish to retain

a balance-of-risks assessment tilted toward economic weakness.  The elevated

threat of terrorist attack and concerns about the potential for military action in Iraq

may seem to pose significant adverse risks.  Even absent such developments, the

Committee may consider a sustained expansion of aggregate demand as by no means

assured, particularly given continuing questions about businesses’ willingness to hire

and spend and the fragility of key emerging markets.  Market participants appear to

share such qualms in that equity prices are still quite volatile and lower on balance, and

corporate risk spreads remain wide.  At this juncture, with financial markets quite

skittish, the Committee may find it more difficult than usual to predict the market

response if policy action does not match prevailing expectations.  Futures market

quotes indicate that investors on average place just a small probability on a policy

easing at this meeting, although they appear to expect at least a quarter point cut in the

funds rate by early next year.  A policy decision of no change in the funds rate and a

balance of risks still pointing toward economic weakness therefore would probably

represent only a minor disappointment to market participants and induce just a slight

backup in interest rates at shorter maturities and perhaps a modest decline in stock

prices.  As always, the wording of the announcement will prove important in shaping



9

that market reaction.  

(10) The Committee may wish to shift to a balanced assessment of risks if

it believes that the likelihood of a slide back into economic weakness, which seemed

more palpable when market stresses mounted in the runup to the August meeting, has

receded.  Two important hurdles–the August 14 deadline for certifying financial

statements and the first anniversary of September 11–passed uneventfully, perhaps

suggesting that the Committee’s assessment of the uncertainties surrounding its

forecast has narrowed.  In addition, the Committee may be concerned that a zero real

funds rate will soon pose the risk of imparting excessive stimulus if the forces currently

holding down the equilibrium real funds rate lift more quickly than is implicit in the

staff forecast, perhaps along the lines of the alternative simulation in the Greenbook. 

With some measures of the equity premium at their highest levels since the early 1990s,

the Committee may see good odds that the stock market and, hence, aggregate demand

will rebound more than projected in the Greenbook, especially given the apparent

ebbing of investors’ concerns about corporate governance.  Announcement of a

Committee decision to shift back to balance in its risk assessment, with no change in

the funds rate, would likely induce market participants to reevaluate their expectations

for policy.  Short-term interest rates would rise as the probabilities of policy easings by

early next year were lowered.  Stock prices would likely fall somewhat initially, while

long-term interest rates would be subjected to the cross-currents of higher short-term

interest rates but chances of a weaker economy in the intermediate run.

(11) The Committee may desire to ease policy at this meeting to provide

more assurance that economic growth would move up to an acceptable pace.  In

particular, if the Committee shares the staff’s assessment that the unemployment rate

will decline only modestly by 2004, it might see little risk that additional policy ease will

“Policymaker Perfect Foresight” Strategies

The updated perfect foresight exercises have been renamed “policymaker
perfect foresight” strategies in this bluebook to clarify that, while policymakers are
assumed to know the structure of the economy and the shocks that will occur over
the projection period, private agents in these FRB/US simulations form
expectations using a small vector autoregression model.  The funds rate path is
chosen to minimize the sum of squares of the deviation of unemployment from its
natural rate of 5 percent, the deviation of core PCE inflation from a long-run goal,
and changes in the funds rate.  In the extension of the Greenbook baseline beyond
2004, potential output is projected to grow at about the same rate projected for 2004
in the Greenbook, foreign GDP growth strengthens modestly, the dollar depreciates
at a 3 percent real rate, and the federal budget balance gradually improves.

The dotted line in Chart 6 depicts the policy path for the funds rate with a
long-run inflation goal of 1 percent, while the dashed line shows a path for a 1-1/2
percent inflation goal.  The solid line depicts the Greenbook funds rate assumption
through 2004, which implies a tighter policy over the next year or so than either of
the FRB/US simulations.  As a result, the baseline projection delivers a faster
disinflation and a slower closing of the output gap than the policymaker perfect
foresight strategies. 

revive inflation and a particular benefit in absorbing slack more quickly.  Judging by the

path of the funds rate in the “policymaker perfect foresight” simulations, a 25 or 50

basis point policy easing at this meeting could be consistent with stable or even

declining inflation given the staff’s assessment of longer-term trends and the

relationships embedded in the FRB/US model (see box and chart).  The Committee

may also favor policy easing at this time in light of the possibility that the lack of such a

policy adjustment could risk economic weakness and further disinflation.  Although

household spending and a swing in inventory investment have carried economic

activity along to date, the extent of the pickup in capital spending–and therefore

sustainable economic expansion–remains uncertain.  Indeed, declines in equity prices

over the intermeeting period and reductions in longer-term interest rates may well

indicate that market participants have become more doubtful on that score as well.

(12) Market participants place only small odds on a policy move at this

meeting, and domestic bond and stock markets would therefore likely rally if the

Committee chose to ease, particularly if the move were 50 basis points.  The extent of

the rally would also depend on whether market participants interpret the action as an

earlier-than-expected completion of the easing already built into market prices or as a

harbinger of further easings.  That assessment, of course, will depend importantly on

the Committee’s judgment on the balance of risks and the wording of its

announcement.

(13) Under the Greenbook forecast, with a flat funds rate, total nonfinancial

debt and its nonfederal component are both projected to continue to grow at about a 6

percent pace over the next couple of quarters.  The composition of nonfederal

borrowing shifts somewhat, however, as business borrowing recovers while household

debt grows more slowly.  Business demands for external finance are projected to rise as

profit growth is subdued while inventory building resumes and fixed investment

gradually picks up.  Banks and financial markets are expected to remain selective in

making credit available to businesses without substantially constricting the overall

prospects for capital spending.  In the household sector, a moderation in auto sales

should contribute to some lessening in the growth of consumer credit.  Home

mortgage debt is expected to decelerate from its rapid recent growth rates, reflecting

moderation in housing activity and the completion of the current wave of mortgage

refinancings.  Nonetheless, growth in household debt is expected to continue to

outpace that of disposable personal income.  Reductions in mortgage refinancings

should also contribute to a diminution in M2 growth in coming months.  Over the

four quarters of this year, M2 is projected to grow 6-3/4 percent, considerably faster



12

than nominal GDP, owing largely to the lagged effects of last year’s decline in short-

term interest rates and opportunity costs, as well as mortgage refinancings.

Directive and Balance of Risks Language

(14) Presented below for the members' consideration is draft wording for (1)

the directive and (2) the “balance of risks” sentence to be included in the press release

issued after the meeting (not part of the directive).

(1) Directive Wording

The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and financial

conditions that will foster price stability and promote sustainable growth

in output.  To further its long-run objectives, the Committee in the

immediate future seeks conditions in reserve markets consistent with

maintaining /INCREASING/REDUCING the federal funds rate at/TO

an average of around ___1-3/4 percent.

(2) “Balance of Risks”  Sentence

Against the background of its long-run goals of price stability and

sustainable economic growth and of the information currently available,

the Committee believes that the risks [CONTINUE  TO BE weighted

mainly towards conditions that may generate economic weakness]  [ARE

BALANCED WITH RESPECT TO PROSPECTS FOR BOTH

GOALS] [ARE WEIGHTED MAINLY TOWARD CONDITIONS

THAT MAY  GENERATE HEIGHTENED INFLATION

PRESSURES] in the foreseeable future.
