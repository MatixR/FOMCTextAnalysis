The attached document represents the most complete and accurate version 
available based on original copies culled from the files of the FOMC Secretariat at the 
Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System.  This electronic document was 
created through a comprehensive digitization process which included identifying the best-
preserved paper copies, scanning those copies,1 and then making the scanned versions 
text-searchable.2  Though a stringent quality assurance process was employed, some 
imperfections may remain. 
 

Please note that this document may contain occasional gaps in the text.  These 
gaps are the result of a redaction process that removed information obtained on a

1 In some cases, original copies needed to be photocopied before being scanned into electronic format.  All 
scanned images were deskewed (to remove the effects of printer- and scanner-introduced tilting) and lightly 
cleaned (to remove dark spots caused by staple holes, hole punches, and other blemishes caused after initial 
printing). 
2 A two-step process was used.  An advanced optimal character recognition computer program (OCR) first 
created electronic text from the document image.  Where the OCR results were inconclusive, staff checked

MONETARY POLICY ALTERNATIVES

Recent Developments

(1) The Committee's decision to leave the funds rate un-

changed at the August meeting was anticipated by market participants

and thus had little effect on market interest rates. With incoming

information on balance confirming earlier indications that the

economic expansion was moderating and inflation remaining subdued, the

asymmetric tilt in the directive was not utilized and the intended

funds rate was maintained at 5-1/4 percent during the intermeeting

period. Federal funds have generally traded near the intended

rate. Indeed, despite further reductions in required operating

balances owing to new sweeps of retail deposits, volatility of the

daily effective funds rate around its intended rate remains relatively

low; some unpredictable late-in-the-day tightness in the funds rate

has occurred, however.

(2) In the weeks following the FOMC meeting, market interest

rates rose somewhat (chart), reversing their declines of early August,

as output growth was seen to have more momentum than had been antici-

pated and press reports suggested increased concern among Committee

members about the outlook for inflation. Credit markets rallied in

mid-September on favorable inflation reports and sluggish retail sales

data, but gave back part of their gains, particularly at the short

end, after a wire service reported that a number of Reserve Banks had

requested discount rate increases. On balance over the intermeeting

period, short-term interest rates have risen about 10 to 15 basis

1. In the two maintenance periods completed since the last FOMC
meeting, borrowing has averaged about $50 million above its allowance
of $325 million.

points, while intermediate- and long-term rates are up 20 to 25 basis

points. Recent surveys of short- and long-term inflation expectations

(available through August for professional forecasters and September

for households) show essentially no evidence of a rise (chart).

Federal funds futures contracts now suggest a two-thirds chance of a

1/4 point increase in the funds rate at the September FOMC meeting,

while Eurodollar futures rates seem to imply only a modest amount of

tightening through next year, once likely term premiums are taken into

account (chart). Equity markets rebounded over the period, with major

indexes up around 2 to 3 percent to record highs; small-cap stocks

rose smartly but remained below records set earlier this year.

(3) Reflecting in part the increase in U.S. interest rates,

the dollar's weighted-average exchange value rose almost 1 percent

over the intermeeting period (chart). Declines in market interest

rates abroad also contributed to a firmer dollar, as foreign ten-year

rates fell 15 basis points and three-month rates dropped 25 basis

points, on average. Official lending rates were lowered by several

central banks, including the Bundesbank and the Bank of Canada.

Canadian, German, and U.K. stock indexes recovered to or exceeded

previous highs, while those in Japan, France, and Italy remained well

below recent peaks, as investors were apparently less optimistic about

prospects for economic activity in the latter group of countries.

; the Desk again did not inter-

vene.

(4) Broad money growth picked up in August, but by somewhat

less than projected at the time of the last FOMC meeting. M2 grew at

a 3-3/4 percent rate, leaving it in the upper portion of its 1 to 5



percent annual range. Liquid deposits continued to run off, but at a

slower pace than in July.2 Retail money funds grew rapidly, as

their yields eased more gradually than market rates in early August.

Small time deposits, whose rates had increased appreciably in spring

and early summer in lagged response to upward movements in market

rates, posted a solid gain. Little substitution between these M2

components and capital market mutual funds was evident, as stock fund

flows resumed in strength and bond fund flows also picked up in

August.3

(5) Despite a decline in bank credit, M3 accelerated to a

5 percent growth rate in August, leaving it somewhat below the upper

end of its 2 to 6 percent annual range. With favorable yield spreads,

institutional money funds posted robust growth. Large time deposits

also grew rapidly, as banks continued to shift markedly away from

reliance on overseas sources of funding. Data for early September

suggest a further acceleration in both M2 and M3.

(6) Growth of the debt of nonfederal sectors has moderated a

bit in recent months. The rate of increase in consumer credit has

remained below that earlier this year; the less ebullient expansion of

such credit primarily reflects more moderate increases in spending on

consumer durables and repayments of earlier loans, but strains on

household balance sheets and less generous loan supplies also may be

2. M1 declined at a 10 percent rate in August. After adjusting for
the initial effects of new sweep programs, M1 was up at a 4-1/2 per-
cent rate. Currency growth moderated to a 7-1/2 percent pace, while
both demand deposits and NOW accounts fell sharply because of new
sweeps. The monetary base rose at a 6-1/4 percent rate, or at a 9-3/4
percent rate after adjusting for sweeps.

3. The effects of capital losses in July on the August month-
average value of assets in stock mutual funds restrained the growth
rate of M2 plus stock and bond funds to only 1 percent in August.



restraining borrowing some. Comprehensive data on residential mort-

gage borrowing lag substantially; real estate lending by banks posted

a solid gain in August, but, rather than additional overall strength

in home mortgage borrowing, this may reflect shifts to adjustable-rate

financing, which banks tend to hold on their books. Business borrow-

ing has slackened somewhat, particularly in commercial paper and cor-

porate bond markets, as hefty profits are perhaps funding a larger

share of business investment spending. Commercial and industrial

lending at banks has strengthened in early September, and bank busi-

ness lending in the third quarter is running ahead of its pace earlier

this year, perhaps reflecting the financing of higher levels of inven-

tories. Loan supply conditions are still quite favorable for busi-

nesses, and quality spreads in securities markets remain at histori-

cally low levels. Outstanding state and local debt has resumed its

decline since mid-year, owing to continued retirement of advance-

refunded debt and a slackened pace of new issues. On the other hand,

federal borrowing has picked up a little this summer. Growth of total

nonfinancial debt for the year has edged down to around the midpoint

of its annual range.

Policy Alternatives

(7) The staff has read the mixed economic data since the

August FOMC meeting as still consistent with growth moderating to a

pace about in line with the economy's potential, assuming that the

Committee's policy stance remains unchanged through the forecast

period. The outlook for output growth and the unemployment rate for

the rest of 1996 and 1997 is essentially the same as in the last

Greenbook and remains broadly consistent with the central tendencies

of the Committee members' forecasts for these variables made in July.

Recent core inflation data have been a shade lower than the staff

anticipated, but resource utilization remains high enough in the staff

forecast to put some upward pressure on increases in labor costs and

prices. With crude energy prices likely to be more elevated for a

time than had been assumed and a hike in the minimum wage further

boosting costs and prices, the staff's projection for consumer price

inflation remains around the upper ends of the Committee members'

central tendencies for both years. However, the underlying profile of

inflation going forward under the staff forecast may be slightly more

adverse than Committee members were expecting in July, because they

may not have fully incorporated upcoming technical adjustments in the

consumer price index at the time they were surveyed.

(8) The Committee thus might view such an inflation outcome

as unacceptable. Nonetheless, there are reasons why the Committee

might choose the unchanged federal funds rate of alternative B for the

upcoming intermeeting period. Although labor markets are tight and

wages accelerating, the extent and timing of any feedthrough of this

acceleration to overall compensation and ultimately prices remain

uncertain. Real interest rates are in the neighborhood of levels that



over the past fifteen years have been associated on average with

little change in inflation, and the growth of money and credit has

been moderate, suggesting perhaps that if the stance of policy is

stimulative, it may not be greatly so. Indeed, the staff forecast has

only a gradual pickup in core inflation, which in any event will start

from a level in the third quarter that is probably lower than the

Committee had anticipated. In these circumstances, waiting to assess

better the economic situation might not incur much risk of a signifi-

cant deterioration in inflation expectations, provided the delay were

not too long, because containing inflation will still be possible

before it has risen appreciably above the general level of recent

years. Moreover, the soft cast to the recent trend of retail sales

and continued surprisingly favorable readings on broad price indexes

may lead the Committee to consider the staff forecast as too pessimis-

tic about likely inflation pressures. If so, inflation is more apt to

be kept within acceptable bounds without policy adjustment.

(9) With market participants apparently placing greater than

even odds on policy tightening at this meeting, interest rates would

likely decline and the dollar weaken on foreign exchange markets if

the unchanged policy of alternative B were adopted. Even before the

discount rate story earlier this week, markets had built in close to

50/50 odds of a slight policy tightening, and alternative B probably

would trigger rate declines that not only reversed the increases

associated with the story, but some of those registered earlier in the

intermeeting period as well. Many would likely view the Committee as

merely delaying policy action until the November meeting rather than

changing its fundamental assessment of the potential inflation threat,

and this reaction would tend to limit the decline in long-term rates.



There is a risk that policy inaction would induce some in the market

to question the Committee's commitment to holding down inflation, or

its willingness to take forward-looking action to do so, which would

tend to boost inflation expectations. Given uncertainties about the

outlook and the perceived lack of a policy consensus within the

Federal Reserve, markets are likely to remain highly sensitive to new

economic data and to indications of Committee members' inclinations.

(10) A tightening of policy at this Committee meeting,

whether by 50 basis points, as assumed in alternative C, or by only 25

basis points, would improve the chances that price pressures would be

contained and inflation outcomes would be consistent with the Commit-

tee members' expectations in July. In the alternative scenarios in

the Greenbook, an increase of one percentage point in the federal

funds rate over the next year is sufficient to tilt core inflation

down. A 25 or 50 basis point tightening at this meeting could be seen

either as a first installment in moving more deliberately toward lower

inflation, or as a more limited action aimed at holding the line.

With labor markets tight and wage gains already strengthening, the

Committee may see it as only a matter of time before total compensa-

tion puts sufficient pressure on profit margins to prompt businesses

to raise their prices faster. Especially if aggregate demand has more

momentum than in the staff forecast, waiting for very long to tighten,

given the lags in the effects of monetary policy, risks embedding some

rise in inflation and inflation expectations into the economy and

financial markets. That result would necessitate more aggressive and

potentially disruptive policy action at a later date to return infla-

tion to recent levels.



(11) Markets participants do not have a 25 basis point firm-

ing at this FOMC meeting fully built into the structure of interest

rates, and would be considerably surprised by a 50 basis point hike.

Thus, some of the former and the bulk of the latter would be matched

by a rise in short-term rates. The impact on intermediate- and long-

term rates is less certain, especially because the firming would con-

stitute a reversal in the direction of policy. Such policy reversals

in the past have often resulted in fairly large movements in inter-

mediate- and long-term rates. However, in light of signs of moderat-

ing aggregate demand and damped inflation, as well as statements in

the Committee's published minutes, much market commentary has accepted

the notion that a reversal in the direction of policy could be limited

in scope. Still, policy action of any size will probably lead market

participants to revise their view of the path of policy and build in

some expectations of additional tightenings. A 1/4 point firming is

more likely to leave them skittish as they expect further action soon,

while the larger tightening would have a greater immediate impact on

rates. The statement accompanying the announcement of the policy

change might be able to reduce the chance that the market would come

to extrapolate sizable further increases in the funds rate.

(12) Borrowing by domestic nonfinancial sectors in the staff

forecast is expected to remain moderate over the final months of the

year. Households are anticipated to use consumer credit at around the

reduced pace of recent months while growth in mortgage indebtedness

probably will decelerate in keeping with a slowdown in home buying.

Elevated debt burdens and further selective tightening of consumer

credit availability should act as a mild restraint on household bor-

rowing. Business debt growth is likely to strengthen a bit in the



-10-

near term in keeping with inventory restocking and some levelling off

of cash flow. Credit is expected to remain readily available to

businesses from banks and securities markets; firms with access to the

bond market will probably concentrate their borrowing there, espe-

cially if bond rates do not rise much from recent levels. With growth

in federal debt fairly subdued, debt of domestic nonfinancial sectors

is expected to expand at a 4-1/4 percent pace over the final four

months of 1996, implying growth of about 5 percent for the year as a

whole.

(13) In view of slower-than-expected M2 and M3 growth in

recent months, the staff has revised down projected growth for those

aggregates in 1996. M2 is now expected to increase at a 4-1/2 percent

rate this year and M3 at a 5-3/4 percent rate under alternative B,

somewhat below the upper ends of their growth ranges for the year.

Over the August-to-December period, the expansion of M2 is projected

to pick up to about a 4-3/4 percent pace, broadly in line with GDP

growth under alternative B. The pickup in M2 should show through to

M3, and growth in the latter is forecast to strengthen to a 6 percent

rate over the final four months of this year, abetted by a strengthen-

ing of the expansion of bank credit. Continued large sweeps of other

checkable deposits and demand deposits will distort measured M1. In-

deed, M1 is projected to run off at about a 5 percent annual rate over

the August-to-December period, while expansion of sweep-adjusted M1

increases to a 6-1/2 percent rate.

Directive Language

(14) Presented below is draft wording for the operational

paragraph that includes the usual options for Committee consideration.

OPERATIONAL PARAGRAPH

In the implementation of policy for the immediate

future, the Committee seeks to DECREASE (SOMEWHAT/SLIGHT-

LY)/maintain/INCREASE (SOMEWHAT/SLIGHTLY) the existing

degree of pressure on reserve positions. In the context

of the Committee's long-run objectives for price stability

and sustainable economic growth, and giving careful con-

sideration to economic, financial, and monetary develop-

ments, somewhat (SLIGHTLY) greater reserve restraint would

(MIGHT) or slightly (SOMEWHAT) lesser reserve restraint

might (WOULD) be acceptable in the intermeeting period.

The contemplated reserve conditions are expected to be

consistent with moderate growth in M2 and M3 over coming

months.
