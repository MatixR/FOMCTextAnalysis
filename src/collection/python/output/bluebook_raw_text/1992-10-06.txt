MONETARY POLICY ALTERNATIVES

Recent Developments

(1) The degree of reserve pressure was left unchanged after

the August 18 FOMC meeting, with federal funds expected to continue to

trade around 3-1/4 percent. However, on September 4, in response to a

weak employment report and in the context of money growth that had

picked up to only a modest rate, the Desk signalled an easing of the

intended federal funds rate to 3 percent. The actual federal funds rate

averaged around 15 basis points above intended levels during the inter-

meeting period. Higher rates owed chiefly to unexpectedly large drains

of nonborrowed reserves by market factors, especially the Treasury

balance as individual nonwithheld tax payments came in above projections

during the second half of September. And earlier this week,

quarter-end pressures added to tightness in the funds market. Addition-

ally, at times early in the period when the dollar was under substantial

downward pressure in volatile foreign exchange markets, the Desk at

times exercised particular caution in providing reserves to avoid gener-

ating expectations of further ease.

(2) Short-term market interest rates declined 15 to 45 basis

points over the intermeeting period, reflecting the System easing in

early September and the recent emergence of expectations of further

1. Unanticipated shortfalls in reserves on the final days of the
last two complete maintenance periods contributed to higher seasonal
and adjustment borrowing than built into the reserve path, though
borrowing tended to run persistently above path throughout those
periods as well. Borrowing spikes and reserve pressures at the end of
those maintenance periods may have been muted somewhat by the increase
in the carryover allowance from 2 percent to 4 percent of required
reserves plus required clearing balances, which took effect in the
period ending September 16. The Board doubled the carryover allowance
to mitigate the adverse impact on the flexibility of bank reserve
management of the two reductions in reserve requirements.



policy action in light of the continued sluggish economic expansion.

Intermediate-term yields also fell, but at the longest end of the matur-

ity spectrum rates were unchanged on balance over the intermeeting

period. The policy easing and generally weak economic data tended to

reduce bond yields, but greater concerns about the fiscal outlook and

increased uncertainty--perhaps arising in part from foreign exchange

market turmoil and policy changes abroad--acted as a counterweight.

Broad stock price indexes generally declined 2 to 4 percent on balance

over the period.

(3) Exchange markets were turbulent over the intermeeting

period and bilateral dollar exchange rates moved by widely varying

amounts. Nonetheless, on a weighted-average basis the dollar was

unchanged on balance over the period.2 The dollar weakened early in

the period, partly in response to expectations of Federal Reserve eas-

ing. On Friday, August 21, and on the following Monday the Desk inter-

vened to purchase a total of $500 million against marks

In mid-September

the dollar moved sharply higher as turmoil in European currency markets

both prompted some safe-haven buying of dollars and resulted in interest

rate reductions in Germany. In recent days, reduced strains within the

European Monetary System and heightened expectations of further ease by

the Federal Reserve have prompted renewed declines in the dollar.

(4) Tension within the EMS gave rise to

, major adjustments in monetary

policies, and the withdrawal of sterling and the lira from the exchange

rate mechanism. The Bundesbank lowered its Lombard and discount rates

2. Appreciations of 4-3/4 percent against the Canadian dollar,
11-1/2 percent against sterling, and 12 percent against the lira about
offset a 3-1/2 percent decline against the mark and a 5-1/2 percent
drop against the yen.



25 and 50 basis points, respectively, and short-term market rates in

Germany have declined about 85 basis points. Reacting to these de-

clines, short-term interest rates also fell on balance in Switzerland,

the Netherlands, and Belgium. Following a sharp but short-lived

increase in interest rates to bolster the pound, the Bank of England

lowered interest rates in association with its suspension of the pound's

membership in the ERM; on net, over the intermeeting period, official

rates in the U.K. fell 1 percentage point. In contrast, rates were

raised in Italy and in France to defend currency values. Interest rates

in Japan are little changed since the FOMC meeting. The Canadians

raised interest rates

Averaging across these disparate interest rate

movements, short-term rates abroad have risen somewhat over the inter-

meeting period, but long-term rates have declined.

(5) The monetary aggregates strengthened over the past two

months, although both of the broad aggregates remain somewhat below

their target cones. M2 rose at around a 3 percent rate in both August

and September, marking a considerable turnaround from the declines

posted on balance from March through July. M3 growth also turned posi-

tive, averaging 2 percent in August and September. For the June-to-

September period, M2 and M3 expanded at 1-3/4 and 1 percent rates,

respectively, roughly consistent with the Committee's expectations for

growth over the June-to-December period of 2 and 1/2 percent, for M2 and

M3. On a quarterly average basis, M2 was unchanged in the third quarter

and, based on the Greenbook projection for GDP, M2 velocity rose at a 4

percent rate--again well in excess of what might have been expected from

previous changes in market interest rates.



(6) While M2 growth remains unusually subdued, its pickup over

the past two months does appear to reflect the cumulative effects of

declines in market interest rates and the related drop in opportunity

costs since the end of June. Demand deposit growth, already strong,

accelerated further in the last two months, likely owing to the effects

of lower money market yields on earnings credit rates for compensating

balances and on incentives to economize on cash balances. In September,

a rise in mortgage refinancing activity associated with the previous

decline in mortgage rates also boosted demand deposits. Liquid house-

hold deposits, including other checkable deposits, accelerated over

August and September; although depository institutions have reduced

rates on liquid deposits quickly this year, opportunity costs on such

deposits still have declined. With currency growth strengthening as

well, apparently owing in part to foreign demand. M1 growth averaged

17 percent over August and September. Small time deposits and

M2-type money market mutual fund shares extended their declines, prob-

ably owing in part to flows into bond and stock mutual funds; those

flows remained strong in August and reportedly in September. Although

large time deposits continued to contract in the last two months, the

runoff at commercial banks slowed, perhaps owing to faster growth of

bank credit.

(7) Bank credit expanded at 5-1/2 percent rates in both August

and September, up from less than 1 percent over the previous two months.

The turnaround in bank credit was attributable to a strengthening of

loans, which ran off more slowly in August and increased in September.

Last month, business loans expanded for the first time since last

3. Required reserves picked up in association with the accelera-
tion in M1 deposits, boosting the increase in total reserves to a 22
percent rate over August and September, and the monetary base to a 16
percent pace.



October. With the prime rate, at 6 percent, remaining unusually high

relative to bank funding costs, the increase in business loans appeared

to reflect stronger demand rather than any significant easing of supply

restraint. Business financing needs seem to have remained modest in

recent months and stronger loan demand may have owed in part to a moder-

ation in issuance of bonds and stocks by nonfinancial firms. In the

household sector, overall credit demands, while perhaps picking up a

bit, also seem to have continued weak. Adjusted for securitizations,

consumer loans at banks expanded at a slower pace in August and Septem-

ber than in the previous two months, as did home equity loans. Mortgage

refinancing activity, however, has remained strong, and net mortgage

growth may have picked up a little. In municipal bond markets, issuance

has been rapid, but most of the proceeds have been used for refinancing.

Altogether, growth of the debt of nonfederal sectors has strengthened a-

little in recent months, but it remains below the pace of spending.

While federal borrowing tailed off in September, it had remained heavy

through August, helping to lift growth of nonfinancial sector debt from

the fourth quarter of 1991 to 4-3/4 percent, a little above the bottom

of its 4-1/2 to 8-1/2 percent monitoring range.

Policy Alternatives

(8) Two alternatives are presented below for the Committee's

consideration. Under alternative B, federal funds would continue to

trade around 3 percent, in association with an initial assumption for

adjustment plus seasonal borrowing of $200 million.4  Under the

easier policy stance of alternative A, the expected federal funds rate

would be cut to 2-1/2 percent. Although moving the funds rate below the

discount rate is technically feasible, implementing this alternative

through a reduction of at least 1/2 point in the discount rate would

accord with the usual practice of keeping the expected funds rate at or

above the discount rate. With a 1/2 percentage point drop in the dis-

count rate, for example, an initial borrowing assumption of $200 million

would be retained under alternative A.

(9) Projected growth rates of the monetary aggregates under

the two policy alternatives appear on the table below. (The table and

charts on the following pages give more detailed data.) The differences

between the money growth paths in alternatives A and B over the next

three months are relatively small, as the near-term responsiveness of

demands for M2 to declines in short-term interest rates is likely to

continue to be damped. This lack of responsiveness arises from the

relatively strong effects of a steeper yield curve and lower short-term

rates on the attractiveness of capital market instruments and from the

prompter adjustment of deposit rates relative to both market rates and

loan rates. Growth in M2 and M3 over June to December would be about in

line with the Committee's expectations for this period expressed in the

last directive. Both aggregates would fall short of the lower bounds of

4. Over the intermeeting period, seasonal borrowing will trend
down, as is typical at this time of year, so technical reductions in
the borrowing assumption probably will be needed.



their annual ranges by about 1/2 percentage point under either alterna-

tive.5 The similar outcomes for the year projected in the two alter-

natives reflect both the reduced near-term interest elasticity and the

lateness in the year.

(10) The spate of weak incoming economic information since

late last week has reestablished market expectations that another

easing of reserve conditions may well be imminent, involving an an-

ticipated further decline in the federal funds rate by 1/4 percentage

point. Under these circumstances, selection of the unchanged reserve

conditions of alternative B would initially induce some backup in

interest rates across the maturity spectrum and some rise in the ex-

change value of the dollar. This upward pressure would be muted to

the extent that market participants viewed any policy action as merely

5. To attain the lower bounds of their annual ranges, M2 and M3
would need to grow by 5 and 3-1/4 percent, respectively, from Septem-
ber to December.

postponed. The market's expectations of an eventual ease would be

strengthened should incoming data confirm the tepid expansion and

disinflationary trends in the Greenbook forecast. That forecast en-

compasses the possibility of some decline in short-term rates over

coming months, but keeping the funds rate at 3 percent over the six

weeks of the intermeeting period would not necessarily be inconsistent

with that possibility. In any event, a decline in long-term rates

could eventually develop even at an unchanged funds rate as evidence

of disinflation takes firm enough hold to offset skittishness about

fiscal policy; indeed, failing to meet market expectations about

policy easing could well strengthen perceptions that the disinflation

trend will be sustained.

(11) Under alternative B, M2 is projected to grow at a

2 percent rate from September to December, somewhat slower than in the

last two months. Monetary growth will be boosted for a time by addi-

tions to demand deposits associated with prepayments on mortgage-

backed securities arising from robust refinancings and to OCDs from

the reclassification of sweep accounts However,

nominal income growth is projected to moderate in the fourth quarter.

Moreover, despite the special factors and lingering effects of pre-

vious policy stimulus, projected M2 growth stays below that of nominal

GDP because of the probable persistence of the forces that have been

boosting M2 velocity for some time. In particular, the further de-

clines in liquid deposit rates in prospect, in combination with a

still steep Treasury yield curve, will continue to encourage shifts

into bond and stock mutual funds from M2 balances. In addition, the

6. About $4-1/2 billion of such accounts, which have been clas-
sified as large time deposits since their introduction in July 1990,
will be reclassified as transaction deposits at the end of October.
Ml as a whole is expected to record a 12-1/2 percent rate of growth
from September to December. With currency and total reserves growth
projected at 9-1/2 and 17-1/2 percent, respectively, over these three
months, the monetary base would expand at an 11 percent rate.



-11-

gap between consumer loan rates and deposit rates will stay wide by

historical standards, tending to foster a further rechannelling of

funds away from M2 and toward household debt repayment or avoidance.

The growth in M2 velocity in the fourth quarter of nearly 1 percent

would bring its expansion over this year to 2-1/2 percent. Were the

federal funds rate to be maintained at 3 percent beyond the Committee

meeting in November, M2 growth in the first quarter probably would be

on a trajectory below the Committee's tentative 2-1/2 to 6-1/2 percent

range, with continued sizeable velocity increases.

(12) Under alternative B, the staff foresees M3 growth of

1 percent from September to December, also somewhat slower than over

August and September. Institution-only money funds have lost the rate

advantage they temporarily enjoyed relative to market instruments

immediately after recent policy easings. Furthermore, the runoffs of

large time deposits at banks as well as thrifts are expected to pick

up again. Bank credit growth is seen as moderating from its pace of

recent months as the unusually rapid pace of security acquisitions

drops off, meaning bank needs for net new financing should abate.

Bank lending terms and standards will probably remain quite restric-

tive, possibly easing only a little, and demands for business and

consumer credit at banks seem likely to remain very subdued.

(13) Overall credit demands will remain modest in the face

of continuing concerns about economic prospects, and they will be

concentrated in longer-term markets as balance sheets continue to be

strengthened. The slightly stronger pace of borrowing by nonfederal

sectors that has developed over the summer is expected to persist.

Borrowers may be a bit less intent on paying down debt given improving

financial situations and cash flows, and credit supply conditions

should remain stable or improve slightly as capital positions of

intermediaries become more comfortable. From August to December,



-12-

business debt is expected to grow slowly, with increases in internal

funds nearly matching the rise in capital spending. Household debt

also is foreseen to grow slowly, with its expansion wholly attribut-

able to mortgage borrowing; incentives to prepay or avoid consumer

debt should keep this component about flat after its previous sus-

tained runoff. The rate of expansion of federal debt on a seasonally

adjusted basis is running temporarily to the low side following the

unexpected buildup in cash balances in September. As a result, total

debt of domestic nonfinancial sectors is projected to slip off to only

a 4-1/2 percent rate, leaving growth over the four quarters of this

year around the 4-1/2 percent lower bound of its annual monitoring

range.

(14) The immediate 1/2 percentage point drop in the federal

funds rate under alternative A would exceed the market's expected

change. Short-term market interest rates would decline by as much as

1/4 point further, and banks would reduce the prime rate by 1/2 point,

maintaining an unusually wide spread over funding costs. The dollar

probably would depreciate somewhat further; since the policy easing

would occur in a situation of persistent macroeconomic slack and ongo-

ing disinflation, the decline in the dollar is most likely to be con-

tained. In such circumstances, long-term market rates probably would

move still lower, pulled down by the weight of a reduced expected path

for short-term rates over at least the intermediate term.

(15) Under alternative A, M2 and M3 likely would grow at

rates of 2-3/4 and 1-1/4 percent over the September-to-December

interval. The two aggregates should be on a somewhat steeper trajec-

tory into next year, raising the odds that they would be within their

tentative ranges in the early months of 1993. In addition to the

limited stimulus to M2 demands arising from the reduction in oppor-

tunity costs, spending by then should have begun to respond to the



-13-

monetary policy easing embodied in alternative A. Real interest rates

would be lower than under alternative B, though actual declines in

real rates may be limited by a continued ebbing of inflation expec-

tations. Although some kinds of spending may now be less responsive

to interest rates, lower rates still would speed balance sheet

strengthening, buoy wealth, and support net exports.

the usual options and updating is presented below.

OPERATIONAL PARAGRAPH

In the implementation of policy for the immediate

future, the Committee seeks to DECREASE SOMEWHAT/main-

tain/INCREASE SOMEWHAT the existing degree of pressure

on reserve positions. In the context of the Committee's

long-run objectives for price stability and sustainable

economic growth, and giving careful consideration to

economic, financial, and monetary developments, slightly

(SOMEWHAT) greater reserve restraint might (WOULD) or

slightly (SOMEWHAT) lesser reserve restraint (MIGHT)

would be acceptable in the intermeeting period. The

contemplated reserve conditions are expected to be

consistent with growth of M2 and M3 over the period from

SEPTEMBER June through December at annual rates of about
