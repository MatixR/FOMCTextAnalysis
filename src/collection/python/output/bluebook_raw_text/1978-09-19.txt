Prefatory Note 

 
 

The attached document represents the most complete and accurate version 
available based on original copies culled from the files of the FOMC Secretariat at the 
Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System.  This electronic document was 
created through a comprehensive digitization process which included identifying the best-
preserved paper copies, scanning those copies,1 and then making the scanned versions 
text-searchable.2  Though a stringent quality assurance process was employed, some 
imperfections may remain. 
 

Please note that this document may contain occasional gaps in the text.  These 
gaps are the result of a redaction process that removed information obtained on a 
confidential basis.  All redacted passages are exempt from disclosure under applicable 
provisions of the Freedom of Information Act.    

 

                                                 
1 In some cases, original copies needed to be photocopied before being scanned into electronic format.  All 
scanned images were deskewed (to remove the effects of printer- and scanner-introduced tilting) and lightly 
cleaned (to remove dark spots caused by staple holes, hole punches, and other blemishes caused after initial 
printing). 
2 A two-step process was used.  An advanced optimal character recognition computer program (OCR) first 
created electronic text from the document image.  Where the OCR results were inconclusive, staff checked 
and corrected the text as necessary.   Please note that the numbers and text in charts and tables were not 
reliably recognized by the OCR process and were not checked or corrected by staff.

Recent developments

(1) Growth in M-1 picked up to about a 7¾ per cent annual

rate in August and appears to be accelerating further in September.

For August and September, M-1 is projected to expand at about a 9 per

cent annual rate, one percentage point above the upper end of the FOMC's

short-run range. M-2 is projected to increase at about an 11¼ per cent

annual rate over August and September, more than one percentage point

above the upper end of the Committee's range.1/ M-2 growth has been

bolstered by a continued sharp rise in the large denomination time

deposits included in this measure. Savings deposits at banks also

increased markedly in August following two months of decline.

1/ These figures do not incorporate revisions based on recently available
March 1978 Call Report benchmark data for nonmember banks and technical
adjustments related to a recently discovered cash items bias. The
revised aggregates will be published on September 21. As shown in
Appendix Table III, the benchmark revisions increase growth rates for
M-1 by 0.5 percentage point for the year-to-date and reduce the growth
rate for M-2 over the same period by 0.3 of a point. All tables on
subsequent pages of this report (with the exception of Appendix V and
the first table following the appendices) are based on the revised
series.



Growth in total deposits at thrift institutions was sustained in August

and early September at about July's rapid pace, although survey results--

available for S&L's--indicate that sales of the 6-month certificate in

August dropped to roughly half the rate of June and July.

(2) Following the August FOMC meeting, incoming data

suggested that growth in the key aggregates over August and September

would likely be around the upper ends of the ranges specified by the

Committee. Accordingly, by late August the Account Management had raised

the funds rate objective to the 8¼ per cent area, the upper end of the

range specified by the FOMC at its August meeting. On September 8, with

M-1 and M-2 both projected to grow at rates significantly above the

upper ends of their respective ranges, the FOMC, in a telephone meeting,

voted to raise the higher end of the funds rate range to 8 ½ per cent

and instructed the Desk to aim promptly for a Federal funds rate of

8-3/8 per cent. On August 18, for international as well as domestic

reasons, the discount rate was raised 1/2 of a percentage point to 7-3/4

per cent. However, until the most recent week, member bank borrowing

remained relatively large, reflecting the further rise in the Federal

funds and other money market rates. On September 15, major banks initiated

an increase in the prime rate from 9-1/4 to 9-1/2 per cent.

(3) Yields on short-dated market instruments generally have

advanced around ½ to ¾ percentage point since the August FOMC meeting.

Bond market yields, on the other hand, have continued to move down

somewhat, apparently in part because participants still hold the view

that, with economic activity slowing, interest rates are near their

peak levels for the current expansion period.



(4) As can be seen in the table below, since reaching their

highest levels of the current expansion in the week before the July

FOMC meeting, long-term corporate yields have declined about ½ percentage

point. This decline reflects not only the shift in interest rate

expectations that occurred in July, but also the relatively light

corporate financing calendar. Declines in yields on municipal bonds

have been more moderate, as a heavy volume of refunding activity

pushed the total volume of offerings in this sector to a record level

in August. While the proceeds from these refundings were channeled

into nonmarketable Treasury debt, the Treasury also has sold a sub-

stantial volume of marketable debt in the period. In contrast to bond

yields, short-term interest rates have advanced on balance since mid-

July along with the rise in the Federal funds rate; upward pressures on

bill rates were reinforced by foreign central banks sales of about

$1.7 billion of these instruments since the August FOMC meeting.

(5) Real estate and consumer loans at banks are estimated

to have posted further large gains in August. Growth in business

loans also picked up but remained well below rates established in the

first half of the year. In addition to funds obtained from growth in

M-2 type deposits, banks financed the expansion in their loan port-

folios by increasing their nondeposit liabilities and reducing their

security holdings. Given improved deposits flows, outstanding mortgage

commitments at S&L's did not fall further, following a number of months

of decline, and their mortgage lending probably picked up in August.

Yields on new conventional mortgages have edged a bit lower in recent

weeks.

rates of change in related monetary and financial flows over various

time periods.

Prospective developments

(7) The table below presents for Committee consideration

two alternative specifications for the Federal funds rate and the

monetary aggregates for the September-October period. (More detailed

and longer-term data are contained in the tables on pp. 7 and 8).

Alt. A Alt. B

Ranges for Sept.-Oct.

M-1 6½ to 10½ 6 to 10

M-2 8 to 12 7½ to 11½

Federal funds rate
(Intermeeting period) 8 to 8¾ 8¼ to 9

(8) Alternative A contemplates a Federal funds rate between

now and the next meeting centered on the prevailing 8-3/8 per cent

level. Growth in M-1 over the September-October period is expected

to be in a 6½ to 10½ per cent annual rate range, largely in reflection

of the stronger growth of this aggregate that appears in train for

September. If M-1 expands at the mid-point of the expected range,

its October level will be above that implied by the upper

end of the FOMC's current longer-run range, as indicated in the upper

panel of Chart 1 on the following page.

(9) For the third quarter, the annual rate of M-1 growth

is expected to be around 7-1/4 per cent. This represents a considerable

slowing from the rate of the second quarter, and reflects the decelera-

tion of economic activity from the extraordinary spring pace and the

lagged response to rising short-term interest rates.

(10) Expansion in M-2 under alternative A is likely to be in

an 8 to 12 per cent annual rate range over the September-October period,

raising this aggregate by October to the level implied by the top of

its current longer-run range, as shown in the top panel of Chart 2.

The interest-bearing component of M-2 is expected to slow markedly from

its recent pace as the year progresses. However, given the strength of

time and savings deposits thus far in September, growth over the September-

October period in the time deposit component of M-2 may be at around an

11 per cent annual rate--considerably above the average pace of the

first half of the year. Savings deposit growth is not likely to be sus-

tained at the August pace, but issuance of 6-month certificates should

support growth of small time deposits and banks are expected to con-

tinue to sell sizable amounts of large-denomination time deposits to

meet loan demands.

(11) The staff continues to expect inflows of deposits to

thrift institutions to slow from their extraordinarily rapid recent rate,

which has been affected by continued shifts from existing financial

assets to the new money market certificates. Nevertheless, because

deposit growth at S&L's and MSB's has been larger than expected in recent

weeks, our projection of total thrift deposit flows has been raised from

the last month. Indeed, with growth in the other monetary aggregates

also strong, it is likely, as shown in the upper panel of Chart 3, that

M-3 in October will be somewhat above the level implied by the upper end

of the FOMC's current longer-run range.

(12) If the Federal funds rate remains around 8-3/8 per cent

over the intermeeting period, as envisioned under alternative A, short-

term market interest rates would be expected to remain near current

levels. The recent increases in short-term rates appear to have kept

them in alignment with the funds rate. Although short-term credit

demands of both financial and nonfinancial businesses may pick up in

September and October, following a weakening in August, they are likely

to remain more moderate than over the first half of the year. Demands

for short-term funds from sponsored agencies should moderate somewhat

in the weeks ahead from their strong summer pace,in view of the recent

strength in thrift deposit flows, and the Treasury will probably not

tap the bill market for new money until the latter part of the fourth

quarter.

(13) Longer-term yields also may change little under alterna-

tive A, and could even edge down a little further, unless incoming data

come to suggest a more rapid rate of inflation or stronger expansion in

real activity than the market is currently expecting. Municipal bond

issuance has dropped off substantially in September and will likely con-

tinue at a reduced pace in October. Corporate bond offerings are likely

to pick up only seasonally from the recent relatively light pace. The

Treasury is expected to rise only about $3.0 billion of new money in

late September in auctions of 2-year and 5-year notes, and will then

not be back in the market until late October. Moreover, institutional

investors apparently still have a considerable volume of liquid funds



-11-

available for investment, and dealer positions are light. The recent

rapid growth of thrift deposits suggests that mortgage market rates

will likely fluctuate around current levels in coming weeks.

(14) Alternative B calls for an increase in the Federal

funds rate by mid-October to around the midpoint of an 8-1/4 to 9 per

cent range. M-1 growth would likely be in a 6 to 10 per cent annual

rate range over September-October and M-2 growth in a 7-1/2 to 11-1/2

per cent range. The further increase in short-term rates would be

expected to slow the inflows of interest-bearing deposits subject to

regulatory ceilings at banks and thrifts, but recent evidence suggests

that the new 6-month certificates will probably blunt some of the

impact of rising rates on deposit growth, especially at thrifts.

(15) The modest increase in the funds rate contemplated

under alternative B is, of course, likely to have some upward impact

on short-term market rates of interest. However, such rates may rise

by less than the funds rate--and long-term rates by quite small amounts--

if market participants act on the assumption that the peak in interest

rates is even closer at hand. A further increase in the funds rate

would reinforce market expectations of another adjustment in the dis-

count rate. Barring such an adjustment, member bank borrowing would

be likely to increase noticeably.

(16) Under either alternative A or B, short-term interest

rates are expected to come under further upward pressure before year-

end. With nominal GNP projected to rise at an annual rate of more than



-12-

11 per cent over the balance of the longer-run policy period, the Federal

funds rate might have to rise to 9 to 9-1/4 per cent during the fourth

quarter if growth in M-1 is to be constrained to around the upper limit

1/2/of its range over the current longer-run policy period. The rise in

market interest rates and the anticipated completion of the stock adjust-

ment to the new 6-month certificates is expected to slow the pace of

inflows into interest-bearing deposits subject to regulatory ceilings,

and growth in both M-2 and M-3 over the QII '78 to QII '79 policy period

is projected to be in the upper half of their longer-run ranges.

1/ The staff's projections for the Federal funds rate through mid-1979
are shown in appendix I and for velocity growth rates in appendix II.

2/ Growth in measured M-1 is expected to slow in the fourth and subsequent
quarters if the Board regulation with regard to automatic transfers from
savings to demand deposits becomes effective November 1. No allowance has
been made for such a slowing in the estimates presented in this blue book.
Banks are just beginning to publish their pricing schedules for the automa-
tic transfer service. Even after most are published, competitive pressures
will undoubtedly tend to change them and in any event it will be very difficult
to project the probable public response and the extent to which M-1 will
become distorted. These uncertainties about the size of the resulting dis-
tortion in M-1 suggest the desirability of supplementing M-1 and M-2 with
another measure that would be less affected than M-1 and would still be a
reasonable indicator of transactions demands for money. Such a measure--
termed M-1+ and defined as M-1 plus savings deposits at commercial banks
and transactions balances at thrift institutions--is presented in appendix V.



-13-

Directive language

(17) Given below are suggested operational paragraphs for

the directive. Alternative language consistent with the short-run

specifications of the alternatives discussed in the preceding section

is shown for the Committee's objective for the Federal funds rate early

in the period. At a later point, alternative language is also provided

for placing main emphasis either on monetary aggregates or on money

market conditions. The specifications adopted at the August meeting

as modified at the telephone meeting on September 8 are shown in strike-

through form.

In the short run, the Committee seeks to achieve bank

reserve and money market conditions that are broadly consistent

with the longer-run ranges for monetary aggregates cited above,

while giving due regard to developing conditions in domestic

and international financial markets more generally. Early in

the period until the next regular meeting, System open market

operations shall be directed at attaining a weekly-average

Federal funds rate

(A) AT ABOUT THE CURRENT LEVEL
(B) slightly (OR SOMEWHAT) above the current level.

Subsequently, operations shall be directed at maintaining the

weekly-average Federal funds rate within the range of [DEL: 7-3/4 to

8-1/2] ____ TO ____ per cent. In deciding on the specific

objective for the Federal funds rate the Manager shall be guided



-14-

mainly by the relationship between the latest estimates of

annual rates of growth in the [DEL: August-September] SEPTEMBER-

OCTOBER period of M-1 and M-2 and the following ranges of

tolerance: [DEL: 4-to-8] ____ TO ____ per cent for M-1 and

[DEL: 6-to-10] ____ TO ____ per cent for M-2. If, giving

approximately equal weight to M-1 and M-2, their rates of

growth appear to be

Monetary aggregates emphasis

significantly above or below the midpoints

Money market emphasis

close to or beyond the upper or lower limits

of the indicated ranges, the objective for the funds rate shall

be raised or lowered in an orderly fashion within its range.

If the rates of growth in the aggregates appear to be above

the upper limit or below the lower limit of the indicated ranges

at a time when the objective for the funds rate has already been

moved to the corresponding limit of its range, the Manager is

promptly to notify the Chairman who will then decide whether the

situation calls for supplementary instructions from the Committee.

Appendix III

Revisions in the Monetary Aggregates

Benchmark adjustments for domestic nonmember banks and

data associated with a recently discovered cash items bias problem

have been incorporated into the money stock series and related data.

The benchmark adjustments are based on the March 1978 call report and

affect deposit levels from January 1978 to date. The cash items bias

adjustment gradually raises the level of the series from mid-1975 to

date. Both M-1 and M-2 grew at an 8.0 per cent annual rate over the

first three quarters of 1978, on the revised basis, compared with

rates of 7.5 and 8.3 per cent, respectively, for the old series.

The impact of benchmark and cash items bias adjustments on annual,

quarterly and monthly M-1 and M-2 growth rates are shown in Tables

III-1 and III-2.

The benchmark adjustments raised the level of M-1 about

$500 million in March 1978 and about $1 billion in August. The level

of M-2 was reduced about $700 million in March and $2 billion in August.

As shown in column 4 of Tables III-1 and III-2, over the first three

quarters of 1978 the benchmark adjustment added 0.3 percentage points

to M-1 growth and reduced M-2 growth by a like amount.

The cash items adjustment corrects for a recently discovered

bias associated with transfers of funds by some agencies and branches

of foreign banks in New York City on behalf of directly-related insti-

tutions. Foreign related banking institutions in New York City have

begun to transfer funds for directly-related institutions (parent and



III-2

subsidiaries) by drawing checks on accounts held by the related institu-

tion at the New York City office; some of these transfers apparently

began as early as mid-1975. In effect the New York office was acting

as agent for the directly related institution. Since funds due to a

directly-related institution are not recorded as deposits, but rather

as other liabilities, the cash items generated by these checks are not

matched by a demand deposit account, and their deduction in the

calculation of money stock measures is therefore inappropriate. Also,

since these checks are not officers checks of the New York City

agency or branch, they are not included in officers checks data

collected to adjust for cash items bias generated by transfers of funds

for regular customers by these institutions. In order to correct for

this relatively small but growing bias, data were collected from foreign

agencies and branches in New York City to provide an estimate of the

amount of cash items bias such transfers generated from mid-1975 to

April 1978. Since May 1978 daily data are available and will be available

on a continuing basis. In the most recent period, this bias adjustment

amounts to about $1 billion.

As can be seen in columns 4 of Tables III- and III-2 the

impact of the cash items adjustment on annual and quarterly growth rates

was minor. Because of the volatility of the series, however, individual

monthly M-1 growth rates were raised or lowered as much as 1¼ percentage

points. Impacts on monthly M-2 growth rates were smaller.

APPENDIX V

Automatic Transfers and a Supplemental Monetary Aggregate

When automatic transfers become available November 1 new uncer-

tainties will arise regarding both projected growth in demand deposits

and the interpretation of M-1 growth.1/ This new service will permit con-

sumers to substitute savings balances, earning explicit interest, for

demand deposits, earning no explicit yield. Thus, automatic transfers

can be expected to weaken the demand deposit component of M-1--of which

consumer deposits are approximately one-third of the total-and simulta-

neously increase savings balances at commercial banks. While commercial

banks may also attract funds from thrift institutions and from other

sources, it is the Board staff's judgment that the volume of any such

inflows will probably be small and that the bulk of funds attracted to

savings accounts subject to automatic transfers will likely come from

household demand accounts.

The extent of the shift from demand to savings accounts will de-

pend heavily on the promotional activity and pricing of this service by

commercial banks. A recent informal and confidential System-wide survey of

1/ The impact of automatic transfers on M-1 and M-2 growth was discussed
in Appendix IV of the July 1978 Bluebook.

NOTE: Data contained in this appendix, including accompanying tables and
charts, do not reflect the recent benchmark to the March 1978 Call
report.



commercial banks indicates that a very high proportion of banks are

planning to offer this service beginning in November. Many of these

banks indicated that they intend to promote automatic transfers actively.

Less clear at this time are the typical pricing features of

automatic transfer programs. Many banks have not yet finalized their pricing

schedules, and others are very reluctant to divulge such sensitive com-

petitive information, but the survey suggests that pricing plans are

likely to vary widely among banks, at least initially.1/ In general,

though, respondent banks indicated that they expect their rivals to

actively promote this new service and they are willing to meet this com-

petition in order to protect their market shares. In view of this evidence,

the staff believes that the amount by which automatic transfers will de-

press M-1 growth in the first three quarters they are offered may be in the

middle or perhaps the upper portion of the 1 to 3-1/2 annual percentage

2/point range estimated previously.- Nevertheless, it should be emphasized

that these estimates remain crude and there continues to be a great deal

of uncertainty regarding the impact of automatic transfers on deposit con-

versions and M-1 growth.

1/ Many banks offering information on their pricing plans mentioned terms-
frequently involving monthly maintenance charges and per transfer fees-
that would appeal mainly to their large household depositors, generally
those with average balances in excess of $1,000. Fragmentary information
on the distribution of household checking balances by size of account
indicates that such large accounts contain over one-half of total house-
hold balances.

2/ The lower end of this range is based on 6 per cent of consumer demand
deposits converting to savings in the first year, while the upper end
is based on conversions of 18 per cent. The 1 to 3 percentage point
range for the impact on M-1 growth reported in the July Bluebook was for
the QII '78 to QII '79 period and the 1 to 3-1/2 percentage point range
given above is for the QIII '78 to QII '79 period.



V-3

Since most of the conversions to savings balances are likely

to come from demand deposits, a somewhat broader aggregate than M-1-

which includes both kinds of accounts-will be less vulnerable to distor-

tions caused by automatic transfers. Board staff has, for some time, been

conducting research on a variety of alternative definitions of money

which reflect recent innovations in the payments mechanism and the changing

character of depository institution liabilities. A full scale study

is expected to be completed in several months. But in view of the impend-

ing problems for interpreting M-1 posed by automatic transfers. Board

staff has constructed a supplemental aggregate that may be useful, at least

during the transition period in which significant conversions are expected

to occur. Table V-1 shows the composition of this aggregate, which is

tentatively being called M-+. Besides M-1, it includes savings deposits

at commercial banks, NOW accounts at thrifts, credit union share drafts

and demand deposits at MSBs. Alternatively, more emphasis could be placed

on M-2, as currently defined, although M-1+ is likely to be more closely

related to transactions and not as sensitive to shifts among time deposits

and other financial assets.

M-1+ equaled $581 billion in August, as compared with M-1 of

$354 billion. The largest single component of M-1+, as with the current

M-1, is demand deposits at commercial banks, followed by commercial bank

savings, and then by currency; total NOW balances and other transactions

balances at thrifts make up a very small portion of the total. Chart V-1

shows how the composition of this aggregate has changed over time. Some

of the increase in the share of savings balances included in M-1+ and the

concurrent fall in the share of demand deposits during 1975 and 1976

resulted from shifts from demand deposits to savings associated with

regulatory changes. However, the bulk of the decline in the demand

deposit share is believed to have stemmed from the widespread applica-

tion of cash management techniques while the rise in the savings share

reflected relatively low market rates of interest during this period.

Quarterly growth rates of M-1+--along with current M-1--are

shown in Chart V-2. Since savings-which tend to be sensitive to change-

ing market yields-are an important component of M-1+, growth of M-1+

has been more responsive than M-1 to the difference between market yields

and regulatory ceilings, shown in the lower panel of the chart. When

market rates were low relative to regulatory ceilings, such as in 1971 and

1972 and again in 1975 and 1976, savings growth tended to be substantial

and M-1+ expanded more rapidly than M-1. Conversely, during those times

when market rates rose appreciably above ceilings, such as in 1969, again

in 1973, and more recently since late 1977, growth of M-1+ tended to fall

below that of M-1. Table V-2 compares growth rates of M-1 and M-1+ over four-

quarter policy periods, beginning in early 1975. During all but the two

most recent policy periods, growth of M-1+ outpaced that of M-1, in some

cases by about 6 percentage points-when market rates were relatively low.

In the two most recent policy periods, however, growth in M-1+ dropped be-

low that of M-1, reflecting the impact on savings deposits of increases in

market yields during these periods. The lower portion of Table V-3 contains

growth rates of M-1 and M-1+ for recent months.

The public's demands for these alternative measures of money

relative to GNP move inversely with their velocities, which are shown in

Chart V-3. Velocities of both M-1 and M-1+ have trended upward over this

period, as the public has tended to economize on its holdings of these

balances relative to GNP. In addition, both velocities have displayed

movement around their respective trends, in part related to the interest

rate cycle. However, during the years 1975 and 1976 M-1 velocity rose at

an unusually fast pace-at a time when the spread of cash management

techniques along with changes in regulatory policy depressed M-1 growth.

In contrast, movements in M-1+ velocity appear to have been dominated by

relatively low rates of interest in these years.

Econometric evidence on the demand for M-1+ indicates a rea-

sonably close relationship between the demand for this aggregate and

income and interest rates. While automatic transfers are likely to alter

the demand relationships for both M-1 and M-1+, it is believed that the

overall demand for M-1+ will be much less affected during the transition

period, as the principal changes in the behavior of this aggregate are

likely to be compositional. During this transition period, M-1+ is likely

to be more predictable, based on historical relationships, than M-1

Data on M-1+ are available weekly and involve about the same

amount of estimation as for M-1. While Board staff has had no experience

in projecting this new aggregate, no special problems are anticipated

over and above those that would be encountered in projecting M-1 and M-2.

NOTE: Government security dealer trading positions are on a commitment basis. Trading positions, which exclude Treasury securities
