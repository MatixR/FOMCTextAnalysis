  1.  The FOMC’s decision at its December meeting to leave the target federal funds rate at
1-1/4 percent and to maintain a neutral balance-of-risks assessment was widely anticipated
and elicited little reaction in financial markets.  The box on the next page discusses the
implementation of monetary policy over the intermeeting period.

MONETARY POLICY ALTERNATIVES

Recent Developments

(1) Over the intermeeting period, prices in financial markets were buffeted

by shifting perceptions of global risks, including the situations in Iraq and North

Korea and the disruptions to oil supplies in Venezuela.1  U.S. economic releases were

mostly mixed, although since the surprisingly strong ISM report in early January

market participants have mostly been disappointed with incoming data.  Adding to

that discontent, the guidance many firms have been offering during the current

corporate reporting season about earnings prospects and capital spending plans has

been downbeat.  That said, the absence of a major revelation of corporate wrongdoing

seemed to lighten investors’ concerns on that score.  In addition, the unveiling of the

Administration’s economic stimulus package, which was larger than had been

previously anticipated, created the sense that substantial additional fiscal impetus is in

train.  Market participants apparently are now betting that the fourth-quarter lull in

economic activity will linger a bit longer than had previously been expected, at least as

can be read from money market futures.  These contracts suggest that the FOMC will

stay on hold well into the third quarter and tighten by almost ½ percentage point less

by mid-2004 than was expected at the time of the December meeting.  

(2) Against this backdrop of revised policy expectations, Treasury note

yields shed 10 to 20 basis points on net over the intermeeting period.  The yield on

the ten-year on-the-run indexed security fell about 1/4 percentage point, implying that

inflation compensation ticked higher over the period.  However, market

The Implementation of Monetary Policy over the Intermeeting Period
 
  The Desk relied entirely on temporary operations to offset the factors 
affecting reserves over the intermeeting period.  The trend increase in currency 
seems to have slowed some, making it unnecessary to purchase Treasury 
securities outright.  Repurchase agreements were built up to accommodate the 
holiday increase in currency in circulation and then run down as currency 
flowed back to the Federal Reserve after year-end (table).  In the event, the 
federal funds rate has averaged close to 1-1/4 percent since the December 
meeting and has mostly traded in a tight range around that level (chart).  As a 
result, only a modest volume of credit was extended through the discount 
window.  Since January 9, loans made outside the seasonal lending program 
have been charged a penalty rate under our new lending facilities.  The daily 
quantity of primary credit outstanding averaged about $9 million.  A total of 
thirty-one, predominantly small, institutions have borrowed, including twenty-
five commercial banks, five thrifts, and one credit union.  No secondary credit 
loans were extended.

participants have attributed a significant portion of the reduction in real yields to an

improvement in the liquidity of the ten-year TIIS following new auction supply. 

Supporting that assessment, survey measures of inflation expectations were little

changed.  Major equity indexes have moved in a wide range over the past six weeks;

most now stand about ½ to 1 percent below their levels at the time of the December

meeting although the NASDAQ finished up about 1-1/2 percent.  Despite this

volatility, forward-looking measures of uncertainty inferred from options prices have

come off their December peaks.  Bank stock prices edged up over the intermeeting

period, as reports confirmed that most large banks remained quite profitable in the

fourth quarter.  Moreover, subordinated debt spreads for major banking corporations

have narrowed further, even those for banks that have been under scrutiny for their

possible involvement in accounting scandals.  Indeed, more broadly in the corporate

market, a sense of diminished concern about governance issues and perhaps also

some increased appetite for risk-taking spurred a substantial decline in yields across

the credit spectrum, further narrowing risk spreads.

(3) The foreign exchange value of the dollar declined about 4-1/4 percent

against major currencies on balance over the intermeeting period.  Market anxiety

about global risks appeared to be the key factor weighing on the dollar, but concerns

about the potential vulnerability of the dollar to a general pull-back of international

capital and the weakish cast of U.S. economic data further dampened market

sentiment.  The fall occurred despite continued signs of weak growth in both the euro

area and Japan and net declines of 20 to 30 basis points in yields on their long-term

government securities.  Broad measures of stock prices were down sharply in the euro

area and about unchanged in Japan.

(4) The dollar rose about 1 percent over the intermeeting period against an

index of the currencies of our other important trading partners, mainly reflecting a

6 percent gain against the Mexican peso.  Continued above-target inflation forced the

central bank of Mexico to tighten policy in January, its third tightening in four

months.  The ongoing general strike in Venezuela has sliced oil revenue and

contributed–along with worries about the possible curtailment of crude oil from

Iraq–to a sharp rise in the price of oil on global markets.  The Venezuelan bolivar

tumbled more than 30 percent against the dollar, to a new low, and Venezuela’s

EMBI+ spread widened 475 basis points.  In contrast, financial market sentiment

toward Brazil and Argentina improved on balance over the intermeeting period. 

Market participants were encouraged by the new Brazilian administration’s signal of its

intention to run a tight fiscal policy and reform the pension system and by the

Brazilian central bank’s tightening to bring inflation back toward its target, but this

enthusiasm appears to have waned in recent days.  On net, the real rose more than

7 percent against the dollar and Brazil’s EMBI+ spread contracted 280 basis points. 

The Argentine peso appreciated nearly 13 percent versus the dollar, and the extremely

high spread on Argentina’s debt narrowed 130 basis points, as Argentina negotiated

an agreement with the IMF that will allow it to stay current on its official obligations. 

Stock markets in both Brazil and Argentina recorded sharp gains during the

intermeeting period.  In emerging Asia, tensions over the North Korean situation

weighed on South Korean equity prices, which fell nearly 14 percent. 

(5) In recent months, business demands for credit have firmed a bit, albeit

from a quite anemic pace, while household borrowing has edged off its previous rapid

rate.  Nonfinancial corporations have raised funds in the bond market on net over the

past few months after paydowns in the third quarter, and runoffs of bank loans and

commercial paper have abated somewhat.  A smaller net percentage of banks

responding on the January Bank Lending Practices survey reported that demand for

business loans continued to weaken.  However, as in the past few surveys, banks on

net continued to indicate that they had tightened terms and standards on business

loans over the past three months.  In the household sector, growth of mortgage debt

has remained robust while revolving credit appears to have decelerated, perhaps

reflecting the only modest increase in sales over the holiday season and continued

substitution of mortgage credit for other forms of consumer credit.  The federal

budget seems poised to record a small surplus this month, but is projected to return to

deficit in February. 

(6) M2 growth stepped down from a 7-3/4 percent rate in November to

about a 2-3/4 percent pace last month, considerably weaker than projected in the

December Bluebook.3  Much of the deceleration was concentrated in the liquid

components of M2, likely in part reflecting a falloff in the volume of mortgage

refinancings and the associated prepayments on mortgage-backed securities, which

boost liquid deposits for a time.  Even so, the drop-off in money growth runs counter

to the impetus that might be expected from the November policy easing.  



6

Policy Alternatives

(7) The data that have become available since the December meeting have

made even starker the contrast in the economic outlook in the past few Greenbooks

between near-term sluggishness and longer-term strength.  Businesses’ apparent

reluctance to invest and willingness to keep even leaner inventory positions brought

output growth to a standstill last quarter.  But the continued resilience of household

spending, prospects for enhanced fiscal stimulus, an upward revision to estimated

structural productivity growth, and a weaker dollar have led the staff to raise its

projection for real GDP growth this year and next.  With the funds rate target

assumed to be unchanged until tightening begins in mid-2004, stock prices rising

steadily, and corporate bond yields edging down as risk spreads narrow (all about as

projected in the December Greenbook), output is expected to expand 3-1/2 percent

this year and 4-3/4 percent in 2004, around 1/4 and ½ percentage points faster,

respectively, than in the previous forecast.  While businesses have remained cautious

about new investment and hiring, they are apparently managing to make their existing

resources more productive, leading the staff to raise its assessment of structural

productivity.  As a result, actual GDP growth is projected to remain below that of its

upward-revised potential over the first half of this year, contributing to a rise in the

unemployment rate to 6-1/4 percent.  Thereafter, economic activity is seen as

accelerating noticeably, owing in part to a strengthening fiscal impetus–though the

fiscal stimulus that eventually materializes is projected to be smaller than the proposals

currently on the table.  The unemployment rate drops to just under 5-1/2 percent by

the end of next year, still about ½  percentage point above the staff’s NAIRU

estimate.  Inflation edges down a bit more than in the December Greenbook owing to

the greater resource slack and faster productivity growth, offset in part by the effects

of higher oil and non-oil import prices.  The core PCE inflation rate is only a tad

above 1 percent by the fourth quarter of 2004. (Some observations on monetary

policy and geopolitical tensions are offered in the box on the next page.)



7

Monetary Policy and Geopolitical Tensions

The phrase “geopolitical tensions” that has gained much currency of late is
meant to stand in for a variety of global trouble spots, most notably including a
possible war with Iraq, nuclear standoff on the Korean peninsula, a general strike in
Venezuela that has curtailed the flow of oil from that important supplier, and the
risk of terrorist attacks around the globe.  To put it mildly, economists cannot
provide much guidance on quantifying the probability of when these problems will
come to a head or how the public will react as they are played out.  

The difficulties in specifying such uncertainties in a meaningful way lie at the
heart of why the staff forecast does not spell out a single scenario as to how the
situation in Iraq is settled.  But to the extent that the staff follows the lead of
markets–say, as in the forecast that oil prices will gradually recede from their
current levels–some average of potential scenarios is implicit in parts of the
Greenbook.

Over the years, a simple syllogism has served the Committee well in
explaining how an event essentially exogenous to its action influences its decisions,
whether that event be a major fiscal initiative, a change in the stance of monetary
policy abroad, or a significant swing in a key asset price.  The logic runs:

   • Given the lags in the effect of monetary policy, a central bank should
be preemptive–that is, act in advance of anticipated major shocks to
the economic system;

   
   • Setting policy preemptively requires basing decisions on a forecast of

aggregate demand and inflation pressures;
   
   • As a result, any event that affects the forecast influences monetary

policy.   
   

Following this argument, the Committee would presumably want to put in place
policy that best positions the economy to absorb the effects of potential hostilities. 
But in that regard, the Committee has already responded to geopolitical tensions by
pulling the funds rate down to a historically accommodative level to counter the
effects of those tensions in exacerbating businesses’ reluctance to hire and spend. 



8

Monetary Policy and Geopolitical Tensions (continued)

Thus, all else equal, the current stance of policy would not need to be
changed unless the Committee’s assessments of the probability of war and the likely
effect of war on the economy have changed significantly.  Perhaps the more
pertinent possibility is to consider how the Committee should act if it came to the
conclusion that war with Iraq was almost a certainty.  The problem is putting a sign
to the effect of war on aggregate demand and inflation pressures.  A lesson from
the Gulf War is that uncertainties may be resolved by military action, making it
possible that household and business confidence will be emboldened should it
become evident that the war will be brief and successful.  If so, an unleashing of
pent-up private demands fueled in part by the currently accommodative stance of
monetary policy (at least as judged by the level of the real federal funds rate relative
to estimates of its equilibrium) would likely combine with near-term fiscal impetus
to spur aggregate demand, particularly if added supplies on the world market sent
oil prices tumbling.  But the Committee might also envisage worse outcomes,
including a protracted stalemate, the use of weapons of mass destruction, or a
slashing of available oil supplies.  While the relative probabilities of such tail events
might heavily favor positive outcomes for spending, the expected cost to the
Committee’s objective of the adverse ones should they occur might be substantial.
  

This is a specific example of the general property that the Committee has
previously noted:  Heightened uncertainty makes forecasting difficult, implying that
it is harder to act preemptively.  The Committee may be even less inclined to key its
policy now on the expectation of a specific war scenario if it believed that at some
later date public confidence or fragile financial markets might need the boost
associated with significant policy ease.  That said, research on the zero bound to
nominal interest rates generally has the implication that it is better to ease early in
anticipation of an adverse shock than to “save your ammunition.”

(8) If the Committee shares the staff’s assessment of economic prospects, it

may want to keep policy unchanged at this meeting, even granted that the

unemployment rate seems poised to head higher and stay at an elevated level for

longer than had been expected in December.  Given the lags in monetary policy, the

Committee may view the near-term increase in economic slack as inevitable and be

satisfied that the existing policy stance will help to return economic growth to a pace

Uncertainty Regarding the Equilibrium Real Funds Rate

As in recent bluebooks, the shaded region in Chart 3 portrays the range of
estimates of equilibrium real federal funds rates shown in the table.  This range
reflects uncertainty across the two models used (FRB/US and a statistical model)
and across two estimation methods (a “one-sided” approach that uses only
historical data and a “two-sided” approach that takes account of data and
projections after the date of the estimate of the equilibrium rate).  However, the
shaded region understates the full extent of uncertainty because it does not
incorporate the imprecision with which specific models are estimated–that is,
parameter uncertainty.  For example, standard errors of the equilibrium rates
estimated using the “two-sided” statistical filter are about 1-1/4 percentage points. 
This yields a 70 percent confidence interval of 2-1/2 percentage points, wider than
the shaded region itself.  Moreover, the standard error for the “one-sided” filter
estimates, which probably better characterizes statistical uncertainty regarding the
current equilibrium rate estimate, implies a 3-1/2 percentage point confidence
interval.     

above that of its potential by the second half of this year.  Indeed, with private yields

lower and the dollar weaker than in December, the Committee may be more

convinced that the existing financial stimulus will be adequate to achieve satisfactory

economic growth with low inflation, especially given the odds of more substantial

fiscal impetus.  While considerable uncertainty surrounds estimates of equilibrium

interest rates (as addressed in the box below), the current real funds rate is negative

and below nearly all current estimates of its equilibrium level.  Even though economic

slack persists through 2004, the Committee may place slim odds on the possibility that

disinflation would cumulate to the point that core inflation becomes unacceptably

low.  To date, inflation expectations have remained stable, and the response of

inflation to resource slack has been very sluggish.  Moreover, the Committee may

view the staff’s estimates of the natural rate of unemployment or of the trend of

structural productivity as too optimistic.  In that regard, the Committee may now see

upside risks (perhaps in the form of a sharp revival of private spending, greater-than-

expected fiscal stimulus, or a steeper dollar depreciation than is built into the staff

forecast) as well balanced with downside risks (including the failure of business

confidence to recover or more protracted tensions around the globe).

(9) Alternatively, the Committee may choose to ease policy 25 basis points

at this meeting to make faster progress than in the Greenbook baseline in reducing

economic slack, which runs along a higher path than in the prior forecast.  For

example, the policymaker perfect foresight simulations indicate that near-term easing

would bring the unemployment rate more quickly to its natural rate, even with a

1 percent core PCE inflation target and an element of interest-rate smoothing (see

chart).  The case for easing would be strengthened if the Committee believes that

current inflation is already at the lower end of its desirable range so that the further

disinflation in the Greenbook should be avoided.  Moreover, the Committee might be

concerned that inflation could well fall short of the path in the Greenbook absent an

easing, producing a firming in the real short-term interest rate.  The Committee might

put particular weight on that possibility if it believes that, owing to the global threats,

continued capital overhangs, and lingering business pessimism, the chance of further

sluggish investment and hiring remains unacceptably high.  In such a circumstance,

the Committee may see additional stimulus as needed to support overall spending

until business confidence can recover.  In addition, while the staff has read the

continuing weakness in the labor market as signaling higher structural productivity,

the Committee may place sizable odds on the view that the same data augur more

sluggish economic activity than in the Greenbook forecast.

The perfect foresight simulations extend the key assumptions of the staff outlook (other than the path for monetary policy) through 2008:
      ●      potential output grows at about 3-3/4 percent per year
      ●      the relative price of oil stabilizes at its end of 2004 level
      ●      the exchange value of dollar measured in real terms falls at a 3 percent clip
      ●      federal budget deficit relative to GDP declines moderately

  4.  In this forecast, the debt ceiling constraint leaves no material imprint on the level of
federal debt.  As discussed in the box on the next page, the staff projects that in the latter
half of February the federal government will begin to resort to the accounting devices it has
used in similar circumstances in the past in the absence of legislation to raise the debt ceiling.

very slim odds of an easing of policy at this meeting and only a few expect a change in

the balance-of-risks statement.  Market prices would therefore likely react little to a

Committee decision that confirmed those expectations, absent a change in the tone of

the announcement.  In contrast, a 25 basis point easing, even if associated with

continued balance in the risk assessment, would surprise markets and likely induce a

decline in short-term interest rates of roughly comparable magnitude.  Longer-term

yields and the foreign exchange value of the dollar would probably also fall, but the

declines would be tempered if equities rallied.  However, the odds of a significant

stock market rally would be reduced by any impression that the FOMC saw

appreciable further weakness in economic activity.    

(11) Under the Greenbook forecast, the growth of total nonfinancial debt is

projected to slow to a 6-1/4 percent rate this quarter and to 5-1/2 percent in the next. 

The government components, both federal and state and local, register the sharpest

deceleration over the period.4  Household borrowing is projected to moderate, as

purchases of cars and new homes finally slow from their brisk run.  Business

borrowing is projected to pick up over the first half of this year, with some restocking

of inventories, recovery of fixed investment, and resumption of merger activity. 

Firms are expected once again to turn to the bond market for most of their external

financing needs in order to lock in longer-term financing at historically low interest

rates.

The Treasury Debt Ceiling
 
 Congress raised the debt limit to $6.4 trillion last summer, but the pace of
borrowing since then has pushed debt subject to the limit to within about $60 
billion of this ceiling (chart).  Staff estimates suggest that–absent Congressional 
action–the current ceiling will become binding by mid-February.  Thereafter, 
the Treasury would need to resort to the tactics it has followed in past 
episodes–calling in compensating balances at depository institutions to obtain 
more operating cash and temporarily disinvesting government pension funds--
to create room under the ceiling for the issuance of marketable debt.  Such 
maneuvers could create a funding cushion of perhaps $100 billion–enough to 
allow the Treasury to operate comfortably for a few weeks and perhaps until its 
cash is replenished by April tax receipts.

(12) Over the first half of this year, M2 is projected to grow at a pace closer

to that of nominal income, after having posted a 2-3/4 percent decline in its velocity

last year.  The moderation in M2 growth owes partly to the ebbing of the response of

money demand to the easing of last November and partly to the unwinding of the

boost to the aggregate from the latest wave of mortgage refinancings.  That said,

monthly growth rates of M2 are likely to be uneven in the period just ahead, in part

because the staff projects an unusually small buildup of deposits ahead of the April tax

date owing to another year of low individual tax payments.
