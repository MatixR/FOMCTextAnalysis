RECENT DEVELOPMENTS 

SUMMARY 

Financial market conditions remained supportive of economic growth over the 

intermeeting period.  Corporate bond spreads fell substantially and broad equity 

indexes edged higher, on net.  Yields on longer-dated Treasury securities were about 

unchanged and market-based measures of near-term inflation compensation rose 

modestly.  The dollar rose against most other major currencies.  The expected path of 

monetary policy moved lower over the period, reportedly as a result of Federal 

Reserve communications that were read as suggesting that policy would be 

accommodative for somewhat longer than previously expected.  Markets exhibited 

few, if any, signs of strain in connection with the pending expiration of several 

extraordinary Federal Reserve lending facilities in early February and the ongoing 

tapering of purchases of agency mortgage-backed securities and agency debt.  

Consistent with the stability and improved liquidity observed in funding markets over 

recent months, borrowing from Federal Reserve facilities declined further over the 

period.     

The level of private-sector debt contracted in the fourth quarter as a result of 

continued declines in the debt of households and businesses.  However, federal 

borrowing remained robust, supporting a modest expansion in total domestic 

nonfinancial sector debt.  Banks largely stopped tightening lending standards outside 

of the commercial real estate sector, but modest net fractions continued to tighten 

terms.  Commercial bank loans declined in December as standards and terms 

remained tight and loan demand weakened further.

MONETARY POLICY EXPECTATIONS AND TREASURY YIELDS 

The FOMC’s decision to keep the target range for the federal funds rate 

unchanged at the December meeting and its retention of the “extended period” 

language in the statement were widely anticipated and elicited little reaction in 

markets.  However, market participants apparently viewed statements by some 

Federal Reserve officials over the intermeeting period and the minutes of the 

December meeting as suggesting policy would likely be accommodative for somewhat 

longer than they had been expecting.  Investors were reportedly surprised by the 

statement in the minutes that a few members of the Committee “observed that it 

might become desirable at some point in the future to provide more policy stimulus 

by expanding the planned scale of the Committee’s large-scale asset purchases” and 

by the indication that only one member saw improvements in financial markets and 

the economic outlook as potentially warranting asset sales.  Incoming economic data 

were, on balance, in line with market expectations and had little net impact on implied 

policy rates, except for the weaker-than-expected December employment report 

which was interpreted by market participants as providing additional support for 

continued accommodation.1   

Futures quotes combined with the staff’s standard assumption of a one-basis 

point-per-month term premium in interbank rates imply that policy expectations 

moved modestly lower over the intermeeting period (Chart 1).  Futures rates now 

suggest that market participants anticipate that the target federal funds rate will be 

increased beginning in the third quarter of 2010 and will reach about 2 percent by the 

end of 2011.  The timing of the lift-off is roughly consistent with results from the 

January survey of primary dealers.  That survey indicated that about two-thirds of 

respondents expect the first rate increase to occur by the end of 2010, in line with 

 

                                           
1 The effective federal funds rate averaged 0.11 percent over the intermeeting period, and the 
intraday standard deviation averaged 3.3 basis points.

what was observed in the December survey.  Staff models suggest that term 

premiums were unchanged over the intermeeting period and are about in line with our 

standard assumption.  

In contrast to the decline in the expected policy path, yields on two-year and ten-

year nominal Treasury securities were about unchanged, on net, amid some notable 

volatility.  Yields on five-year TIPS, however, fell somewhat over the intermeeting 

period, leaving near-term inflation compensation about 15 basis points higher.  Staff 

models indicate that a rise in inflation expectations (which likely owed in part to the 

sharp rise in oil prices over the intermeeting period), higher inflation risk premiums, 

and improved liquidity conditions in the TIPS market contributed about equally to the 

rise in near-term inflation compensation.  Five-year inflation compensation five years 

ahead moved down slightly, while survey measures of long-term inflation expectations 

were about unchanged. 

The Treasury auctioned $202 billion in coupon securities of various maturities 

over the intermeeting period.  The auctions were generally well received.  On 

December 24, Congress approved an increase in the debt ceiling of $290 billion, 

which provides the Treasury with several more months of borrowing capacity.  

Market participants reported that the passage of only a relatively small increase in the 

debt ceiling resulted in continued market uncertainty about the future of the 

Supplementary Financing Program. 

CAPITAL MARKETS  

Broad equity price indexes rose about 1 percent, on balance, over the intermeeting 

period.  Stock prices trended higher over much of the period as incoming data 

reportedly confirmed investors’ beliefs that the economy was continuing to recover 

(Chart 2).  Analysts’ forecasts of year-ahead earnings were little changed through mid-

January, while option-implied volatility on the S&P 500 index continued to decline.

However, equity prices retraced most of those gains recently on concerns about 

potential downside risks to the global recovery and the Administration’s proposal to 

limit the size of financial institutions and restrict their trading activity.  The equity 

premium, measured as the staff’s estimate of the expected real return on equities over 

the next ten years relative to the real 10-year yield on Treasury securities, was little 

changed over the intermeeting period and remained well above levels observed during 

the past decade. 

Financial sector shares, on the whole, outperformed the broader market during 

the period.  Available fourth-quarter earnings reports have generally been in line with 

market expectations.  Capital market trading revenues moderated more than expected 

and net interest margins declined due to reduced loan levels and higher non-

performing loans; changes in delinquency rates were mixed.  Following Bank of 

America’s equity offering in early December, both Wells Fargo and Citigroup issued 

shares, and all three used the proceeds to repay TARP capital.  Including these three 

repayments, the eight major financial institutions that received initial disbursements of 

funds under the TARP in October of 2008 have all now repurchased the preferred 

equity shares that they issued to the government.  Late in the period, the 

announcement of the Financial Crisis Responsibility Fee and the Administration’s 

proposal regarding financial institutions’ size and trading activity pressured financial 

shares lower and boosted spreads on their credit default swaps as market participants 

assessed the potential impact of these proposals on the affected institutions.2  

Yields on both investment- and speculative-grade corporate bonds declined over 

the intermeeting period, leaving their spreads over Treasury yields lower by about 45 

and 65 basis points, respectively.  Spreads on investment-grade corporate bonds have 

                                           
2 The proposed fee would consist of a 15 basis point levy on total assets less Tier 1 capital 
and FDIC-assessed deposits and would be applied to firms with over $50 billion in total 
consolidated assets that own insured depository institutions and broker-dealers.

moved back to levels last seen in late 2007.  The recent decline appears to owe in part 

to continued strong net inflows into taxable bond mutual funds.  On balance, the 

credit quality of nonfinancial firms improved slightly in recent months.  Based on data 

through the fourth quarter, the pace of downgrades of nonfinancial bonds was about 

the same as that of upgrades, although the bonds of a single domestic automaker 

accounted for much of the latter.  The year-ahead expected default frequency for 

nonfinancial firms from Moody’s KMV fell only slightly in January, but the six-month 

trailing corporate bond default rate has dropped sharply and now stands below 1 

percent, a level that is comparable to averages over the last decade before the 

downturn.  

Overall, net debt financing by nonfinancial businesses was near zero in the fourth 

quarter, after having dipped into negative territory in the third quarter (Chart 3).  

Adjusting for the normal slowing of issuance around year-end, gross issuance of 

investment-grade bonds remained robust in December (and in early January).  

However, commercial paper outstanding was little changed and C&I loans continued 

to decline sharply.  In contrast, net equity issuance by nonfinancial firms was negative 

during the quarter for the first time since 2008, due to a rebound in cash-financed 

mergers.  For financial firms, public equity issuance surged in conjunction with the 

repayment of TARP capital, while gross bond issuance continued to be somewhat 

slower than observed in the third quarter. 

Over the intermeeting period, the average interest rate on 30-year conforming 

fixed-rate mortgages increased slightly, on net, to 5 percent.  Yields on agency 

mortgage-backed securities (MBS) were unchanged, even as net issuance of MBS by 

Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac dropped sharply in November, partly reflecting seasonal 

factors.  The tapering of MBS purchases and the anticipated completion of such 

transactions by the end of the first quarter have yet to have a discernable impact on 

MBS spreads as purchase amounts continue to outpace mortgage origination.  The

Desk’s survey of mortgage market analysts indicates that market participants expect 

MBS spreads to rise by an average of 20 to 25 basis points in March and April as 

purchases come to an end.  Analysts noted, however, that there was considerable 

uncertainty about the possible effects of the end of the purchase program.        

On December 24th, the Treasury expanded its capital commitment to Fannie Mae 

and Freddie Mac to any amount necessary to offset cumulative reductions in net 

worth over the next three years.  Market participants generally welcomed the news, 

although it elicited little immediate price reaction.  Analysts suggested that the 

announcement failed to resolve long-run uncertainty surrounding the status of these 

government-sponsored enterprises (GSEs) and, partly as a consequence, they remain 

unsure whether the commitment will encourage the return of investors who have 

reduced their holdings of agency debt and MBS.  Additionally, at year-end the 

Treasury allowed its unused GSE Credit Facility as well as its MBS purchase program 

to expire. 

Revolving and nonrevolving consumer credit continued to contract in November 

and delinquency rates on consumer loans remained high.  Credit card interest-rate 

spreads continued to widen, likely reflecting several factors, including lenders’ 

preparations for the implementation of the CARD Act next month, regulatory and 

accounting changes which increase the cost of funds, and the continued high rate of 

charge-offs.  In contrast, spreads of rates on new auto loans over those on 

comparable-maturity Treasuries dropped further in December as captive finance 

companies offered lower rates to spur sales.  Consumer ABS issuance was about flat 

in December, although credit card issuance picked up relative to previous months 

following the FDIC’s announcement of a temporary extension of safe harbor rules

regarding its handling of securitized assets should a sponsoring bank be taken into 

receivership.3  

MARKET FUNCTIONING AND FEDERAL RESERVE PROGRAMS 

Conditions in short-term funding markets remained stable over the intermeeting 

period.  Year-end pressures were generally modest amid ample liquidity.  One- and 

three-month Libor-OIS spreads remained low while six-month spreads edged down 

somewhat further.  Spreads of rates on A2/P2-rated commercial paper and AA-rated 

ABCP over the AA nonfinancial rate were also little changed.  Demand for Treasury 

bills in the cash and repo markets was strong around year-end.  Elevated demand 

persisted in subsequent weeks amid the seasonal decline in bills outstanding and the 

reduction in the Supplementary Financing Program, resulting in continued downward 

pressure on both bill yields and short-term Treasury repo rates.  No signs of stress in 

short-term funding markets were visible in association with the impending expiration 

of several extraordinary Federal Reserve lending facilities on February 1.4  Indicators 

of functioning in other markets were largely unchanged.5  Consistent with these 

developments, borrowing from Federal Reserve facilities declined further over the 

period. 

                                           
3 The box entitled “The Effects of FAS 166 and FAS 167 on Commercial Banks” on pages 
10-11 of the December 10, 2009, Bluebook provides additional information. 

4 The facilities set to expire are the Asset-Backed Commercial Paper Money Market Mutual 
Fund Liquidity Facility, the Commercial Paper Funding Facility, the Primary Dealer Credit 
Facility, and the Term Securities Lending Facility.  In addition, the temporary liquidity swap 
arrangements with foreign central banks are expected to expire on February 1.  

5 Market participants continue to evaluate the potential impact of the Financial Crisis 
Responsibility Fee on market functioning.  Leverage created through the use of repurchase 
agreements would not be exempt from the fee under the announced structure, leading 
some market participants to suggest that imposition of the fee could raise the cost of 
financing and put modest pressure on short-term interest rates.

Two TALF operations settled during the intermeeting period: a CMBS operation 

for $1.3 billion in mid-December and an ABS operation for $1.1 billion in early 

January.  (See box entitled “Balance Sheet Developments during the Intermeeting 

Period.”)  The January TALF operation supported the issuance of only one ABS, 

likely because of the proximity of the holiday season.  Preliminary indications suggest 

that the February and March ABS subscriptions are likely to be substantial as market 

participants seek to take advantage of the TALF program before its expiration. 

The Federal Reserve proposed amendments to Regulation D in late December 

that would enable the establishment of a term deposit facility.  Under the proposal, 

Federal Reserve Banks would offer interest-bearing term deposits to eligible 

institutions through an auction mechanism.  The news was generally well received by 

markets and elicited little price response.   

FOREIGN MARKET DEVELOPMENTS 

Over the intermeeting period, benchmark sovereign yields in the advanced foreign 

economies displayed some volatility but ended little changed on net (Chart 4).  Global 

sovereign bond offerings have been reasonably well received since the start of the 

year, although mounting fiscal concerns have made investors more reluctant to hold 

debt issued by the Greek government.  As a result, the spread between 10-year Greek 

and German sovereign yields has increased 60 basis points to almost 3 percentage 

points.  Investors have also displayed increasing concern about fiscal problems in 

Spain and Portugal, though spreads over German debt for these countries are closer 

to 1 percentage point. 

The European Central Bank (ECB), the Bank of England (BOE), the Bank of 

Japan (BOJ), and the Bank of Canada (BOC) held their policy rates constant over the 

period.  The BOE kept the size of its asset purchase facility at £200 billion and 

announced that it expected to reach this limit by the end of this month.  The

Balance Sheet Developments during the Intermeeting Period 

The Federal Reserve’s total assets edged up to about $2.3 trillion over the 
intermeeting period.1  As a result of ongoing asset purchases, securities held 
outright increased by $78 billion, which more than offset the $61 billion net decline 
in lending through liquidity and credit facilities.   

The Open Market Desk purchased $5 billion in agency debt securities and $74 
billion in agency mortgage-backed securities (MBS) during the intermeeting period.2 
In contrast, most of the System’s liquidity and credit programs contracted further.  
Consistent with the continued improvement in short-term funding markets over 
recent months, term auction credit declined $47 billion, foreign central bank 
liquidity swaps declined $13 billion, and primary credit declined $4 billion.  Net 
portfolio holdings of Commercial Paper Funding Facility LLC (CPFF) declined $1 
billion to $13 billion, of which $8 billion is commercial paper.3  Lending under the 
Primary Dealer Credit Facility (PDCF) and under the Asset-Backed Commercial 
Paper Money Market Mutual Fund Liquidity Facility (AMLF) remained at zero 
during the intermeeting period.  Securities lent through the Term Securities 
Lending Facility (TSLF) also remained at zero.4  The final scheduled Schedule 2 
TSLF operation was held on January 7, 2010; it garnered no participation.  As 
previously announced, the final day for operations under the foreign central bank 
liquidity swaps, the CPFF, the PDCF, and the AMLF is expected to be February 1, 
2010.  Credit extended through these liquidity facilities now stands at about $9 
billion.  

 

Lending through the Term Asset-Backed Securities Loan Facility (TALF) 
edged up $1 billion over the period.  Two TALF operations settled during the 
intermeeting period.  About $1.3 billion in loans backed by commercial mortgage-
backed securities (CMBS) were extended in December, and about $1.1 billion in 
loans against non-mortgage asset-backed securities (ABS) were extended in January.  
This increase in lending was offset by about $1.4 billion in loan prepayments.  The 
January CMBS subscription, which took place on January 20, saw $1.5 billion in 
loan requests backed by legacy CMBS; these loans will settle on January 28.  

                                           
1 These data are through January 20, 2010. 
2 The figures for securities holdings reflect only trades that have settled.  Over the intermeeting period, the 

Open Market Desk committed to purchase, but has not settled, an additional $79 billion of MBS, on net. 
3 The remaining assets of CPFF LLC are investments of the fees paid by issuers that have sold commercial 

paper to the facility. 
4 Securities lent through TSLF do not affect the level of Federal Reserve assets because the Federal Reserve 

retains ownership of the securities lent.

On the liability side of the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet, the U.S. Treasury’s 
general account increased $127 billion, while the Treasury’s supplementary 
financing account (SFA) decreased $10 billion.  The Treasury reduced the level of 
the SFA to $5 billion to allow greater flexibility in debt management as it 
approached the debt ceiling last year.  Reserve balances of depository institutions 
decreased $74 billion over the intermeeting period.

announcement was widely expected, and gilt yields moved little in response.  Market 

participants continue to expect that the BOE and the BOC will raise rates in the 

second half of this year, while they expect the ECB will raise rates early in 2011 and 

that the BOJ will keep its policy rate at its current low level for at least two more 

years.  

Foreign equity prices ended the intermeeting period mixed.  Although stock price 

changes in most countries remained in positive territory for much of the period, news 

that the People’s Bank of China had moved in the direction of tighter monetary policy 

caused a correction in many stock markets.  European financial stocks declined about 

4 percent, as early profit reports for the fourth quarter from a few banks rekindled 

some concern as to the health of the banking system.   

The broad nominal index of the dollar rose almost 1 percent.  The dollar 

appreciated 1 percent against the yen and over 3 percent against the euro, seemingly 

driven by a growing realization that U.S. growth prospects appear considerably better 

than those in Europe and Japan.  Concerns regarding the risks that policy tightening 

by China might pose for the global recovery also seemed to drive the dollar higher 

against many currencies late in the period.   

DEBT, BANK CREDIT, AND MONEY 

The level of private-sector debt appears to have fallen in the fourth quarter as a 

result of further declines in both household and nonfinancial business debt (Chart 5).  

Federal government debt expanded significantly, albeit a bit less than in previous 

quarters, while state and local government debt continued to expand at a moderate 

pace.  All told, the growth rate of domestic nonfinancial sector debt is projected to 

have declined from an annual rate of 2¾ percent in the third quarter to 2 percent in 

the fourth quarter.

6 Staff recently revised measures of the money stock and its components to incorporate 
updated seasonal factors and a new quarterly benchmark.  The net effect of the inclusion of 
updated seasonal factors and the benchmark was to lower the growth rate of M2 by about 
½ percentage point in the first half of 2009 and increase the growth rate by roughly 1 
percentage point in the second half of 2009. 

Bank credit contracted at a somewhat slower pace in December than earlier in the 

fall.  However, the moderation was due to increased growth in banks’ Treasury and 

agency securities holdings; total loans contracted more steeply than in November.  

C&I loans plummeted at large domestic banks and foreign banks, while the 

contraction at other domestic banks was milder.  Banks’ holdings of closed-end 

residential mortgages edged up again in December, but home equity loans continued 

to run off.  Consumer loans originated by banks continued to fall in December, 

reflecting ongoing weakness in credit card loans.  According to the January Senior 

Loan Officer Opinion Survey, banks left standards on most categories of loans to 

businesses and households little changed during the fourth quarter, while small net 

fractions of banks tightened terms on most major loan types.  The exception was 

commercial real estate loans, where standards and terms continued to be tightened by 

a significant fraction of respondents.  The demand for loans generally weakened 

further.  (See box entitled “Interpretation of the January Senior Loan Officer Opinion 

Survey.”)  The drop in bank credit in December more than offset a further increase in 

cash and equivalent assets (a category that includes reserve balances), and total bank 

assets continued to trend lower.   

M2 expanded at a 2 percent annual rate in December, a slight deceleration from 

its relatively modest growth earlier in the fourth quarter.6  Growth in liquid deposits 

remained robust, but small time deposits and retail money market mutual funds 

continued to run off.  Currency grew at an annualized rate of around ½ percent in 

December, with the modest pace of expansion likely a result of continued moderation 

of demands for U.S. currency from abroad.  The monetary base was roughly flat in

Interpretation of the January Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey 

The January Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey (SLOOS) suggests that the 
prolonged bout of tightening of credit standards at U.S. commercial banks came to 
an end in the fourth quarter of last year for most types of loans.  As shown in the 
panel below, the staff’s composite index of the change in credit standards on all 
major categories of loans to both businesses and households fell to about zero in 
the latest survey, indicating that banks left their credit standards essentially 
unchanged, on net, in the fourth quarter. Credit conditions, however, remain very 
tight, given banks’ pronounced moves 
over the past two years toward much
more stringent lending standards and
terms.    

 
 

The staff has developed a number 
of statistical models that allow one to 
estimate the unanticipated changes in 
banks’ lending standards over time. In 
essence, these models attempt to 
remove from the change in standards 
reported in the SLOOS the effects on 
standards of changes in loan demand, 
the economic outlook, and other 
variables likely to play an important 
role in the determination of banks’ 
credit policies.  One model used to make such adjustments is a small-scale vector 
autoregression (VAR) that includes real GDP growth, inflation, the growth of 
banks’ core lending capacity (defined as the sum of core loans outstanding and 
unused core loan commitments), a corporate bond credit spread index, the federal 
funds rate, and the change in aggregate credit standards.  This simple model 
incorporates the effects on aggregate credit standards of only a small set of 
macroeconomic variables and cannot incorporate bank-specific factors that may 
also influence changes in banks’ credit policies. An alternative model developed by 
the staff explains bank-level indexes of the change in credit standards using 
indicators of bank-specific conditions as well as changes in expected 
macroeconomic conditions from the Survey of Professional Forecasters.1 

                                           
1 Among bank-specific explanatory variables are profitability indicators such as the bank’s net interest margin 

and the parent bank holding company’s realized return on equity; indicators of credit quality and capital 
adequacy such as delinquency rates and leverage ratios; and indicators that capture differences in the 

January 21, 2010 Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) Page 19 of 72



The solid red line in the panel below depicts the unanticipated changes in credit 
standards implied by the bank-level model, whereas the dotted blue line shows the 
unanticipated changes in standards based on the small-scale VAR model.  Negative 
indicate an easing of the banks’ credit standards not caused by the other variables 
in the model; positive values, conversely, represent a tightening of credit standards 
independent of the effects of the other variables. Both estimates are subject to 
considerable coefficient and model uncertainty; in addition, each of the empirical 
approaches faces significant challenges in identifying exogenous moves in credit 
standards and probably fails to account fully for the effects on bank lending
standards of the various traditional and nontraditional policy actions taken by the 
Federal Reserve and the federal 
government to mitigate the effects 
of the recent crisis.    

 

Subject to these caveats, both 
models indicate that credit standards 
eased in the fourth quarter relative 
to the changes in standards the 
models would project based on the 
explanatory variables.  In absolute 
terms, this unanticipated easing of 
standards was considerably smaller 
when estimated using the bank-level 
model than when estimated using 
the VAR model. In both models, this relative easing of credit standards—in the 
absence of other shocks—provides an impetus to growth in banks’ core lending 
capacity and economic activity over the coming year. 

                                                                                                                                        
composition of assets and liabilities across banks.  In addition, the model includes the realized equity 
volatility of the parent bank holding company to control for difference in riskiness across banks; a bank-
specific index of the change in loan demand as reported in the SLOOS; and bank fixed effects, which 
capture any (time-invariant) unobservable differences among the respondent banks. Because banks’ changes 
in credit standards tend to be fairly persistent, the model also includes a lag of the dependent variable.

December as the effect on reserves of gradually diminishing purchases under the 

Federal Reserve’s large-scale asset purchase programs was mostly offset by a further 

contraction in credit outstanding under liquidity and credit facilities and an increase in 

the U.S. Treasury’s general account.

ECONOMIC OUTLOOK 

On balance, the staff forecast has changed little from that presented in the 

December Greenbook.  The incoming information on final sales was about as 

expected, on net, with stronger readings on business equipment outlays offsetting 

somewhat weaker federal purchases, net exports, and housing activity.  A smaller-

than-expected inventory reduction appears to have provided a temporary boost to real 

GDP growth last quarter that is expected to be substantially reversed in this and the 

next few quarters.  The information received since December on wages and prices 

also was in line with the staff expectations.  Accordingly, the staff outlook for real 

activity this year and next is only a bit stronger and the projection for inflation is 

about unchanged.      

As in the December Greenbook, the staff assumes that the target for the federal 

funds rate will remain unchanged until the last quarter of 2011.  No significant 

changes have been made to the assumptions regarding the magnitude or timing of the 

Federal Reserve’s LSAP programs.7  Fiscal policy is expected to add about 1 

percentage point to real GDP growth in 2010 but to exert a slight drag on growth in 

2011, the same as in the December Greenbook.  House prices are projected to decline 

somewhat further this year as foreclosures increase, and then rise a bit in 2011 as 

demand picks up more notably.   

Interest rates on 30-year fixed-rate mortgages and longer-term Treasury securities 

are projected to rise through 2011, with the spread between them widening about 25 

basis points as the Federal Reserve completes its purchases of agency MBS.  By 

contrast, yields on investment-grade corporate bonds are expected to remain about 

flat this year and to increase less than Treasury yields next year, as risk spreads narrow 



 

somewhat further against a backdrop of continued improvements in the economic 

outlook.  With the equity risk premium also expected to narrow, stock prices are 

projected to rise at an annual rate of around 15 percent over the next two years.  Bank 

lending conditions are anticipated to ease gradually over time but to remain tighter 

than their average over the past decade.  The real foreign exchange value of the dollar 

is assumed to depreciate at about a 2¾ percent pace, on average, over 2010 and 2011.  

The spot price of West Texas intermediate crude oil currently stands at about $76 per 

barrel, and based on readings from futures markets, the staff projects it to rise to 

about $84 per barrel by late 2011; relative to the December Greenbook assumption, 

these prices are about $3 per barrel higher in the near term and $2 per barrel lower in 

the longer run.   

Against this backdrop, the staff expects real GDP to grow about 3½ percent in 

2010 and about 4¾ percent in 2011.  Following a trajectory similar to that in the last 

Greenbook, the unemployment rate is projected to rise a notch to 10.1 percent this 

quarter and then decline gradually to about 9½ percent at the end of 2010 and 8¼ 

percent at the end of 2011, well above the staff’s 5¼ percent estimate of the NAIRU 

over this period.8  With inflation expectations stable and economic slack forecast to 

remain substantial, the staff projects core PCE inflation to slow from 1½ percent in 

2009 to about 1¼ percent in 2010 and to edge down to just above 1 percent in 2011.  

Total PCE inflation has been running at around 2½ percent in recent quarters, 

boosted by higher oil prices, but is expected to moderate to just under 1½ percent in 

2010 and then decline a bit further next year.   

Looking further ahead, the staff assumes that the federal funds rate will rise 

steadily starting in the fourth quarter of 2011, climbing to 3¾ percent by late 2014.  

 

                                           
8 As noted in the Greenbook, the “effective” NAIRU is, at about 6¼ percent, appreciably 
higher because of the effects of extended and emergency unemployment benefits on the 
measured unemployment rate. 

January 21, 2010 Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) Page 23 of 72



 

 

The staff forecasts that real GDP will expand 4½ percent in 2012 before decelerating 

to 3¼ percent in 2014.  Potential output is forecast to rise at an average pace of about 

2½ percent per year from 2012 through 2014, and so with real GDP growth 

outstripping that of potential, the unemployment rate falls to about 5¼ percent in 

2014, about in line with the staff’s estimate of the NAIRU.  Longer-term inflation 

expectations remain stable and, as the output gap steadily closes, total PCE inflation 

slowly rises to about 1¾ percent by 2014, still somewhat below the central tendency 

of policymakers’ long-run projections for inflation.

MONETARY POLICY STRATEGIES 

Chart 6 displays estimates of short-run r*, defined as the real federal funds rate 

that, if maintained over time, would return output to potential in twelve quarters.  The 

Greenbook-consistent short-run r* estimate generated by the FRB/US model is -1.5 

percent, 40 basis points higher than its value in December.  Nevertheless, this 

estimate remains about 20 basis points below the actual real federal funds rate.  The 

Greenbook-consistent r* estimate associated with the EDO model has increased by a 

larger amount (100 basis points), but, at -2.3 percent, remains even further below the 

actual real funds rate. 

Two factors account for the increases in the Greenbook-consistent r* estimates.  

The first is the upward revision to the staff’s assessment of the recent level of 

economic activity, which reduces the size of the output gap that needs to be closed in 

the subsequent twelve quarters.  As can be seen by comparing the first two columns 

in the table in Chart 6, the slightly narrower output gap produces only a small increase 

in the FRB/US model’s Greenbook-consistent r* estimate, but is responsible for a 25 

basis point increase in the EDO model’s Greenbook-consistent r* estimate.9  The 

second reason for the increase in the r* estimates is the one-quarter shift of the time 

window used in the calculations.  The twelve-quarter window now begins in 2010Q1; 

the twelve-quarter horizon in the December Bluebook began in 2009Q4.  Less policy 

stimulus is now required because the output gap that needs to be closed at the end of 

the current window is smaller than the output gap at the end of the window that 

began in the fourth quarter of 2009.  As examination of the middle and final columns 

                                           
9 The second column in the table, “Current Estimate as of Previous Bluebook,” gives the 
estimate of r* in the current quarter that would be obtained using the December Bluebook 
assumptions regarding the current quarter.  This new column helps indicate the degree of 
the movement in r* that is due to changed assessments of current economic activity.

of the table shows, the rolling forward of the window accounts for the bulk of the rise 

in the Greenbook-consistent r* estimates.  

The Greenbook-consistent r* estimate from the EDO model has increased more 

than the corresponding Greenbook-consistent estimate from FRB/US because 

aggregate demand is effectively less sensitive to changes in the real funds rate than it is 

in the FRB/US model.  (See the box, “The Equilibrium Real Rate (r*):  Concepts, 

Measurement, and Policy Implications,” for further details.)  As a result, when the 

output gap that needs to be closed becomes narrower, there is a larger decline in the 

required policy stimulus in the EDO model than in FRB/US.   

The remaining four r* estimates shown in Chart 6 do not condition on the staff 

outlook.  All of these estimates of r* have increased, primarily because of the shift in 

the twelve-quarter window for the r* calculation, and to a lesser extent because of the 

higher assessment of current economic activity.  The r* estimates generated using the 

small structural model and the FRB/US model are both about 30 basis points higher 

than in December, and the single-equation model’s r* estimate is about 70 basis points 

higher.  All three of these estimates are near or below the current level of the real 

funds rate of about -1.3 percent.  By contrast, the EDO model’s estimate of r*, at 

about 60 basis points, is well above the actual real rate, reflecting that model’s 

projection of a robust recovery combined with its assessment that there is less slack at 

present than the staff estimates. 

Chart 7 shows the results of optimal control simulations of the FRB/US model.  

These simulations use the extended staff baseline projection, which incorporates the 

liquidity and credit actions of the Federal Reserve, as a starting point.  Policymakers 

are assumed to place equal weight on keeping core PCE inflation close to a 2 percent 

inflation goal, on keeping unemployment close to the NAIRU (adjusted for the 

temporary effects of emergency and extended unemployment benefits on the

The Equilibrium Real Rate (r*):  Concepts, Measurement, and Policy 
Implications 

The Board staff produces several estimates of the equilibrium real federal funds 
rate, r*, for each Bluebook.  Short-run r* is defined as the value of the real funds 
rate that, if sustained, would be projected to close the output gap twelve quarters in 
the future.  Short-run r* estimates can be interpreted as a summary measure of the 
factors affecting aggregate demand, relative to aggregate supply, over that twelve-
quarter period.  In any particular model, the greater the amount of slack, the lower 
the real funds rate required to close the output gap.  

It is important to note that estimates of r* are not prescriptions for the 
appropriate setting of the funds rate.  The calculation of r* does not involve any 
consideration of the path of inflation, and hence it does not incorporate potentially 
important monetary policy tradeoffs.  In addition, the r* measure is based on a 
criterion of closing the output gap at a given horizon, and consequently takes no 
account of the path of the output gap before and after that horizon.  Finally, r* is 
associated with a policy that fixes the value of the real funds rate for the coming 
twelve quarters.  Therefore, this concept does not recognize how the trajectories 
for output and inflation might be improved via policy adjustments over time. 

Different models produce different estimates of r*, even when conditioning on 
the same outlook, because they differ with regard to the estimated dynamics of the 
economy.  In the Bluebook, short-run r* values are reported based on a single-
equation model, a small structural model, the FRB/US model, and the EDO 
model.  The FRB/US and EDO models are each used to compute two estimates of 
r*, one conditioned on the staff’s extended Greenbook projection and the other 
based on the models’ own projections.   

The two Greenbook-consistent estimates of r* reported in the Bluebook take as 
given the staff outlook and assessment of the current degree of slack.  The 
estimates vary because the FRB/US and EDO models do not generate identical 
responses of slack to changes in the policy rate.  Rather, the two models embed 
different assumptions about the effects of the federal funds rate on broader 
financial conditions and the reaction of aggregate demand to those conditions.  
These differences tend to imply that aggregate demand is somewhat less sensitive 
to changes in the real federal funds rate in EDO than in FRB/US; thus, for a given 
change in projected slack, the EDO model will imply a larger change in the 
estimate of r*.  As shown in Chart 6 of the Bluebook, the Greenbook-consistent 
short-run r* estimate generated by FRB/US is 40 basis points higher than its 

January 21, 2010 Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) Page 28 of 72



December value, while the corresponding EDO estimate has increased 100 basis 
points. 

The model-based FRB/US and EDO estimates of r* are conditioned on the 
respective models’ projections of the output gap.  Accordingly, these two measures 
can differ not only because the models incorporate different sensitivities of slack to 
changes in monetary policy—as with the Greenbook-consistent estimates, but also 
because the models have different perspectives on current resource utilization and 
the outlook for the economic expansion.  In the current Bluebook, the r* estimate 
generated by the FRB/US model is about -1¾ percent.  By contrast, the EDO 
model-based estimate of r*, at about 60 basis points, is well above the actual real 
rate.  The EDO model estimates less slack currently and forecasts a stronger 
economic recovery than envisioned in either the FRB/US projection or in the 
Greenbook.  Such alternative views about the economic outlook, when combined 
with different characterizations of the monetary transmission mechanism, allow the 
model-based r* estimates potentially to convey information beyond that contained 
in the Greenbook-consistent r* measures.

measured unemployment rate), and on minimizing changes in the federal funds rate.  

As in recent Bluebooks, optimal monetary policy in these simulations is constrained 

by the effective lower bound, and the nominal funds rate does not leave this bound 

until the second half of 2012 (black solid lines).  Under this policy, the unemployment 

rate would be projected to remain above the NAIRU until late 2012, while core PCE 

inflation would stay appreciably below the 2 percent goal until late 2013.  

 Chart 7 also displays the optimal control results obtained if the nominal funds 

rate were not constrained by the effective lower bound (blue dashed lines).  Absent 

the constraint, a more accommodative policy stance would allow real activity to 

recover faster and bring the inflation trajectory closer to the assumed 2 percent goal.  

The unconstrained policy path for 2010 and 2011 is moderately higher than in 

December, reflecting the slight upward revision to the staff’s assessment of aggregate 

demand. 

As shown in Chart 8, the prescriptions of the outcome-based estimated policy rule 

are similar to those shown in the previous Bluebook.  The federal funds rate rises 

from the effective lower bound in 2011Q4 (upper-left panel).  According to stochastic 

simulations of the FRB/US model, the 90 percent confidence interval for the funds 

rate in 2011Q4 runs from the effective lower bound to about 3.3 percent.  Market 

participants’ expectations of the path of the funds rate beyond 2010 have shifted up a 

little since the December Bluebook; the expected funds rate between 2011 and 2013 

averages about 15 basis points higher than at the time of the previous Bluebook 

(upper-right panel).10  Financial market quotes imply that the 90 percent confidence 

interval for the federal funds rate in 2011Q4 is about 0.4 percent to about 4.8 percent; 

the width of this interval is slightly greater than that in the previous Bluebook. 

                                           
10 A considerable part of this shift in market expectations took place after the December 
Bluebook was completed but prior to the December FOMC meeting.

The lower panel of Chart 8 provides near-term prescriptions from simple policy 

rules under constrained policy.  The two variants of the Taylor rule and the two 

estimated policy rules would keep the federal funds rate at its effective lower bound 

over the next two quarters.  When this bound is not imposed, all four rules prescribe 

funds rates that are lower (more negative) than in the previous Bluebook, reflecting a 

slight downward revision to the staff projection for core PCE inflation (the measure 

used in the rules).  In contrast, the first-difference rule—because it responds to 

economic growth and does not take the level of resource utilization into account—

prescribes an upward trajectory for the policy rate, with the funds rate increasing to 

about 70 basis points in 2010Q2.

POLICY ALTERNATIVES 

This Bluebook presents three policy alternatives—labeled A, B, and C—for the 

Committee’s consideration.  The characterization of the economic outlook differs 

somewhat across the three alternatives, and each alternative presents a different set  

of judgments about the anticipated funds rate path, adjustments to the amount and 

timing of agency MBS purchases, and prospects for engaging in asset sales.  Table 1 

provides an overview of the key elements of these alternatives.  Draft statements are 

provided in subsequent pages, followed by a summary of the case for each alternative. 

Alternative A refers to the recent pickup in economic activity but points to the 

sluggishness of housing activity, the weak labor market, and the prospects for a 

subpar recovery in the absence of further monetary stimulus.  Alternative B notes the 

continued strengthening of economic activity, the abatement of deterioration in the 

labor market, and the likelihood of a moderate pace of recovery.  Alternative C 

indicates that the economy is growing at a solid rate and that the labor market is 

stabilizing and concludes that a sustainable recovery is now under way.   

All three alternatives point out that overall inflation has been boosted recently by 

higher energy prices.  Alternatives A and B each indicate that substantial resource 

slack continues to restrain cost pressures and that longer-term inflation expectations 

remain stable, making it likely that inflation will be subdued for some time.  

Alternative C refers to appropriate monetary policy adjustments and stable longer-

term inflation expectations—but not to resource slack—in projecting that inflation 

will return to levels consistent with price stability. 

All three alternatives would maintain the target range of 0 to ¼ percent for the 

federal funds rate during the upcoming intermeeting period.  As in recent statements, 

Alternatives A and B indicate that the Committee expects the funds rate to remain 

January 21, 2010 Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) Page 34 of 72



 

 

“exceptionally low...for an extended period.”  Alternative C modifies the forward 

guidance by using the phrase “low...for some time.”   

Alternative A expands the amount of agency MBS purchases by $250 billion and 

indicates that these transactions will continue through the end of the third quarter. 

Alternatives B and C do not make any changes to the amounts or timing of the 

Federal Reserve’s previously announced securities purchases.  Alternative B states that 

the Committee will continue to evaluate its purchases of securities based on the 

economic outlook and financial conditions, leaving the door open to adjusting its 

purchases should circumstances warrant.  Alternative C indicates that the Committee 

will be evaluating the size and composition of its holdings of securities, thereby 

signaling that asset sales could be used to manage the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet.  

The reference to the Federal Reserve’s “holdings”—rather than “purchases”—is  

also presented as a variant of Alternative B, as denoted by the square brackets.    

All three alternatives conclude with identical language about the Federal Reserve’s 

plans for winding down its special liquidity programs.  Most of these facilities—the 

Asset-Backed Commercial Paper Money Market Mutual Fund Liquidity Facility, the 

Commercial Paper Funding Facility, the Primary Dealer Credit Facility, and the Term 

Securities Lending Facility—would be closed on February 1, and the temporary swap 

lines with other central banks would also expire that day.  The TAF would continue  

to be scaled back in February and March, and the decision of whether to conduct any 

subsequent TAF auctions would be considered further over coming weeks.  Finally, 

the TALF would expire on June 30 for loans backed by new-issue CMBS and on 

March 31 for loans backed by all other types of collateral.

December FOMC Statement 

Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in November suggests that 
economic activity has continued to pick up and that the deterioration in the labor market is abating.  
The housing sector has shown some signs of improvement over recent months.  Household 
spending appears to be expanding at a moderate rate, though it remains constrained by a weak labor 
market, modest income growth, lower housing wealth, and tight credit.  Businesses are still cutting 
back on fixed investment, though at a slower pace, and remain reluctant to add to payrolls; they 
continue to make progress in bringing inventory stocks into better alignment with sales.  Financial 
market conditions have become more supportive of economic growth.  Although economic activity 
is likely to remain weak for a time, the Committee anticipates that policy actions to stabilize 
financial markets and institutions, fiscal and monetary stimulus, and market forces will contribute  
to a strengthening of economic growth and a gradual return to higher levels of resource utilization 
in a context of price stability. 

With substantial resource slack likely to continue to dampen cost pressures and with longer-term 
inflation expectations stable, the Committee expects that inflation will remain subdued for some 
time. 

The Committee will maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to ¼ percent and 
continues to anticipate that economic conditions, including low rates of resource utilization, 
subdued inflation trends, and stable inflation expectations, are likely to warrant exceptionally low 
levels of the federal funds rate for an extended period.  To provide support to mortgage lending 
and housing markets and to improve overall conditions in private credit markets, the Federal 
Reserve is in the process of purchasing $1.25 trillion of agency mortgage-backed securities  
and about $175 billion of agency debt.  In order to promote a smooth transition in markets,  
the Committee is gradually slowing the pace of these purchases, and it anticipates that these 
transactions will be executed by the end of the first quarter of 2010.  The Committee will continue 
to evaluate the timing and overall amounts of its purchases of securities in light of the evolving 
economic outlook and conditions in financial markets.   

In light of ongoing improvements in the functioning of financial markets, the Committee and the 
Board of Governors anticipate that most of the Federal Reserve’s special liquidity facilities will 
expire on February 1, 2010, consistent with the Federal Reserve’s announcement of June 25, 2009.  
These facilities include the Asset-Backed Commercial Paper Money Market Mutual Fund Liquidity 
Facility, the Commercial Paper Funding Facility, the Primary Dealer Credit Facility, and the  
Term Securities Lending Facility.  The Federal Reserve will also be working with its central bank 
counterparties to close its temporary liquidity swap arrangements by February 1.  The Federal 
Reserve expects that amounts provided under the Term Auction Facility will continue to be scaled 
back in early 2010.   The anticipated expiration dates for the Term Asset-Backed Securities Loan 
Facility remain set at June 30, 2010, for loans backed by new-issue commercial mortgage-backed 
securities and March 31, 2010, for loans backed by all other types of collateral.  The Federal Reserve 
is prepared to modify these plans if necessary to support financial stability and economic growth.

January FOMC Statement—Alternative A 

1.   Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in December suggests 
that economic activity has continued to pick up and that the deterioration in the labor market  
is abating.  Household spending is expanding at a moderate rate but remains constrained  
by a weak labor market, modest income growth, lower housing wealth, and tight credit.  
Business spending on equipment and software appears to be picking up, but  
investment in structures is still contracting and firms remain reluctant to add to payrolls.  
Recent data indicate that housing activity remains sluggish and the level of foreclosures 
continues to be elevated.  In light of the weakness in labor markets and prospects  
for a subpar economic recovery, the Committee judges that further monetary stimulus  
is warranted. 

2.   Energy prices have risen in recent months, but core inflation has remained low.   
With substantial resource slack continuing to restrain cost pressures and longer-term inflation 
expectations stable, inflation is likely to be subdued for some time.   

3.   To provide further support to mortgage lending and housing markets and to promote a  
more robust economic recovery in a context of price stability, the Committee decided  
to expand its purchases of agency mortgage-backed securities to a total of $1.5 trillion,  
up from the previously announced amount of $1.25 trillion; the Committee anticipates  
that these transactions will be executed by the end of the third quarter.  The Federal Reserve  
is also in the process of purchasing about $175 billion of agency debt, and the Committee 
anticipates that those transactions will be executed by the end of the first quarter.  The 
Committee will continue to evaluate the timing and overall amounts of its purchases of 
securities in light of the evolving economic outlook and conditions in financial markets.   
The Committee will maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to ¼ percent and 
continues to anticipate that economic conditions, including low rates of resource utilization, 
subdued inflation trends, and stable inflation expectations, are likely to warrant exceptionally 
low levels of the federal funds rate for an extended period.     

4.   In light of improved functioning of financial markets, the Federal Reserve will be closing  
the Asset-Backed Commercial Paper Money Market Mutual Fund Liquidity Facility, the  
Commercial Paper Funding Facility, the Primary Dealer Credit Facility, and the Term Securities 
Lending Facility on February 1, as previously announced.  In addition, the temporary 
liquidity swap arrangements between the Federal Reserve and other central banks will  
expire on February 1.  The amounts provided under the Term Auction Facility will continue  
to be scaled back, with $50 billion in 28-day credit to be offered at the next auction on  
February 8; the Federal Reserve expects to offer $25 billion in 28-day credit on March 8 
and will consider whether to conduct further auctions beyond that date.  The anticipated 
expiration dates for the Term Asset-Backed Securities Loan Facility remain set at June 30  
for loans backed by new-issue commercial mortgage-backed securities and March 31 for loans 
backed by all other types of collateral.  The Federal Reserve is prepared to modify these plans  
if necessary to support financial stability and economic growth.

of economic growth.  Although the pace of economic recovery is likely to be moderate  
for a time, the Committee anticipates a gradual return to higher levels of resource utilization  
in a context of price stability. 

2.   Energy prices have risen in recent months.  However, with substantial resource slack

inflation is likely to be subdued for some time.

January FOMC Statement—Alternative C 

1.   Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in December suggests 
that economic activity is increasing at a solid rate and that the labor market is stabilizing.  
Financial market conditions have continued to become more supportive of economic growth.     
Household spending is expanding at a moderate rate.  Business spending on equipment  
and software appears to be picking up, and firms have brought inventory stocks into better 
alignment with sales.  With a sustainable economic recovery now under way, the Committee 
anticipates a gradual return to higher levels of resource utilization. 

2.   Inflation has been somewhat elevated recently, reflecting a pickup in energy prices,  
but longer-term inflation expectations have remained stable.  The Committee expects that, 
with appropriate monetary policy adjustments, inflation will be at levels consistent with 
price stability. 

3.   The Committee will maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to ¼ percent and 
continues to anticipate that economic conditions, including low rates of resource utilization, 
subdued inflation trends, and stable inflation expectations, are likely to warrant low levels  
of the federal funds rate for some time.  The Federal Reserve is in the process of purchasing  
$1.25 trillion of agency mortgage-backed securities and about $175 billion of agency debt.  In 
order to promote a smooth transition in markets, the Committee is gradually slowing the pace 
of these purchases and anticipates that these transactions will be executed by the end of the first 
quarter.  The Committee will continue to evaluate the size and composition of its securities 
holdings in light of the evolving economic outlook and conditions in financial markets. 

4.   In light of improved functioning of financial markets, the Federal Reserve will be closing  
the Asset-Backed Commercial Paper Money Market Mutual Fund Liquidity Facility, the  
Commercial Paper Funding Facility, the Primary Dealer Credit Facility, and the Term Securities 
Lending Facility on February 1, as previously announced.  In addition, the temporary 
liquidity swap arrangements between the Federal Reserve and other central banks will  
expire on February 1.  The amounts provided under the Term Auction Facility will continue  
to be scaled back, with $50 billion in 28-day credit to be offered at the next auction on  
February 8; the Federal Reserve expects to offer $25 billion in 28-day credit on March 8 
and will consider whether to conduct further auctions beyond that date.  The anticipated 
expiration dates for the Term Asset-Backed Securities Loan Facility remain set at June 30  
for loans backed by new-issue commercial mortgage-backed securities and March 31 for loans 
backed by all other types of collateral.  The Federal Reserve is prepared to modify these plans  
if necessary to support financial stability and economic growth.

THE CASE FOR ALTERNATIVE B 

If policymakers judge that the pace of economic recovery is likely to be moderate, 

that inflation is likely be subdued for some time, and that these outcomes are the best 

that can be achieved under current circumstances, then the Committee could choose 

to reiterate its forward policy guidance and to carry out the remainder of its previously 

announced securities purchases, as in Alternative B.  Members may anticipate that 

aggregate demand will continue to be damped over coming quarters by a variety  

of factors, including weak labor market conditions, tight credit conditions for 

households and small businesses, and the waning effects of fiscal stimulus.  Indeed, 

consistent with this outlook, both of the Greenbook-consistent measures of short-run 

r* remain at low levels, and the staff projects resource slack to diminish only gradually 

over the next several years.  Moreover, with longer-term inflation expectations stable 

and with core inflation running at a fairly steady rate between 1¼ and 1½ percent, 

members may be reasonably confident that overall inflation—which has been boosted 

recently by higher energy prices—will moderate significantly going forward.   Thus, 

the Committee may continue to judge that exceptionally low levels of the funds rate 

are likely to be warranted for an extended period. 

Even if policymakers are not satisfied with the outlook for protracted resource 

slack and for inflation at rates persistently below those consistent with their dual 

objectives, they might conclude that an increase in LSAPs would be undesirable at  

this juncture.  As in recent meetings, the Committee may continue to view the likely 

benefits of such a policy action as being outweighed by the risks associated with a 

significant further expansion of the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet.  Indeed, 

members may be concerned that an announcement of expanded agency MBS 

purchases could have a counterproductive impact on private borrowing rates and 

hence on economic activity if the announcement undermined investors’ confidence in 

January 21, 2010 Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) Page 41 of 72



 

the Federal Reserve’s exit strategy and hence led them to demand greater 

compensation for inflation risk in nominal lending contracts.   

 Nonetheless, given the approaching completion of the previously announced 

LSAPs, the Committee may find it helpful to note that the Federal Reserve would 

consider further securities purchases under some circumstances.  The spreads of 

agency MBS yields and conventional mortgage rates over those on comparable 

Treasuries have remained near their historical lows over recent weeks, and the staff 

projects that these spreads will widen about 30 basis points over the next few months.  

However, some analysts anticipate that the agency MBS spread could shift upward as 

much as 75 or 100 basis points, with an associated rise in mortgage rates that could 

adversely impact the housing sector and potentially even hinder the recovery of the 

broader economy.  Thus, members may see substantial benefits to stating that  

“The Committee will continue to evaluate its purchases of securities in light of the 

evolving economic outlook and conditions in financial markets.” 

The Committee might also prefer issuing such a statement because it suggests  

that the Federal Reserve is not likely to engage in asset sales in the near term.  In 

particular, policymakers might be concerned that heightened prospects of asset sales 

could raise the level of uncertainty in the agency MBS market, potentially disrupting 

market functioning, impairing liquidity conditions, and pushing up term premiums.11  

As a result, members may view asset sales as likely to remain on the back burner,  

at least temporarily, given the Federal Reserve’s development of other balance sheet 

tools such as reverse repos and the term deposit facility.12

Management Issues in the Longer Term” that were sent to the Committee on January 19.

Changes in Policy Rates” that was sent to the Committee on January 19. 

January 21, 2010 Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) Page 42 of 72



 

 

The financial market reaction to a statement like that of Alternative B would likely 

be muted.  The Desk’s survey indicates that primary dealers are not anticipating any 

changes in the Committee’s forward policy guidance at this meeting and that they  

do not expect any further changes in the size or composition of the Federal Reserve’s 

LSAPs.  Moreover, market quotes on fed funds futures and options indicate that 

investors expect the funds rate to remain within the current target range at least 

through the third quarter and hence would probably not be surprised if the 

Committee’s announcement at this meeting expresses the same forward policy 

guidance as in recent statements.  Thus, there would likely be little change in bond 

yields, equity prices, or the foreign exchange value of the dollar. 

Policymakers might also wish to consider a variant of Alternative B that refers  

to the Committee’s evaluation of its securities “holdings” instead of its “purchases”.     

That variant might be particularly appealing to members who judge that asset sales 

should be used as a tool for influencing financial market conditions and for shrinking 

the overall size of the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet, perhaps well in advance of the 

onset of funds rate firming.  Such a variant might also be seen as helpful in conveying 

that the Committee is disinclined towards any further LSAP expansion but has not 

ruled out that policy option. 

A statement like this variant of Alternative B would probably cause a substantial 

shift in investors’ expectations about the anticipated trajectory of the Federal 

Reserve’s securities holdings.  The Desk’s survey indicates that none of the primary 

dealers expect the Federal Reserve to sell any securities during the first two quarters  

of this year; indeed, about three-fourths of the primary dealers do not anticipate  

any asset sales by the Federal Reserve over the next several years, and the remainder 

expect only modest amounts of such sales.  Thus, yields on agency MBS, agency debt, 

and Treasury securities could increase significantly in response to a Committee 

January 21, 2010 Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) Page 43 of 72



 

 

announcement along these lines, and the levels of actual and implied volatility in these 

markets would also tend to move up.  Implied volatility in the agency MBS market 

might also be boosted over the near term as investors perceived reduced prospects 

that the Federal Reserve would engage in further purchases of agency MBS during  

the second quarter, even if rates began rising sharply around the time of completion 

of its previously announced LSAPs.     

THE CASE FOR ALTERNATIVE C 

If policymakers are confident that a sustainable economic recovery is now  

under way and see substantial upside risks to the inflation outlook in the absence of 

appropriate near-term monetary policy adjustments, then the Committee might wish 

to issue a statement that shortens the horizon over which the funds rate is likely to 

remain low and that raises the possibility of active unwinding of the Federal Reserve’s 

securities holdings, as in Alternative C.  To the extent that inflation outcomes are seen 

as linked mainly to expected inflation rather than to resource slack, members may 

view the level of forward inflation compensation and the degree of dispersion in 

professional forecasters’ longer-run inflation projections as worrisome indicators that 

inflation expectations may not be anchored very firmly.  Under such circumstances, 

policymakers might judge that moving promptly to commence the withdrawal of 

extraordinary policy stimulus would play a key role in maintaining the public’s 

confidence in the Federal Reserve’s commitment to foster price stability.     

Participants may view the pace of economic recovery over coming quarters as 

mainly determined by the speed of structural adjustments rather than the extent of 

growth in aggregate demand, so that continuing to keep the real funds rate below zero 

for an extended period might be seen as likely to push up the inflation rate while 

having only a modest impact in stimulating real economic activity.  Moreover, with 

risk spreads having declined substantially and banks no longer tightening standards on 

January 21, 2010 Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) Page 44 of 72



 

 

C&I loans or consumer credit, participants may be increasingly concerned about the 

possibility that the extraordinarily high level of excess reserves held by the banking 

system might generate a brisk turnaround in lending and rapid growth in broad 

monetary aggregates that could exert significant upward pressure on inflation.  Even  

if the probability of such an outcome is judged to be low, the magnitude of the 

adverse consequences in such circumstances might warrant a shift to policies aimed  

at shrinking the size of the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet over coming months. 

Thus, policymakers may judge that the size and composition of the Federal 

Reserve’s portfolio should be actively managed via asset sales rather than relying 

exclusively on the redemption of maturing securities and on other tools such as 

reverse repos and the term deposit facility.  Asset sales may be viewed as particularly 

helpful in communicating the Committee’s commitment to permanent reductions  

in the balance sheet and thereby facilitate the anchoring of longer-term inflation 

expectations.  Moreover, in light of the marked improvements in financial market 

functioning since last spring, Committee members may anticipate that selling agency 

debt and agency MBS would have only modest effects on their yields relative to those 

of other securities. 

The adoption of a statement like that of Alternative C would greatly surprise 

financial market participants.  At present, investors understand the phrase 

“exceptionally low levels of the funds rate” as pointing to the current target range  

of 0 to 25 basis points, and hence the abbreviated phrase “low levels of the funds 

rate” would probably be viewed as referring to rates of around 1 or 2 percent that 

would still be quite low by historical standards.  Moreover, Alternative C uses the 

phrase “for some time” to refer to the duration over which the funds rate target 

would remain at low levels—not the time horizon preceding the onset of funds  

rate firming.  Thus, investors would be likely to interpret a statement like that of 

January 21, 2010 Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) Page 45 of 72



 

 

Alternative C as conveying the Committee’s intention to commence tightening  

quite soon—perhaps as early as March—and to move fairly quickly to raise the funds 

rate target to a level of around 1 or 2 percent.  Short-term interest rates would shift  

up substantially.  In addition, as noted above, term premiums on agency MBS and 

Treasury securities would likely shift upward as a result of heightened prospects that 

the Federal Reserve might actively reduce its “holdings” of securities over coming 

months.  As a result, longer-term yields would rise.  Forward measures of inflation 

compensation might decline if investors became less concerned about risks to the 

longer-term inflation outlook.  Equity prices would likely decline, and the foreign 

exchange value of the dollar would increase.   

THE CASE FOR ALTERNATIVE A 

If meeting participants are concerned about prospects for a subpar recovery  

and believe that further monetary stimulus would help improve the outlook for 

economic activity and inflation, then they might wish to expand the amount of the 

Federal Reserve’s agency MBS purchases by $250 billion and extend the horizon  

of those purchases through the third quarter of this year, as in Alternative A.  With  

these adjustments, agency MBS purchases could continue over coming months at  

an average rate of around $10 billion per week, about the same as the volume of the 

Desk’s purchases over recent weeks.   

 Participants, like the staff, may view the pace of economic recovery as likely to be 

slow—with the unemployment rate still above 8 percent at the end of next year—and 

see inflation running persistently below the rates they judge to be most consistent 

with the Federal Reserve’s dual mandate.  With such an outlook, policymakers might 

conclude that expanded monetary stimulus is warranted to promote a more robust 

recovery in a context of price stability.  Moreover, recent staff work on developing 

various tools for draining reserves may have strengthened participants’ confidence 

January 21, 2010 Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) Page 46 of 72



 

 

that additional securities can be purchased at this stage without undermining the 

Committee’s ability to withdraw monetary stimulus at the appropriate time. 

Members might see an even stronger rationale for providing additional monetary 

stimulus if their outlook is substantially weaker than that of the Greenbook or if they 

judge the risks to economic activity and inflation to be mainly tilted to the downside.  

For example, incoming information on retail sales and nonfarm payrolls might be  

read as suggesting that the economic recovery will be even more protracted, perhaps 

similar to the “Weaker Aggregate Demand” alternative scenario in the Greenbook.  

Furthermore, while the staff projects that core inflation will only decline slightly over 

coming quarters, participants may place greater probability on outcomes in which the 

persistence of substantial resource slack weighs more heavily on labor compensation 

and hence causes a steeper downward trajectory for inflation. 

Policymakers may also judge that augmenting the Federal Reserve’s agency MBS 

purchases would be especially helpful at the current juncture in order to mitigate 

increases in mortgage rates that could impair the recuperation of housing markets and 

undermine the economic recovery.  Indeed, conventional mortgage rates have moved 

up a quarter percentage point since mid-December, and in the absence of any agency 

MBS purchases beyond those previously announced, the staff anticipates a further 

increase of more than a quarter percentage point over the next few months.  Such 

increases in home loan rates might be viewed as particularly undesirable under  

current circumstances in which housing activity remains sluggish while the level of 

foreclosures continues to be elevated.   

An announcement like that of Alternative A would come as a surprise to market 

participants, since they do not appear to be anticipating any changes in the overall  

size or composition of the Federal Reserve’s LSAPs.  Staff estimates suggest that  

January 21, 2010 Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) Page 47 of 72



 

 

a $250 billion increase in agency MBS purchases might reduce mortgage rates and  

other longer-term yields by about 10 to 25 basis points.  Equity prices might rise, 

while the foreign exchange value of the dollar would likely decline.  Inflation 

compensation could increase if the Committee’s announcement undermined 

investors’ confidence in the viability of the Federal Reserve’s exit strategy.

LONG‐RUN PROJECTIONS OF THE BALANCE SHEET AND MONETARY BASE 

In this section, scenarios for the balance sheet are presented that correspond to 

the paths for large-scale asset purchases (LSAPs) of agency debt securities and agency 

MBS proposed in the alternatives discussed in the “Policy Alternatives” section of the 

Bluebook.  The baseline scenario corresponds to Alternative B in this Bluebook.  For 

the baseline, we assume that agency MBS purchases of $1.25 trillion and agency debt 

securities purchases of $175 billion are executed by the end of the first quarter of 

2010.  We also present a projection for Alternative A, where the agency MBS 

purchases are increased by $250 billion to a total of $1.5 trillion and are executed by 

the end of the third quarter of 2010; purchases of agency debt securities under this 

alternative remain at $175 billion and are executed by the end of the first quarter of 

2010.  We do not present balance sheet projections for Alternative C in this Bluebook 

because the Committee has not yet specified any strategy for asset sales or the use of 

other reserve draining tools.  Each alternative assumes that assets decline gradually 

over time due to redemptions and prepayments of securities holdings.  The 

announced LSAP purchases in Alternative B and Alternative C are the same, so the 

baseline projections for assets and reserves can serve as a reference for Alternative C. 

Projections for the scenarios are based on assumptions about each component of 

the balance sheet.13  Details of these assumptions are described in Appendix C.  

Substantive revisions to these assumptions, relative to the December Bluebook, are 

outlined below.  

                                           
13 The Greenbook projection assumes that the federal funds rate begins to rise in the fourth 
quarter of 2011.  The balance sheet projections assume that no draining of reserve balances 
is required to achieve the higher target federal funds rate. 

January 21, 2010 Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) Page 49 of 72



 

 

Under the baseline, total assets are slightly higher over most of the projection 

period than in the December Bluebook.  The modest upward revision in the size of 

the balance sheet is largely the result of a projected increase in the level of agency 

MBS holdings, which reflects a lower assumed pace of MBS prepayments.  The 

change in the path for prepayments is due largely to the incorporation of a higher 

assumed mortgage interest rate path.  In contrast, total support to AIG was revised 

down, reflecting expectations regarding the possibility of an initial public offering and 

the resulting disposition of preferred interests in AIA Aurora LLC & ALICO 

Holdings LLC.14  The projected levels of credit extended through Federal Reserve 

liquidity programs and credit facilities, except for the TALF, fall to zero fairly quickly 

this year, as in the last Bluebook.  Alternative A projects a higher contour of total 

assets because of the assumed larger purchases of agency MBS.     

On the liability side of the balance sheet, given the small increase in the debt 

ceiling in late December 2009, we assume that the Treasury’s Supplementary 

Financing Account (SFA) remains at its current level of $5 billion until June 2010.  

We assume that the Congress will pass a substantial boost in the debt ceiling at 

around that point.  After June, the SFA returns to $200 billion, its level in the middle 

of last year, and remains at this level until near the end of the projection period.  As 

the aggregate level of reserve balances declines to very low levels at the end of the 

projection period, balances in the SFA are drawn down, falling to zero in the baseline 

scenario.  On net, the revisions in the asset and liability components of the balance 

sheet imply a moderate upward revision in the level of reserve balances over the 

majority of the projection period. 
                                           
14 On March 2, 2009, the Federal Reserve and Treasury jointly announced a restructuring of 
the government’s assistance to AIG.  As part of this restructuring, on December 1, 2009, 
the revolving credit facility was reduced in exchange for preferred interests in two special 
purpose vehicles, AIA Aurora LLC and ALICO Holdings LLC, created to hold the 
outstanding common stock of two AIG subsidiaries.

   December 2016 $19 billion $19 billion

   Total purchased $1.5 trillion $1.25 trillion

   Peak month May 2010 March 2010 

   Peak amount $1.38 trillion $1.30 trillion 

 

For the baseline scenario, the balance sheet reaches a peak of nearly $2.4 trillion in 

April 2010.  The peak in the balance sheet occurs after the March 31 conclusion of 

large-scale asset purchases because of substantial lags in settlement of MBS purchases.  

In Alternative A, the size of the balance sheet peaks at $2.5 trillion, with the peak 

occurring a few months before all MBS purchases settle because of the runoff of

other assets.  By the end of 2016, the size of the balance sheet under both scenarios 

declines to roughly $1.5 trillion.15 

Reserve balances decline in the second half of 2010 primarily because of the 

return of the SFA to $200 billion.  Since the monetary base is derived from the 

balance sheet projections of Federal Reserve notes in circulation and reserve balances, 

and because currency is projected to follow a fairly gradual trajectory, the path of the 

monetary base in each scenario largely mirrors the path of reserve balances.  

Specifically, in each scenario, the monetary base peaks at essentially the same time as 

reserve balances, and as reserve balances decline, the monetary base contracts.  

Toward the end of the projection period, when reserve balances are assumed to 

stabilize at $25 billion, the level of the monetary base moves more in line with 

changes in Federal Reserve notes in circulation.   

  

                                           
15 The composition of Federal Reserve assets in these projections differs notably from 
historical patterns.  Prior to August 2007, U.S. Treasury securities were about 90 percent of 
assets and the Federal Reserve did not hold any agency mortgage-backed securities.  By 
contrast, under the baseline scenario, Treasury securities are projected to account for only 
around 34 percent of total assets at the end of 2010 and rise to just 43 percent of total 
assets at the end of the projection period.

DEBT, BANK CREDIT, AND MONEY FORECASTS 

The staff projects that domestic nonfinancial sector debt will expand at an annual 

rate of 2¾ percent this quarter, with this rise due almost entirely to an increase in 

federal debt.  For 2010 as a whole and in 2011, debt is projected to increase 5¼ 

percent; this forecast reflects rapid expected growth in federal debt, a moderate rise in 

state and local government debt, and a gradual turnaround in lending to households 

and to nonfinancial businesses.  After contracting 2 percent last year, household debt 

is expected to decline a bit further in the current quarter, and then grow tepidly 

through 2011.  Debt of the nonfinancial business sector is projected to edge up in the 

current quarter after having contracted slightly last year, with strong corporate bond 

issuance offsetting weak C&I and commercial real estate lending.  We expect only a 

modest rise in business debt over the forecast period, as demand for external funds 

generally remains soft and the commercial real estate market remains particularly 

weak. 

Commercial bank credit is expected to contract at an annual rate of 3 percent in 

the first quarter of 2010, reflecting continued drops in loans, especially to businesses.  

Over the entire year, bank credit is expected to expand just ½ percent, as moderate 

growth in securities continues to offset declines in loans during the first three 

quarters.  Loans in most categories are expected expand by the fourth quarter, though 

only weakly, reflecting a pickup in loan demand as the economic recovery gains steam, 

as well as an improvement in bank health and a gradual easing of standards and terms.  

Loans are expected to continue growing in 2011, with bank credit advancing 4¼ 

percent over the year.   

M2 is expected to remain flat in the current quarter, as a reallocation of household 

wealth toward higher-yielding non-M2 assets likely is continuing to weigh on money

demand.  As that process wanes over the rest of this year and into 2011, M2 growth is 

expected to pick up to a pace that is closer to that of nominal GDP.

DIRECTIVE 

The directive from the December meeting and draft language for the January 

directive are provided below.  The staff recommends that the directive issued at  

this meeting under Alternative B or Alternative C include the following sentence:   

“The Committee directs the Desk to engage in dollar roll transactions as necessary  

to facilitate settlement of the Federal Reserve's agency MBS purchases that are to  

be conducted through the end of March 31, 2010, as directed above.”   

The Authorization for Domestic Open Market Operations (the “Authorization”) 

permits the Desk to buy and sell agency MBS to the extent necessary to carry out  

the most recent domestic policy directive.  (Dollar roll transactions are a particular 

method of buying and selling agency MBS on a temporary basis.  Dollar roll 

transactions have proven helpful to the Desk in settling MBS purchases. )  If the 

Committee does not direct execution of agency MBS purchases beyond March 31,  

the current authorization would not permit the Desk to engage in dollar roll 

transactions after that date in the process of settling previous MBS purchases.   

Including the recommended sentence in the directives for the next several 

meetings would allow the Desk to conduct such transactions only as needed to settle 

finally any agency MBS purchased through the end of March 31, 2010, and would 

make clear to counterparties that the Desk has the necessary authority.  The additional 

sentence would seem not to be needed under Alternative A, as the directive under 

that alternative would instruct the Desk to continue to purchase MBS through the 

third quarter, and thus dollar roll transactions would remain authorized through that 

time as they are at present.

DECEMBER FOMC MEETING 

The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and financial conditions that 

will foster price stability and promote sustainable growth in output.  To further its 

long-run objectives, the Committee seeks conditions in reserve markets consistent 

with federal funds trading in a range from 0 to ¼ percent. The Committee directs  

the Desk to purchase agency debt and agency MBS during the intermeeting period 

with the aim of providing support to private credit markets and economic activity.  

The timing and pace of these purchases should depend on conditions in the markets 

for such securities and on a broader assessment of private credit market conditions.  

The Desk is expected to execute purchases of about $175 billion in housing-related 

agency debt and about $1.25 trillion of agency MBS by the end of the first quarter  

of 2010.  The Desk is expected to gradually slow the pace of these purchases as they 

near completion.  The Committee anticipates that outright purchases of securities will 

cause the size of the Federal Reserve's balance sheet to expand significantly in coming 

months.  The System Open Market Account Manager and the Secretary will keep the 

Committee informed of ongoing developments regarding the System's balance sheet 

that could affect the attainment over time of the Committee's objectives of maximum 

employment and price stability.

APPENDIX A:  MEASURES OF THE EQUILIBRIUM REAL RATE 

The equilibrium real rate is the real federal funds rate that, if maintained, would be projected to 
return output to its potential level over time.  The short-run equilibrium rate is defined as the rate 
that would close the output gap in twelve quarters given the corresponding model’s projection of 
the economy.  The medium-run concept is the value of the real federal funds rate projected to keep 
output at potential in seven years, under the assumption that monetary policy acts to bring actual 
and potential output into line in the short run and then keeps them equal thereafter.  The TIPS-
based factor model measure provides an estimate of market expectations for the real federal funds 
rate seven years ahead.  

The actual real federal funds rate is constructed as the difference between the nominal rate and 
realized inflation, where the nominal rate is measured as the quarterly average of the observed 
federal funds rate, and realized inflation is given by the log difference between the core PCE price 
index and its lagged value four quarters earlier.  If the upcoming FOMC meeting falls early in the 
quarter, the lagged inflation measure ends in the last quarter.  For the current quarter, the nominal 
rate is specified as the target federal funds rate on the Bluebook publication date.   

Measure  Description 

Single-
equation 

Model 

The measure of the equilibrium real rate in the single-equation model is based on an 
estimated aggregate-demand relationship between the current value of the output gap and its 
lagged values as well as the lagged values of the real federal funds rate. 

Small 
Structural 

Model 

The small-scale model of the economy consists of equations for six variables: the output 
gap, the equity premium, the federal budget surplus, the trend growth rate of output, the real 
bond yield, and the real federal funds rate. 

EDO 
Model 

Estimates of the equilibrium real rate using EDO—an estimated dynamic-stochastic-
general-equilibrium (DSGE) model of the U.S. economy—depend on data for major 
spending categories, price and wages, and the federal funds rate as well as the model’s 
structure and estimate of the output gap. 

FRB/US 
Model 

Estimates of the equilibrium real rate using FRB/US—the staff’s large-scale econometric 
model of the U.S. economy—depend on a very broad array of economic factors, some of 
which take the form of projected values of the model’s exogenous variables. 

Greenbook-
consistent 

Two measures are presented—based on the FRB/US and the EDO models.  Both models 
are matched to the extended Greenbook forecast.  Model simulations determine the value of 
the real federal funds rate that closes the output gap conditional on the extended baseline. 

TIPS-based 
Factor 
Model 

Yields on TIPS (Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities) reflect investors’ expectations of 
the future path of real interest rates.  The TIPS-based measure of the equilibrium real rate is 
constructed using the seven-year-ahead instantaneous real forward rate derived from TIPS 
yields as of the Bluebook publication date.  This forward rate is adjusted to remove 
estimates of the term and liquidity premiums based on a three-factor arbitrage-free term-
structure model applied to TIPS yields, nominal yields, and inflation. 

January 21, 2010 Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) Page 63 of 72



 

Estimates of the real federal funds rate depend on the proxies for expected inflation used.  The table 
below shows estimated real federal funds rates based on lagged core PCE inflation, the definition 
used in the Equilibrium Real Federal Funds Rate chart; lagged four-quarter headline PCE inflation; 
and projected four-quarter headline PCE inflation beginning with the next quarter.  For each 
estimate of the real rate, the table also provides the Greenbook-consistent measure of the short-run 
equilibrium real rate and the average actual real federal funds rate over the next twelve quarters.

APPENDIX B:  ANALYSIS OF POLICY PATHS AND CONFIDENCE INTERVALS 

RULE SPECIFICATIONS   
For the following rules, it denotes the federal funds rate for quarter t, while the explanatory variables 
include the staff’s projection of trailing four-quarter core PCE inflation (πt), inflation two and three 
quarters ahead (πt+2|t and πt+3|t), the output gap in the current period and one quarter ahead ( y *t  y  
and yt t 1|  y *t t1| ), and the three-quarter-ahead forecast of annual average GDP growth relative to 
potential ( 4 4y *t t 3|  yt 3|t ), and  *  denotes an assumed value of policymakers’ long-run inflation 
objective.  The outcome-based and forecast-based rules were estimated using real-time data over the 
sample 1988:1-2006:4; each specification was chosen using the Bayesian information criterion. Each 
rule incorporates a 75 basis point shift in the intercept, specified as a sequence of 25 basis point 
increments during the first three quarters of 1998.  The first two simple rules were proposed by 
Taylor (1993, 1999).  The prescriptions of the first-difference rule do not depend on assumptions 
regarding r* or the level of the output gap; see Orphanides (2003). 

t

Outcome-based rule it =  1.20it-1–0.39it-2+0.19[1.17  + 1.73 πt  + 3.66( *t ty y )  – 2.72( *1 1t ty y  )] 

Forecast-based rule it =  1.18it-1–0.38it-2+0.20[0.98 +1.72 πt+2|t+2.29( *1| 1|t t t ty y  )–1.37( *1 1t ty y  )] 

Taylor (1993) rule it = 2 + πt + 0.5(πt – * ) + 0.5( *t ty y ) 

Taylor (1999) rule it = 2 + πt + 0.5(πt – * ) + ( *t ty y ) 

First-difference rule it = it-1 + 0.5(πt+3|t – * ) + 0.5( 4 4 *3| 3|t t t ty y    ) 

FRB/US MODEL SIMULATIONS   
Prescriptions from the two empirical rules are computed using dynamic simulations of the FRB/US 
model, implemented as though the rule were followed starting at this FOMC meeting.  The dotted 
line labeled “Previous Bluebook” is based on the current specification of the policy rule, applied to 
the previous Greenbook projection.  Confidence intervals are based on stochastic simulations of the 
FRB/US model with shocks drawn from the estimated residuals over 1969-2008.  

INFORMATION FROM FINANCIAL MARKETS   
The expected funds rate path is based on Eurodollar quotes and implied three-month forward rates 
from swaps, and the confidence intervals for this path are constructed using prices of interest rate 
caps.  

NEAR‐TERM PRESCRIPTIONS OF SIMPLE POLICY RULES   
These prescriptions are calculated using Greenbook projections for inflation and the output gap. 
Because the first-difference rule involves the lagged funds rate, the value labeled “Previous 
Bluebook” for the current quarter is computed using the actual value of the lagged funds rate, and 
the one-quarter-ahead prescriptions are based on this rule’s prescription for the current quarter.

APPENDIX C:  LONG‐RUN PROJECTIONS OF THE BALANCE SHEET AND 
MONETARY BASE  

This appendix presents the assumptions underlying the projections provided in the section entitled 
“Long-Run Projections of the Balance Sheet and Monetary Base.” 

GENERAL ASSUMPTIONS 
The balance sheet projections are constructed on a monthly frequency from January 2010 to 
December 2016.  The few balance sheet items that are not discussed below are assumed to be 
constant over the projection period at the level observed on December 31, 2009.  The projections 
for all major asset and liability categories are summarized in the charts and table that follow the 
bullet points.   

The Greenbook projection assumes that the federal funds rate begins to rise in the fourth quarter of 
2011.  The balance sheet projections assume that no draining of reserve balances is required to 
achieve the higher target federal funds rate. 

ASSETS 

Asset Purchases 

 The baseline scenario, corresponding to Alternative B, incorporates large-scale asset 
purchases (LSAP) roughly in line with those that have been announced.   

o The Committee purchases $175 billion in agency debt securities and $1.25 trillion in 
agency MBS; both types of purchases are to be executed by the end of the first 
quarter of 2010. 
 Agency debt securities and agency MBS are held to maturity and are not 

replaced.  Prepayments of MBS are not reinvested. 
 Holdings of agency debt securities peak at $172 billion in March 2010, and 

decline slowly over the remainder of the forecast horizon as they mature.  
The peak is slightly below the announced purchase amount, reflecting 
maturing agency debt securities already in the SOMA portfolio.    

 Due to expected settlement lags and prepayments, agency MBS holdings 
peak at $1.1 trillion in June 2010, a somewhat lower level than the amount 
purchased.1  For agency MBS, the rate of prepayment is based on estimates 
from one of the program’s investment managers.  The historically low 
coupon on these securities implies a relatively slow prepayment rate.  As a 
result, at the end of 2016, $708 billion of the $1.25 trillion of MBS purchased 
remain on the balance sheet. 

o The Committee’s purchases of $300 billion in U.S. Treasury securities related to the 
LSAP program were completed by the end of October 2009. 

                                           
1 Prepayments include regular payments of principal and repayments of mortgages. 

January 21, 2010 Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) Page 67 of 72



   
 

 

 

 The maturity distribution of the Treasury securities purchased as a part of the 
LSAP program is based on data from the Federal Reserve Bank of New 
York’s Markets Group.  The maturities of most purchases are between two 
and ten years, with the current weighted average maturity being about six 
years.  The first maturity of an LSAP Treasury security will occur in April of 
this year. 

 No Treasury securities purchased as a part of the LSAP program are sold, 
and maturing securities are not rolled over.  As a result, total holdings of 
Treasury securities decline as issues mature.  Treasury securities held in the 
SOMA portfolio prior to the initiation of the LSAP program are assumed to 
be reinvested as they mature.   

 In the scenario corresponding to Alternative A, the Committee increases its purchases of 
agency MBS by $250 billion to a total of $1.5 trillion and extends the timeframe for these 
purchases to the end of the third quarter of 2010.  The Committee completes its purchase of 
$175 billion in agency debt securities by the end of the first quarter of 2010. 

 Projections for Alternative C are not presented in this Bluebook because the Committee has 
not yet specified any strategy for asset sales or the use of other reserve draining tools.  The 
announced LSAP purchases in Alternative B and Alternative C are the same, so the baseline 
projections for assets and reserves can serve as a reference for Alternative C.  

 A minimum level of $25 billion is set for reserve balances.  To ensure that reserves do not 
fall below this minimum level, first the U.S. Treasury’s Supplementary Financing Account 
(SFA) is reduced.  If this does not generate enough reserves, then Treasury securities are 
purchased.  By the end of the projection period in Alternative B, the expansion of Federal 
Reserve notes in circulation and capital, combined with a runoff of assets, necessitates not 
only the reduction of the U.S. Treasury’s supplementary financing account to zero, but also 
the resumption of Treasury securities purchases to maintain reserve balances at a level of $25 
billion. 

Liquidity Programs and Credit Facilities 

 Primary credit declines gradually from its current level to $1 billion by the end of 2011 and 
remains at that level thereafter.  Secondary credit is assumed to be zero over the forecast 
period. 

 The Term Auction Facility (TAF) falls to zero by April 2010 and remains at zero thereafter.   
 The Term Asset-Backed Securities Loan Facility (TALF) peaks at $63 billion in March 2010.  

Credit extended through this facility is assumed to reach zero in the second quarter of 2015, 
reflecting loan maturities and prepayments. 

o TALF loans are extended with either a three-year or a five-year term. 
 Until loans with a three-year term begin to mature in 2012, the decline in 

TALF is attributable to prepayments.   
 In 2012, TALF loans outstanding begin to decline more rapidly, reflecting 

the maturity of three-year loans.   

January 21, 2010 Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) Page 68 of 72



   
 

 

 After all three-year loans have matured in 2013, TALF declines at a less rapid 
pace as five-year loans prepay and mature, because the dollar amount of five-
year loans is smaller than the dollar amount of three-year loans. 

o TALF three- and five-year loans backed by asset-backed securities other than 
commercial mortgage-backed securities (CMBS) reach $51 billion by March 2010.  A 
portion of these loans are expected to prepay, and the quantity outstanding reaches 
zero by the end of the third quarter of 2014. 

o TALF three- and five-year loans backed by CMBS reach $13 billion by June 2010.  A 
portion of these loans are expected to prepay, and the quantity outstanding reaches 
zero by the end of the second quarter of 2015. 

 The Commercial Paper Funding Facility (CPFF) and central bank liquidity swap lines are 
assumed to expire on February 1, 2010; funds extended through these facilities decline to 
zero in the first half of 2010 as their credit extensions mature. 

 No credit is extended through either the Asset-Backed Commercial Paper Money Market 
Mutual Fund Liquidity Facility (AMLF) or the Primary Dealer Credit Facility (PDCF) before 
the facilities expire on February 1, 2010. 

 Credit extended to AIG, the sum of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York’s extension of 
revolving credit and its preferred interests in AIA Aurora LLC and ALICO Holdings LLC, 
drops to $24 billion by the third quarter of 2010 and then declines to zero by the end of 
2013.2 

 The assets held by Maiden Lane LLC, Maiden Lane II LLC, and Maiden Lane III LLC are 
sold over time and reach either zero or a nominal level by the end of 2016.   

 The assets held by TALF LLC increase to $2 billion by June 2012 and remain at that level 
through 2014, before dropping down to zero by the end of 2015.  Assets held by TALF LLC 
comprise investments purchased with commitment fees collected by the LLC and from the 
U.S. Treasury’s initial funding.  The LLC does not purchase any ABS received by the Federal 
Reserve Bank of New York in connection with a decision of a borrower not to repay a 
TALF loan.  

Other Assets 

 The Special Drawing Rights (SDR) certificate account increases by $2 billion, to $7 billion, 
by the third quarter of 2011, as a result of an assumed monetization of the recent allocation 
of SDRs. 

LIABILITIES AND CAPITAL 
 All liability and capital assumptions are the same across scenarios except where noted below. 
 Federal Reserve notes in circulation grow in line with the staff forecast for money stock 

currency through the end of 2011.  From 2011 to the end of the projection period, Federal 

 

                                           
2 On March 2, 2009, the Federal Reserve and Treasury jointly announced a restructuring of the government’s assistance 

to AIG.  As part of this restructuring, on December 1, 2009, the revolving credit facility was reduced in exchange for 
preferred interests in two special purpose vehicles created to hold common stock of two AIG subsidiaries.   

January 21, 2010 Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) Page 69 of 72



   
 

 

Reserve notes in circulation grow at the same rate as nominal GDP, as projected in the 
extended Greenbook forecast. 

 Reverse repurchase agreements remain roughly at the current level of reverse repurchase 
agreements with foreign official and international accounts.  Some minor fluctuations in the 
near-term level of reverse repurchase agreements reflect the tests by the Open Market Desk 
of triparty reverse repurchase agreements with primary dealers.  

 The U.S. Treasury’s general account (TGA) follows the staff forecast for end-of-month U.S. 
Treasury operating cash balances through June 2010.3  Thereafter, the TGA drops back to its 
historical target level of $5 billion by the end of this year as it is assumed that the Treasury 
will have implemented a new cash management system that allows it to easily invest funds in 
excess of $5 billion.  The TGA remains constant at $5 billion over the remainder of the 
forecast period. 

 In the near term, movements in the U.S. Treasury’s supplementary financing account (SFA) 
reflect constraints the U.S. Treasury faces with regards to its debt limit.  As a result of the 
modest increase in the debt limit in December, the SFA is forecast to remain at its current 
level of $5 billion through the second quarter of 2010.  Subsequently, under the assumption 
that the Congress raises the debt limit, the balances in the SFA gradually increase to $200 
billion over the third quarter of 2010 and remain at this level in each of the scenarios until 
the SFA is reduced to ensure reserve balance levels do not fall below $25 billion.  The timing 
of when the SFA is reduced to maintain reserve balance levels of $25 billion varies across the 
scenarios. 

 Federal Reserve capital grows 15 percent per year, in line with the average rate of the past 
ten years. 

 In general, the level of assets of the Federal Reserve drives the level of reserve balances.  
Increases in the levels of other liability items, such as Federal Reserve notes in circulation 
and the TGA, along with increases in the level of Reserve Bank capital, drain reserve 
balances.  Reserve balances in the baseline scenario peak earlier and at a lower level than in 
the Alternative A scenario.  However, in both scenarios, reserve balances fall back to $25 
billion by the end of the forecast horizon.

e staff forecast for end-of-month U.S. Treasury operating cash balances includes forecasts of both the TGA and 
ances associated with the U.S. Treasury’s Tax and Loan program.  Because balances associated with the Tax and 
an program are $2 billion, for the time being, this forecast is a good proxy for the level of TGA balances.
