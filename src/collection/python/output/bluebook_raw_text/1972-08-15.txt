MONETARY AGGREGATES AND
MONEY MARKET CONDITIONS

Recent developments

(1) Reserves available to support private non-bank deposits now

appear to be growing at about a 6.5 per cent annual rate over the July-August

target period, at the upper end of the 3-7 per cent annual rate range desired

by the Committee. Over the past two weeks it had appeared that RPD growth

was running slightly above the target range, but various technical revisions

as well as lower than projected excess reserves in the week just ended

reduced the RPD level somewhat.

(2) During most of the interval since the previous Committee

meeting, the Federal funds rate averaged around 4-1/2 per cent, down slightly

from the 4-5/8 per cent level that had prevailed briefly early in July.

With RPD growth appearing to be on the high side of the target range and

M1 expanding substantially more than projected, however, the Desk began to

hold back on its reserve supplying operations, forcing banks to meet a larger

share of their reserve needs through borrowing at the discount window. This

edged the funds rate back to the 4-5/8 per cent level. Since the large-scale

Treasury refunding was in progress at the time, the Desk felt constrained by

even-keel considerations from putting pressure on the funds rate much beyond

that point. Most recently, although dealer inventories of the new refunding

issues are still large, the favorable general performance of securities



-2-

markets has made it possible for the Desk to press a little harder on reserves,

and the funds rate has moved up to about 4-3/4 per cent.

(3) The early July bulge in private demand deposits evident at

the time of the last Committee meeting receded somewhat over the latter part

of the month, but this drop-off was significantly smaller than expected.

As a result, M1 rose at a 15 per cent annual rate during the month, even

faster than the 10.4 per cent rate estimated for the policy alternative

approved at the last meeting. 1/ Data for the first two weeks of August

indicated that M1 is continuing to exceed levels thought likely a month ago,

although the differences are not so sharp as in July. During the second

quarter, the demand for cash balances had seemed on the low side, given the

rapid expansion of nominal GNP and the marked earlier decline of interest

rates extending into early 1972. Thus, the stronger July and August perform-

ance may be signaling a catch-up to more normal relationships between changes

in M1, interest rates, and GNP.

(4) In contrast to M1, growth of M2 was about as projected in

July, as slower than forecast growth in time deposits other than large CD's

offset the stronger advance in demand deposits. While savings inflows appear

to have strengthened a bit in early August and are tending--in combination

with demand deposits--to boost M2 a little above earlier expectations, growth

in other time and savings deposits has remained below the rapid pace set

earlier in the year.

(5) The adjusted credit proxy expanded much more in July than thought

likely at the time of the Committee meeting, and in early August it continues

1/ Various technical factors during July increased somewhat the volume of
private demand deposits supportable by a given level of reserves. In
particular, a greater than expected share of the demand deposit increase
lodged at country banks, where reserve requirements are lower.



-3-

to show somewhat greater strength than anticipated. The strength in private

demand deposits and a larger than projected increase in negotiable CD's

accounted for much of this overshoot, but the principal factor at work was

the failure of U. S. Treasury deposits to decline as expected from their

relatively high June level. Large foreign central bank acquisitions of

special Treasury issues and lower than estimated Federal spending accounted

for this relative stability in Treasury balances.

(6) Investors responded enthusiastically to the Treasury's August

refunding package, and the consequent attrition of only $630 million was

readily met out of the Treasury's ample cash position. Exchange offers

accepted totaled $8.1 billion, of which $4.1 billion was in the longer

seven and twelve year options. The new issues have performed well thus far in

the after-market, although dealer holdings of these issues still totaled $910

million on August 10.

(7) Interest rates on market securities--both long and short-term--

have declined on balance during the interval between Committee meetings, in

some cases by as much as 25 basis points. Treasury bill yields have edged

up recently from the lows reached during the Treasury refunding--when holders

of "rights" not wishing to make the exchange were switching into other short-

term Treasury issues--but they are a touch below the levels prevailing at the

time of the last meeting. The 3-month bill, for example, was bid at 3.84 per

cent on Friday, down 5 basis points from the last meeting.

(8) The following table compares seasonally adjusted annual rates

of change in major financial aggregates for recent periods with the average

annual rate of growth over the past two and a half years.

Prospective developments

(9) The persistent recent tendency for M1 levels to come in

higher than projected has led the staff to raise its estimates of likely

money demands in both the third and fourth quarters. While some of the

early July bulge in private demand deposits does seem to have been

transitory, continued rapid GNP expansion over the months ahead, along

with the lagged influence of the relatively stable interest rate levels

since spring, can be expected to generate sizable further growth in

money demands. Special factors that may add to money demand in the coming

quarter include the large boost in social security payments and the prospect

of a retroactive revenue sharing payment to States and localities by the

Federal government. For the third quarter, the deposit data thus far

available suggests that expansion in M1 is moving along a path that will

produce an annual growth rate of about 9 per cent. This is well above the

6-1/2 per cent rate thought to be consistent with the policy specifications

adopted at the last meeting, and is close to the 9-1/2 per cent expansion

rate now projected for nominal GNP.

(10) Adherence to an RPD target at this juncture that might

achieve 6-1/2 per cent M1 growth rate in the third quarter would produce

a drastic tightening in money market conditions. Moreover, money market

conditions would have to ease markedly after the third quarter in order to

keep growth in the aggregates from falling too sharply in the fourth and

first quarters. To avoid the resulting whip-sawing effect on credit

conditions, the suggested policy alternatives that follow are designed to



-6-

achieve a moderation in growth of the aggregates over a longer interval.

Since even a policy directed at slowing money growth substantially in the

fourthquarter would be likely to generate significant lagged interest

rate effects on money demands during early 1973, the staff has carried

its projection of M1 changes under the three directive alternatives

through the first quarter. Estimates this far ahead, of course, are

subject to considerable uncertainty.

(11) Patterns of monetary aggregates, RPD, and money market

conditions are summarized for the three suggested directive alternatives

in the table below, with details in the tables on the two following

pages. Alternative C would set an RPD growth path designed to slow

expansion in M1 down to a 6-1/2 per cent annual rate by the fourth quarter.

The staff's best judgment is that this RPD would be associated with a

sharply higher Federal funds rate, perhaps fluctuating around 6 per cent.

General interest rate increases resulting from such a change would be

expected to lead to further reduction in money growth to about 4-1/2

per cent rate in the first quarter of 1973. Alternative B would move

less aggressively to slow growth in the aggregates--moderating the ex-

pansion of M1 to an annual rate of 7-1/2 per cent in the fourth quarter

and 6 per cent in the first. Under this approach, the response of

interest rates would be less marked than under

Alternative C; the Federal funds rate would be expected to fluctuate

around 5-1/4 per cent, about 50 basis points above its recent level.

Alternative A would achieve the least moderation in M1 growth, and would



-7-

be associated with little change in money market conditions. Under this

alternative, M 1 would be expected to grow over the fourth and first

quarters combined at about a 7-1/2 per cent rate, the same rate as had

been specified for the third quarter under alternative A in the last

bluebook. Under all three of the policy alternatives outlined, M2 and

the bank credit proxy are expected to average close to a 9 per cent annual

rate of growth in the third quarter. Thereafter, the rate of growth in

M2 is expected to slow, as rising interest rates on market securities

become increasingly attractive to savers. Anticipated more aggressive

bank issuance of large CD's, however, would be expected to sustain the

rate of growth in the credit proxy during the fall.

-10-

(12) Under all three of the alternatives, short-term rates are

likely to be moving upward in the fourth quarter under pressure from rising

credit demands. Some of this pressure will come from business demands on

banks and the commercial paper market, but the major factor will be the

heavy anticipated Federal cash borrowing--which will undoubtedly be mainly

in short-term markets. (The period of heavy Treasury borrowing will not come

until October, but some financing may be needed in September, possibly close

to the time when the System will also be selling Treasury issues to absorb

the excess reserves released by the combined effects of changes in Regulation D

and J.) Even under alternative A, although little change would be anticipated

in the Federal funds rate, the 3-month Treasury bill rate might rise from

its recently depressed rate by 50 basis points or so during the fourth quarter,

and very likely will advance further in early 1973. Upward pressure on

short-term rates, of course, would be considerably greater under alternative B--

and more so under C. Thus, the 3-month bill rate might rise to 5 per cent

or more by the end of the fourth quarter under B and could be approaching

6 per cent under C.

(13) Rising short-term interest rates would begin to have an

increasing impact on rates of growth in M1 as the fourth quarter progressed,

but their major restraining effects on M1 would probably not occur until the

early months of 1973. The temporary slowing shown for August in the monthly

average M1 growth rate is a statistical consequence of the early July bulge;

from the last week in July to the last week of August, the projected annual

growth rate in M1 is over 9 per cent.



-11-

(14) As money market instruments rise in yield, their increasing

relative attractiveness can be expected to dampen fourth quarter flows

into consumer-type time and savings deposits. Even under alternative A

a moderate slowing of inflows to accounts is expected to occur; under

alternative B the higher level of short-term market rates would have a

more noticeable effect. The money market rates associated with

alternative C would reduce inflows still further, and given present

rate ceilings, they could also make all but the highest yielding longer-

term accounts non-competitive with market instruments by the time of

the year-end interest-crediting period. As shown in the table on page 8,

growth in M2 over the fourth quarter is expected to slow progressively

more than M1 under alternatives B and C.

(15) Under alternatives B or C, banks could be expected to take

a more aggressive stance in the CD market, as inflows of other time

deposits decelerate and as business loan demands rise. Additional

borrowing in the Eurodollar market would be expected to remain modest,

however, so long as the 20 per cent marginal reserve requirement on such

borrowings remains in effect. The latitude for bank issuance of CD's

should be a major factor tending to sustain the rate of growth of the

credit proxy even under the firmer money market conditions associated with

alternatives B or C.

(16) Under alternative A, interest rates in longer-term markets

would probably remain relatively stable until late in the year. It is

likely that corporations, with relatively high liquidity and increased

emphasis on equity financing, private placements, and short-term borrowing,



-12-

will continue their relatively moderate pace of bond offerings, and

that State and local borrowings will remain below last year's high

Mortgage demands are expected to moderate in any event, both seasonally

and in line with the decline in housing starts. However, the increases

in money market rates associated with alternative B could produce an

earlier advance in long-term rates, and under alternative C the upward

movement in long rates would undoubtedly be both large and prompt. In

the latter circumstances investors would tend to withdraw from the market

to await anticipated higher yields and issuers could be expected to

accelerate offerings now planned for 1973. The tax-exempt market would

be adversely affected by reduced bank purchases, and the impact on the

mortgage market could be quite substantial as institutional lenders began

to experience a slowing of savings inflows in the context of a record volume

of outstanding commitments.



-13-

Proposed directives

(17) Three alternative formulations for the operational

paragraph of the directive are presented below. They might be

associated with the correspondingly lettered patterns of growth in

the aggregates described in the preceding section.

(18) Alternative A.

"To implement this policy, while taking account of

[DEL: the forthcoming Treasury financing developments in capital

markets and] international developments, the Committee

seeks to achieve bank reserve and money market conditions

that will support [DEL: moderate] growth in monetary aggregates

over the months ahead AT ABOUT THE AVERAGE RATES RECORDED

IN THE FIRST HALF OF THE YEAR."

(19) Alternative B.

"To implement this policy, while taking account of

[DEL: the forthcoming Treasury financing,] developments in capital

markets, [DEL: and international developments,] the Committee seeks

to achieve bank reserve and money market conditions that will

support moderate growth in monetary aggregates over the months

ahead."



-14-

(20) Alternative C.

"To implement this policy, while taking account of [DEL: the

forthcoming Treasury financing,] developments in capital markets,

[DEL: and international developments,] the Committee seeks to achieve

bank reserve and money market conditions that will support

[DEL: moderate] SOMEWHAT SLOWER growth in monetary aggregates over

the months ahead."

(21) In all three alternatives it is proposed to delete the

reference to the Treasury financing, now that it is completed. The

Committee has interpreted a reference to international developments in

other recent directives as calling for use of operating techniques designed

to minimize downward pressures on short-term interest rates. Retention of

this reference is proposed only in alternative A, since that is the only

policy course herein described under which there is believed to be any

significant possibility for short-term rate declines. It is proposed to

delete the reference to capital market developments in alternative A, since

generally stable long-term rates are foreseen under that alternative.

Retention of this reference in alternative B could be construed, as in

past directives, to call for the types of operations best calculated to

minimize upward pressure on long-term rates. In alternative C the same

language could be interpreted as calling for adopting Desk operations as

necessary to facilitate orderly market adjustments to the higher long-term

rate levels foreseen.
