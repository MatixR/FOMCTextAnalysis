Strictly Confidential (FR) Class I FOMC

MONETARY POLICY ALTERNATIVES

Prepared for the Federal Open Market Committee

By the staff Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System



STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL (FR)
CLASS I - FOMC March 22, 1991

MONETARY POLICY ALTERNATIVES

Recent Developments

(1) In the period immediately after the February FOMC meeting,

the Desk sought a degree of reserve pressure consistent with federal funds

continuing to trade in the area of 6-1/4 percent. Reserve targets were

based on a formal allowance for adjustment plus seasonal borrowing of $100

million. On March 8, in response to data indicating that the economy had

continued to weaken substantially into February, the borrowing allowance

was lowered by $25 million and the Desk signalled a 25 basis point

reduction in the System's intended federal funds rate. The average

federal funds rate has dropped to 6.11 since the easing, down from 6.33

percent over the first two maintenance periods after the meeting.

Adjustment plus seasonal borrowing has run appreciably above the path

allowance, in part reflecting a greater willingness by banks to come to

the discount window when conditions tighten in the funds market.1

(2) The change in borrowing behavior may have been one reason

for a substantial decrease in the volatility of the federal funds rate

over the intermeeting period. The intraday trading range, for example,

has narrowed to levels prevailing last autumn, before the cut in reserve

requirements. An additional factor damping funds rate movements may have

been the greater experience of bank reserve managers in operating with

1. Borrowing averaged $264 million in the first two maintenance peri-
ods, and $138 million in the most recent complete maintenance period.
In the current period, the Desk made a technical upward adjustment of
$50 million to the borrowing assumption in recognition of the usual
upturn in seasonal borrowing and the greater use of adjustment credit.



lower balances. The most important factor, however, probably has been the

rise of required reserve balances from their seasonal low reached in early

February, so that, together with enlarged required clearing balances, they

now appear to exceed the level needed for daily clearing purposes. With

required balances moving above clearing needs, demands for excess reserves

fell over the intermeeting period, averaging a more normal $1.1 billion in

the last two maintenance periods.

(3) Despite the drop in the federal funds rate, short-term

Treasury bill rates declined only very slightly over the intermeeting

period and rates on longer-term Treasury issues rose about 35 basis

2
points. The upward pressures on rates likely stemmed primarily from

improved prospects for economic recovery following the quick and success-

ful conclusion of the war--with the resulting rebound in consumer con-

fidence and demands for reconstruction capital by Kuwait. Signs of

increased activity in housing markets also appeared to foreshadow an eco-

nomic turnaround, which--along with disappointing news on prices--was seen

as limiting any scope for further easing by the Federal Reserve. Antici-

pation of better business earnings and reduced strains on borrowers have

helped narrow spreads of private securities over Treasury debt during the

intermeeting period, particularly for those issuers that had been seen as

especially vulnerable to a prolonged recession. Rates on most private

short-term paper have declined a little more than Treasury bill rates

while, in contrast to yields on Treasury bonds, rates on high-grade bonds

are little changed and those on lower-rated bonds are down substantially.

Stock prices flirted with record levels during the period, though they

have retraced part of these gains in recent days. Bank stock prices were

about unchanged over the period, but spreads on subordinated bank debt

have narrowed substantially--drawing forth some issuance--and the access

of lower-rated banks to the federal funds market has become a bit less

restricted.

(4) The dollar's weighted-average foreign exchange value soared

11 percent over the intermeeting period; the dollar rose about 12 percent

from its low just after the February FOMC meeting, before easing back a

little over the last few days. In addition to optimism about the U.S.

economy, there was a growing perception that growth abroad was weakening

and that foreign interest rates were now more likely to move lower, on

average, than higher. Political turmoil in the Soviet Union appeared to

affect the German mark adversely, and the dollar rose more against the

mark than against the yen. These factors, however, seem unable to account

fully for the extraordinary strength of the dollar. Whereas in the first

days of the intermeeting period the Desk

sold $850 million equivalent of marks to support the

dollar, by the second week of March the Desk was selling dollars ($330

million)

Foreign short-term interest rates on



-4-

average declined about 35 basis points over the period, while long-term

rates were about unchanged.

(5) At least partly in response to earlier declines in interest

rates, the monetary aggregates have accelerated in recent months. M2

increased at an 8-1/2 percent annual rate in February, and partial data

suggest growth has continued in March at about a 7 percent pace. This

outcome would bring expansion over the December-to-March period to a 5-1/2

percent pace, considerably above the FOMC's expectation at the last meet-

ing of 3-1/2 to 4 percent, and would leave M2 near the middle of its 2-1/2

to 6-1/2 percent target range. The bulk of the acceleration within M2 has

occurred in liquid retail deposits--OCDs, savings, and MMDAs. Offering

rates on these accounts have, as usual, responded quite sluggishly to the

declines in market interest rates over the past several months, substan-

tially reducing their opportunity costs. In addition, demand deposits

also reversed their January decline, and currency growth remained brisk in

February before moderating this month. The belated emergence of a

response to opportunity costs, which had been narrowing since last summer,

may suggest some return of confidence in the banking system, in light of

the prospects for economic recovery and absence of new highly publicized

3. M1 expanded at a 14 percent rate in February and growth is estimated
at about 7 percent in March. Reflecting a pickup in required reserves
associated with the acceleration of transactions deposits, nonborrowed
and total reserves growth increased in February to 15-1/2 and 10 per-
cent rates, respectively. These measures are expected to be about flat
in March, however, as excess reserves continue to decline on a monthly
average basis and required reserves rise less rapidly. Growth of the
monetary base slowed to a 16-1/2 percent rate in February, owing to a
deceleration of currency growth, which nevertheless, at nearly 17 per-
cent, was still quite rapid. In March, the base is expected to increase
at about a 4 percent rate.

bank failures or depositor losses. Over the last two months, M2 has grown

considerably more rapidly than predicted by econometric models, making up

a small portion of the earlier shortfall. Nevertheless, given the slow

growth late last year and in January, expansion in the first quarter on a

quarterly average basis still is below model predictions, and M2 velocity

is likely to decline at only about a 1 percent annual rate.

(6) Whether the pickup in M2 also is associated with a greater

willingness to lend by depositories (or at least no further intensifica-

tion of restraint) is difficult to tell. Bank credit has strengthened in

February and early March, but the spread of the prime over market rates

has widened even further, and banks report that they have continued to

tighten credit standards for businesses. M3 growth also accelerated--to a

10-1/2 percent rate in February, and a 4-3/4 percent pace estimated for

March--bringing December-to-March growth to a 6-1/4 percent rate. How-

ever, the strength of M3, which also ran well above expectations,

reflected a number of influences unrelated to an expansion of credit

through depositories. For example, a substantial portion of the increase

in M3 over the first quarter was attributable to rapid growth of institu-

tion-only money market funds, which have been boosted by declines in money

market rates during the past few months. In addition, an unanticipated

rise in large time deposits over the past two months was due entirely to

issuance by branches and agencies of foreign banks, primarily to

substitute domestic CDs for federal funds and Eurodollar borrowings as a

result of the elimination of the reserve requirement on nontransaction



liabilities, which reduced the relative cost of domestic CDs.4  Large

time deposits at domestic banks and thrifts have continued to run off.

(7) Private credit growth appears to have strengthened, but only

a little from its very depressed pace in the months around year-end.

Overall business borrowing has been damped by a fall-off in equity retire-

ments as well as by weak fixed capital and inventory investment. Offer-

ings of corporate bonds have risen sharply, as treasurers apparently

believe that interest rates are unlikely to decrease further. But, in

part, this issuance was used to fund a paydown of short-term debt, as the

total of bank loans and commercial paper declined. Consumer loans at

banks rose in February on a monthly average basis, even after adjusting

for a changing volume of securitization across months, but leveled out

over the latter part of February and in early March. Issuance of tax-

exempt securities has increased. However, Treasury borrowing has been

reduced substantially, albeit temporarily, during the latter part of the

first quarter, reflecting contributions related to the war and the slow

pace of RTC resolutions. In total, domestic nonfinancial sector debt in

February grew 6-1/4 percent at an annual rate from its fourth-quarter

4. Regulation D for some time has exempted from reserve requirements
net Eurodollar borrowings equal to 8 percent of a branch's assets (after
certain adjustments). Thus, the reduction of nontransaction reserve
requirements to zero eliminated the value of this favorable treatment of
net Eurodollar borrowings and lowered the relative cost of domestic CDs.
More generally, foreign banks, who need not pay FDIC premiums on U.S.
deposits, have found that the lack of reserve requirements on CDs
reduces incentives to book dollar deposits at IBFs and non-U.S. offices.
These institutions also report that they now are funding greater volumes
of overseas assets by issuing deposits in the United States and lending
the proceeds to their foreign offices.

Policy Alternatives

(8) Three policy alternatives are presented below for Committee

consideration. Under alternative B, federal funds would continue to trade

around 6 percent and would be associated with adjustment plus seasonal

borrowing initially of $125 million. An increase to about $250 million

over the intermeeting period may be called for as seasonal borrowing

continues its normal climb. Under alternative A, the federal funds rate

would fall to 5-1/2 percent, effected either through a reduction in

borrowing to $75 million or a 50 basis point cut in the discount rate and

the same borrowing specification as in alternative B. As noted in recent

bluebooks, it is technically feasible for federal funds to trade below the

discount rate. However, the discount window becomes a marginally less

effective buffer to unpredictable changes in reserve supply or demand, and

the federal funds rate likely would be a little more volatile than if

alternative A were achieved through a discount rate cut. Moreover, allow-

ing the funds rate to fall below the discount rate is likely to give rise

to market uncertainty about System intentions; in particular, there would

be more speculation about whether a discount rate cut is forthcoming or

whether a penalty discount rate is being instituted. Under alternative C,

the federal funds rate would rise to 6-1/2 percent and the initial borrow-

ing level would be increased to $175 million.

(9) The structure of market interest rates does not now appear

to incorporate expectations of any further easing in monetary policy in

the weeks ahead; thus under alternative B, short-term interest rates are

unlikely to change substantially, though they may edge lower. Private

rates should slip off with the passing of quarter-end, and bills could



-10-

well benefit from steeper reductions in outstanding supplies after the

April tax date. The greenbook forecast implies some further unwinding of

the recent sharp rise in the dollar under the unchanged policy of alterna-

tive B. Still, with interest rate differentials now more favorable to

dollar assets, the dollar should remain well above its February lows.

Longer-term securities markets are likely to continue to be quite sensi-

tive to data about developments in the real economy over the intermeeting

period, as investors search for indications as to whether consumer and

business responses to the end of the war are helping to propel a turn-

around in the economy. Bond yields already seem to have built in some

rebound in the economy, judging by their levels relative to inflation

expectations and to short-term rates. Thus, they might not rise much, if

at all, even should incoming information confirm that the economy was

reaching a trough.

(10) Under alternative A, money market rates would likely

decrease by close to the full amount of the reduction in the federal funds

rate, and the prime rate would be lowered 1/2 percentage point, given its

already wide margin over funding costs. The dollar would decline promptly

and substantially. The drop in interest rates and the dollar could be

seen by market participants as adding further stimulus at a time when a

rebound in the economy already is expected. In such circumstances, bond

rates might not decline by much, and could even back up. A reversal of

any adverse reaction would occur, however, if incoming data began to con-

firm that the easing had correctly anticipated weaker money growth, more

favorable trends in prices, or a substantial further shortfall in

economic activity.



-11-

(11) The tightening of policy under alternative C would surprise

market participants, coming on the heels of recent easing measures, and

bill rates would rise by 1/2 percentage point. Private money market rates

could well rise by more and quality spreads retrace some of their recent

declines. In particular, a portion of the improvement since year-end in

the prices of securities of financial firms likely would be reversed by

the unexpected increase in short-term rates. Increases in bond yields

might be limited, however, by a sense that the Federal Reserve was taking

early action to check potential inflation pressures in the coming recov-

ery. In this environment, the dollar would be subject to further upward

pressure.

(12) The money growth paths projected under each alternative are

given in the table below and in the table and charts on the following

pages.

percent rate over the March-to-June period, in line with its December-to-

March growth, placing it a little above the midpoint of its 1991 range.

Expansion of money will continue to be boosted by previous declines in

market interest rates, but these effects will be less over the second

quarter than over the first.5  On the other hand, the projected pickup in

nominal spending will be working to buoy M2 growth over coming months. As

in recent months, most of the increase in M2 will occur in the form of

inflows to liquid retail balances, owing to their narrow opportunity

costs, as offering rates come down only a bit in response to recent

declines in market rates. Growth in small time deposits, by contrast,

should continue anemic, given the much larger adjustment of the rates on

these deposits to declines in market yields.

(14) On a quarterly average basis, M2 under alternative B would

expand at a 6 percent annual rate in the second quarter, a shade faster

than nominal GNP. Expansion at this rate would be a bit higher than pre-

dicted by the staff money demand models, implying a partial makeup of the

shortfall of recent quarters. The projection thus assumes a continuation

of the very recent experience, in which some of the unusual factors that

5. Growth rates for individual months are likely to be influenced by
tax payments this year. Reflecting weakness in income last year, non-
withheld tax payments due by April 15 could well fall short of those
embedded in the seasonal adjustment factors for monetary aggregates.
Thus, both the buildup of balances prior to that date and the decline in
balances after it may be smaller than usual; in these circumstances,
growth in M2 would be reduced in April but boosted in May. In addition,
June growth could speed up a little more as the economic recovery fore-
seen by the staff shows through to demands for money.
6. Under alternative B, M1 also is projected to grow at an annual rate

of 5-1/2 percent over the March-to-June period, as transaction deposits
complete their adjustments to interest rate changes, and as currency
demand abates with the end of war-related uncertainties. The level of
demand deposits may be boosted to some degree by greater mortgage
refinancing at the reduced levels of rates on fixed-rate mortgages of
recent months; prepayments of securitized mortgages generally are held
in demand deposits for some time before being passed through to security
holders. However, at current interest rates, the effects of this on M1
growth rates are expected to be quite small in coming months. Growth of
the monetary base is expected to slow to a 5-1/4 percent rate in the
second quarter.



-14-

had been damping money growth in earlier quarters seem less pronounced.

The recent recovery in confidence by depositors and investors in the bank-

ing system is not expected to be reversed, and against this backdrop,

constriction of credit supplies by banks should not intensify. While

opportunity costs will rise as offering rates continue to adjust, they are

not expected to become unusually wide in coming months.

(15) Growth in M3 would slow to a 3-1/2 percent rate over the

March-to-June period in the case of alternative B. To be sure, a modest

pickup in bank lending and in the associated needs for funds is antici-

pated as credit demands strengthen with spending; banks should be willing

to meet this demand in light of improved prospects for borrowers, enhanced

access to capital markets and the recent regulatory initiatives. However,

rate relationships are expected to be less favorable to money funds. In

addition, the unusual issuance of large time deposits by U.S. branches of

foreign banks related to the reserve requirement cut is assumed to slow in

the second quarter. RTC resolution activity will pick up over the quar-

ter, so that increasing quantities of thrift assets will end up financed

by Treasury securities instead of M3. Even with its slowing, M3 would

remain above the midpoint of its annual range by June. On a quarterly

average basis, M3 would grow at a 4-1/2 percent rate in the second quar-

ter, once again lagging growth in nominal income.

(16) Private debt growth should be a little stronger in the

second quarter than in the first as the economy recovers, though below the

growth in spending. Household borrowing will firm as consumer spending,

including spending on durables, resumes expanding and as housing activity

picks up further. Although access to credit by some households might be



-15-

curtailed, especially as delinquencies continue to rise, narrow spreads on

mortgages and asset-backed securities recently suggest that credit con-

straints on households are unlikely to be very important. By contrast,

the small business and commercial real estate sectors will continue to

face stringent credit conditions. For firms with access to securities

markets, however, limitations on credit should prove to be less of a

factor, as indicated by reduced quality spreads. Overall, corporate

borrowing is expected to edge higher, albeit largely reflecting a tran-

sitory pickup in share retirements. Stresses on state and local govern-

ments will result in some boost to their borrowing, mostly temporary

short-term borrowing to cover deficits. Federal debt growth will pick up

later in the quarter once RTC resolution activity revives. Growth in the

debt of all domestic nonfinancial sectors is expected to be merely 5 per-

cent from February to June, keeping this aggregate in the lower half of

its 1991 monitoring range.

(17) Under alternative A, M2 would strengthen to a 6-1/2 percent

rate over the March-to-June period. The pickup would be concentrated in

retail liquid accounts as their opportunity costs fell further. By June,

this aggregate would be well into the upper half of its annual range. M3

would expand at a 4 percent rate over this period, buoyed by larger

inflows to money funds and by some spillover of the strength in M2.

(18) The tighter money market conditions of alternative C would

slow M2 from the pace of December to March, holding this aggregate down to

the midpoint of its 1991 range by June. M3 growth over the three months

would moderate to a 3 percent rate, with some risk that expansion could be



-16-

even more damped if there were an appreciable adverse reaction in bank

capital and funding markets.
