MONETARY POLICY ALTERNATIVES

Recent Developments

(1) The degree of reserve pressure was left unchanged over

the intermeeting period, with the expected level of the federal funds

rate remaining at 3 percent. The firmness in the federal funds rate

seen during much of the previous intermeeting period carried into the

first week of the current period, partly as a result of unexpected

strength in required reserves, but subsequently the rate has averaged

close to 3 percent.1 Markets had built in a quarter-point decline

in the federal funds rate, and the absence of an expected easing of

monetary policy after the October FOMC meeting, concerns about fiscal

stimulus, and some signs of firmer economic activity and money and

credit demands boosted market interest rates during the intermeeting

period. Both short- and long-term yields rose 15 to 50 basis points.

The largest increases, however, were at intermediate maturities, with

Treasury yields climbing as much as 80 basis points. Apparently, the

prospects of fiscal stimulus next year and a stronger economy had their

greatest effects on expectations of credit demands and the paths of

short-term rates one to five years hence. Interest rates in the pri-

mary mortgage market also rose over the intermeeting period, but by

less than the rise in yields on Treasuries, partly owing to narrowing

spreads in the secondary mortgage market. Expectations of firmer

economic growth boosted stock prices; major indexes rose 2 to 4 percent

over the period.

1. In view of diminishing demands for seasonal credit, the al-
lowance for adjustment and seasonal borrowing was reduced in five
steps of $25 million each during the intermeeting period to its cur-
rent level of $75 million. Actual borrowing averaged close to its
allowance during the three maintenance periods completed since the
October 6 meeting.



(2) With U.S. interest rates rising and foreign rates fall-

ing, the dollar appreciated about 7-1/2 percent on a weighted average

basis over the intermeeting period. The dollar was particularly robust

against European currencies, while advancing only moderately against

the yen. Interest rate declines abroad were widespread amid signs of

greater economic weakness and expectations of, together with some

actual, easing in monetary policies. On balance over the period, Ger-

man short- and long-term rates fell by 5 basis points, but rate de-

clines elsewhere in Europe were more substantial, as central banks took

advantage of the unwinding of some of the EMS exchange rate pressures.

In Japan, short- and long-term interest rates dropped by 5 and 15 basis

points, respectively.

(3) Monetary growth continued to strengthen in October.

Growth rates of M1 and M2 picked up to 22-3/4 and 5-1/4 percent rates,

respectively, bringing M2 a little closer to, but still below, the

lower end of its annual range.2 The acceleration of M2 in October

owed to strength in liquid accounts, which likely were lifted in part

by the lagged effects of previous declines in market interest rates and

opportunity costs, as well as by two special factors: heavy mortgage

refinancing activity and the reclassification in late October of about

$5-1/4 billion of large time deposits as other checkable deposits, as

2. The strong growth of transactions deposits increased expansion
of required reserves to a 41 percent rate in October. With currency
growth slowing considerably in October, perhaps owing to diminishing
foreign demands, growth of the monetary base edged down to a still-
rapid 14-1/2 percent rate last month.



reserve-avoidance scheme was unwound. In addition to

liquid deposits, money market mutual funds were strong, rising for the

first time in five months; the increase in MMMFs may have stemmed from

concerns about actual and prospective capital losses on notes and

bonds. Anecdotal information suggests that bond mutual funds experi-

enced a sharp fall-off of investments in October. The robust growth of

liquid accounts was mirrored in a continued runoff of small time

deposits. M2 growth in October exceeded the pace thought consistent

with the FOMC's expectation of 2 percent for growth over the September-

to-December period. In addition to somewhat greater mortgage refinanc-

ing than expected and reduced attractiveness of capital market invest-

ments, the overage likely reflected a faster pace of spending than had

been projected previously.

(4) In contrast to the narrower aggregates, M3 slowed in

October; its growth last month, at a 3/4 percent pace, was a little

short of the expectations at the last Committee meeting, and left that

aggregate somewhat below its target range. Institution-only money

market fund shares plunged, reflecting shifting yield relationships

around quarter end. Large time deposits also declined sharply, led by

a drop in Yankee CDs around the end of the quarter and the reclassifi-

cation of deposits. Banks' needs for managed liabilities

decreased, as bank loan growth fell to a 1-1/2 percent rate last month

after a jump in September, and bank credit slackened to a 4 percent

rate.

3. The elevated pace of mortgage refinancings is estimated to have
boosted M2 growth in October by about $4 billion, and the reclassifi-
cation of deposits added another $1-1/2 billion on a
month-average basis, for a combined effect of 2 percentage points at
an annual rate.



(5) Growth of the debt of all nonfinancial sectors remained

just above the lower bound of its 4-1/2 to 8-1/2 percent range in

September. Only a few signs of a strengthening in nonfederal credit

flows have been glimpsed. Business loans expanded for the first time

in eleven months in September, but were about flat in October. Accord-

ing to this month's survey of senior loan officers, terms and standards

for business loans were largely unchanged in the past three months.

Gross issuance of corporate bonds remained brisk in October, but the

proceeds were directed mainly at refinancing debt, and activity has

tailed off in recent weeks in response to the backup in bond rates.

In the household sector, consumer credit expanded in September after

seven consecutive monthly declines; consumer loans at commercial banks,

after adjusting for securitizations, continued to rise at only a 2

percent pace in October. Mortgage refinancing activity remains rapid,

though net mortgage growth still appears to be moderate. Municipal

bond issuance also has been strong, but many of the issues have been

for refunding purposes and retirements have been heavy.

Long-Run Ranges

(6) This section presents the staff's projections for money

growth in coming years and alternative long-run ranges for 1993. It is

provided as background for Committee reconsideration of those ranges at

this meeting. This item was placed on the agenda prior to next February

in light of Committee intentions to revisit its decision on the pro-

visional 1993 ranges once additional information and analysis on the

behavior of M2 were available.

Projections for 1992, 1993, and 1994

(7) The table below contains staff projections for growth of

money and debt aggregates over 1992, 1993, and 1994 consistent with the

Greenbook outlook for the economy and interest rates.

Projected Money and Debt Growth
(Percent change)

1992 1993 1994

M2 2-1/4 2 2-1/2

M3 1/2 1/2 1

Debt 4-1/2 5-3/4 6-1/4

M1 14-1/2 7-1/2 6-1/2

Memo:
Nominal GDP 5 4-1/2 4-3/4

(8) Growth in the broad money aggregates is expected to remain

subdued in 1993. Nominal GDP is projected to increase at a relatively

slow pace, and a number of influences should be boosting the velocities

of M2 and M3 substantially again next year. Chief among these in-

fluences would be continued household and business balance sheet re-

structuring and channeling of credit flows away from depository in-

stitutions, although both influences are likely to diminish next year.



These processes are associated with widening opportunity costs, depress-

ing money demand relative to income. Prospective further declines in

offering rates on liquid deposits are key elements in this widening.

Depositories may be especially aggressive in reducing their offering

rates, partly as a consequence of higher deposit insurance premiums and

various provisions in last year's FDICIA legislation, which includes

constraints on brokered deposits and retail deposit offering rates and

incentives to bolster capital ratios. In addition, bank funding needs

are likely to be restrained again next year in light of still stringent

terms and conditions of credit availability and relatively modest in-

creases expected in demands for bank loans. Consumer loan rates may

move down, but a still wide spread over retail deposit rates will sus-

tain deleveraging incentives to a degree. Business credit demands at

banks, though firming, also probably will remain subdued, reflecting in

part continued reliance on bond issuance, given the projected decline in

long-term rates. Moreover, what pickup there might be in bank loans may

be funded in part by cutting back on securities purchases.

(9) Several additional forces will be restraining M2 and M3

growth next year and boosting their velocities. One is a pickup of RTC

and FDIC resolution activity, which may disrupt depositor relationships

and would involve Treasury funding of whatever assets are acquired,

replacing previous thrift and bank liabilities. In addition, the

special factors boosting M2 growth this year will hold down growth next

year relative to 1992: Mortgage refinancing, which surged to record

levels this quarter, is projected to level off in 1993, and the reclas-

sification of sweep accounts boosts only the level of M2

in 1993, and not its growth rate. Without special factors elevating

growth and with unchanged short-term rates after their decline this



year, M1 growth will slow especially sharply. At the same time, how-

ever, the projected decline in long-term rates will tend to boost the

nontransactions component of M2 at the expense of capital market invest-

ments, holding down the rise in velocities. Given the Greenbook outlook

for nominal GDP in 1993, M2 velocity again would rise around 2-1/2 per-

cent. 4 M3 is seen expanding at a 1/2 percent pace both this year and

next, stretching the string of significant velocity increases to a

seventh year.

(10) The debt of domestic nonfinancial sectors is expected to

accelerate from a 4-1/2 percent pace this year to a 5-3/4 percent rate

next year, owing primarily to a pickup in borrowing by nonfederal sec-

tors. The pace of private sector borrowing is expected to quicken

throughout 1993 as the economy grows and households and businesses be-

come increasingly willing to assume debt as balance sheet structures

improve. Financial institutions also should become more aggressive

lenders as their portfolios strengthen and prudent lending opportunities

increase. Business spending on inventories and fixed capital is pro-

jected to strengthen more than the flow of internal funds, spurring

borrowing. In addition, firms are expected to decrease equity issuance,

relying more on credit markets. Household borrowing, too, is likely to

strengthen some next year, even as balance sheet restructuring persists.

Paydowns of consumer credit this year should evolve into slow growth of

4. The staff projection for M2 growth in 1993 is broadly in line
with, though slightly lower than, simulations of the new econometric
models developed by Board staff. (See Joshua N. Feinman and Richard
D. Porter, "The Continuing Weakness in M2," Finance and Economics
Discussion Series No. 209, [September 1992]). The Greenbook judgmen-
tal projections for short- and long-term market rates were used to-
gether with separate equations for deposit and loan rates in obtaining
predictions from these models. The staff's slightly lower forecast
reflects the judgment that more weight should be placed on the unwind-
ing of this quarter's unusual factors and on potential FDICIA and RTC
effects in depressing future M2 growth than is embodied in the models.



consumer installment debt next year, while the more buoyant housing

activity foreseen in the Greenbook should translate into faster growth

of mortgage debt. Only the debt growth of the state and local govern-

ment sector is expected to abate next year because of retirements of

bonds refunded earlier.

Alternative Ranges for 1993

(11) Two alternatives for money and debt growth ranges are

shown below for 1993, along with the staff projections. The alternative

I ranges represent the current provisional ranges announced last July;

the lower ends of these ranges are above the staff forecasts for broad

money growth. Alternative II ranges are 1 percentage point lower for M2

and M3 and encompass the staff forecasts for these aggregates. The

current provisional debt range, which readily includes the staff

forecast, is left unchanged in alternative II.5

M3 1 to 5 0 to 4 1/2

Debt 4-1/2 to 8-1/2 4-1/2 to 8-1/2 5-3/4

(12) The lower ranges embodied in alternative II might be

chosen on the rationale that since July experience with substantial

further increases in velocities and additional analysis have reduced the

uncertainty regarding the strength of the forces acting to boost veloci-

ties in 1993. Given the forecasts of velocities, the lower ranges seem

compatible with the Greenbook forecast or somewhat faster growth of

nominal GDP. Even in the event money demand is stronger relative to

spending than the staff anticipates, growth of the broader aggregates is

still likely to fall well within the alternative II ranges under the

staff economic forecast. Alternative II additionally might be favored

on the thought that the probable growth of the broader aggregates below

the lower bounds of the alternative I ranges would make it more dif-

ficult to firm, or even maintain, the stance of policy if that proved

desirable as the economic expansion gains momentum. The lower ranges

are close to those consistent with reasonable price stability (assuming

no secular trend in V2), and thus would underscore the System's commit-

ment to this longer-run objective, even if reserve conditions needed to

be eased further.

(13) Leaving the ranges unchanged, perhaps deferring the

decision to February, could seem more attractive if recent research,

while better identifying the determinants of velocity, is also seen

as underscoring the complexity of predicting it. An alteration of the

tentative ranges now--an unusual time for such decisions--might connote

undue confidence in knowledge of prospective money behavior relative to

spending, possibly implying more emphasis on M2 as a policy guide than

the Committee is willing to give it. Or the Committee could put some

emphasis on M2 and still select alternative I if the Greenbook forecast

were viewed as involving unacceptably weak economic activity and

unnecessarily rapid disinflation. In these circumstances, more monetary

policy stimulus than in the staff forecast, indexed both by short-term

market rates and by money growth, could be seen as in order.

Accordingly, even if the projected relationship among money demand,

spending, and interest rates foreseen by the staff proves to be correct,



-11-

the lower portions of the current ranges still could be seen as

representing appropriate intermediate targets for M2 and M3 growth next

year, more so than the lower portions of the alternative II ranges. In

this case, retaining the current ranges would convey a preference for

faster monetary growth next year than the outcomes this year.



-12-

Short-Run Policy Alternatives

(14) Two alternatives are presented below for the Committee's

consideration. Under alternative B, the trading range for the federal

funds rate would remain centered at 3 percent, in conjunction with an

initial assumption for adjustment plus seasonal borrowing of $75 mil-

lion.6  The policy ease envisaged under alternative A would trim the

expected federal funds rate to 2-1/2 percent. In keeping with the usual

practice of holding the expected federal funds rate at or above the

discount rate, this change could be effected by lowering the discount

rate by 1/2 percentage point while retaining the borrowing assumption at

$75 million. Technically, though, the lower federal funds rate of

alternative A could be achieved by reducing the borrowing assumption

$25 million with an unchanged discount rate.

(15) Projected growth rates of the monetary aggregates under

the two policy alternatives are given in the table below. (More de-

tailed data appear in the tables and charts on the pages that follow.)

The lateness in the year limits the scope for the growth rates of the

monetary aggregates over the September-to-December period to differ much

under the two alternatives. The pickup in M2 already witnessed in Octo-

ber quite likely implies that growth in that aggregate from September to

December will be a bit above the Committee's expectation expressed in

the last directive. But with the recent expansion in liquid deposits

offset by a contraction in non-M2 components of M3, growth of M3 for the

September-to-December period remains consistent with the last directive.

Under either alternative, M2 and M3 fall shy of the lower bounds of

6. The already low borrowing assumption may have to be shaved
further in a technical adjustment during the intermeeting period,
since the typical winter downturn in seasonal borrowing probably has
not yet run its course.



-13-

their target ranges in December by about 1/4 and 1/2 percent, respec-

tively. Beyond December, money growth rates under the alternatives

diverge more, as the effects of the different interest rate paths--

including the beginnings of effects on nominal spending--increasingly

influence the public's demands for monetary assets. Even over a longer

horizon, however, such as the October-to-March period shown in the

table, it is likely the differences in short-term market interest rates

under the two alternatives would continue to have only a modest impact

on the growth of the broad monetary aggregates.

(16) The absence of System action over the current intermeet-

ing period and the flow of data releases pointing more clearly to sus-

tained expansion in economic activity have solidified the notion that

monetary policy will remain unchanged for some time. Thus, market par-

ticipants would be unlikely to react to the unchanged reserve conditions

of alternative B, especially if incoming data conform to the Greenbook

assessment of moderately expanding real activity in the fourth quarter.

Treasury bill rates would hold at their current levels, as would the

7. To attain the lower bounds of their target ranges by December,
M2 and M3 would need to grow at average rates of 4-1/4 and 4 percent,
respectively, in November and December.

exchange value of the dollar, unless a further darkening in the economic

outlook abroad prompted unexpected reductions in foreign interest rates.

Private money market rates, however, may rise should skittishness about

the availability of funds at year-end intensify. As the December 19

date for implementation of prompt corrective action approaches, pres-

sures on quality spreads in the banking sector might be exacerbated by

uncertainty about the circle of candidates subject to early closure. In

capital markets, yields could edge down on balance as the readings that

trickle in over the intermeeting period indicate a modest pace to the

economic expansion and imply further progress toward price stability.

At the same time, concerns about the prospects for fiscal stimulus and

uncertainties about the economic policies of the new administration more

generally, which may not be resolved for some time, will continue to

weigh upon market sentiment.

(17) Under alternative B, the growth of M2 is projected to

slow somewhat from its pace of the last two months. Special factors are

continuing to boost M2 growth in November but will partly reverse there-

after, pulling average growth over the five month forecast horizon back

to an underlying rate of about 2 percent. On a quarterly average

basis, the near-term pickup in M2 puts that aggregate on a growth tra-

jectory somewhat below that for nominal GDP in the fourth quarter but

8. Additions to demand deposits and MMDAs to support mortgage
refinancings account for about $4 billion of the increase in M2 from
October to December, but the anticipated contraction in mortgage
refinancing activity subtracts a like amount from the change in that
aggregate over the December-to-March period. The reclassification of

sweep accounts as other checkable rather than large time
deposits adds about $4 billion to M2 from October to December but has
no further effect. M1 growth is slowing, but the lagged effects of
previous reductions in short-term market interest rates still show
clearly in the projected near double-digit expansion of the narrow
aggregates. With currency and total reserves projected at 7-3/4 and 6
percent, respectively, over these five months, the monetary base would
increase at an 8 percent rate.



-16-

about 3 percentage points below it in the first quarter of 1993. This

upward tilt to M2 velocity over the two quarters reflects a continuation

of those forces that have been boosting velocity for some time--the

ongoing process of balance-sheet restructuring and deleveraging that

makes investors less willing to acquire monetary assets and depository

institutions less willing to compete aggressively for funds.

(18) The growth of M3 is projected at a 3/4 percent rate over.

the October-to-March period. With money market interest rates expected

to remain unchanged for the near term, or perhaps to increase should the

fear of year-end pressures take firmer hold, the prospects for M3-type

money funds remain subdued. Further, with the terms and standards of

lending expected to remain firm and with households and firms concen-

trating on longer-term borrowing, bank credit should grow at only a

modest pace, suggesting that depositories' need for additional funds

will remain limited.

(19) The projected slowdown in the growth of domestic non-

financial debt in the fourth quarter likely will be transitory, caused

by a temporary drop in federal borrowing. Nonfederal credit demand,

concentrated in large part in longer-term borrowing by households and

corporations, should edge above its third-quarter pace. A pickup in

activity by the FDIC after December 19, which will necessitate borrowing

from the federal government, should return the growth of the federal

debt to the neighborhood of 12 percent. Thus, the growth of total debt

should pick up appreciably in the first quarter of 1993, to around 5-1/2

percent, so that the debt aggregate moves somewhat above the lower bound

of its tentative monitoring range.

(20) Against a backdrop of public readings that suggested

some firming in economic activity, market participants would be sur-

prised by the 1/2 point decline in the funds rate under alternative A.



-17-

Most short-term interest rates would match the decrease in the federal

funds rate. Major commercial banks would take that cue, cutting the

prime rate 1/2 percentage point; even with a 5-1/2 percent prime rate,

banks still would enjoy a swollen margin over funding costs, at least in

comparison to the historical record. The foreign exchange value of the

dollar would decline. Long-term interest rates are likely to drop,

reversing much of the recent runup. Such a decline would be limited,

however, should the easing engender market fears that the lagged effects

of the monetary stimulus, reinforcing a boost provided by a prospective

fiscal policy package in 1993, would undercut the downward tilt to in-

flation.

(21) While the impetus to the monetary aggregates imparted by

choosing alternative A would be barely discernible in 1992, the lower

market interest rates embodied in that choice would push up both M2 and

M3 to the lower end of their current tentative ranges for 1993 by March.

The anticipated drop in nominal interest rates across the term structure

should speed balance-sheet adjustments, lowering debt service burdens

for households and corporations, and by reducing real rates as well,

provide some spur to spending.

Directive Language

(22) Draft language for the tentative ranges for 1993 and for

the operational paragraph is presented below.

Tentative Ranges for 1993

The following language is provided should the Committee decide

at this meeting to vote on the tentative ranges for 1993. Reaffirming

the current tentative ranges could be handled in the directive with

wording such as the following:

At this meeting the Committee voted to reaffirm the tentative

ranges for 1993 that it had set at the June 30-July 1 meeting; the

1993 ranges are the same as those for 1992 and cover the period

from the fourth quarter of 1992 to the fourth quarter of 1993.

The following wording for the directive is proposed if the

Committee chose to lower the ranges.

"In light of additional information suggesting significant

uptrends in the velocities of broad money measures, the Committee

voted at this meeting to lower the tentative ranges initially set

at the June 30-July 1 meeting to growth rates of ____ to ____ percent

for M2 and ____ to ____ percent for M3, measured from the fourth

quarter of 1992 to the fourth quarter of 1993. The Committee

retained the tentative monitoring range of 4-1/2 to 8-1/2 percent

for growth in total domestic nonfinancial debt in 1993.

Either sentence would be followed by the current sentence:

"The behavior of the monetary aggregates will continue to be

evaluated in the light of progress toward price level stability,

movements in their velocities, and developments in the economy and

financial markets."



-19-

Operational Paragraph

Draft language for the operational paragraph is presented

below. In keeping with the bluebook discussion, two alternatives,

labeled (a) and (b), are shown for the last sentence. The first would

follow the usual practice of retaining the current mid-quarter approach

of updating the Committee's expectations for the quarter. The second

would extend the money projections through March, 1993.

In the implementation of policy for the immediate future,

the Committee seeks to maintain/EASE SOMEWHAT/INCREASE SOMEWHAT

the existing degree of pressure on reserve positions. In the

context of the Committee's long-run objectives for price

stability and sustainable economic growth, and giving careful

consideration to economic, financial, and monetary developments,

slightly (SOMEWHAT) greater reserve restraint might (WOULD) or

slightly (SOMEWHAT) lesser reserve restraint (MIGHT) would be

acceptable in the intermeeting period.

(a) The contemplated reserve conditions are expected to be

consistent with growth of M2 and M3 over the period

from September through December at annual rates of

about ____ AND ____ {DEL: 2 and 1] percent, respectively.

(b) The contemplated reserve conditions are expected to be

consistent with growth of M2 and M3 over the period

from October through March at annual rates of about ____

AND ____ [DEL: 2 and 1] percent, respectively.

n.s.--not specified.
1. Targets are for bank credit until 1983; from 1983 onward targets are for domestic
nonfinancial sector debt.
2. At the February 1979 meeting the FOMC adopted a QIV'78 to QIV'79 range for M1 of 1-1/2
to 4-1/2 percent. This range anticipated that shifting to ATS and NOW accounts in New
York State would slow M1 growth by 3 percentage points. At the October meeting it was
noted that ATS/NOW shifts would reduce M1 by no more than 1-1/2 percentage points. Thus,
the longer-run range for M1 was modified to 3-6 percent.
3. The figures shown reflect target and actual growth of Ml-B in 1980 and shift-adjusted
M1-B in 1981. MI-B was relabeled M1 in January 1982. The targeted growth for M1-A was 3-
1/2 to 6 percent in 1980 (actual growth was 5.0 percent); in 1981 targeted growth for
shift-adjusted M1-A was 3 to 5-1/2 percent (actual growth was 1.3 percent).
4. When these ranges were set. shifts into other checkable deposits in 1980 were expected
to have only a limited effect on growth of Ml-A and M1-B. As the year progressed.
however, banks offered other checkable deposits more actively, and more funds than
expected were directed to these accounts. Such shifts are estimated to have decreased Ml-
A growth and increased MI-B growth each by at least 1/2 percentage point more than had
been anticipated.

5. Adjusted for the effects of shifts out of demand deposits and savings deposits into
other checkable deposits. At the February FOMC meeting, the target ranges for observed
M1-A and M1-B in 1981 on an unadjusted basis, expected to be consistent with the adjusted
ranges, were -4-1/2 to -2 and 6 to 8-1/2 percent, respectively. Actual M1-B growth (not
shift adjusted) was 5.0 percent.
6. Adjusted for shifts of assets from domestic banking offices to International Banking
Facilities.
7. Range for bank credit is annualized growth from the December 1981-January 1982 average
level through the fourth quarter of 1982.
8. Base period, adopted at the July 1983 FOMC meeting, is QII'83. At the February 1983
meeting the FOMC had adopted a QIV'82 to QIV'83 target range for M1 of 4 to 8 percent.
9. Base period is the February-March 1983 average.
10. Base period, adopted at the July 1985 FOMC meeting, is QII'85. At the February 1985
meeting the FOMC had adopted a QIV'84 to QIV'85 target range for M1 of 4 to 7 percent.
11. No range for M1 has been specified since the February 1987 FOMC meeting because of
uncertainties about its underlying relationship to the behavior of the economy and its
sensitivity to economic and financial circumstances.
12. At the February 1990 meeting the FOMC specified a range of 2-1/2 to 6-1/2 percent.
This range was lowered to 1 to 5 percent at the July 1990 meeting.
13. Growth rates in parentheses for the monetary aggregates are from 1991 QIV to
October 1992 and for nonfinancial debt are from 1991 QIV to September 1992.
