Prefatory Note 
 
 
The attached document represents the most complete and accurate version available 
based on original copies culled from the files of the FOMC Secretariat at the Board 
of Governors of the Federal Reserve System.  This electronic document was created 
through a comprehensive digitization process which included identifying the best-
preserved paper copies, scanning those copies,1 and then making the scanned 
versions text-searchable.2   Though a stringent quality assurance process was 
employed, some imperfections may remain. 
 
Please note that some material may have been redacted from this document if that

1  In some cases, original copies needed to be photocopied before being scanned into electronic 
format.  All scanned images were deskewed (to remove the effects of printer- and scanner-introduced 
tilting) and lightly cleaned (to remove dark spots caused by staple holes, hole punches, and other 
blemishes caused after initial printing). 
 
2 A two-step process was used.  An advanced optical character recognition computer program (OCR) 
first created electronic text from the document image.  Where the OCR results were inconclusive, 
staff checked and corrected the text as necessary.  Please note that the numbers and text in charts and

MONEY MARKET CONDITIONS

Recent Developments

(1) M1 increased at an annual rate of about 2 per cent in

December,and incoming data for early January suggest that its growth

over the December-January target period will fall substantially below the

lower end of the range of tolerance established by the FOMC at its

December meeting. M2 expanded at only a 2 per cent annual rate in

December, as inflows into bank time deposits other than money market CD's

also slowed markedly. While such time deposit inflows appear to be

improving in January, M2 expansion for the December-January target period

also is expected to be well below the lower end of its tolerance range.

The bank credit proxy expanded at a 7 per cent annual rate in December,

as banks issued CD's aggressively, partly for window-dressing purposes.

Since the turn of the year, banks have been much less active in the CD

market.

(2) Following the December FOMC meeting, the Account Manager

began aiming at a Federal funds rate of about 8¼ per cent. Despite

large increases in nonborrowed reserves, the Federal funds market showed

little tendency to ease, however, as member banks managed their reserve

positions conservatively over the holiday and year-end statement date

period. The relative abundance of reserves finally showed through in

the money market on the final day of the year, so that the average funds

rate for the statement week ending January 1 dropped to 7.35 per cent.

In the following statement week, the Desk reduced its Federal funds rate

target to about 7½ per cent, the lower limit of the Committee's tolerance

range, in response to evidence of weakness in the aggregates. On

January 9, with growth in the aggregates apparently well below the

lower limits set by the FOMC, the Committee concurred in the Chairman's

recommendation to reduce the lower limit of the funds rate range to

7-1/8 per cent. In the statement week ended this past Wednesday, the

funds rate averaged 7.22 per cent, and the funds rate has drifted down

further in recent days.

(3) Interest rates on private short-term market instruments

have generally declined 1 to 2 percentage points since the December

meeting due to a combination of System policy actions and weaker private

credit demands. The 3-month Treasury bill rate declined around per-

centage point to about 6.30 per cent. On January 3, the discount rate

was reduced by ½ point to 7¼ per cent by six Federal Reserve Banks.

Because of the exceptionally heavy current and prospective corporate

bond calendar as well as the prospect of large Treasury financings,



-3-

yields in bond markets have not responded to the sharp decline in

short-term rates, although the large volume of new corporate issues

has been readily handled by the market.

(4) Deposit inflows strengthened significantly further at

nonbank thrift institutions in December. With mortgage demands remaining

weak, these funds were used mainly to repay debt and build portfolio

liquidity. Some institutions were also reported to have stepped up

their acquisition of mortgages from mortgage companies and to have

increased their purchases of GNMA guaranteed mortgage-backed securities.

Mortgage rates have declined somewhat further in recent weeks.

(5) The table on the following page shows (in percentage

annual rates of change) selected monetary and financial flows over

various recent time periods. Appendix table IV compares money supply

growth rates computed on a quarterly-average basis with those computed

on a last-month-of-quarter basis. Projected figures on the two bases

are shown in appendix table V for the three alternatives presented in

the next section.

of time varying from 6 months to a year, with all periods ending in mid-1975.

These longer-run growth rates assume the staff GNP projection and further

assume that the funds rate reaches levels at about the mid-point of the

ranges shown over the next several weeks. For alternative A, however, it

should be noted that the lower interest rates are not assumed to persist

throughout the whole first half of the year, as will be explained below.

(8) Alternative A encompasses the 6 per cent longer-run annual

rate of growth for M1 (over the seven-month November '74-June '75 period)

that was preferred by the Committee at its last meeting, the achievement

of which would now require a 6¾ per cent growth rate over the first half

of this year. Under this alternative the funds rate would be expected to

decline to 6 per cent, or a shade below, between now and mid-February.

Growth in M1 by February would be expected to be considerably higher than

in recent months, partly in lagged reaction to earlier interest rate

declines, and partly because the behavior of money appears to have been

unusually weak recently relative to nominal GNP. Given the very low growth

that seems in store for January, however, the M1 growth rate would be

expected to be in a 4-6 per cent range for the two-month January-February

period.

(9) Interest rate declines under alternative A may begin to be

reversed as spring progresses. The rate of growth in M1 by the second

quarter is expected to be relatively rapid as the impact of monetary

ease cumulates, and growth would tend to accelerate further in the third

quarter, given the substantial jump in the rate of increase in nominal

GNP forecast by the staff, partly because a greater fiscal stimulus is

now assumed, as explained in the green book. Assuming the Committee were to wish

to hold monetary growth to around a 6-7 per cent annual rate in



-7-

the second half of the year, this would appear to require an upward

adjustment of the funds rate, as well as other short-term market

interest rates, at a fairly early stage.

(10) The specifications of alternative B contemplate a smaller

decline in the Federal funds rate over the next few weeks than under

alternative A. The mid-point of the suggested range is around 6¾ per

cent. Money supply growth over the first half of 1975 would be

expected to be at about a 6 per cent annual rate, and would be at about

a 5½ per cent annual rate of growth over the Nov. '74--June '75 period.

Because alternative B puts in place a lesser degree of monetary stimula-

tion over the near-term, it would appear that any reversal of the interest

rate decline would be delayed more than under alternative A. In order to

prevent an acceleration of monetary growth in the second half of 1975, the

funds rate under this alternative would probably not need to rise until

perhaps early summer. However, market interest rates more generally could

begin rising in spring in anticipation of continued exceptionally large

Treasury cash needs in the second half of the year combined with a pick-up

of total private credit demands (assuming that an economic recovery in

the second half is still anticipated at that time).

(11) Alternative C assumes money market conditions as indexed

by a Federal funds rate centering around 7¼ per cent. M1 growth in

the January-February period under this alternative would be expected to

be in a 3-5 per cent annual rate range. A pick-up in M1 growth would

still be anticipated in February, but the rate of expansion would be

less than under the two other alternatives. Similarly, over the



-8-

longer-run, growth rates for money supply would be slower; for example,

over the first half of 1975 M1 growth might be at around a 5¼ per cent

annual rate.

(12) Given prevailing market expectations of a further easing

in monetary policy, a Federal funds rate of around 7¼ per cent is likely

to be accompanied by some back-up in market interest rates in the near-

term, particularly rates on Treasury securities and corporate bonds.

Over the next few weeks, the Treasury will likely be raising new cash by

adding $200-$300 million to the weekly bill auctions; in addition

$1 -$2 billion of new cash will probably be raised in connection with

the refunding of $3 billion of publicly-held debt that matures in

mid-February. Terms of this refunding will be announced on January 22

or 23. The Treasury will also be raising large amounts of new cash in

March and April. Given the prospective volume of Treasury issues to be

distributed through the market, dealers may be reluctant to add

significantly further to holdings unless they can foresee some drop in

their financing costs. On the other hand--aside from a very heavy

volume of corporate bond issues--credit demands in other sectors of the

market are likely to be quite modest in the weeks ahead. Demands may

be particularly light in private short-term markets so that interest rate

pressures, should they develop, are more likely to appear in longer-term

market sectors.

(13) The net inflow at banks of time and savings deposits

(other than money market CD's) is expected to continue at about the

pace of the fourth quarter of 1974 under alternative C. Greater



-9-

inflows of consumer-type time and savings deposits are assumed under

alternatives A and B in the months immediately ahead, but under

alternative A the rate of inflow is assumed to drop back somewhat in

the spring as interest rates begin to rise. Under all three alternatives,

the staff has assumed that savings inflows will be sustained in late

spring or early summer by initial payments of the proposed income tax

rebate--which would also tend temporarily to enlarge demand deposits.

Implied rates of growth for M2 under the three alternatives are shown in

the bottom panel of the summary table in paragraph (6).

(14) Similar assumptions to those for consumer-type time

deposits at banks were made for deposit flows at thrift institutions.

Given the apparently weak mortgage demand, downward pressures on mortgage

interest rates might be expected in the months ahead under all three

alternatives, with declines in mortgage rates the largest, of course,

under alternative A. Under the easing alternatives, conditions leading

to a reversal of such rate declines would tend to develop as time passes,

though perhaps not until after mid-year.

(15) Bank credit expansion will probably be generally moderate

over the months ahead under any of the alternatives. This is mainly

because business and consumer credit demands on banks are expected to be

quite sluggish, as businesses reduce inventories and consumers continue

to hold off on purchases of durable goods. In addition, given their need

to improve liquidity positions, uncertainties as to the quality of their

loan portfolio, and their weak capital positions, banks are unlikely to be



-10-

aggressive issuers of CD's over the months ahead. Money center banks

in particular may be cautious in adding to their security portfolios and

relaxing lending terms. Nevertheless, the banking system as a whole may

make sizable investments in short-term U.S. and state and local government

securities, utilizing available funds from consumer-type time and savings

deposits and demand deposits.



-11-

Proposed directive

(16) Presented below are three alternative formulations for

the operational paragraph of the directive, which are intended to

correspond to the similarly lettered policy alternatives discussed in

the preceding section. For all three alternatives, it is proposed to

include a reference to Treasury financing because the regular mid-February

financing will be announced shortly.

Alternative A

To implement this policy, while taking account of

THE FORTHCOMING TREASURY FINANCING AND OF developments in

domestic and international financial markets, the Committee

seeks to achieve bank reserve and money market conditions

consistent with [DEL: somewhat] more rapid growth in monetary

aggregates over the months ahead than has occurred in

recent months.

Alternative B

To implement this policy, while taking account of

THE FORTHCOMING TREASURY FINANCING AND OF developments in

domestic and international financial markets, the Committee

seeks to achieve bank reserve and money market conditions

consistent with somewhat more rapid growth in monetary

aggregates over the months ahead than has occurred in recent

months.



-12-

Alternative C

To implement this policy, while taking account of

THE FORTHCOMING TREASURY FINANCING AND OF developments in

domestic and international financial markets, the Committee

seeks to achieve bank reserve and money market conditions

consistent with [DEL: somewhat more rapid] MODERATE growth in monetary

aggregates over the months ahead [DEL: than has occurred in recent

months].

** Monthly averages for excess reserves and borrowings are weighted averages of statement week figures.

Government security dealer trading positions are on a commitment basis. Trading positions, which exclude Treasury bills financed by repurchase agree-
ments maturing in 16 days or more, are indicators of dealer holdings available for sale over the near-term. Other security dealer positions are debt
issues still in syndicate, excluding trading positions. The basic reserve deficit is excess reserves less borrowing at Federal Reserve less net Federal
funds purchases. Weekly data are daily averages for statement weeks, except for corporate and municipal issues in syndicate which are Friday figures.
