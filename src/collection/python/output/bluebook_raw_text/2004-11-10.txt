Class I – FOMC 

MONETARY POLICY ALTERNATIVES 

Recent Developments 

(1) The FOMC’s decision at its September meeting to increase the target 

federal funds rate 25 basis points to 1¾ percent, to assess the risks to sustainable 

economic growth and price stability as balanced, and to retain the “measured pace” 

language was widely expected and elicited only a muted reaction in financial markets.1  

Despite mixed economic reports subsequently, the near-term expected path of 

monetary policy moved higher (Chart 1).  Market participants apparently inferred an 

increased likelihood of continued policy firming from both the minutes of the August 

FOMC meeting, which noted the need for “significant cumulative policy tightening,” 

and comments by the Chairman and other Federal Reserve officials, which were read 

as downplaying the economic drag from elevated oil prices.  Futures market quotes 

indicate that investors now place sizable odds on a quarter-point tightening at this 

meeting, but expect a pause sometime soon.  The Desk’s survey of primary dealers 

reveals that they uniformly expect firming at this meeting, most anticipate retention of 

the measured pace language, and some see a modification of the statement to signal a 

possible pause in the process of firming.  Futures quotes suggest that investors expect 

the funds rate to rise to about 2¾ percent by the end of 2005. 

(2) The shift in near-term policy expectations contributed to a flattening of the 

term structure of interest rates, with the yield on the two-year Treasury note rising 

                                           
1 The effective federal funds rate averaged 1.76 percent over the intermeeting period.  The 
Desk expanded the System’s outright holdings of securities by about $11.0 billion, with 
purchases of $0.6 billion of Treasury bills from foreign official customers and $3.2 billion of 
Treasury bills and $7.2 billion of Treasury coupon securities from the market.  The volume 
of outstanding long-term RPs decreased $7.0 billion, to $15.0 billion.

20 basis points while the yield on the ten-year note was about unchanged.2  Increasing 

oil prices seemed to heighten concerns about the near-term prospects for inflation 

and, at least at times, for output growth; both stock prices and bond yields often 

moved closely and inversely with oil prices from day to day.  Treasury inflation-

indexed yields fell substantially, leaving inflation compensation over the next five 

years 35 basis points higher and at the upper end of its range over the past few years.  

Five-year inflation compensation five years ahead, however, edged down, and survey 

measures of long-term inflation expectations remained well contained. 

(3) Yields on investment-grade corporate bonds moved roughly in line with 

those on nominal Treasury securities of comparable maturity, keeping risk spreads on 

these securities about unchanged (Chart 2).3  In contrast, spreads on speculative-grade 

debt narrowed 45 basis points.  Third-quarter corporate earnings reports ran slightly 

ahead of expectations, but the rise in energy prices and news of investigations of 

insurance industry practices weighed on equity prices.  In recent days, equity markets 

rallied as the presidential election reached a decisive conclusion, and broad share price 

indexes ended the period up 3½ to 4 percent on net. 

(4) The exchange value of the dollar fell almost 5 percent on balance against a 

basket of other major currencies over the intermeeting period, amid heightened 

concerns about financing the deepening U.S. current account deficit (Chart 3).  At 

times, market participants pointed to statements of Federal Reserve officials about 

international financial developments as a factor contributing to such worries.  The 

                                           
2 Under the expectations approach to the term structure, a long-term yield represents a 
weighted average of the current and expected future short-term rates over the life of the 
instrument plus, potentially, a term premium.  During periods when policy is expected to 
tighten, the average of expected future short rates will tend to rise over time.  The result can 
be a sizable expected increase in yields on short- and intermediate-term securities.  About 
half of the rise in the two-year yield over this intermeeting period can be attributed solely to 
this effect. 
3 Judging from spreads on ninety-day commercial paper, year-end pressures in money 
markets seem to be rather subdued this year.

dollar dropped most steeply against the Canadian dollar—about 6½ percent.  With 

signs of further strengthening of Canadian domestic demand and concerns building 

about inflation pressures, the Bank of Canada raised its official rate 25 basis points on 

October 19.  Canada’s position as a net exporter of oil also seemed to provide support 

to its currency.  The dollar declined 4¾ percent vis-à-vis the euro, moving close to a 

record low, and depreciated 3½ percent against the yen.  Japanese authorities referred 

publicly to taking action in the event that the yen continues to appreciate, but no 

intervention occurred during the intermeeting period.4  Yields on long-term 

government bonds edged up in Japan but fell about 10 to 20 basis points in Europe 

and Canada over the intermeeting period.  Share prices in Japan dropped slightly, but 

those in most other major industrial countries moved up about 2 to 3 percent on 

balance.  The dollar depreciated slightly against currencies of our other important 

trading partners.  In late October, the People’s Bank of China surprised markets by 

increasing a benchmark one-year lending rate 27 basis points.  The move raised 

uncertainties about the future pace of China’s economic expansion and prompted 

speculation about possible changes in China’s fixed-exchange-rate regime.  

(5) Domestic nonfinancial debt grew at a robust annual rate of about 7 percent 

in the third quarter.  In the nonfinancial business sector, debt growth stepped up to 

5¼ percent last quarter.  Available data point to even faster growth in October, owing 

in part to the financing of a large merger transaction in the bond and commercial 

paper markets (Chart 4).  Business loans at commercial banks continued to advance 

last month, and results from the October Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey 

indicate that banks have continued to ease standards and terms on these loans.  

Household debt appears to have decelerated a little in the third quarter as mortgage 

borrowing, although remaining quite brisk, slowed somewhat while consumer debt

continued to expand at a moderate pace.  After surging in the first half, federal sector 

debt advanced moderately in the third quarter.  In October, the Treasury reached the 

statutory debt limit and began using extraordinary accounting devices to continue 

funding government activity (see box). 

(6) M2 grew at a moderate pace in September but slowed in October.  Money 

growth was likely damped by a further rise in the opportunity cost of holding M2 

assets, as yields paid on deposits have lagged the increases in open market rates that 

accompanied monetary policy tightening.  Thus far, the increase in the opportunity 

cost of holding M2 about matches the experience of recent policy tightening periods.  

M2 velocity edged higher in the third quarter, roughly in line with historical 

relationships among money, nominal income, and opportunity costs.   

 



 5

Treasury Debt Subject to Limit 

On October 14, 2004, the Treasury reached its statutory debt limit of $7,384 billion.  As 
in previous debt limit episodes, the Treasury resorted to a set of extraordinary accounting 
devices to avoid violating the statute, denoted by the shaded area in the chart below.  So far, 
the Treasury has begun to underinvest the Government Securities Investment Fund (the so-
called G-fund), part of the federal employees’ thrift savings plan.  In the past, the Treasury 
also increased debt issued by the Federal Financing Bank—debt which is not subject to the 
limit—to extinguish other Treasury debt and tapped both the Exchange Stabilization Fund 
and the Civil Service Retirement and Disability Fund.  While the total room for borrowing 
made available by these accounting devices will depend on the Secretary’s declaration of the 
likely duration of the debt limit emergency period, staff estimates suggest that the Treasury 
will be able to maintain normal cash and debt management practices at least through late 
November; however, on November 3, the Treasury announced that it may need to postpone 
the November 18 settlement of the four-week bill if the limit has not been raised.  The 
Congress is scheduled to reconvene the week of November 15 in order to pass 
appropriations legislation for the fiscal year, and Congressional leadership has signaled an 
intention to raise the debt limit then.  In order to make its debt issuance more predictable, 
the Treasury suspended issuance of SLGS—securities purchased by municipal governments 
to comply with rules surrounding advance refunding.  To date, there has been no evidence 
that concerns about the debt limit have affected financial markets.

Policy Alternatives 

(7) The staff has marked down its outlook for economic activity through the 

first quarter of next year, but the broad outline of the forecast through 2006 is 

otherwise similar to that prepared for the September FOMC meeting.  The staff 

forecast assumes that the Committee will raise the target federal funds rate to  

2 percent before year-end, hold it steady at that level for much of the next year, and 

tighten in late 2005 and into 2006.  This trajectory for the federal funds rate runs well 

below the path embedded in market yields.  In the Greenbook projection, the outlook 

of investors is assumed to align gradually with that of the staff, and the resultant 

downward revisions to policy expectations lead to a modest decline in long-term 

yields.  The projected path for stock prices is almost identical to that of the last round 

and, as in prior Greenbooks, provides investors a risk-adjusted return comparable to 

that on fixed-income securities.  The staff continues to assume about a 2 percent rate 

of depreciation in the foreign exchange value of the dollar, albeit from its current 

lower level.  Against this financial backdrop, real GDP growth averages about 

3¼ percent this quarter and next, in line with the growth rate of potential output, and 

about 4 percent thereafter.  Accordingly, resource slack is gradually taken up after the 

first quarter of next year, bringing the unemployment rate close to the staff’s 

estimated NAIRU of 5 percent by the end of the forecast period.  Although 

diminishing, resource slack should continue to put downward pressure on core 

consumer price inflation.  But these pressures are expected to be offset by a slowing 

in the pace of structural productivity growth and, for a time, by the delayed effects of 

past increases in the prices of oil and core imports.  Core PCE inflation is forecast at 

about 1½ percent in 2005 and 2006.   

(8) Table 1 presents three alternatives for near-term policy, together with draft 

language for the Committee’s announcement.  The rationale paragraph has been 

updated to reflect recent readings on the economy as well as the passage of time,

which makes mention of developments earlier this year less relevant.  The description 

of the labor market will depend importantly on the employment report released 

tomorrow, but, as a placeholder, the entry in the table describes conditions as having 

improved modestly.  If economic circumstances diverge significantly from this 

characterization, staff will circulate alternative language in advance of Wednesday’s 

meeting.  Under Alternative A, the federal funds rate target would be maintained at 

1¾ percent at this meeting.  Alternative B would raise the target 25 basis points to 

2 percent, but the language of the announcement would signal that the Committee 

might now be more inclined to pause in the process of removing policy 

accommodation.  Under Alternative C, the funds rate would also be raised to 

2 percent, but the language of the announcement would be consistent with a firming 

of policy at least as rapid as currently embodied in market expectations.  Under all 

three alternatives, it seems likely that the Committee would view the risks to growth 

and price stability as about balanced after the policy announcement. 

(9) The current degree of stimulus provided by financial market prices 

embodies the expectation of tightening at this meeting followed by a brief pause.  If 

the Committee regarded the outlook for economic activity and inflation given these 

financial conditions as striking an appropriate balance between reducing slack and 

limiting inflation risks, it might wish to validate those expectations by tightening 

25 basis points and issuing a statement similar to that of Alternative B in the table, 

which includes language intended to signal a possible pause in the removal of policy 

accommodation.  The Committee might view a further quarter-point tightening at this 

meeting as an appropriate step in the direction suggested by standard policy 

benchmarks:  Such a tightening would be consonant with the prescriptions from a 

battery of interest rate rules (Chart 5) and would boost the real federal funds rate 

nearer to the middle of the range of various measures of the equilibrium real interest 

rate (Chart 6).  The Committee’s desire to align the stance of policy more closely with

Note: Rule prescriptions for 2004Q4 through 2005Q3 are calculated using Greenbook projections for inflation and the
output gap (or unemployment gap).  For rules that contain the lagged funds rate, the rule’s previous prescription for
the funds rate is used to compute prescriptions for 2005Q1 through 2005Q3.  It is assumed that there is no feedback
from the rule prescriptions to the Greenbook projections through 2005Q3.

such benchmarks might be heightened by the perceived need to be vigilant in 

response to the decline in the foreign exchange value of the dollar and the jump in 

some short-term measures of inflation compensation.  Looking forward, though, the 

Committee might regard a pause following this firming action as potentially prudent 

given the uncertainties attending the macroeconomic outlook.  Such a pause would 

allow the Committee time to assess the underlying strength of aggregate demand and, 

given relatively anchored longer-term inflation expectations, might be viewed as 

imposing little cost. 

(10) Regarding the announcement of Alternative B, the Committee might signal 

the possibility of a pause by noting that the firming brings “the cumulative increase  

in the target rate over the past several months to 1 percentage point.”  A mention of the 

cumulative policy tightening would convey the sense that the Committee was 

reflecting upon the extent to which accommodation had been removed.  Citing 

cumulative changes is a device last employed in the FOMC statements of June and 

August 2001.  The sense that the Committee was inclined to pause for a time might 

be reinforced by characterizing the stance of policy as remaining “somewhat 

accommodative,” rather than “accommodative” as in the September announcement, and 

would seem to parallel the Committee’s decision in January 2002 when it first 

characterized policy as accommodative when the funds rate was at 1-3/4 percent. 

(11) The market reaction to the announcement for Alternative B is difficult to 

gauge precisely.  Futures quotes indicate that market prices have largely, but not 

completely, built in a quarter-point tightening at Wednesday’s meeting, suggesting that 

such an action would probably impart a bit of upward pressure to near-term yields.  In 

addition, options data indicate that investors attach some probability to scenarios in 

which the funds rate remains at 2 percent for a few meetings.  Nonetheless, the signal 

of a possible pause might cause investors to mark down the odds they currently seem 



 10

to attach to tightening over the next several months.  In such circumstances, longer-

term yields could edge lower and stock prices might tick up. 

(12) Against the backdrop of higher oil prices and a weaker dollar, the 

Committee might believe that inflation pressures under the Greenbook policy 

assumption are unlikely to be as well-contained as in the staff forecast.  Indeed, both 

market- and survey-based measures of near-term inflation expectations moved higher 

over the intermeeting period.  Faced with these developments, the Committee might 

wish to tighten policy a quarter-point and adopt the firmer statement language shown 

for Alternative C.  Even if the Committee found the staff forecast of a gradual 

decline in inflation to be both likely and generally acceptable as a modal assessment, it 

might be concerned about upside risks to the outlook.  In particular, as discussed in 

the “more inflation” scenario in the Greenbook, inflation could pick up markedly if 

the rise in oil prices were to trigger a significant increase in long-term inflation 

expectations.  Moreover, the Committee might harbor some concerns that inflation 

pressures could build if—as envisioned in the “slower productivity” Greenbook 

simulation—the favorable productivity growth trends witnessed in recent years fade 

over time.  In such circumstances, policy might need to be tightened relatively briskly 

at coming meetings, perhaps inclining the Committee to be reluctant to hint now that 

it might pause in the process of firming. 

(13) The announcement of Alternative C could cite the increase in the target rate 

to 2 percent with no intimation of a pause any time soon.  The stance of policy might 

still be characterized simply as “accommodative” and the rationale paragraph might note 

that “rising energy prices and an escalation of business costs have the potential to contribute to 

upward pressure on prices” so as to highlight concerns about inflation.  The Committee 

could retain the measured pace language and might also continue to assess the risks to 

growth and price stability as balanced, particularly if it viewed that assessment as 

conditioned on an assumption of appropriate policy.   



 11

(14) Such an announcement would probably be read as suggesting that the 

FOMC is placing somewhat greater weight on inflation risks than the market currently 

perceives.  It seems likely then that both real and nominal interest rates would edge 

higher, and stock prices would fall.  The market reaction might be more muted if the 

references to mounting inflation pressures were not as explicit.  That said, it is also 

possible that, without the hint of a pause, investors would be more likely to build in 

expectations of tightening at each of the next several meetings given the experience of 

four consecutive firmings.  In that event, the rise in interest rates and the drop in 

stock prices could be more substantial. 

(15) Given the disappointing data on employment and industrial production in 

recent months, along with the mixed signals from other economic indicators, the 

Committee’s assessment of the near-term prospects for spending and employment 

might be less optimistic than in the staff forecast.  In particular, members might read 

the meager pace of hiring since the spring and weak high-tech spending as evidence of 

continued reluctance on the part of firms to make significant commitments in the 

current environment.  The still-weak tone in labor markets also might be viewed as a 

factor depressing consumer confidence and so weighing on household spending.  In 

that circumstance, the Committee might see less need to continue removing policy 

accommodation at this meeting and choose to keep the funds rate at 1¾ percent and 

issue a statement like that shown in Alternative A.  Even if the Committee judged the 

staff forecast as likely, it might consider the projected progress in working down slack 

as too slow to be acceptable, especially given that core PCE inflation runs at 

1½ percent—only a shade above the level prevailing in the summer of 2003 when 

concerns about disinflation were acute.  The Committee might also be concerned 

about possible downside risks to the forecast from high oil prices and the potential 

for a deceleration in consumer spending similar to that in the “faltering expansion” 

scenario in the Greenbook.  



 12

(16) The announcement of Alternative A would indicate an unchanged target 

federal funds rate but otherwise might look fairly similar to the announcement for the 

September meeting.  The statement might characterize policy as “somewhat” 

accommodative while the final sentence would underscore the Committee’s 

commitment to both its price stability and sustainable growth objectives.  Given the 

actual pause in policy adjustment, the “cumulative increase” wording employed in 

Alternative B would not seem necessary.  Such an announcement would come as a 

surprise to market participants.  Both real and nominal yields would likely decline and 

stock prices could increase.  However, if investors interpreted the announcement as 

portending weaker-than-expected economic activity, the rise in stock prices might be 

muted while the drop in yields could be more pronounced. 

Money and Debt Forecasts 

(17) Growth of M2 from the fourth quarter of last year to the fourth quarter of 

this year is currently projected at about 5 percent.  Under the staff forecast, M2 

growth steps down to about 2½ percent next year, owing largely to the lagged effects 

of the policy tightening undertaken in recent months on opportunity costs.  Stronger 

nominal income growth in 2006 contributes to a projected acceleration in M2 to a 

3½ percent pace that year.  Domestic nonfinancial debt is expected to decelerate over 

the forecast period, primarily reflecting a decline in household debt growth as slowing 

home price appreciation trims the pace of mortgage borrowing.  Growth of the debt 

of nonfinancial businesses is anticipated to pick up over the forecast period as capital 

spending begins to outstrip internal funds by a wider margin.  Stronger income 

growth is projected to bolster federal tax revenues and reduce federal deficits, but 

federal debt is projected to advance at a pace exceeding that of nominal GDP.

Directive and Balance-of-Risks Statement 

(18) Draft language for the directive and draft risk assessments identical to those 

presented in Table 1 are provided below. 

(1) Directive Wording 
The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and financial 

conditions that will foster price stability and promote sustainable growth 

in output.  To further its long-run objectives, the Committee in the 

immediate future seeks conditions in reserve markets consistent with 

MAINTAINING/increasing/REDUCING the federal funds rate 

AT/to an average of around _______ 1¾. 

(2) Risk Assessments  

A. The Committee perceives the upside and downside risks to the 

attainment of both sustainable growth and price stability for the next few 

quarters to be roughly equal.  With underlying inflation expected to be 

relatively low, the Committee believes that policy accommodation can be 

removed at a pace this is likely to be measured.  Nonetheless, the 

Committee will respond to changes in economic prospects as needed to 

fulfill its obligation to promote price stability and sustainable growth. 

B. The Committee perceives the upside and downside risks to the 

attainment of both sustainable growth and price stability for the next few 

quarters to be roughly equal.  With underlying inflation expected to be 

relatively low, the Committee believes that policy accommodation can be 

removed at a pace that is likely to be measured.  Nonetheless, the 

Committee will respond to changes in economic prospects as needed to 

fulfill its obligation to maintain price stability.

C. The Committee perceives the upside and downside risks to the 

attainment of both sustainable growth and price stability for the next few 

quarters to be roughly equal.  With underlying inflation expected to be 

relatively low, the Committee believes that policy accommodation can be 

removed at a pace that is likely to be measured.  Nonetheless, the 

Committee will respond to changes in economic prospects as needed to 

fulfill its obligation to maintain price stability.

MONETARY POLICY ALTERNATIVES 

An Update 
  

Attached is an exhibit that details the market reaction to this morning’s 

employment report and a revised version of table 1 from the Bluebook.  As shown in 

the top panel of the market reaction exhibit, interest rates and policy expectations 

registered substantial increases following the release of the employment report.  As of 

10 a.m., Treasury coupon yields were up 12 to 15 basis points across the maturity 

structure.  Treasury inflation-indexed yields rose nearly as much as comparable-

maturity nominal yields, suggesting that much of the market response was attributable 

to an upward revision in the market’s outlook for real economic activity.  The 

November federal funds futures contract ticked up a half basis point, putting the 

implied probability of a quarter-point tightening at the upcoming meeting at 90 

percent.  Further-ahead futures rates were marked up as much as 20 basis points, as 

investors evidently concluded that a more vigorous expansion would likely be 

accompanied by more rapid policy tightening than they had previously expected.   

The bottom left panel of the exhibit displays the option-implied probability 

distribution for the employment report outcome based on the economic derivatives 

auction held at 8:00 a.m. today.  As noted by the vertical line, the reported increase of 

337,000 was well into the upper tail of this distribution, which helps to explain the 

sizable market reaction.  But, as noted at the right, the market reaction was sizable 

even controlling for the magnitude of the surprise.  For example, the response of the 

ten-year Treasury yield—denoted by the blue square—was larger than would have 

been predicted based upon a historical event-study regression (shown by the thin 

black line) but was quite close to the regression line based on experience over the last 



 2

year (the red line) during which markets have appeared especially sensitive to news 

bearing on labor market conditions. 

 In view of the sizable employment gains reported for October and the upward 

revisions for the prior two months, as well as comments from several members, the 

staff has revised Bluebook table 1.  The revised table eliminates alternative A and 

incorporates a new variation on alternative B that is labeled alternative B’.  The new 

alternative does not hint that the Committee is entertaining the possibility of a pause.  

As a result, the language of alternative B’ incorporates only minimal changes to the 

wording of the September FOMC statement.  Alternatives B and C in the revised 

table are slightly revised for clarity, with material struck out in rows three and four.

2. The Committee believes that, 
even after this action, the stance 
of monetary policy remains

with robust underlying growth 
in productivity, is providing 
ongoing support to economic 
activity.

3. After moderating earlier this 
year partly in response to the 
substantial rise in energy prices, 
output growth appears to have 
regained some traction, and 
labor market conditions have 
improved modestly. 

Output appears to be growing at 
a moderate pace, and labor 
market conditions have improved 
modestly. 

Output appears to be growing at

market conditions have

Output appears to be growing at a 
moderate pace, and labor market 
conditions have improved 
modestly. 

Rationale 

4. Despite the rise in energy prices, 
inflation and inflation 
expectations have eased in 
recent months. 

Despite the rise in energy prices, 
inflation and longer-term 
inflation expectations seem to 
remain well contained. 

Despite the rise in energy prices, 
inflation and longer-term 
inflation expectations remain 
well contained. 

Although longer-term inflation 
expectations seem to remain well 
contained, rising energy prices and 
an escalation of business costs 
have the potential to contribute to 
upward pressure on prices.  

5. The Committee perceives the 
upside and downside risks to 
the attainment of both 
sustainable growth and price 
stability for the next few 
quarters to be roughly equal.

Assessment 
of Risk 

6. With underlying inflation 
expected to be relatively low, 
the Committee believes that 
policy accommodation can be 
removed at a pace that is likely 
to be measured. Nonetheless, 
the Committee will respond to 
changes in economic prospects 
as needed to fulfill its obligation 
to maintain price stability.
