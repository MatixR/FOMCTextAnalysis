through a comprehensive digitization process which included identifying the best-
preserved paper copies, scanning those copies,1 and then making the scanned 
versions text-searchable.2   Though a stringent quality assurance process was 
employed, some imperfections may remain.

Recent developments

(1) Seasonally adjusted total reserves available to support private

nonbank deposits (RPD) expanded somewhat less rapidly in March than targeted,

as shown in attached Table 1. However, RPD in April appears to be growing

more than anticipated, and for the two months combined the growth rate seems

likely to be at an annual rate of about 13-1/2 per cent. This compares with

an adjusted 10-1/2--14-1/2 per cent target range. Originally, the Committee

had set the target range at 9-13 per cent, but for comparability the range

should be adjusted upward by 1-1/2 percentage points to allow for corrections

in the distribution of reserves between private and interbank deposits

necessitated by the introduction of the new PEPS system for clearing inter-

national transfers. 1/

(2) In March measures of the money stock and the adjusted credit

proxy expanded somewhat more than expectedas shown in attached Table 2. A

slowing in the rate of growth is anticipated for April, although partial data

for the early part of the month suggest that all three of the money and credit

aggregates are running somewhat ahead of rates for the month indicated in

pattern II at the last meeting.

1/ See appendix for explanation.

(3) At the time of the last Committee meeting, Federal funds were

trading around 3-7/8 per cent, below the level thought likely to emerge in

achieving the desired RPD growth rate. As the intermeeting period progressed,

the funds rate edged steadily higher from 3.91 to 4.18 per cent, with recent

daily trading most frequently around 4-1/4 per cent. With the money market

tightening and with increasing evidence of strengthening economic activity,

other interest rates also rose during the period--generally by 20-40 basis

points on private short-term market instruments and by 10-30 basis points

in bond markets. The 3-month bill rate, however, was virtually unchanged

over the period, as demand for very short maturities expanded in the face of

anticipated interest rate increases.

of change in major financial aggregates for recent periods,

Prospective developments

(5) Of the two patterns summarized below, pattern I incorporates

essentially the same second quarter growth rates for monetary aggregates

adopted at the last Committee meeting. Pattern II shows somewhat slower

rates of growth in the monetary aggregates. (The patterns in detail are

shown on the next page.)

somewhat above the mid-point of the earlier range (after technical adjust-

ment) but below the upper end, The rate of increase in RPD is targeted to

decelerate over the two months May and June. And the rate of growth for

the second quarter as a whole leads to a June level of RPD that is slightly

above the mid-point of the earlier adjusted path because recent experience

has suggested a somewhat greater bank demand for excess reserves.

(7) If the Committee instructs the Manager to achieve the

pattern I reserve path and aggregates, the staff expects that the Federal

funds rate would remain near or slightly above the 4-1/4 per cent mid-point

of the 3-3/4--4-3/4 per cent range associated with this pattern. However,

if such a funds rate prevails through the second quarter, we would also

expect growth in the aggregates, particularly M1, to remain generally strong

in the third quarter. For M1, it appears likely that such a posture would

lead to third quarter growth on the order of 8-1/2 per cent, assuming that

transactions demands will accelerate along with projected GNP.

(8) Attainment of pattern II reserve objectives in the second

quarter would probably lead to a funds rate moving up to an average of

around 5--5-1/4 per cent fairly promptly, at or slightly above the mid-point

of the 4-1/2--5-1/2 per cent range shown for the pattern. This would be

associated not only with some slowing in M1 growth in the second quarter,

but would encourage a lower third quarter growth rate of M1, perhaps on the

order of 6-1/2 per cent, annual rate.

(9) Short-term markets are likely to have to absorb continua-

tion of the recent stronger business loan performance and greater than season-

al Treasury cash requirements (though much lower than earlier anticipated by



-7-

the market). Nevertheless, given the aggregates of pattern I, any further rise

in short-term interest rates might be minor, since it does not now seem

probable that the funds rate would need to rise to the top end of the range

shown in paragraph (5). However, the 3-month bill rate, which has been

running low relative to the Federal funds and other short-term rates, may

show a noticeable increase. Under pattern II, with a rising Federal funds

rate, short-term rates would be expected to adjust upward substantially.

Such a rate rise would be reinforced by spreading expectations of a discount

rate increase.

(10) The long-term bond market appears to have adjusted in

good part to the recent rise in short rates. On balance, no more than a

moderate further rise in long rates seems likely so long as the Federal funds

rate stays around its recent 4-1/4 per cent level. Security dealer positions

are light, and corporate bond offerings are not expected to be heavy. The

Treasury refunding to be announced on April 26 is comparatively small. There

apparently will be no need to raise new cash at that time, and the public

holds only $2-1/2 billion of the issues maturing in mid-May.

(11) A rise in the funds rate toward the upper end of the

pattern I range, and certainly into the pattern II range, would be very

likely, however, to spark further significant increases in long-term rates.

As market rates generally rose further, this would, moreover, begin to be

reflected in rising primary mortgage market rates. The secondary mortgage

market has already shown signs of caution, and a further general rise in

short- and long-term market rates would be likely to reduce inflows to

savings institutions and to induce diversified lenders to shift some funds

away from mortgages.



(12) The anticipated behavior of M2 and the credit proxy over

the second quarter is little different from what was presented to the

Committee four weeks ago. Growth in time deposits other than large CD's is

expected to be significantly slower in the second quarter than in the first

in both patterns I and II, and the slowdown is greater in response to the

higher short-term market rates expected in pattern II. Reflecting slower

growth in time deposits, as well as a substantial drop in U. S. Government

deposits, the bank credit proxy should expand at a much more moderate rate

in both patterns. However, as market rates rise, especially under pattern

II, major money market banks can be expected to raise interest rates offer-

ed on time deposits, both large and small, to keep deposit inflows from

slowing markedly further in what appears to be a period of developing loan

demand.



Proposed directive

(13) This section presents three alternative formulations for

the operational paragraph of the directive. All continue the same language

with respect to reserves and money market conditions contained in the

directives of the last three meetings, and all include a qualifying instruc-

tion to the Manager to take account of the forthcoming Treasury refunding,

the terms of which are expected to be announced on April 26, as noted in

paragraph (10). It is proposed to delete the reference to international

developments on the assumption that the Committee will not consider it

necessary to take specific account of those developments in the currently

quieter environment surrounding the exchange markets.

(14) Alternative A.

"To implement this policy, while taking account of

[DEL: international development and possible] THE FORTHCOMING

Treasury financing, the Committee seeks to achieve bank

reserve and money market conditions that will support

moderate growth in monetary aggregates over the months

ahead."

Alternative A language is proposed for possible use if the

Committee wishes to adopt essentially the same second-quarter growth rates

for the monetary aggregates that were adopted at the meeting on March 21.

The pattern of specifications for this alternative is described in para-

graph (5).

(15) Alternative B.

"To implement this policy, while taking account of

[DEL: international developments and possible] CAPITAL MARKET



-10-

DEVELOPMENTS AND THE FORTHCOMING Treasury financing, the

Committee seeks to achieve bank reserve and money market

conditions that will support moderate growth in monetary

aggregates over the months ahead."

The language of alternative B differs from that of alternative A

in that it includes a reference to developments in capital markets. It is

proposed for possible use in the event that members of the Committee wish to

provide some safeguard against the risk of a significant near-term rise in

interest rates, particularly long-term rates. The pattern of specifications

for this alternative could be the same as that for alternative A, but the phrase

"taking account of capital market developments" could be construed as in-

structing the Manager to be more liberal in providing reserves and more

cautious in allowing the Federal funds rate to move upward if significant

increases in long-term interest rates appear to be in process.

(16) Alternative C. This language differs from that of alternative

A in the inclusion of the word "more" before "moderate growth in monetary

aggregates." It is proposed for possible use if the Committee decides to

pursue the more restrictive course contemplated by the specifications given

earlier for pattern II.

"To implement this policy, while taking account of

[DEL: international developments and possible] THE FORTHCOMING

Treasury financing, the Committee seeks to achieve bank

reserve and money market conditions that will support

MORE moderate growth in monetary aggregates over the

months ahead."

APPENDIX

BACKGROUND TO TECHNICAL CORRECTION OF RPD PATH

The correction affects the measured distribution of reserves held

behind private nonbank demand deposits (RPD) and net interbank deposits. The

target after correction represents what the staff would have presented at the

time of the March 21 FOMC meeting as consistant with pattern II aggregates if

the timing and extent to which foreign banking institutions were moving onto

PEPS had been known. The change in effect reduces the multiplier between

available reserves for private nonbank deposits and currently measured M 1.

The correction was necessary because of the accounting effect of the

recent transfer (on February 7 and March 13) to the PEPS system for clearing

international transactions of several foreign banking institutions which had

not yet been incorporated into our banking statistics. The staff did not

know the magnitude and exact timing of this transfer at the time of the

last FOMC meeting. As these foreign institutions joined PEPS, the effect

was to lower both cash items and net interbank deposits on the books of

member banks. In staff calculations of the distribution of reserves, this

would mean that reserves against net interbank deposits would decline and

required reserves against private demand deposits at member banks (gross demand

deposits less the now lower cash items) would rise by an equivalent amount,

thereby increasing the measured reserves available series. As noted above,

if the timing and extent of transfer had been known at the time of the last

FOMC meeting, the staff would have allowed for the effect in construction of

the reserve path presented at that meeting.



-12-

Incorporation of these institutions into the banking statistics

will, when we make our next annual revision, raise the measured level of the

money supply (unless offset, of course, by other benchmark changes). But the

data for the institutions that we have gathered indicates that there will be

virtually no effect on rates of change in money supply. In the annual

revision, a gradually decreasing level will be carried back over a number

of years.

NOTE: Data shown in parentheses are current projections. Annual rates of change other than those for the past are rounded to the nearest half percent.
1/ The target has been adjusted to reflect corrections in the distribution of reserves between private and interbank deposits necessitated by the

introduction of the new PEPS system for clearing international transfers. These corrections, worked out in conjunction with the Federal Reserve
Bank of New York, are purely technical. The adjusted target represents what the staff would have presented at the time of the March 21 FOMC
meeting as consistent with Pattern II aggregates and money market conditions if the timing and extent to which foreign banking institutions were
moving onto PEPS had been known. The amount of correction is plus 1-1/2 percentage points at an annual rate for the March-April period. Thus,
the adjusted target indicates a 12-1/2 percent annual rate (mid-point of the range) for the two-month period, as compared with 11 percent in the
original target.

2/ The range is centered on the adjusted 12.5 percent annual rate of growth in these reserves from February to April thought to be consistent with the
growth in monetary aggregates shown in Pattern II in the March 17, 1972 Bluebook.
