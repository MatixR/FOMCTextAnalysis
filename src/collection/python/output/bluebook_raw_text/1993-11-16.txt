Strictly Confidential (FR) Class I FOMC

MONETARY POLICY ALTERNATIVES

Prepared for the Federal Open Market Committee

By the staff Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System



Strictly Confidential (FR)
Class I - FOMC November 12, 1993

MONETARY POLICY ALTERNATIVES

Recent Developments

(1) Since the September 21 FOMC meeting, the federal funds

rate has averaged close to its intended level of 3 percent, while most

short-term rates have moved up 15 to 20 basis points. For

maturities that recently crossed the turn of the year, much of that

increase owed to the anticipated pressures on overnight rates associated

with window-dressing efforts at year end. The Treasury bill sector

has been pressured, in part, by increases in supply: With the elimina-

tion of the seven-year note and no thirty-year bond issuance in the

fourth quarter under the new auction schedule, the Treasury will, on

net, retire coupon securities this quarter, and rely more heavily on

bills. On October 18, Morgan Guaranty trimmed its prime lending rate

1/2 percentage point, to 5-1/2 percent, but no other major money center

bank followed suit.

(2) Intermediate- and long-term rates fell in the weeks fol-

lowing the September FOMC meeting, reaching twenty-year lows. However,

strength in incoming economic data over the latter part of the inter-

meeting period has contributed to upward revisions to market partici-

pants' expectations of economic growth over the intermediate run. With

1. With the usual summer bulge in seasonal borrowing receding, the
Desk lowered the borrowing allowance by $150 million in four steps, to
$100 million. Actual borrowing, boosted by quarter-end pressures and
a miss in nonborrowed reserves related to an unexpected swing in the
Treasury balance, exceeded the allowance by about $45 million, on
average, in the three complete maintenance periods since the previous
FOMC meeting.

2. Rate quotes are taken as of noon on Friday, November 12.
3. Term contracts currently imply about a 10 percent federal funds

rate for the three-day weekend beginning December 31. However, those
now using these contracts to lock in funds are said to be primarily
foreign banks, which in the past have paid premiums for year-end
funding.



firmer credit demands and a tighter monetary policy now foreseen over

time, intermediate-term Treasury rates rose sharply, and have increased

about 25 basis points on balance since the September meeting. Treasury

and private long-term rates have increased as many as 20 basis points on

net. The robust gains in most equity indexes that were posted early in

the period were whittled back when interest rates rose in recent weeks:

most major indexes registered net gains of 2 to 6 percent.

(3) The dollar's weighted-average foreign exchange value in-

creased 2-1/4 percent, on balance, over the intermeeting period. The

strength of the dollar reflected not only upward revisions to expecta-

tions about growth in the United States, but also downward revisions in

the outlook for Europe and Japan. On average over the intermeeting

period, both short- and long-term interest rates declined about 25 basis

points in major foreign countries. In Mexico, financial markets were

roiled by anxieties about the fate of NAFTA, and the peso depreciated 3

percent on balance against the dollar. In recent days, these anxieties

appear to have abated, and the peso has steadied. In contrast to the

general strength of the dollar, its value fell against the Canadian

dollar, as the new government in Canada affirmed its support for anti-

inflationary macroeconomic policies, resolving some of the uncertainties

that had troubled market participants.

The Desk did not intervene.

(4) Growth of the monetary aggregates ran a bit faster over

the past two months than the staff had envisioned in the previous blue-

book. Although somewhat more rapid income and spending than anticipated

likely contributed to this overage, special factors also appear to have



played a role. M2 flattened in October after a relatively strong

advance in September, with growth averaging 2-1/4 percent over the two

months--twice the expected pace. The upward surprise in M2 owed to its

most volatile component: Overnight RPs by the end of October were about

$6 billion above the level anticipated at the time of the September

meeting.4 Household M2 (M2 less demand deposits and overnight RPs

and Eurodollar deposits) was in line with projections of no growth.

This weakness in household M2 apparently owed largely to the continued

allure of capital market instruments. While flows into stock and bond

mutual funds tapered off in September, partial data for October point to

a substantial pickup to a near-record pace.5 Through October M2 grew

at a 1-1/4 percent annual rate from the fourth quarter of 1992, placing

it in the lower portion of its annual range. M1 expanded at a 12

percent rate over September and October. Currency growth averaged a

10-3/4 percent rate over the past two months, in part reflecting con-

tinued strong demands for U.S. dollars abroad. In addition, the

surge in mortgage prepayments over the last two months provided a

temporary lift to demand deposits and perhaps to other checkable depos-

its as well.9

4. As expected, NationsBank spun off its recently acquired dealer
into a nonbank subsidiary, removing $4-1/2 billion of overnight RPs
from M2 in late September.

5. M2 plus bond and stock mutual funds (excluding institutional
holdings and IRA/Keogh accounts) is estimated to have grown at an 8-
1/4 percent pace over the past two months.

6. M2 velocity rose at a 1-1/4 percent rate in the third quarter,
down from about a 4 percent rate of growth over the first half of the
year.

7. M1 velocity plunged in the third quarter. This decline
reflects the lagged effects of prior reductions in competing interest
rates as well as identifiable special factors, such as currency flows
abroad and mortgage prepayments.

8. Foreign currency shipments are estimated to have accounted for
about 2 percentage points of the growth in M1 over this period.

9. Total reserves and the monetary base grew at 18-1/4 and 11-1/2
percent rates, respectively, over September and October.



(5) M3 grew at a 2-1/2 percent pace over the past two months,

in contrast to the staff anticipation that it would be about flat. In

October, M3 was about 1/4 percent at an annual rate above the zero-

percent lower bound of its annual cone. Aside from the unexpected boost

provided by M2, the broader aggregate was aided by a runup in institu-

tion-only money funds. Large time deposits edged lower over the two

months. Bankers apparently have had little reason to compete for

deposit funds of late. Bank credit was unchanged in October and, even

abstracting from the effect of the restructuring by NationsBank,

expanded at only about a 3-3/4 percent rate over the past two months.

(6) The growth of nonfederal sector debt dipped to about a

3-1/2 percent rate in September but still remained ahead of its pace in

the first half of the year. Short-term credit flows to businesses have

remained anemic, likely reflecting further refinancing of bank loans

with the proceeds of capital market offerings. Business loans at com-

mercial banks fell over September and October, despite greater efforts

by banks to extend such credit, as evidenced by some additional easing

of standards and terms on business credit reported by bank loan officers

in our most recent survey. Household borrowing has picked up, perhaps

indicating a sense of brighter income prospects and greater comfort with

financial positions. Consumer credit expanded at a 10-1/4 percent rate

in September and bank data suggest another strong month in October. Net

mortgage growth is estimated to have remained modest over the past few

months, however, despite the apparent surge in refinancings. Similarly,

the heavy gross flow of issues by state and local governments has mostly

reflected efforts to pay down existing debt; net tax-exempt debt has

risen at a shade above 4 percent in recent months. On balance, from the

fourth quarter of 1992 through September, nonfederal debt grew at about



-5-

a 3 percent rate. With the growth of federal debt continuing to slow,

the total debt of nonfinancial sectors expanded at a 4-1/2 percent rate

in September, sufficient to keep the aggregate a little above the four-

percent lower bound of its monitoring range.

Policy Alternatives

(7) Three policy alternatives are presented for consideration

by the Committee. Under alternative B, the federal funds rate would

continue to trade around 3 percent.10  This alternative is consistent

with the monetary policy assumption of a steady federal funds rate for

several quarters ahead that underlies the greenbook projection of eco-

nomic activity and inflation. In that forecast, real GDP growth settles

into a 2-1/2 percent pace next year, as the stimulus imparted by past

interest rate declines and diminishing balance-sheet and credit supply

constraints about offsets the drag from continued fiscal retrenchment;

the unemployment rate remains around 6-3/4 percent, and core inflation

edges down. Market participants generally seem to believe that the

economic expansion will run a little faster than projected by the staff

and to avoid a pickup in inflation down the road the Federal Reserve

will begin to firm reserve conditions in the first half of next year.

If economic and inflation data over coming months instead prove to be

closer to the staff forecast, bond yields probably will retrace some of

their recent runup.

(8) The staff expects that a little faster expansion of spend-

ing and less cautious attitudes toward credit on the part of borrowers

and lenders will contribute to a slight pickup in the growth of non-

federal debt over coming months. Securities markets should remain very

receptive to offerings, as spreads of both investment-grade and junk

issues relative to Treasuries stay narrow. With long-term rates not

much above their recent lows, borrowing by households and firms is

10. The allowance for adjustment and seasonal borrowing would be
maintained initially at its current level of $100 million. Further
small reductions in the allowance likely would be needed over the
intermeeting period as demands for seasonal credit continue to fall
off.



expected to continue to be focused on longer-term sources. The recent

trend toward a greater willingness to lend by banks and other inter-

mediaries is unlikely to be reversed. However, credit flows through

depositories, while firming in early 1994, are likely to remain subdued,

limiting banks' and thrifts' need to bid for deposits. For 1993, domes-

tic nonfinancial sector debt is projected to finish the year 4-1/2 per-

cent above its 1992:Q4 base, a little above the lower edge of its 4 to 8

percent monitoring range. From the fourth quarter of this year through

next March, debt is projected to expand at a 5-1/4 percent rate; this

growth would place it well within its tentative 1994 monitoring range of

4 to 8 percent.

(9) As shown in the lower panel of the above table, M2 under

alternative B is projected to grow at a 2-1/2 percent rate over October

to March. This would leave M2 in the fourth quarter 1-1/4 percent above

its Q4 1992 base, just within its 1 to 5 percent annual range. By next

March, this aggregate would be 2-3/4 percent at an annual rate above its

fourth quarter 1993 base, and well within its provisional range. The

firming in M2 growth over the next several months reflects forecasts of

stronger expansion in nominal GDP late this year, the effects of the

recent surge in mortgage refinancing activity, and lagged stimulus from

the previous flattening of the yield curve. Despite the latter two

effects, M2 velocity rises noticeably further in the fourth and first

quarters as funds continue to be diverted from deposits into longer-term

mutual funds. For that reason, the velocity of M2+, which adds the

market value of net holdings of bond and stock mutual funds to M2, seems

likely to remain more stable than that of M2 in coming quarters. Ml,

which is projected to expand at a 10-1/2 percent rate from October to

March, would still account for all of the increase in M2. The continued

brisk pace of M1 growth mainly owes to earlier declines in its oppor-

tunity cost, but sustained strong foreign currency demands also are seen

as supporting expansion of this aggregate. With core deposits and

non-deposit sources continuing to fund the bulk of moderate expansion of

bank credit, issuance of managed liabilities in M3 should remain weak.

M3 would increase at a 1-1/2 percent rate from October to March. This

aggregate would be a little above the lower bound of its 0 to 4 percent

range for 1993 and more distinctly within its tentative 1994 range by

March.

(10) Under Alternative C, the federal funds rate would rise

1/2 percentage point to 3-1/2 percent.12 An immediate firming of

reserve market conditions is not embedded in market interest rates, and

consequently, short-term interest rates are likely to rise by nearly the

full 1/2 percentage point increase in the federal funds. Long-term

rates probably would rise appreciably at first, but some of those in-

creases could be reversed over time as market participants interpreted

that action as trimming the trajectory of economic activity and prices

and reducing the need for more aggressive tightening in the future.

11. In association with continued rapid growth in M1 and required
reserves, total reserves would expand at a 9.6 percent pace over the
October-March period and the monetary base at a 9.3 percent rate.

12. The borrowing allowance would be increased to $125 million.



-11-

With dollar-denominated returns rising significantly, the dollar likely

would appreciate considerably on foreign exchange markets.

(11) The Committee might favor alternative C if strength in

recent economic data were seen as implying that any delay in firming ran

an unacceptably high risk that economic activity could develop excessive

momentum that would rapidly erode the remaining degree of slack and

produce an acceleration of prices. Even if growth in aggregate demand

turns out to be as moderate as in the staff forecast, a tightening would

better ensure a resumption of a distinct downward trend to inflation.

Under this alternative, M2 would expand at a 2 percent rate from October

through March of next year, leaving growth from the fourth quarter of

this year in the lower half of its tentative range. M3 would expand at

a 1-1/4 percent rate from October through March, also in the lower half

of its provisional range.

(12) Alternative A contemplates an easing in reserve market

pressures and a decline in the federal funds rate to 2-1/2 percent.13

Implementation of alternative A would be especially surprising to market

participants, given their view that underlying economic growth is

strengthening. Short-term interest rates, including the prime rate,

probably would fall by about the 50 basis point reduction in the federal

funds rate, and the value of the dollar on foreign exchange markets

likely would decline. In these circumstances, any lasting reduction in

intermediate- and longer-term interest rates likely would be limited by

a belief that the action would need to be reversed before too long, as

well as by perceptions that the Federal Reserve was placing less weight

13. The reduction in the federal funds rate would be accomplished
either through a commensurate cut in the discount rate or through a
reduction in the borrowing allowance to $75 million.



-12-

on containing inflationary pressures and more weight on promoting near-

term growth in output and employment. Issuance of bonds and mortgages

likely would be heavy, as borrowers reacted to a sense that this was the

last window of low long-term rates for quite some time.

(13) Alternative A might be viewed as appropriate if the Com-

mittee wished to make appreciable progress in reducing remaining slack

in the economy, in contrast to the plateau for the unemployment rate

seen in the staff forecast. Lower short rates might also be seen as

desirable if the Committee were concerned about the possibility of

renewed weakness in economic growth over coming quarters, perhaps

brought on by tax increases becoming effective in 1994. This alterna-

tive would provide somewhat greater assurance that growth of the broad

monetary aggregates would be well within their annual ranges in the

first half of next year. Although the steeper yield curve under alter-

native A would make bond and stock funds more attractive, experience of

the last few years suggests some net shift of funds from market instru-

ments to M2 in the months following monetary policy easings. Thus, the

staff projects that M2 in March would be 3-1/4 percent at an annual rate

above its fourth-quarter base, a little above the middle of its tenta-

tive range, and M3 would be higher by 2 percent, around the middle of

its range.

Directive Language

(14) Presented below is draft wording for the operational

paragraph that includes the usual options for Committee consideration.

OPERATIONAL PARAGRAPH

In the implementation of policy for the immediate

future, the Committee seeks to DECREASE SOMEWHAT/main-

tain/INCREASE SOMEWHAT the existing degree of pressure

on reserve positions. In the context of the Commit-

tee's long-run objectives for price stability and

sustainable economic growth, and giving careful con-

sideration to economic, financial, and monetary devel-

opments, slightly (SOMEWHAT) greater reserve restraint

(WOULD/MIGHT) or slightly (SOMEWHAT) lesser reserve

restraint (WOULD) might be acceptable in the inter-

meeting period. The contemplated reserve conditions

are expected to be consistent with modest growth in M2

and M3 over COMING MONTHS [DEL: the balance of the year].
