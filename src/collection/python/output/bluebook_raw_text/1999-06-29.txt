MONETARY POLICY ALTERNATIVES

Recent Developments

(1) The announcement of the adoption of a directive tilted toward tightening at

the Committee's meeting on May 18 reinforced market expectations of firmer monetary

policy. While most interest rates backed up only modestly that day, the announcement set

the stage for the more pronounced increase in interest rates in subsequent weeks that was

fueled by stronger-than-expected incoming data and published reports of the views of

Federal Reserve officials, which boosted market participants' expectations of policy

tightening (Chart 1).1 The better-than-expected May CPI report on June 16 and the

Chairman's testimony the next day only temporarily damped expectations of the extent of

eventual policy firming. After allowing for term premiums, federal funds and Eurodollar

futures rates now suggest that most market participants view a quarter-point rate hike at this

meeting as virtually certain and expect a cumulative increase in the funds rate ofthree-

quarters of a percentage point or more over the next year. Over the intermeeting period,

most short-term rates have risen around 25 basis points; yields on Treasury coupon securities

have increased about 25 to 40 basis points, perhaps pressured as well by a crowded calendar

of upcoming agency and corporate issuance. The advance in nominal Treasury yields

primarily reflected increases in forward rates at two- to five-year horizons, while longer-term

forward rates rose much less. This configuration suggests that Federal Reserve policy is

1 The federal funds rate has averaged a shade under the intended rate over the
intermeeting period in trading that has been somewhat less volatile than earlier this year.

expected to push real interest rates higher over the next few years than had been expected

prior to the May meeting, but perhaps not by enough to contain pressures on prices entirely.

This view is supported by the fact that yields on indexed Treasury securities have gained

about half as much as their nominal counterparts.

(2) The announcement of a biased directive, coming on the heels of stronger-

than-expected April CPI figures the Friday before the last meeting, seemed to make market

participants more cautious about taking on risk. This increased caution was evidenced by

some deterioration in measures of market liquidity and a widening of risk spreads, although

these effects mostly faded later in the intermeeting period (Chart 2). On balance, yield

spreads on agency and investment-grade securities still are a touch wider than at the time of

the May meeting. The effects of higher interest rates on stock prices were about offset by

brighter second-quarter earnings prospects, and, on net, broad equity indexes are unchanged

to down 3 percent.

(3) The exchange value of the dollar has changed little against an index of other

major currencies over the intermeeting period. Even though U.S. interest rates rose less than

those in euro-area countries, the dollar has risen about 2-1/4 percent against the euro,

reflecting in part uncertainty about the attitude of the authorities owing to sometimes-

conflicting public statements by officials. The Bank of England lowered its repo rate 25

basis points, responding largely to the implications of persistent strength of the pound for

growth and inflation. Following that action, the dollar has appreciated 3/4 percent against

the pound. In contrast, the dollar has depreciated 1-1/2 percent against the yen over the

period, as yields on Japanese government debt rose sharply relative to rates on U.S.

Treasuries. The rise in Japanese rates owed to perceptions of improved prospects for the

Japanese economy, supported in part by the surprising strength of reported Japanese GDP in

the first quarter. Monetary authorities in Japan have leaned against the rise in the foreign

exchange value of the yen, intervening on four recent days in both Japan and Europe and

purchasing more than $20 billion and the equivalent of more than $4-1/4 billion in euro. 2

(4) In Latin America, financial markets have been subject to heightened stress

over the intermeeting period, related only in part to market expectations of higher U.S.

interest rates. Uncertainty about Argentina's longer-term commitment to its currency-board

regime and concerns over the slow progress of fiscal reform in Brazil have contributed to

these pressures. Stripped Brady bond spreads spiked higher in late May and early June; on

balance, Brady bond spreads have increased 60 to 140 basis points from their levels in

mid-May. In Argentina, domestic short-term interest rates are up 2-3/4 percentage points

since early May. The Brazilian realhas depreciated almost 7-1/2 percent against the dollar on

balance, while the Mexican peso has fallen almost 1-1/2 percent. Major Latin American

stock market indexes are up slightly to off 5-1/2 percent over the intermeeting period. In

contrast, financial markets in emerging Asian economies have generally improved, with their

currencies appreciating and share price indexes up considerably in many cases.

(5) Growth of the broad monetary aggregates has been volatile in recent months,

reflecting in part the effects of tax-related flows on liquid deposits. Smoothing through the

monthly swings, money growth appears to have moderated slightly, with M2 expanding at an

average rate of about 5-1/4 percent over the four months through June, down from about 6

percent in January and February and double-digit rates late last year. The slowing earlier in

the year owed to an unwinding of the heightened demand for safety and liquidity of last fall,

while more recently M2 growth has been damped by a rise in its opportunity cost as market

rates have increased. Through June of this year, M2 has expanded at about a 6-1/4 percent

pace from the final quarter of last year, above the upper end of its 1 to 5 percent annual

range. Growth in M3 has also declined this year, partly as the consequence of the behavior

of M2. In addition, the sluggish expansion of depository credit since the start of the year has

reduced depository institutions' issuance of managed liabilities in M3, including large time

deposits and RPs. Institution-only money market funds also contributed to the slowdown in

M3: These funds pay rates that are averages of recent short-term market rates, and so their

relative attractiveness has diminished with the backup in market interest rates in recent

months. From the fourth quarter of last year through June, M3 has grown at a rate of about

6 percent, leaving that aggregate at the upper end of its annual range.

(6) The expansion of domestic nonfinancial sector debt also has moderated a bit

recently. Business borrowing appears to have fallen back a bit from its very rapid pace earlier

in the year. Moreover, the uptick in rates following the May meeting appeared to redirect

business credit, with bond issuance slowing, as some borrowers deferred coming to market,



and commercial paper issuance and bank lending picking up. Household debt has advanced

less rapidly in recent months than early in the year, owing to a slowing in consumer credit

growth. Municipal debt issuance also has dipped of late, as higher interest rates have reduced

the attractiveness of the advance refunding of earlier issues. Despite the recent slowing, the

debt of nonfederal sectors grew at an 8-3/4 percent annual rate from the final quarter of last

year through May, up slightly relative to 1998. Paydowns of federal debt have accelerated

this year, however, leaving the growth rate of total domestic nonfinancial debt from the

fourth quarter of 1998 through May at 6 percent--about the same pace as last year and in the

upper half of its annual range.

Long-Term Strategies

(7) This section uses the staff quarterly econometric model of the U.S. economy

to extend the Greenbook forecast and to consider alternative monetary policies: The base-

line strategy caps inflation at 2-1/2 percent as measured by the chain-weight core PCE price

index, while the price stability alternative is constructed to bring this gauge of inflation down

to around 3/4 percent by the middle of the next decade.3 4

(8) The Greenbook projection for this year and next shows an economy marked

by several notable imbalances that shape the evolution of the economy over the next decade.

One imbalance is the excess of domestic investment over domestic saving. In response to

the apparent improvement in productivity trends, as well as to the partly related surge in

equity prices, consumers have boosted their spending to levels that are unusually high relative

to current income (although not to perceived permanent income). This low rate of saving,

which implies little direct addition to wealth, together with the projection that equity prices

rise less rapidly than nominal income, implies that the ratio of household net worth to GDP

3 The price stability alternative was obtained by using a Taylor rule with the target for
the inflation rate assumed to be 3/4 percent rather than the 2-1/2 percent implied in the
baseline. The rule was modified from the standard version by having a considerably higher
response to inflation (so that inflation in the simulation is brought to the target in about
seven years) and by phasing in the lower inflation target over two years to make the policy
shift less abrupt. The numerical target of this "price stability" strategy approximates true
stability after allowance is made for the biases produced by measurement problems.

4 In the version of the model used for these simulations, expectations of inflation and
other variables are formed in a forward-looking manner, but with incomplete knowledge of
the structure of the economy and the intent of the policymakers. Over an intermediate term,
the sacrifice ratio--the cumulative percentage point increase in the unemployment rate
required to cut inflation 1 percentage point--is 2-1/2.



falls gradually over the next decade. As current income moves higher in line with the

public's anticipations, saving out of that income is likely to rise gradually over time, to a level

more in line with historical norms, moderating the decline in the ratio of wealth to GDP.

Federal budget surpluses are assumed to remain sizable relative to nominal GDP, and the

behavior of households boosts national saving, lowering the equilibrium real rate of interest

over the long term.5

(9) A related imbalance is on the international side. The current account deficit

has ballooned in response to strong domestic spending, weak growth abroad, and a relatively

high value of the dollar. With the rest of the world called upon to finance the continuing

excess of domestic spending over production, international portfolios are likely to be

increasingly dominated by dollar-denominated assets. The extended forecast assumes that

the discomfort implied by burgeoning dollar asset holdings in foreign portfolios, together

with the downward movement of U.S. real interest rates as domestic saving increases, leads

to a secular decline in the real foreign exchange value of the dollar.

5 Also helping to reduce the equilibrium real interest rate in the long run is a
moderation in the pace of business investment. Capital formation in recent years has been,
and for a time going forward is likely to continue to be, boosted above its long-run trend by
the desire of businesses to raise the capital-output ratio in response to a faster pace of
technological progress. As this adjustment of the capital stock is completed, however,
investment growth slows. In addition to lowering the equilibrium real interest rate, the
slower pace of investment implies that in the later part of the extended outlook capital will
grow less rapidly relative to labor (reducing the pace of capital deepening), which will in turn
restrain labor productivity growth. As a result, the growth rate of potential GDP, which
remains at its currently assumed rate of 3-1/4 percent per annum until the middle of the next
decade, edges down a few tenths of a percent in subsequent years.

8



(10) Another imbalance occurs in the labor market, which in the Greenbook

remains tight through the end of next year. As a consequence, inflation picks up and is

poised to rise further in 2001 and beyond. In the absence of additional increases in

productivity growth or of declines in relative import and commodity prices, consumer price

inflation would continue to move up until the economy returns to a sustainable level of

resource utilization, which for labor markets in the model is represented by a NAIRU of

5-1/4 percent.

(11) Under the baseline strategy, policy is assumed to tighten sufficiently to raise

the unemployment rate gradually to 5-1/4 percent, thereby capping inflation at a moderate

rate (shown by the solid lines in Chart 3). This action requires 100 basis points of tightening

in 2001 (beyond the 50 basis points assumed in the Greenbook) and brings the nominal

funds rate to 6-1/4 percent. Over the longer run, short-term interest rates decline modestly,

along with the downward drift in the equilibrium rate. Under the alternative price-stability

strategy (shown by the dotted lines in the chart), policy must create enough economic slack

to bring inflation down from its current level. This entails a similar-sized increase in the

nominal federal funds rate, but it is put in place much sooner so that the real funds rate rises

higher and remains elevated for a more extended period. As a result, the unemployment rate

peaks at almost 6-1/2 percent at the end of 2003, but thereafter drifts down to its sustainable

level, as inflation settles in at the lower target rate and policy returns to a neutral stance.

(13) Over the first half of this year, M2 grew about 1 percentage point faster at an

annual rate than did nominal GDP, extending the decline in velocity that has been evident

since mid-1997. The factors behind that decrease over the past two years are not entirely

clear. As the lower two panels of Chart 5 suggest, velocity, after shifting higher over the

early 1990s, appears to have responded to movements in the standard measure of

opportunity cost (the three-month Treasury bill rate minus the average rate earned on M2

assets) in a fashion similar to its behavior during the 1960s, 1970s, and 19 80s. Nonetheless,

velocity continued to drift higher until mid-1997 and since then has dropped considerably

despite the fact that the standard measure of opportunity cost has changed little on balance

in the last two years. Much of the recent decline in velocity could reflect the substantial rise

in wealth relative to income in recent years: Investors may have been attempting to

rebalance their portfolios by reallocating some of their wealth from equities to assets

included in M2. The staff projects that velocity will continue to fall over the balance of

1999 and during 2000, albeit only marginally, as the presumed effects on money demand of

the previous build-up in wealth begin to fade and as M2's opportunity cost increases in

response to the monetary policy tightening assumed for this year. M2 growth is projected

to slow to 5-1/4 percent over the balance of 1999, bringing growth for the year to 6

percent. Next year, growth is expected to moderate further to 5 percent as expansion of

nominal income slows. 6

(14) M3 is forecast to increase 6-1/4 percent in 1999, its slowest pace since 1995

and well below the nearly 11 percent advance posted in 1998. The non-M2 component of

M3 should decelerate sharply from last year's rate, partly owing to reduced funding needs of

depository institutions. Adjusted for mark-to-market effects, bank credit growth is

6 The public, concerned about the century date change, is projected to shift funds into
currency and deposits from obligations that are not federally insured, thereby boosting the
growth of M2 and M3 by 1/4 percentage point on balance this year relative to nominal
income. As noted in the Greenbook, income growth is also expected to be lifted slightly by
inventory-building and purchases of consumer goods in advance of the century date change,
which should also buoy money demand. Any fillip to monetary growth associated with the
century date change would be reversed next year. Obviously, substantial uncertainty attends
these assumptions.



projected to plunge to 3-1/4 percent this year from 10-1/4 percent in 1998, largely

reflecting an unwinding of the bulge related to the market turmoil in the latter part of 1998.

The slack demands for bank credit this year translate into very subdued issuance by banks of

managed liabilities included in M3, such as large time deposits. M3 also decelerates because

the expansion of institutional money market mutual funds this year is lagging behind the

blistering pace of 1998, perhaps as more corporations complete their shift toward the

outsourcing of corporate cash management and as the effects of last year's monetary easings

wear off. Next year, the expansion of M3 is seen as declining slightly further to 6 percent.

Although bank funding needs should be boosted a little by a modest rebound in bank credit

growth, the deceleration in M2 should hold down M3 growth. With M3 growth still

outstripping that of nominal GDP over both 1999 and 2000, V3 is projected to extend its

secular decline (Chart 6).

(15) In the staff forecast, domestic nonfinancial sector debt expands 5-1/2

percent in 1999 and 4-1/4 percent in 2000, about in line with nominal income. In both

years, debt growth is accounted for by the nonfederal sectors, whose debt is expected to

increase about 8 percent this year and about 7 percent next year. Increasing federal

surpluses imply that the government is a growing net supplier of funds to credit markets,

facilitating household and business borrowing and spending. Nonetheless, most credit

supply conditions, as measured by interest rate spreads in open markets and lending terms

and standards of banks, are expected to remain around current levels, which are a bit tighter

than one year ago, imparting little, if any, additional restraint on spending.

Ranges for Money and Debt

(16) In February, the Committee chose ranges of 1 to 5 percent for M2, 2 to 6

percent for M3, and 3 to 7 percent for debt for 1999. The Committee established those

ranges for the monetary aggregates--the same ranges that have been in place since 1995--to

provide benchmarks for money growth consistent with long-term price stability and

historically typical velocity trends. Thus, the ranges did not necessarily reflect the

Committee's expectations for actual money growth over 1999. Indeed, the staffs

projections for monetary growth exceeded the upper ends of the selected ranges, and those

projections were based on a forecast of nominal GDP growth that was slower than those of

most FOMC members.7 The predictability of the velocity of the monetary aggregates does

not appear to have improved markedly in the last two years. After two years of relatively

small errors in annual staff projections, V2 fell about 3 percentage points more in 1998 than

the staff had projected at the beginning of that year; relatively little of that error can be

explained by unforeseen movements in opportunity costs prompted by the Committee's

policy actions in the second half of the year. As noted above, the velocity of M2 has

continued to decline in 1999, albeit at a slower pace than in 1998, and, based on the

Greenbook GDP forecast, the rate of decline in velocity over the first half of this year

appears to have been about 1-1/2 percentage points less than forecast by the staff this

January.

7 The February Humphrey-Hawkins report noted the possibility that the aggregates
could overshoot their ranges this year.



(17) The table below displays two sets of ranges for money and debt for 1999 and

2000, along with staff projections. Given the continued uncertainty regarding appropriate

rates of money growth and relatively small errors in forecasting debt growth in recent years,

the alternatives are constructed under the presumption that the Committee will continue

with its current approach to the ranges--that is, ranges for money keyed to the Federal

Reserve's price stability objective and the range for debt aligned with its expected growth.

(18) The Committee's selection of ranges for M2 and M3 may be influenced by the

possibility that underlying trends in productivity and potential GDP growth have

strengthened appreciably since the adoption of these ranges and their underlying rationale in

the mid-1990s. If the Committee were confident that the faster trend in potential output

would persist, it might choose to increase the monetary ranges, as discussed below. If not,

it presumably would opt to maintain the current monetary ranges for 1999 and carry them

over to 2000, as in Alternative I. Those ranges would be consistent with an expectation of

potential real GDP growth of 2-1/2 percent, the staff estimate of a 1/2 percentage point



upward bias in inflation calculated using the GDP deflator, no true inflation, and the

assumptions that V2 would be flat and V3 would decline at 1 percent per year, their long-

term historical tendencies. The July Humphrey-Hawkins report would need to note that the

monetary aggregates could well overshoot their ranges again during 1999 and very possibly

in 2000.

(19) If the Committee believed that long-term productivity trends had improved

significantly, price stability and historically typical velocity trends would involve more rapid

rates of monetary growth than implied by the midpoint of the existing ranges. For example,

allowing for the 3-1/4 percent growth in potential real GDP in the Greenbook forecast, the

1/2 percentage point bias in inflation measured by the GDP deflator, and a very low rate

(1/4 percent) of true inflation would call for M2 and M3 ranges centered on 4 and 5

percent, respectively, 1 percentage point higher than their current ranges. Alternative II

gives such ranges.8

(20) The Committee has not employed a price-stability rationale in choosing

ranges for the debt of domestic nonfinancial sectors but instead has based ranges on

forecasts of actual growth. The current 3 to 7 percent range remains consistent with this

approach for 1999. However, centering the range for 2000 approximately on the staff

forecast would imply selecting a range of 2 to 6 percent. As it happens, a range of 2 to 6

The Committee might also adjust the monetary ranges upward, as in Alternative II,
if it wished to shift away from its current, long-run price-stability rationale and toward ranges
based on forecasts in 2000, perhaps because it believed that the period of especially large
disturbances to velocity was coming to an end. Staff forecasts suggest that an upward adjust-
ment probably would be necessary to center the ranges on expected monetary growth.

15



percent would also be centered on the 4 percent expected rate of growth of debt under

assumptions of increased productivity growth, price stability, and the flat trend of velocity

that has prevailed over most of the postwar period.



Short-Run Policy Alternatives

(21) The general contours of the staff forecast have not changed much from the

May Greenbook. Smoothing through turn-of-the-year effects, output increases on average

over the next 1-1/2 years at a rate a little below the growth of its potential, down noticeably

from the pace of the last few years. In the near term, financial conditions act as more of a

restraint on demand than was assumed in the last forecast, reflecting both recent market

developments and an assumption that tightening by the Committee will take place sooner

than in the previous forecast. Financial conditions remain roughly unchanged over the

forecast period--bond yields, equity prices, and the dollar fluctuate near current levels--

which contributes to the maintenance of economic growth near trend. The current tautness

of labor markets persists, and core inflation begins to edge higher. Core PCE price inflation

moves from a little below 1-1/2 percent over 1999 to a little above 1-3/4 percent over 2000,

and core CPI inflation from just above 2 percent to 2-1/2 percent--in both cases revised up

slightly from the May Greenbook. Pressures on compensation are expected to be a bit

stronger in this forecast, based on a slightly firmer tone to recent wage and benefits reports.

(22) The Committee might nonetheless favor the unchanged federal funds rate of

alternative B if it did not view the prospects for a rise in inflation as having increased since

the last meeting, when it saw the risks as tilted, but not enough to tighten. The staff sees

the growth of GDP slowing in the second and third quarters to about the pace of its

potential. This slowing presumably does not owe in any appreciable way to the firming of

-17-



financial conditions over May and June and could reflect more fundamental tendencies of

aggregate demand. If so, a partial reversal of that financial market firming, which would

occur under this alternative, would not lead to tauter labor markets, especially if continued

rapid growth in productivity were viewed as a reasonable prospect. Furthermore, CPI data

that have become available since the last Committee meeting have extended the downward

trend in the twelve-month change in core prices, underlining uncertainties about the supply

side of the economy. In these circumstances, before tightening policy, the Committee may

want to see more concrete evidence that the economy was growing faster than its potential

or that upward pressures in costs and prices were emerging.

(23) A decision to leave the federal funds rate unchanged would come as a surprise

to market participants and prompt a reassessment of the Federal Reserve's strategy and

tactics. Interest rates would decline some and the dollar would drop on foreign exchange

markets, although the extent of the declines could be limited by expectations that a

tightening may not be far off, especially if market participants were to believe that the

Committee's directive retained the tilt announced in May. Still, the hesitancy of the

Committee to tighten at this meeting would signal lessened concern about inflation

prospects than the market has inferred from announcements and statements and would

suggest a less steep trajectory for short-term rates going forward. Equity prices might be

boosted for a while by declines in interest rates, but they could reverse any gains if,

-18-



consistent with the staff forecast, news on earnings proved to be disappointing in coming

quarters.

(24) The Committee might choose the 25 basis-point increase in the federal funds

rate under alternative C if it agreed with the staffs forecast that the risks were decidedly on

the side of an upward tilt to inflation and wished to take preemptive action now. Although

inflation remains subdued, as yet signs that economic expansion will moderate to a pace that

will avoid added strains in labor markets are tentative. With foreign economies continuing

to recover and the real federal funds rate appreciably below its level of a year ago, the

Committee may desire some added assurance that the economy will slow to trend.

Validating at least the initial step of the sequence of expected policy moves now embedded

in financial prices would help to preserve the recent firming in financial conditions.

Grounds for tightening would be even stronger if the Committee saw, as the staff does, the

unchanged unemployment rate in the Greenbook forecast as too low to forestall an upward

trend in inflation. The Committee, in this case, might even want to consider a 50 basis

point firming; in the extended baseline strategy, a 150 basis point tightening over the next

three years is needed to cap PCE inflation at 2-1/2 percent.

(25) Although a 25 basis-point firming is built into prices, financial markets might

still react to a tightening move of this magnitude. The fluctuations in yields of the past few

weeks have demonstrated that financial markets are especially sensitive to perceptions of

Federal Reserve intentions, and the near-term reaction to alternative C will depend on the

-19-



market's interpretation of the announcement together with the choice of the tilt of the

directive. If the wording of the announcement suggested that the Committee was less

concerned about inflationary pressures than market participants have come to believe--and

therefore that the extent of policy firming in coming quarters might be less than now

anticipated--intermediate- and longer-term interest rates could decline some, perhaps

reversing a significant portion of the run-up over the past week. In this case, the dollar

could weaken some and equity markets could turn up. If, instead, the announcement

suggested serious concern about inflation risks, market participants could expect a more

rapid or protracted subsequent series of moves. In this case, interest rates and the foreign

exchange value of the dollar could rise a good bit, and stocks and emerging market debt

could come under selling pressure. While market talk that the Committee might tighten by

50 basis points at this meeting has recently surfaced, such an action would nonetheless

come as a considerable surprise. Price movements would likely be outsized, though a clear

indication that the Committee would be on hold for some time could limit the response.

Directive Language

(26) Presented below for the members' consideration is draft wording relating to

the Committee's ranges for the aggregates in 1999 and 2000 and the operational paragraph

for the intermeeting period.

1999-2000 RANGES

The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and financial

conditions that will foster price stability and promote sustainable growth in output. In

furtherance of these objectives, the Committee REAFFIRMED at THIS its meeting THE

RANGES IT HAD ESTABLISHED in February [DEL: established ranges] for growth of M2 and

M3 of 1 to 5 percent and 2 to 6 percent respectively, measured from the fourth quarter of

1998 to the fourth quarter of 1999. [IN FURTHERANCE OF THESE OBJECTIVES,

THE COMMITTEE AT THIS MEETING RAISED/LOWERED THE RANGES IT

HAD ESTABLISHED IN FEBRUARY FOR GROWTH OF M2 AND M3 TO RANGES

OF ____ TO ____PERCENT AND ____ TO ____ PERCENT RESPECTIVELY,

MEASURED FROM THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 1998 TO THE FOURTH

QUARTER OF 1999.] The range for growth of total domestic nonfinancial debt was

MAINTAINED set at 3 to 7 percent (RAISED/LOWERED TO ____ TO ____

PERCENT) for the year.

FOR 2000, THE COMMITTEE AGREED ON A TENTATIVE BASIS

TO SET THE SAME RANGES FOR GROWTH OF THE MONETARY

- 21 -



AGGREGATES AND DEBT, MEASURED FROM THE FOURTH QUARTER OF

1999 TO THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2000. [FOR 2000, THE COMMITTEE

AGREED ON TENTATIVE RANGES FOR MONETARY GROWTH, MEASURED

FROM THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 1999 TO THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2000,

OF ____ TO ____ PERCENT FOR M2 AND ____ TO ____ PERCENT FOR M3. THE

COMMITTEE PROVISIONALLY SET THE ASSOCIATED RANGE FOR GROWTH

OF TOTAL DOMESTIC NONFINANCIAL DEBT AT ____ TO ____ PERCENT FOR

2000.] The behavior of the monetary aggregates will continue to be evaluated in the light of

progress toward price level stability, movements in their velocities, and developments in the

economy and financial markets.

OPERATIONAL PARAGRAPH

To promote the Committee's long-run objectives of price stability and

sustainable economic growth, the Committee in the immediate future seeks conditions in

reserve markets consistent with maintaining/INCREASING/DECREASING the federal

funds rate at/TO an average of around ____ [DEL: 4-3/4] percent. In view of the evidence

currently available, the Committee believes that prospective developments are [EQUALLY

LIKELY TO WARRANT AN INCREASE OR A DECREASE] more likely to warrant an

increase/A DECREASE than a decrease /AN INCREASE in the federal funds rate

operating objective during the intermeeting period.

NOTE: Numbers in parentheses are actual growth rates as reported at end of policy period in February Monetary Policy
Report to Congress. Subsequent revisions to historical data (not reflected above) have altered growth rates by up to a
few tenths of a percent.

n.s. -- not specified.
Footnotes on following page



1. Targets are for bank credit until 1983; from 1983 onward targets are for domestic nonfinancial sector debt.

2. The figures shown reflect target and actual growth of M1-B in 1980 and shift-adjusted M1-B in 1981. M1-B was
relabelled M1 in January 1982. The targeted growth for M1-A was 3-1/2 to 6 percent in 1980 (actual growth was 5.0
percent); in 1981 targeted growth for shift-adjusted M1-A was 3 to 5-1/2 percent (actual growth was 1.3 percent).

3. When these ranges were set, shifts into other checkable deposits in 1980 were expected to have only a limited effect
on growth of M1-A and M1-B. As the year progressed, however, banks offered other checkable deposits more actively,
and more funds than expected were directed to these accounts. Such shifts are estimated to have decreased M1-A growth
and increased M1-B growth each by at least 1/2 percentage point more than had been anticipated.

4. Adjusted for the effects of shifts out of demand deposits and savings deposits. At the February FOMC meeting, the
target ranges for observed M1-A and M1-B in 1981 on an unadjusted basis, expected to be consistent with the adjusted
ranges, were -(4-1/2) to -2 and 6 to 8-1/2 percent, respectively. Actual M1-B growth (not shift adjusted) was 5.0 percent.

5. Adjusted for shifts of assets from domestic banking offices to International Banking Facilities.

6. Range for bank credit is annualized growth from the December 1981 - January 1982 average level through the fourth
quarter of 1982.

7. Base period, adopted at the July 1983 FOMC meeting, is 1983 QII. At the February 1983 meeting, the FOMC had
adopted a 1982 QIV to 1983 QIV target range for M1 of 4 to 8 percent.

8. Base period is the February-March 1983 average.

9. Base period, adopted at the July 1985 FOMC meeting, is 1985 QII. At the February 1983 meeting, the FOMC had
adopted a 1984 QIV to 1985 QIV target range for M1 of 4 to 7 percent.

10. No range for M1 has been specified since the February 1987 FOMC meeting because of uncertainties about its
underlying relationship to the behavior of the economy and its sensitivity to economic and financial circumstances.

11. At the February 1990 meeting, the FOMC specified a range of 2-1/2 to 6-1/2 percent. This range was lowered to
1 to 5 percent at the July 1990 meeting.

12. At the February 1993 meeting, the FOMC specified a range of 2 to 6 percent for M2, 1/2 to 4-1/2 percent for M3,
and 4-1/2 to 8-1/2 percent for domestic nonfinancial debt. These ranges were lowered to 1 to 5 percent for M2, 0 to 4
percent for M3, and 4 to 8 percent for domestic nonfinancial debt at the July 1993 meeting.

13. At the February 1995 FOMC meeting, the FOMC specified a range of 0 to 4 percent. This range was raised to 2
to 6 percent at the July 1995 meeting.

14. Growth rates in parentheses for the monetary aggregates are from 1998 QIV to June 1999 and for nonfinancial debt
are from 1998 QIV to May 1999.
