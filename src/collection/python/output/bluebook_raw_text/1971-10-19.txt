MONETARY AGGREGATES AND
MONEY MARKET CONDITIONS

Recent developments

(1) In September and early October both the narrowly and broadly

defined money supply aggregates fell considerably short of the paths projected

in the last blue book, as shown in the table on page 2. The outstanding

level of M1, instead of rising from the reduced levels of early September as

expected, dropped further as the month progressed, and for the month as a

whole, declined at a 3.7 per cent annual rate. As a result, M 1 growth over

the third quarter was reduced to 3.0 per cent and for the second and third

quarters combined to about 7.0 per cent. With private demand deposits turning

down and time deposits other than CD's growing less than anticipated, the

expansion of M2 was virtually halted in September and was reduced to a 4.5

per cent annual rate in the third quarter. Growth of the adjusted credit

proxy, on the other hand, remained about on target for both September and the

third quarter, as greater than expected strength in large CD's and nondeposit

sources of funds approximately offset the shortfalls in other deposits.

(2) As incoming data on the money supply aggregates continued to

fall short of path levels, the Desk sought to provide enough reserves to

promote somewhat easier money market conditions, aiming at gradually reducing

the Federal funds rate to around 5-1/4 per cent or a little below. In the

two weeks ending October 6, required reserves were below path, on balance, as

indicated in the table on page 3. At the same time nonborrowed reserves were

above target path, and as a result net borrowed reserves were much reduced,

with banks electing both to hold more excess reserves and to reduce their borrow-

ings from the Federal Reserve. The funds rate initially dropped less than might

have been expected under these conditions--averaging, for example, 5.43 per

cent in the week ending September 29. But by the week ending October 13

the Federal funds rate had softened to about the 5-1/4 per cent target. In

that week, nonborrowed reserves dropped off sharply relative to target,

but the demand for reserves, as indicated by the shortfall in required

reserves relative to target, was also lower than earlier anticipated.

(3) Since the last meeting of the Committee, market interest

rates have experienced significant across-the-board declines as shown in

the table below. In fact, for most series, recently prevailing rate levels

are close to or below the earlier lows reached in the immediate aftermath

of the President's mid-August speech. While there is still uncertainty

surrounding the wage-price control program, the plans recently announced

have so far contributed to strengthening of bond markets. But in addition

bond prices have risen in response to the recent moderate easing of money

market conditions and to the prospects for further easing of money market

conditions inferred from the recent slow growth of the monetary aggregates.

Prospective developments

(5) Three alternatives for Committee consideration are summarized

in the text table below, with the monetary aggregate paths laid out in

more detail in the table on the next page. (Two tables at the end of

text show weekly paths for the monetary aggregates and more detail on

aggregate reserves).

Alternative A Alternative B Alternative C

1st Q. 1972 4-1/2 6 7-1/2

(6) The money market conditions shown for the three paths vary

from a range around those recently prevailing (Alt. A) to considerably

easier specifications. Overall credit conditions--as typified by behavior

of short- and long-term interest rates--might well ease somewhat between

now and the next Committee meeting even under Alternative A. Credit demands

from businesses and State and local governments in long-term markets appear

to be tapering off, and investors have shown a greater willingness to purchase

longer-term securities. Investors' demands will be influenced, however, by

their evaluation, as the details of Phase II become known, of the extent

to which it seems to promise significant restraint on wage and price pressures.

(7) Short-term credit demands are likely to expand in the fourth

quarter both for seasonal reasons and as business activity improves cycllically.

But we would not expect such demands to be reflected in much, if any, near-

term upward pressure on Treasury bill or private short-term rates. The

peak period of seasonal pressure on short-term markets normally comes after

mid-November. Also, the Treasury's mid-November refunding--to be announced

on October 27--may reduce short-term market pressures by emphasizing debt

lengthening, perhaps partly through incorporation of an advance refunding.

On the other hand, the Treasury could announce in conjunction with the

refunding that it will raise cash around mid-November through a bill issue.

On balance, we would expect the 3-month bill rate to be in a 4-1/4--4-3/4

per cent range between now and the next meeting of the Committee, given the

money market specifications of alternative A. This bill rate range assumes

no substantial bill sales by foreign central banks.

(8) An easing of money market conditions that entailed a Federal

funds rate dropping appreciably below the 5 per cent discount rate for a

sustained period could well lead to significant declines in other market

rates, particularly if expectations of an accompanying discount rate cut

should become pervasive. The lower the Federal funds rate were to drop--

and particularly if it moved into the range of alternative C--the greater

would be the possibility of a large speculative build-up in bond positions,

especially during this forthcoming Treasury financing period. Such a

build-up would carry with it the potential for a sharp subsequent market

reversal or for the need to expand money and credit rapidly to forestall

such a reversal.



-10-

(9) The growth rate in M1 is expected to remain quite small

in October and November under all three alternatives considered here.

However, in the course of the ensuing several months money growth is expected

to pick up to a more normal rate in relation to projected GNP expansion.

The exact timing is particularly hard to predict, though, depending as it

does on when the public completes the readjustment of its cash position

following the very large, partly precautionary build-up of cash balances

in the spring and early summer. The timing and extent of this readjustment

is especially uncertain in light of the limited degree to which Phase II

has been spelled out thus far.

(10) Our best present estimate is that under the money market

conditions of alternative A, M1 will grow in the first quarter of next

year at a 4-1/2 per cent annual rate following the 2-1/2 per cent rate

indicated for the fourth quarter. Under the easing alternatives, money

growth would accelerate more as lower interest rates themselves tended to

increase the public's demand for cash. For alternative B, the annual rate of

money growth rises from 3 per cent in the fourth quarter to 6 per cent in the

first quarter,.andfor alternative C from a 4 per cent annual rate to a

7-1/2 per cent annual rate over the same period.

(11) The bank credit proxy in the fourth quarter is expected

to grow less rapidly than in the third quarter under any of the alternatives;

under alternative A, the growth rate is projected to drop below 5 per cent.

The slowing in growth reflects mainly a turn-around in the availability of



-11-

U.S. Government deposits to finance credit expansion; these deposits are

expected to decline irregularly in the fourth quarter following a sub-

stantial rise in the third. Growth in time deposits other than large

CD's is expected to remain moderate in the fourth quarter, with growth rates

somewhat larger under alternativesB and C as a result of the lower market

interest rates likely to develop.

(12) A fairly sizable expansion in bank CD's is anticipated

between now and year-end, although the growth rate is likely to be less

than the exceptional September pace. Somewhat stronger business loan

demands, assuming GNP growth as projected in the Greenbook, and a will-

ingness to acquire securities in anticipation of declining long-term

market interest rates are expected to encourage banks to issue CD's.

It is likely, though, that banks will lower CD offering rates if short-

term market rates decline, but not so rapidly as to forestall a somewhat

greater increase in CD's in November under alternatives B and C than

under alternative A, with the additional funds used to build up positions

in securities.



-12-

Possible directive language

(13) This section presents possible language for the second

paragraph of the directive for the three alternative policy courses

discussed above. All three alternatives include a qualifying instruc-

tion to the Manager to take account of the forthcoming Treasury refund-

ing, the terms of which are expected to be announced on October 27, as

noted in paragraph (7). In addition, in all three alternatives it is

proposed to delete the instruction to take account of developments in

capital markets, given the recent strengthening of those markets.

Finally, in alternatives B and C--in which the primary instruction is

oriented toward the monetary and credit aggregates rather than money

market conditions--the objective is described in terms of growth "over

the months ahead." Restoration of tnat phrase is suggested on the

assumption that, after focusing on the near-term at its September meeting,

the Committee will now wish to return to its more customary time-horizon

for policy.

(14) Alternative A. This language is proposed for possible

use if the Committee decides to call for maintenance of prevailing money

market conditions, subject to a proviso clause.

"To implement this policy, [DEL: the Committee seeks to achieve

moderate growth in monetary and credit aggregates, taking account

of developments in capital markets.] System open market operations

until the next meeting of the Committee shall be conducted with a

view to [DEL: achieving bank reserves and] MAINTAINING ABOUT THE PREVAILING

money market conditions; [DEL: consistent with that objective] PROVIDED



-13-

THAT SOMEWHAT EASIER CONDITIONS SHALL BE SOUGHT, TAKING ACOUNT

OF THE FORTHCOMING TREASURY FINANCING, IF IT APPEARS THAT THE

MONETARY AND CREDIT AGGREGATES ARE FALLING SIGNIFICANTLY BELOW

THE GROWTH PATHS EXPECTED."

If the Committee adopts this alternative, it may wish to consider the

money market conditions noted for alternative A in paragraph (5) as

a description of "prevailing conditions", and for purposes of the pro-

viso clause to adopt the aggregate growth paths discussed earlier in

connection with alternative A as the "expected" paths. The proviso

clause has been formulated in one-way terms, guarding against signif-

icant shortfalls but not excesses, on the assumption that the Committee

would not want money market conditions to be tightened in the coming

period if M1 and M2 should appear to be expanding on paths above those

projected, which represent comparatively low growth rates for the

fourth quarter.

(15) Alternative B. This language is proposed for possible

use if the Committee decides to seek the growth rates for the aggregates

over the months ahead discussed earlier in connection with alternative B,

including a fourth-quarter rate for M1 of 3 per cent and moving up to a

6 per cent path in the first quarter.

"To implement this policy, the Committee seeks to achieve

moderate growth in monetary and credit aggregates [DEL: , taking account

of developments in capital markets] OVER THE MONTHS AHEAD. System

open market operations until the next meeting of the Committee

shall be conducted with a view to achieving bank reserve and



-14-

money market conditions consistent with that objective, TAKING

ACCOUNT OF THE FORTHCOMING TREASURY FINANCING."

(16) Alternative C. This language differs from that of

alternative B in indicating that the Committee seeks "actively to

promote" rather than "to achieve" moderate growth in the aggregates

over the months ahead. It is proposed for possible use if the

Committee decides to pursue the more aggressive course contemplated

by the specifications given earlier for alternative C.

"To implement this policy, the Committee seeks ACTIVELY

to PROMOTE [DEL: achieve] moderate growth in monetary and credit

aggregates [DEL: , taking account of developments in capital markets]

OVER THE MONTHS AHEAD. System open market operations until

the next meeting of the Committee shall be conducted with a

view to achieving bank reserve and money market conditions

consistent with that objective, TAKING ACCOUNT OF THE FORTH-

COMING TREASURY FINANCING."
