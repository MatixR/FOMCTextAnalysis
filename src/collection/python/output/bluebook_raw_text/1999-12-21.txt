Prefatory Note 

 
 

The attached document represents the most complete and accurate version 
available based on original copies culled from the files of the FOMC Secretariat at the 
Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System.  This electronic document was 
created through a comprehensive digitization process which included identifying the best-
preserved paper copies, scanning those copies,1 and then making the scanned versions 
text-searchable.2  Though a stringent quality assurance process was employed, some 
imperfections may remain. 
 

Please note that this document may contain occasional gaps in the text.  These 
gaps are the result of a redaction process that removed information obtained on a 
confidential basis.  All redacted passages are exempt from disclosure under applicable 
provisions of the Freedom of Information Act.    

 

                                                 
1 In some cases, original copies needed to be photocopied before being scanned into electronic format.  All 
scanned images were deskewed (to remove the effects of printer- and scanner-introduced tilting) and lightly 
cleaned (to remove dark spots caused by staple holes, hole punches, and other blemishes caused after initial 
printing). 
2 A two-step process was used.  An advanced optimal character recognition computer program (OCR) first 
created electronic text from the document image.  Where the OCR results were inconclusive, staff checked 
and corrected the text as necessary.   Please note that the numbers and text in charts and tables were not

STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL (FR) CLASS II FOMC

MONETARY POLICY ALTERNATIVES

PREPARED FOR THE FEDERAL OPEN MARKET COMMITTEE

BY THE STAFF OF THE BOARD OF GOVERNORS OF THE FEDERAL RESERVE SYSTEM



Strictly Confidential (F.R.) December 17, 1999
Class I -- FOMC

MONETARY POLICY ALTERNATIVES

Recent Developments

(1) The announcement that the FOMC increased its target federal funds rate to

5-1/2 percent was partly anticipated and as a consequence prompted only a modest initial

backup in interest rates. 1 However, the concern expressed in the announcement about the

inflationary implications of unsustainably rapid economic growth may have heightened

reactions to subsequent economic news pointing to persistent strength in aggregate demand.

While favorable information on costs and prices helped to damp the overall rise in yields,

economic releases were apparently read on balance as boosting the odds of additional

tightening actions in the coming year. Futures market quotes now suggest that market

participants attach a high probability to a quarter-point tightening at next February's meeting

and additional subsequent firmings of about another half point by next fall. On net,

Treasury coupon yields rose about 35 basis points over the intermeeting period. Yields on

investment-grade corporate bonds moved up a bit less, and those on junk bonds were about

unchanged, and risk spreads on junk bonds remain 1 percentage point wider than they were

in the first half of 1998. Most broad stock market indexes finished the period up about 2 to

4-1/2 percent, with much of the gains accounted for by technology companies.

1 The federal funds rate averaged close to 5-1/2 percent over the intermeeting period.
Largely reflecting the steep rise in vault cash at depositories preparing to meet year-end cash
demands, required operating balances (required reserve balances plus required clearing
balances) dropped to very low levels. However, neither the demand for excess reserves nor
the daily volatility of the federal funds rate seems to have been much affected.

(2) Participants seemed to become somewhat less worried over the intermeeting

period that the century date change will lead to much greater and longer lasting illiquidity in

financial markets than associated with a typical year-end. Contrary to earlier expectations,

markets generally remained quite receptive to new financing through the first week or so of

December: Issuance of commercial paper and corporate bonds was brisk, and initial public

offerings of equity surged. It has only been in the last few days that volume in corporate

bond markets has shown signs of tailing off seasonally; in the commercial paper market,

however, liquidity has eroded noticeably and spreads are widening. In the Treasury market,

bid-asked spreads were little changed over the intermeeting period, and the decline in trading

volumes was normal for this time of year. Premiums embedded in funding contracts with

maturities crossing over the year-end generally were little changed over the intermeeting

period and are well below the peaks recorded in October of this year, though they remain

elevated relative to past year-ends. Such elevated premiums mostly seem to reflect

borrowers' intense desire to lock in funding over the turn combined with lenders' reluctance

to expand their balance sheets; the December federal funds futures contract suggests, if

anything, that investors may be expecting funds to trade somewhat below target at year-end.

The cumulative increase in the volume of options on repurchase agreements auctioned by

the Desk seemed ultimately to sate dealer and customer demands. Propositions at the three

auctions since the November FOMC meeting dropped off considerably, on balance, and

despite the lower quantities of options awarded at these auctions, the premiums generally



edged lower.2 In other actions aimed at mitigating year-end pressures, the Desk this week

arranged two forward RP transactions totaling $6 billion that settle on December 30 and

December 31 and mature on January 3 and January 4; it has also arranged a considerable

volume of longer-term RPs stretching into the new year. To date, Desk operations have put

in place $60.4 billion of System RPs over the year-end.

(3) The rise in long-term interest rates in the United States over the intermeeting

period about matched that in most industrial countries with the exception of Japan, but the

foreign exchange value of the dollar still appreciated about 3/4 percent against a basket of

major currencies. The strength in the dollar, though, was not uniform: The dollar

appreciated 2-1/4 percent against the euro and depreciated 1-1/2 percent against the yen.

The weakness of the euro, which moved close to parity with the dollar, is somewhat puzzling

in that incoming data generally supported the notion that economic expansion in Europe was

well in train. Market participants did evince concerns about the attractiveness of the business

environment in Europe after the German and French governments intervened to block a few

corporate restructurings; nonetheless, European equity prices rose strongly over the

2 Options outstanding now total $114 billion in the week of December 23, $223 billion in the
week of December 30, and $144 billion in the week of January 6. Not surprisingly, with
federal funds trading close to the target over the intermeeting period, borrowing from the
Special Liquidity Facility was generally light, apart from one sizable overnight borrowing
amid tight settlement day conditions in the reserve market on December 15. Depositories
continued to pledge additional quantities of collateral at the discount window to be prepared
for potential borrowing over the turn. On December 6, the President signed into law an
amendment to the Federal Reserve Act that allows all discount window loans to serve as
collateral backing for Federal Reserve notes. The change removes an impediment the
Federal Reserve might otherwise have faced in implementing appropriate open market
operations in the event of a surge in discount window borrowing over the year-end.

intermeeting period. In emerging market economies, yield spreads narrowed, on balance, to

the lowest levels seen since the market turmoil of the autumn of 1998, and equity prices for

the most part registered sizable gains.

. U.S. monetary

authorities did not intervene during the period.

(4) The growth of M2 in November, at 5-1/2 percent, remained moderate, with

higher opportunity costs evidently tending to offset some of the impetus to money demand

from stronger spending in the second half of the year. Among the components of M2,

currency growth, which has been brisk for some time, strengthened further last month.

Some portion of the recent runup in currency could mark a pickup in Y2K-related demands,

but strong holiday spending also may have played a role. In contrast to M2, M3 growth

surged last month with the institution-only money fund and large time deposit components

of M3 running especially strongly. The pickup in the expansion of institution-only money

funds is consistent with reports that firms may be consolidating liquid assets in professionally

managed funds in advance of the year-end. Rapid growth in large time deposits at domestic

banks seems to have been driven by the need to fund sizable increases in bank credit and

vault cash. Moreover, the Treasury ran down its deposits in November, probably leading

some domestic banks to ratchet up their issuance of large time deposits. U.S. branches and

agencies of foreign banks apparently relied increasingly on large time deposits to fund their

head offices and build up liquid assets in advance of the century date change and to finance

loan growth. Recent informal contacts with several foreign branches suggested that their



-5-

head offices have found U.S. markets to be a relatively attractive source of funds and have

chosen to issue large time deposits in the United States as one of their preferred vehicles for

securing over-the-turn funding for the global organization. Growth of M2 and M3 from the

fourth quarter of 1998 to the fourth quarter of this year, at 6 percent and 7-1/2 percent,

respectively, exceeded the annual ranges of 1 to 5 percent and 2 to 6 percent, respectively,

for these aggregates.3

(5) The expansion of the debt of domestic nonfinancial sectors has slowed a little

in recent months, mostly reflecting a steeper paydown in federal debt. Only a slight decline

in federal debt is expected in this month as the Treasury seeks to build an elevated cash

balance at year-end. Business borrowing has remained brisk, both in capital markets and at

banks. Data on household borrowing, while limited for recent months, point to continued

solid expansion in the fourth quarter. From the fourth quarter of 1998 to the fourth quarter

of 1999, total domestic nonfinancial debt is estimated to have grown 6-1/2 percent, about

the same as last year and toward the upper end of the 3 to 7 percent range, implying that

debt velocity fell about 1 percent over the same period.

3. A Greenbook appendix provides further discussion of money and credit growth over
the year.

Policy Alternatives

(6) Reflecting robust incoming data on spending and further gains in stock prices

over the intermeeting period, the staff has again revised up its assessment of aggregate

demand over the next two years. In view of this strength, the staff sees the need for a

steeper trajectory of monetary policy tightening than in the previous Greenbook to produce

the financial conditions necessary to limit further tightening in labor markets. The funds

rate target is assumed to rise to 6-1/4 percent by late next year, contributing to some further

increase in longer-term interest rates. The upward movement in rates and disappointing

news on corporate earnings are expected to hold equity prices near their current levels on

average over the forecast period. Output growth is projected to slow slightly from this

year's pace, keeping the unemployment rate near 4 percent in 2000 and 2001. In these

circumstances, inflation in the core consumer price index is projected to pick up next year

and still further in 2001, reaching 2-3/4 percent in the latter year; overall consumer price

inflation runs in the 2-1/4 to 2-1/2 percent range over the next two years, restrained by

anticipated declines in energy prices.

(7) Given the circumstances of the looming century date change, the economic

outlook might not weigh as significantly in the Committee's consideration of its action at

this meeting as is usual. The Committee might see the heightened potential for financial

dislocation at this time as sufficient reason to keep policy on hold at this meeting, choosing

alternative B. Although financial markets have been much more liquid in recent weeks

than many participants had anticipated earlier in the year, various indicators still suggest that



-8-

trading is likely to be thin and investors unusually risk averse around year-end. Market

participants have apparently interpreted Federal Reserve actions to deal with potential

liquidity problems around the century date change, along with the adoption of a symmetric

directive at the last meeting, as virtually ensuring that the intended federal funds rate would

be left unchanged this month. With this prevailing expectation, a monetary tightening

would prompt substantial adjustments in portfolios. The extent of the resulting drop in

market prices could well be exacerbated by the thinness of markets and by the urgency that

market participants are likely to feel to complete their adjustments quickly before market

liquidity erodes further. Under the circumstances, the Committee may not want to incur

even the small risk of a potentially costly market disruption that might follow a policy

tightening, especially when any increase in inflation pressures resulting from a short delay

would be quite limited. Overall consumer price inflation is expected to moderate a little,

which should help damp inflation expectations, and most of the restraining effects of a

near-term policy firming are already built into financial market prices.

(8) Even abstracting from century date change considerations, the Committee

might not be persuaded that policy does in fact need to tighten over the next few months.

Incoming data over the intermeeting period have suggested that cost pressures and price

increases have remained subdued despite strong economic growth, perhaps because

productivity gains have been still greater than expected. This combination could be viewed

as suggesting that the economy can run with unusually taut labor markets for some time

longer before underlying inflation pressures intensify. On the demand side, the Committee



-9-

may feel that the 75 basis points of tightening implemented to date may result in more

restraint on demand than in the staff forecast. Premature or unnecessary tightening would

tend to hold gains in output and employment over the intermediate term below the

economy's full potential. In light of uncertainties on both the supply and demand sides of

the economy, the Committee might see considerable benefits in awaiting more data with

which to evaluate underlying trends.

(9) If the Committee believes that there is a reasonable possibility that

macroeconomic fundamentals could be balanced enough to make tightening unnecessary

within the next few months, it should choose a symmetric directive. 4 Such a directive,

accompanied by an announcement that emphasized that inflation could remain subdued

despite the strength of the demand, would cause market participants to take out much of

the tightening of monetary policy during the early part of 2000 that is currently built into

financial quotations. Although the thinness in markets in advance of year-end makes

reactions difficult to gauge, interest rates could drop appreciably, especially at intermediate

maturities, as those expectations were unwound, and equity markets would rally further.

The value of the dollar on foreign exchange markets could edge lower. However, these

market responses may be damped if the announcement were only perfunctory--that is, not

accompanied by any explanation--leaving open the possibility that the symmetry was

4. The discussion in this bluebook assumes that at this meeting the Committee will retain
the current treatment of the tilt in the directive rather than implementing new tilt language
and disclosure policy.



-10-

motivated by concerns about the century date change rather than a sense that policy was in

fact equally likely to tighten or to ease in coming months.

(10) If, in contrast, the Committee were concerned about mounting inflation

pressures and, as a consequence, saw reasonably high odds that it might tighten in the next

few months, it might want to convey a sense of these odds to market participants so that

the possibility of firming would remain built into the structure of market interest rates.

However, the Committee's desire at the same time not to add to market uncertainty and

volatility around the century date change may raise the issue of how best to impart its

assessment of the risks. Announcement of a shift from the existing symmetric directive to a

directive tilted toward tightening would most readily communicate concerns about incipient

price pressures and the likelihood of action in February. Although the wording of the

announcement could effectively rule out a firming in the weeks surrounding the century date

change, a drawback of this approach is that the asymmetry might be highlighted in press

accounts, running some risk of unsettling markets when they are vulnerable to dislocation.

Even more assurance to market participants that an intermeeting tightening was not

imminent might be provided by adopting a symmetric directive, while using the

announcement to give the Committee's sense of a risk of heightened inflation pressures

going forward; such assurance would be bought at the expense of possibly adding to

confusion in markets about the Committee's use of biases and their meaning. Many market

participants expect adoption of an asymmetric directive, and the structure of interest rates

already appears to embody at least 75 percent odds of a tightening in February. As a



-11-

consequence, while rates might firm a little as a tightening in February came to be perceived

as more assured under either variant, any increase would likely be small.

(11) As noted, considerations relating to the century date change would seem to

militate against tightening at this meeting. Nonetheless, the Committee might wish to

contemplate the 25 basis point tightening of policy at this meeting under alternative C--

perhaps as background for selection of an asymmetric directive or even for consideration of

an intermeeting move once risks associated with the century date change have faded. In the

staff forecast, core inflation picks up--and is poised to move higher beyond the projection

horizon--even with 75 basis points of further tightening and the more rapid rates of

productivity growth that the staff has built into the forecast over recent months. In effect,

faster productivity growth, other things equal, needs to be reflected at some point in higher

real interest rates to keep the influences of the associated boost to earnings--working on the

demands for capital goods and, through wealth, on consumption--from driving aggregate

demand further beyond aggregate supply. Still higher interest rates would be needed to

bring the levels of demand and supply into balance so as to forestall rising inflation. Indeed,

based on incoming spending data and the continued upward march of equity prices, the

Committee may see the risks to aggregate demand as having shifted further to the upside

over recent months, possibly requiring more restrictive financial conditions than assumed in

the staff forecast just to keep the output gap from widening. A firming action at this

meeting or in mid-January would be only a little prompter than in the staff forecast. But it is

likely to be associated with a sharper rise in market interest rates as market participants



-12-

inferred from the timing of the action that the Federal Reserve was much more concerned

about near-term inflation risks than they had perceived and was on a steeper tightening path

than now incorporated in the yield curve. As noted above, a tightening at this meeting

would pose some risk of prompting financial market disruptions.

(12) Assuming the selection of alternative B and no significantly untoward

developments over year-end, some further abatement of the unusual risk aversion and

demand for liquidity currently evident in markets should be apparent over the first few

weeks of 2000. Risks spreads could narrow somewhat, but they should remain wider, and

other credit terms tighter, than in the period before the market disruptions in the summer

and fall of 1998. Measured from October to March, domestic nonfinancial sector debt is

expected to expand at a 5-1/2 percent pace, roughly in line with nominal income, placing

this aggregate in March in the upper half of its 3 to 7 percent provisional range.

(13) After its Y2K-related runup late in the year, expansion of the monetary

aggregates is expected to moderate substantially over the first few months of the new year.

Currency growth should slow sharply. Similarly, the recent surge in large time deposits

should substantially unwind, as bank credit growth settles down from its Y2K-related bulge

and depository institutions return to more typical funding patterns. M2 also should

continue to respond to the earlier tightenings in the stance of monetary policy and the

associated widening in the opportunity cost of holding retail monetary assets. From

December to March, M2 and M3 are projected to grow at 4 and 3-3/4 percent annual rates,

respectively under alternative B. Measured over the October-to-March period to abstract



-13-

from most Y2K influences, M2 is forecast to expand at a 5-1/2 percent rate under that

alternative. This growth would leave this aggregate in March at the upper end of its

provisional 1 to 5 percent annual range. M3 is projected to expand at an 8-1/2 percent pace

over the same period, placing it in March somewhat above its provisional 2 to 6 percent

annual range.

Directive Language

(14) Presented below for the members' consideration is the operational paragraph

for the intermeeting period

OPERATIONAL PARAGRAPH

To promote the Committee's long-run objectives of price stability and

sustainable economic growth, the Committee in the immediate future seeks conditions in

reserve markets consistent with MAINTAINING/increasing/DECREASING the federal

funds rate AT/to an average of around ____ [DEL: 5-1/2] percent. In view of the evidence

currently available, the Committee believes that prospective developments are equally likely

to warrant an increase or a decrease [MORE LIKELY TO WARRANT AN INCREASE/A

DECREASE THAN A DECREASE/AN INCREASE] in the federal funds rate operating

objective during the intermeeting period.
