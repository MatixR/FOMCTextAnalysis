MONETARY POLICY ALTERNATIVES 

Recent Developments 

(1) Investors had largely anticipated the FOMC’s decision at the December 

meeting to raise the target federal funds rate 25 basis points, to 4¼ percent.1  

Although market participants had expected a change in the portions of the statement 

characterizing policy as accommodative, the complete removal of the reference 

pushed down expectations of the path of monetary policy from the middle of 2006 

onward.  These expectations dropped further in response to the publication of the 

minutes of the December meeting, readings on economic activity that were on the 

soft side of market forecasts, and benign inflation data.  In recent days, some of the 

drop in expectations has been rolled back, partly in response to stronger-than-

expected economic data releases and reports that the Committee was likely to firm 

policy in March.  Money market futures rates for the end of next year declined about 

10 basis points over the intermeeting period and imply the expectation of modest 

policy easing by then (Chart 1).  In contrast, near-term expectations of policy were 

unchanged over the intermeeting period.  Judging from futures quotes and responses 

to the Desk’s latest dealer survey, market participants are virtually certain of a 25 basis 

point hike in the federal funds target at the upcoming meeting and put roughly two-

thirds odds on a similar increase at the March meeting.  Against the backdrop of the 

                                           
1 Over most of the intermeeting period, the effective federal funds rate held close to the new 
target.  Late in the period, however, the funds rate traded on the firm side despite the sizable 
provision of reserves by the Desk, as reserve managers at banks once again shifted their 
demand earlier in the maintenance period given the widespread anticipation of policy firming 
by the Committee.  The Desk purchased $3.3 billion of Treasury coupon securities in the 
market and $1.6 billion of Treasury bills from foreign customers.  It also redeemed 
$1.3 billion of Treasury coupon securities.  The volume of outstanding long-term RPs 
decreased $2 billion, to $18 billion.

growing belief that the tightening cycle is drawing to a close and that policy might 

ease soon thereafter, option-implied uncertainty about the path for policy edged a bit 

lower over the period. 

(2) Over the intermeeting period, yields on nominal Treasury coupon securities 

were little changed to down slightly.  The declines occurred at longer maturities, 

serving to invert slightly the yield curve between one and five years and resulting in a 

20 basis point drop in the one-year forward rate ten years hence (see box entitled 

“The Flat Yield Curve, the Level of Short-Term Rates, and Growth Prospects”).  

Some of the fall at longer maturities may have reflected a further decline in term 

premiums, consistent with the edging lower of implied volatilities on options on 

Eurodollar futures.  After adjusting for carry effects, TIPS-based inflation 

compensation at maturities of five and ten years was about unchanged over the 

period, as the effects of the subdued inflation data were apparently offset by the step-

up in oil prices. 

(3) The rise in oil prices, along with weaker-than-expected earnings reports and 

downbeat guidance from corporations about future earnings, weighed on equities, and 

broad stock price indexes rose slightly on balance (Chart 2).  Implied volatilities on 

major equity indexes increased notably, albeit to levels that are still low by historical 

standards.  Nonetheless, staff estimates of the equity premium moved sideways.  The 

credit quality of nonfinancial firms generally remained solid.  While the six-month 

trailing bond default rate has been boosted by the bankruptcy filings of a few large 

firms that had long been recognized as being in weak financial condition, forward-

looking measures of default risk stayed low.  Yields on investment- and speculative-

grade corporate debt moved about in line with those on comparable Treasury 

securities, leaving risk spreads about unchanged.

(4) The dollar’s foreign exchange value against other major currencies dropped 

about 1¾ percent on balance over the intermeeting period (Chart 3).  Downward 

pressure on the dollar was prompted in part by softer-than-expected U.S. economic 

data early in the period and the slight decline in U.S. long-term interest rates.  The 

The Flat Yield Curve, the Level of Short-Term Rates, and Growth Prospects 
 
The Treasury yield curve flattened further over the intermeeting period and is now 
slightly inverted between about one and five years.  Some commentators have pointed 
to the tendency of the yield curve to invert before business cycle peaks to argue that 
the current term structure could be a harbinger of a pronounced slowdown in growth 
or even a recession.  Historically, flat or inverted yield curves owing to unusually high 
short-term interest rates have tended to be followed by slowdowns, but at present  
short-term rates are not unusually high.  An econometric model estimated with data 
over the past forty-five years, using the level of the federal funds rate as well as the 
ten-year over three-month term spread, has substantially better predictive power for 
recessions than an alternative model based on the term spread alone.  The chart 
below shows the probability of a recession at any time in the next four quarters 
implied by this econometric model.  As can be seen, the odds of a recession in the 
next year implied by the model remain low.  In that regard, it is worth noting that 
yield curves in Australia and the United Kingdom have been inverted for some time, 
and their economies have continued to expand robustly.

dollar fell nearly 3¼ percent against the yen, as readings on the Japanese economy 

continued to confirm solid growth.  Remarks by ECB officials suggesting that more 

tightening will be needed to combat inflation helped drive the dollar about 

2½ percent lower versus the euro.  In contrast, the dollar posted only a slight loss 

against the Canadian dollar; the Bank of Canada raised its policy rate 25 basis points 

during the intermeeting period.  Yields on long-term government securities were up 

slightly on net in most foreign industrial countries.  On balance, most foreign stock 

markets rose modestly.  Japanese markets had outperformed until mid-January, when 

news of a corporate accounting scandal and concerns about softer earnings in the 

global high-tech sector caused a brief selling binge.  The downdraft left Japanese stock 

prices close to unchanged on balance. 

(5) The dollar fell about 1¾ percent over the intermeeting period against an 

index of currencies of our other important trading partners.  The drop included 3 to 

5 percent declines against the currencies of Korea, Singapore, Thailand, and Taiwan 

amid perceptions that the region’s growth prospects were continuing to improve.  

 

.2  Signs of greater flexibility in 

Chinese foreign exchange markets, including the start early this month of over-the-

counter trading of the renminbi, as well as the strengthening of the yen, may have 

added to the upward pressure on other Asian currencies.  Most stock markets in the 

region recorded solid increases over the period, but they were rattled—particularly in 

Korea—by the events shaking the Tokyo market.  Equity prices recorded quite strong 

increases in Latin America as well, where financial conditions for major U.S. trading 

partners continued to be favorable, and the Brazilian central bank cut its policy rate 

75 basis points in mid-January.  Both Brazil and Argentina surprised financial markets

by announcing repayment of all their remaining obligations to the International 

Monetary Fund.   

(6) Domestic nonfinancial sector debt is estimated to have grown at an annual 

rate of 7¾ percent in the fourth quarter, down from the rapid 9 percent pace seen in 

the third quarter (Chart 4).  Household debt growth appears to have moderated, given 

hints of a downshift in mortgage borrowing from its robust third-quarter pace and an 

outright decline in consumer credit in October and November.  Consumer credit was 

likely set back in part by increased charge-offs following October’s spike in 

bankruptcy filings.  Filings since then have remained quite low.  Business sector debt 

slowed somewhat in the fourth quarter, mainly reflecting a run-off of commercial 

paper by multinational firms that were reported to have repatriated foreign earnings.  

At the same time, firms raised a moderate amount of funds in the bond market, and 

business lending at commercial banks continued to be vigorous.  The January Senior 

Loan Officer Opinion Survey confirmed that demand for C&I loans strengthened in 

the fourth quarter and indicated some further easing of lending standards and terms 

for those loans.  Surveyed banks, however, reported somewhat weaker demand for 

household loans.  Federal debt is estimated to have grown at a 7¾ percent annual rate 

in the fourth quarter.  The Treasury recently stated publicly that its debt will likely hit 

the current statutory limit in mid-February (see box entitled “Treasury Debt Subject 

to Limit”). 

(7) M2 growth rose to 5 percent at an annual rate in December, bringing 

fourth-quarter growth to 5¼ percent.3  That monetary aggregate appears to be 

accelerating to an 8 percent rate in January.  The December increase in M2 was driven 

mainly by the expansion of liquid deposits, with about half of the increase in that 

component estimated to reflect continued effects of Hurricane Katrina.  Stronger 

foreign demand for dollars apparently boosted currency growth, and the expansion of 

                                           
3 These data incorporate the results of the annual seasonal factor review.

retail money market funds and small time deposits remained robust.  On the eve of 

tomorrow’s NIPA release, the expansion of M2 in the fourth quarter nearly matches 

the staff estimate of nominal GDP growth despite the rise in opportunity costs. 

Treasury Debt Subject to Limit 
 
 According to staff estimates, on or around February 16, 2006, the Treasury will 
likely reach the statutory ceiling of $8,184 billion on the public debt in the absence of 
Congressional action to lift the limit.  As has been the case in previous episodes, the 
Treasury probably would use extraordinary accounting devices to avoid breaching the 
limit.  The Treasury would first likely begin to underinvest the Government Securities 
Investment Fund (the so-called G-fund, which is part of the federal employees’ thrift 
savings plan) and tap the Exchange Stabilization Fund and possibly the Civil Service 
Retirement and Disability Fund.  Two of the previously used accounting devices, 
however, are no longer available:  Debt of the Federal Financing Bank, which is not 
subject to the limit, was swapped with other Treasury debt to avoid the last debt limit 
crisis, and the Treasury eliminated its holdings of compensating balances at depository 
institutions.  While the room afforded by the available accounting devices depends on 
the duration of the debt limit emergency period declared by the Secretary of the 
Treasury, staff estimates suggest that the Treasury will be able to maintain normal 
cash and debt management practices through the end of March—but not much 
longer—without Congress raising the limit.  
 

 

Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) Page 10 of 42



Economic Outlook 

(8) The economic outlook has changed little since the December Greenbook.  

The staff responded to the news over the intermeeting period—including weaker-

than-expected exports, federal spending, and inventory investment—by marking 

down real GDP growth in the fourth quarter, but that revision is expected to be 

largely reversed by faster growth over the first half of this year.  Inflationary pressures 

are seen as a tad more intense in the near term, and the staff now assumes that the 

federal funds rate will rise to 4¾ percent this spring and edge back to 4½ percent only 

after mid-year 2007.  Longer-term interest rates are projected to remain around their 

current low levels, the stock market is, as usual, expected to generate a risk-adjusted 

yield similar to those on fixed-income investments, and house prices are anticipated to 

decelerate sharply.  The foreign exchange value of the dollar is assumed to extend its 

recent declines by depreciating at a gradual pace over the rest of this year and next.  

Guided by quotes from futures markets, the staff assumes that spot oil prices will 

remain close to their present elevated levels over the forecast interval.  Given these 

underlying conditions, real GDP is expected to expand 3¾ percent this year, boosted 

by hurricane-related spending, before moderating to a 3 percent pace in 2007―slightly 

below the growth rate of potential output.  Over the forecast period, the 

unemployment rate hovers around the estimated NAIRU of 5 percent.  Total and 

core PCE inflation are both about 2¼ percent this year, a touch higher than in the last 

forecast owing largely to the pass-through of higher energy and core import prices.  

As those effects diminish, both inflation measures drop back to 1¾ percent in 2007. 

Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) Page 11 of 42



Longer-Run Scenarios 

(9) Longer-run aspects of monetary policy choice—including the selection of 

an inflation objective—can be informed by simulations of the FRB/US model.  The 

model was first used (with judgmental adjustments) to extend the staff’s forecast for a 

decade beyond the Greenbook horizon.  In that extension, the natural rate of 

unemployment is assumed to hold steady at 5 percent, while labor force growth slows 

markedly because of demographic factors, and the pace of structural labor 

productivity growth declines gradually towards its long-run historical average.  As a 

result, potential output growth slows to just above 2¼ percent by 2015, nearly a 

percentage point lower than the rate projected for the current year.  As for aggregate 

demand, the personal saving rate rises gradually while the unified federal budget 

deficit is projected to widen from about 2¾ percent of GDP this year to slightly more 

than 3¼ percent of GDP in 2015.  The foreign exchange value of the dollar is 

assumed to decline in real terms at an annual rate of 5 percent from 2008 onward, 

which helps to keep the current account deficit within a range of about 6½ to 

8 percent of GDP through 2015.   

(10) The first set of simulations depicts optimal policy paths conditional on a 

long-term inflation objective of either 1½ or 2 percent (expressed in terms of core 

PCE inflation).  In each simulation, policymakers are assumed to assign equal priority 

to minimizing deviations in inflation from the long-run objective, deviations in the 

unemployment rate from its natural rate, and changes in the federal funds rate, subject 

to the constraint that inflation settles down to its long-run objective over the next 

seven years.4  The optimal path of the funds rate is conditioned on the structure of 

                                           
4 More precisely, the federal funds rate path is chosen to minimize the equally weighted sum 
of three components—the squared deviations of core PCE inflation from its target, the 
squared deviations of the unemployment rate from its natural rate, and squared changes in 
the federal funds rate—subject to the constraint that core PCE inflation must be close to its 
target by 2012 and remain on target thereafter.  It should be noted that the latter constraint 

Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) Page 12 of 42



the macroeconomy as captured in the FRB/US model as well as on the longer-term 

outlook embedded in the extended Greenbook baseline.  Participants in financial 

markets—including those in the equity, bond, and foreign exchange markets—are 

assumed to understand fully the economy and the policy formulation process, 

whereas households and firms are assumed to form their expectations using more 

limited information.5     

(11) In each panel of Chart 5, the solid line depicts the scenario in which the 

optimal path of policy is directed toward an inflation objective of 1½ percent.  In this 

case, the nominal federal funds rate rises a bit above 5 percent by late 2006 and then 

declines gradually to just below 4 percent by 2012.  With this backdrop of moderately 

tight financial conditions, the unemployment rate rises gradually to about 5½ percent 

at the end of 2007 before returning to its natural rate over the following five years.  

This economic slack helps to ensure that this year’s projected pickup in core PCE 

inflation is only transitory.  The adjustment of inflation is restrained somewhat by 

long-term inflation expectations of households and firms (not shown), which are 

currently estimated at about 2 percent and lag a bit behind actual inflation in 

converging to the long-run objective.6  The dashed line in each panel corresponds to 

the optimal policy scenario with a long-run inflation objective of 2 percent.  In this 

case, the funds rate remains at about 4¼ percent through mid-2007 and then gradually 

rises to about 4¾ percent in subsequent years to check the inflationary effects of 

faster dollar depreciation.  With the funds rate essentially on hold for an extended 

period, some of this year’s projected rise in core PCE inflation becomes permanent.  
                                                                                                                                        
was not imposed in constructing the longer-run scenarios considered in prior Bluebooks 
(most recently in June 2005). 
5 In these simulations, it is assumed that monetary policy has achieved a degree of credibility  
that causes the adjustment of long-run inflation expectations to be somewhat more rapid 
than the average pace over the past several decades. 
6 The FRB/US estimate of long-run inflation expectations is constructed by adjusting  
the readings of the Philadelphia Fed survey of professional forecasters to account for  
the average difference between CPI and PCE inflation.

Inflation rises a bit further after 2007 and settles in around 2 percent by the end of the 

decade.  Because the realized path of inflation is fairly close to the long-run inflation 

expectations that households and firms currently hold, this scenario does not involve 

sizable resource slack. 

(12) The second set of simulations examines the range of inflation outcomes that 

might occur over the next seven years under the two alternative long-run inflation 

objectives.  These simulations were performed using the standard version of the 

FRB/US model, starting from each optimal policy scenario described above and 

assuming that the U.S. economy is subject to the same distribution of exogenous 

shocks seen over the past two decades (roughly corresponding to the “Great 

Moderation” period).7  The upper panel of Chart 6 depicts the 70 percent confidence 

interval around the baseline core PCE inflation projection under each long-run 

objective, while the lower panel depicts the corresponding 90 percent confidence 

intervals.  The distributions of inflation outcomes under the alternative objectives are 

fairly similar over the period covered by the Greenbook but become more distinct in 

subsequent years.  As indicated by the horizontally hatched region in each panel, the 

long-run objective of 1½ percent implies that nearly two-thirds of the inflation 

outcomes from 2008 to 2012 fall in the range of 1 to 2 percent.  In contrast, with a 

long-run objective of 2 percent, the lower panel indicates that nearly 90 percent of the 

inflation outcomes fall in the interval from 1 to 3 percent. 

                                           
7 Specifically, the exogenous shocks are drawn from the estimated FRB/US residuals over 
the period 1987Q1 through 2004Q4.  Because stochastic simulations with fully optimal 
policy are not computationally feasible if investor expectations are fully model consistent, 
these simulations have been conducted using the standard version of the model in which all 
expectations are based on more limited information.  The policy response to exogenous 
shocks is determined by the version of Taylor’s rule with coefficients of 1.0 on the output 
gap and 0.5 on the inflation gap.

Short-Run Policy Alternatives 

(13) This Bluebook discusses three short-run policy alternatives that are 

presented in Table 1.  The target funds rate would be raised 25 basis points under 

Alternatives B and C but left unchanged under Alternative A.  Alternative C retains 

risk assessment language identical to that used in the December statement on the 

notion that this will convey to markets a high likelihood of further firming in March.  

The assessment of risks under both Alternatives A and B is intended to soften that 

sense by suggesting that policy is likely—but not certain—to tighten in the future.  

Because the slowing in economic growth in the fourth quarter owed importantly to 

swings in federal spending and exports that are thought to be temporary, the 

description of the economy in the sentence in row 2 of the table begins with 

“Smoothing through near-term volatility in spending and production” rather than 

“Despite elevated energy prices and hurricane-related disruptions” for each 

alternative.  The sentence then continues by reiterating that “the expansion in 

economic activity appears solid.”  

(14) If the Committee believes that a 25 basis point tightening at this meeting 

may be sufficient, at least for a time, to keep both inflation and inflation expectations 

contained in the face of increased energy prices and diminishing resource slack, it may 

prefer Alternative B.  While the staff has penciled in an assumed additional 

tightening after this meeting, it also assumes that the move will be reversed next year.  

The Committee might believe that the relatively benign macroeconomic outcomes of 

the Greenbook could be achieved by validating current market expectations of both a 

¼ percentage point firming on Tuesday and two-thirds odds on a like-sized move in 

March.  As shown in Chart 7, this policy move would place the real funds rate about 

at the center of the range of staff estimates of its equilibrium value.  While the 

Greenbook projections for economic growth and inflation have been revised up for 

this year, the current level of the output gap is slightly wider owing to a greater-than-

Equilibrium Real Rate Chart: Explanatory Notes 
 

The equilibrium real rate is the real federal funds rate that, if maintained, would be projected to return 
output to its potential level over time.  For the first three measures listed below, the short-run 
equilibrium rate is defined as the rate that would close the output gap in twelve quarters given the 
corresponding model’s projection of the economy.  For the first two measures, the medium-run concept 
is the value of the real funds rate projected to keep output at potential in seven years under the 
assumption that monetary policy acts to bring actual and potential output into line in the short run and 
then keep them equal thereafter.  The TIPS-based factor model measure provides an estimate of market 
expectations for the real federal funds rate seven years ahead.  The actual real federal funds rate shown 
in the chart employs the log difference of the core PCE price index over the previous four quarters as a 
proxy for expected inflation, with the staff projection used for the current quarter. 
   

Measure Description 

Single-equation 
Model  

The measure of the equilibrium real rate in the single-equation model is based on an 
estimated aggregate-demand relationship between the current value of the output gap and 
its lagged values as well as the lagged values of the real federal funds rate.  In light of this 
model’s simple structure, the short-run measure of the equilibrium real rate depends only 
on the recent position of output relative to potential, and the medium-run measure is 
virtually constant. 

Small Structural 
Model 

The small-scale model of the economy consists of equations for five variables: the output 
gap, the equity premium, the federal budget surplus, the trend growth rate of output, and 
the real bond yield.  Unlike the estimates from the single-equation model, values of the 
equilibrium real rate also depend directly on conditions associated with output growth, 
fiscal policy, and capital markets. 

Large Model 
(FRB/US) 

Estimates of the equilibrium real rate using FRB/US—the staff’s large-scale econometric 
model of the U.S. economy—depend on a very broad array of economic factors, some of 
which take the form of projected values of the model’s exogenous variables.  These 
projections make use of several simple forecasting rules which are appropriate for the 
three-year horizon relevant for the short-run concept but are less sensible over longer 
horizons.  Thus, we report only the short-run measure for the FRB/US model. 

Greenbook-
consistent  

Measures of the equilibrium real rate cannot be directly obtained from the Greenbook 
forecast, because the Greenbook is not based on a formal model.  Rather, we use the 
FRB/US model in conjunction with an extended version of the Greenbook forecast to 
derive a Greenbook-consistent measure.  FRB/US is first add-factored so that its 
simulation matches the extended Greenbook forecast, and then a second simulation is run 
off this baseline to determine the value of the real federal funds rate that closes the output 
gap.  The medium-run concept of the equilibrium real rate is not computed because it 
requires a relatively long extension of the Greenbook forecast. 

TIPS-based 
Factor Model 

Yields on TIPS (Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities) reflect investors’ expectations of 
the future path of real interest rates, but also include term and liquidity premiums.  The 
TIPS-based measure of the equilibrium real rate is constructed using the seven-year-ahead 
instantaneous real forward rate derived from TIPS yields as of the Bluebook publication 
date.  This forward rate is adjusted to remove estimates of the term and liquidity 
premiums based on a three-factor arbitrage-free term-structure model applied to TIPS 
yields, nominal yields, and inflation.  Because TIPS indexation is based on the total CPI, 
this measure is also adjusted for the medium-term difference—projected at 40 basis 
points—between total CPI inflation and core PCE inflation.

anticipated deceleration of production in the fourth quarter of last year.  In 

consequence, Committee members may view the need for further policy firming after 

this meeting to be about as they had expected in December.  Even if members are 

fairly confident that an additional firming step will be necessary at the March meeting, 

they may view this as an appropriate time to begin to wean market participants from 

explicit characterizations of future interest rate action in the statement as a matter of 

routine.  On that score, the attendant increase in expected interest rate volatility might 

be seen as engendering a more healthy respect for risk in financial markets. 

(15) Although the proposed wording for Alternative B suggests greater 

uncertainty about future policy moves, it continues to indicate that the risks are tilted 

toward the possibility of further policy firming.  It would state that “some further 

policy firming may well be needed” to keep risks in balance, replacing “is likely to” 

with “may well” in that phrase.  The proposed wording would also drop the word 

“measured,” as some may believe that the phrase may imply more than one future 

move.  The minutes of the December meeting likely helped prepare markets not to 

interpret the dropping of the word “measured” as a signal that the Committee 

expected to move policy in larger increments going forward.  If the Committee 

wanted to stress the role incoming data will play in its deliberations on further action, 

it may want to reverse the order of rows 4 and 5 and delete “In any event.”  The 

wording in Table 1 does not do so on the thought that the Committee would prefer 

to make relatively few changes to the statement at this time.  Some members may be 

uncomfortable with the language of Table 1 either because they believe that further 

firming will be unnecessary or that the Committee should get out of the business of 

signaling its policy intent.  In either case, it might be appropriate to strike row 4 and 

rely on a revised version of row 5 to underscore the uncertainties surrounding policy 

and the necessity of being responsive to economic data.  In particular, row 5 could 

Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) Page 21 of 42



read, “The Committee will respond to changes in economic prospects as needed to 

foster the attainment of sustainable economic growth and price stability.” 

(16) Futures markets and surveys suggest that investors are sure of a 25 basis 

point policy firming at this meeting and place greater than even odds on another such 

move in March.  Therefore, selection of this policy move coupled with the language 

of Alternative B likely would not result in substantial changes in financial market 

prices.  Short-term interest rates might edge lower and stocks could rally a bit as 

market participants strengthen their expectations that the tightening phase may be 

drawing to a close.  Offsetting this effect somewhat, implied volatilities on options on 

money market futures may step up as the Committee sends a less confident signal 

about its future action. 

(17) If the Committee believes that appreciable further policy firming will likely 

be needed to address upside risks to inflation―which include the potential pass-

through of higher prices of oil and other commodities and a lower foreign exchange 

value of the dollar―it may prefer to associate a ¼ percentage point increase in the 

target funds rate at this meeting with the language in Alternative C.  A firmer tone 

might also seem appropriate in light of the longer-run scenarios discussed earlier.  To 

achieve a 1½ percent objective for core PCE inflation, model-based optimal policy 

paths, along with several policy rules shown in Charts 8 and 9, point to a need to raise 

the funds rate above 4½ percent fairly soon.8  Even if a target funds rate above 

4½ percent needs to be reversed before too long, it might be required to offset near-

term pressures on inflation.  In addition, the moderation in spending growth in the 

staff forecast depends in part on some cooling of house price appreciation, which is 

not yet a foregone conclusion, and projecting a more restrictive stance of policy may 

be appropriate until such a trend is better established. 
                                           
8 Chart 8 presents two new estimated rules, along with confidence bands reflecting 
uncertainty about the policy path obtained from model-based simulations of future 
economic shocks and on options quotes, as discussed in the box.

New Analysis of Monetary Policy Rules 
 
This Bluebook introduces two new exhibits related to policy rules.  First, Chart 8 depicts the 
implications of estimated policy rules, together with information from futures and options 
prices.  In the top left panel, the dashed line denotes the path implied by a rule that relates 
the federal funds rate to its own lagged values, to the current four-quarter average core PCE 
inflation rate, and to the current and lagged output gap (known as an outcome-based rule 
because it relies on observed macroeconomic variables).  This empirical specification was 
chosen using a formal statistical procedure that balances simplicity of the specification with 
goodness-of-fit over the sample period 1988Q1 through 2005Q4.  Dynamic simulation of 
the FRB/US model was then used to determine the predicted funds rate path that this rule 
implies over the Greenbook horizon.1  
 
The chart also depicts the range of uncertainty for the outcome-based rule associated with 
the incidence of shocks that might occur over the forecast period.  For that purpose, 
stochastic simulations of the FRB/US model were performed using the estimated 
distribution of shocks over the post-1987 period to every equation of the model, except the 
policy rule.  The dark green region shows the 70 percent confidence interval while the light 
green region denotes the 90 percent confidence interval. 
 
The dotted line in the left panel portrays the path prescribed by a forecast-based rule, 
estimated using Greenbook forecasts for the two-quarter-ahead four-quarter-average core 
PCE inflation rate and the one-quarter-ahead and one-quarter lag of the output gap, along 
with two lags of the funds rate.  This specification was chosen by a procedure similar to that 
for the outcome-based rule.  Relative to the outcome-based rule, this rule prescribes a path 
that is tighter by about ¼ percentage point during 2006 and easier by a similar amount 
during 2007.2   
 
The right panel of Chart 8 provides information from futures and options markets.  
Expectations for the federal funds rate derived from quotes on federal funds and Eurodollar 
futures are shown as a dotted line in the right panel.  The expected funds rate has a mild 
humped shape over the next two years.  The confidence bands reflect uncertainty as 
computed from options prices.  Note that financial markets have built in somewhat less 
uncertainty than is suggested by the stochastic simulations of the outcome-based rule. 
 
Finally, Chart 9 reports on prescriptions from simple policy rules that have been included in  
Bluebooks since January 2004.  Using dynamic simulations of the FRB/US model, these rule 
prescriptions are now shown for the entire Greenbook horizon.  With an inflation objective 
of 1½ percent, the baseline and aggressive Taylor rules prescribe funds rate paths that are 
lower than the Greenbook assumption, whereas the first-difference rule implies a markedly 
tighter path during 2007.

2 Confidence intervals for this rule are not available.

lag structure for the policy rule.  The predicted values (the dashed line in the left panel) come from a 
dynamic simulation of this rule using the FRB/US model, with add-factors to match the Greenbook 
baseline.  The forecast-based rule differs from the outcome-based rule in that it also permits staff

(18) Under Alternative C, the wording proposed for the inflation outlook, line 3, 

would indicate slightly greater concern about the potential for “increases in resource 

utilization as well as energy and other cost pressures” to “boost underlying inflation.”  

The assessment of risks could be quite similar to that announced following the 

December meeting, including a statement that “some further measured policy firming 

is likely to be needed” to maintain balanced risks to price stability and sustainable 

growth.  Markets would probably see the language under Alternative C as indicating a 

greater probability of future policy tightening than they had expected.  Short- and 

intermediate-term interest rates would likely rise with the revisions to the market’s 

expected path for the funds rate.  The stock market might fall back a little, but longer-

term interest rates and the foreign exchange value of the dollar probably would not 

change much.  

(19) If members see sizable odds that the target funds rate has already been 

raised sufficiently to check inflationary pressures, the Committee would presumably 

choose to forego a policy move at this meeting, as in Alternative A.  With the real 

funds rate now well within the range of estimates of its equilibrium, it might be 

desirable to pause at this meeting before deciding whether to move to a position that 

could entail policy restraint.  Given the lags in the effects of policy changes on the 

economy and the already substantial cumulative increase in the target funds rate, the 

Committee may prefer to await further data to assess whether additional tightening 

steps would risk an undesirable overshooting.  Indeed, given the deceleration in 

economic activity in the fourth quarter and the depressed level of longer-term interest 

rates, members may believe that the staff forecast is too optimistic about the 

prospects for continued solid growth.  Moreover, the possibility that the saving rate 

might rise more rapidly toward historical norms, as discussed in an alternative 

simulation in the Greenbook, may be of sufficient concern to the Committee that it 

would require more evidence of inflationary pressures before firming policy further.  

Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) Page 27 of 42



In addition, if the Committee preferred that the core PCE inflation rate remain near 

2 percent, rather than drop back to 1½ percent, the long-run scenarios discussed 

earlier would suggest no need to raise the funds rate above 4¼ percent this year.  

(20) The proposed wording of inflation concerns for Alternative A, in row 3 of 

Table 1, is basically a reordering of the sentences employed in the last announcement.  

The phrase regarding elevated energy prices and resource utilization is placed first to 

leave readers with the sense that such concerns have been somewhat assuaged by 

recent readings on core inflation and inflation expectations.  Even if members believe 

that further tightening will likely be needed at some point, they may view those 

sentiments to be adequately communicated by the asymmetric risk assessment under 

Alterative A.  

(21) Markets would be very surprised if the Committee chose to keep the target 

funds rate unchanged at this meeting.  Short-term interest rates would likely fall by 

close to 25 basis points, although the expected funds rate path probably would not 

flatten out completely, as the statement would point to the possibility of additional 

tightening in the future.  Long-term interest rates should decline much less, in part 

because financial markets have built in an expectation that the ¼ percentage point 

move predicted for this meeting would be unwound in the second half of next year.  

However, with an unchanged policy stance at this meeting, stock prices could move 

higher and the dollar fall, at least temporarily.    

Money and Debt Forecasts 

(22)  Under the staff forecast, M2 is expected to expand about 5½ percent this 

year, about ½ percentage point slower than nominal GDP, owing to the lagged 

response of money demand to increases in opportunity costs.  M2 growth should be 

supported somewhat by the flat yield curve, which implies that the returns on M2 

instruments are more attractive than usual when compared with yields on notes and 

Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) Page 28 of 42



bonds.  As these interest rate effects subside in 2007, M2 is expected to expand 

5 percent, equal to the rate of growth of nominal GDP.  Domestic nonfinancial sector 

debt is anticipated to decelerate to a 7½ percent pace this year and 6½ percent in 

2007, largely because a projected sharp decline in house price appreciation holds 

down home mortgage borrowing.  Overall business borrowing is also expected to 

slow a bit, owing in part to a projected deceleration in commercial real estate prices.  

Federal debt is forecast to grow at an average 7½ percent pace over this year and 

next, while state and local borrowing throttles back with the completion of many 

advance refundings.

Directive and Balance-of-Risks Statement 

(23) Draft language for the directive and draft risk assessments identical to those 

presented in Table 1 are provided below. 

Directive Wording 

The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and financial 

conditions that will foster price stability and promote sustainable growth 

in output.  To further its long-run objectives, the Committee in the 

immediate future seeks conditions in reserve markets consistent with 

MAINTAINING/increasing/REDUCING the federal funds rate 

AT/to an average of around ____________ 4¼ percent.   

Risk Assessments  

A. or B.  The Committee judges that some further policy firming may 

well be needed to keep the risks to the attainment of both 

sustainable economic growth and price stability roughly in balance.  

In any event, the Committee will respond to changes in economic 

prospects as needed to foster these objectives. 

C.   The Committee judges that some further measured policy firming is 

likely to be needed to keep the risks to the attainment of both 

sustainable economic growth and price stability roughly in balance.  

In any event, the Committee will respond to changes in economic 

prospects as needed to foster these objectives.
