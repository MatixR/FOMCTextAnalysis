Prefatory Note 

 
 

The attached document represents the most complete and accurate version 
available based on original copies culled from the files of the FOMC Secretariat at the 
Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System.  This electronic document was 
created through a comprehensive digitization process which included identifying the best-
preserved paper copies, scanning those copies,1 and then making the scanned versions 
text-searchable.2  Though a stringent quality assurance process was employed, some 
imperfections may remain. 
 

Please note that this document may contain occasional gaps in the text.  These 
gaps are the result of a redaction process that removed information obtained on a 
confidential basis.  All redacted passages are exempt from disclosure under applicable 
provisions of the Freedom of Information Act.    

 

                                                 
1 In some cases, original copies needed to be photocopied before being scanned into electronic format.  All 
scanned images were deskewed (to remove the effects of printer- and scanner-introduced tilting) and lightly 
cleaned (to remove dark spots caused by staple holes, hole punches, and other blemishes caused after initial 
printing). 
2 A two-step process was used.  An advanced optimal character recognition computer program (OCR) first 
created electronic text from the document image.  Where the OCR results were inconclusive, staff checked 
and corrected the text as necessary.   Please note that the numbers and text in charts and tables were not 
reliably recognized by the OCR process and were not checked or corrected by staff.

CLASS I - FOMC September 30, 1983

MONETARY POLICY ALTERNATIVES

Recent developments

(I) Growth of M2 remained relatively low in August and September,

averaging about 5-1/2 percent at an annual rate. Its growth over the 3-month

June-to-September short-run target period was about 6 percent at an annual

rate, well below the FOMC's 8 percent specification. Growth in the nontrans-

actions component remained low throughout the summer relative to past experi-

ence and expansion in its MI component slowed markedly in August and September.

On a quarterly average basis, M2 grew at about a 7-3/4 percent annual rate

in the third quarter, implying an increase in its velocity of nearly 2-3/4

percent at an annual rate, a bit more than in the second quarter.

(2) In some contrast to M2, growth of M3 picked up in August and

September--to about an 8 percent annual rate on average--from its relatively

modest July pace, as banks increased reliance on managed liabilities while

CD issuance by thrifts remained heavy. M3 over June to September is esti-

mated to have grown at a 7-1/4 percent annual rate, somewhat below the 8

percent pace anticipated by the FOMC at the August meeting.

(3) The deceleration of M1 from the surge in the spring extended

into August and, judging from available data, growth remained low in

September--with this aggregate estimated to have expanded at an annual rate

of just over 3 percent over the two months. In both months, demand deposits

declined, following three months of substantial increases; currency growth,

on the other hand, picked up in both August and September from the reduced

July rate. Although M1 grew at only a 5 percent annual rate over the

June-to-September period--about 2 points lower than the FOMC's short-run

path--quarterly average growth was at a 9-1/4 percent rate owing to strong

growth in the latter part of the preceding quarter. M1 velocity rose at

about a 1-1/2 percent annual rate, more than in the second quarter but

still well below the pace that had been common in earlier postwar recoveries.

(4) With the general slowing of growth in the monetary aggre-

gates over the past two months, all of the aggregates are rather comfort-

ably within their longer-run ranges. As shown in the last column of the

table on the preceding page, growth through September would place M1

somewhat above the midpoint, M2 in the lower portion, and M3 in the

upper portion of their respective longer-run ranges.

(5) The growth in borrowing by domestic nonfinancial sectors is

estimated to have moderated further in August--to about a 9 percent annual

rate--reflecting an appreciable reduction in funds raised by non-federal

sectors. Credit growth at commercial banks in August, at an 11 percent

annual rate, was somewhat faster than that of total credit, as expansion of

real estate, consumer and business loans remained strong. However, data

available for September suggest that growth in both loans and securities

at banks has decelerated; lending to consumers appears to have slowed

somewhat from the very rapid pace of the spring and summer while business

lending apparently was off sharply despite continued relatively light

financing in long-term markets. Commercial paper issuance by nonfinancial

business in September is estimated to have remained at about the August

pace.

(6) Total reserves of depository institutions contracted in

both August and September. The August decline reflected a reduction in

the demand for excess reserves and required reserves against large time

and government deposits, while in September weakness of deposits in M1

reduced required reserves. Growth of the monetary base, by contrast,



-4-

picked up a bit in August and September as currency growth accelerated.

A contraction in nonborrowed reserves plus extended credit in August was

retraced only partially in September.

(7) The level of borrowing assumed in constructing reserve paths

has been decreased in stages from $800 to $700 and then to $650 million

since the last FOMC meeting. Nonetheless, borrowing has fluctuated widely

within a range of about $650 million to the $1.6 billion figure reached in

the statement week of September 21. In that week and also in the week just

past bank reserve management and to a degree System reserve management were

complicated greatly by huge flows of funds related to the unusual and

unexpectedly large build-up in Treasury cash balances at both banks and the

Federal Reserve in the latter part of the month. Despite the fluctuations

in borrowing, the federal funds rate averaged close to 9-1/2 percent for

the first five weeks of the intermeeting period before dropping to an average

of just over 9 percent in the reserve settlement week just past. In that

week large money center banks were experiencing less than usual strain on

reserve positions owing in part to the availability of Treasury funds,

thereby contributing to lessened pressure on the federal funds market. The

federal funds rate rose substantially in the past two days, reflecting

usual end-of-quarter statement date positioning.

(8) Short-term interest rates generally have declined about 25

to 50 basis points over the intermeeting period as evidence of slower money

growth and moderation of economic activity continued to mount, and, late in

the period, as perceptions of some easing in monetary policy spread. In

the long-term markets, rates have come down about 10 to 20 basis points and

mortgage rates have decline around one-quarter of a percentage point.



-5-

(9) The dollar on a weighted average basis has shown little net

change since the last Committee meeting,

. The dollar advanced in late August,

but moved lower during September as dollar interest rates declined. Over

the period, the interest differential between U.S. and key foreign short-

term interest rates narrowed slightly.



Prospective developments

(10) The table below shows alternative specifications for the

monetary aggregates over the September-to-December period, together with

associated federal funds rate ranges for the upcoming intermeeting period.

All the alternatives keep the monetary aggregates within their long-run

target ranges through the fourth quarter, though differing money market

conditions are implied. The lower panels give the implied growth rates for

each aggregate from the base period established by the Committee for its

longer-term ranges to the fourth quarter. (More detailed data for the

alternatives are shown in the charts and table on the following pages.)

B would be expected to accelerate from the relatively slow pace of recent

months, but even so M1 and M2 in the fourth quarter on average would be,

respectively, just above and just below the midpoints of their longer-run

ranges while M3 would be in the upper portion of its range. For M1, some

rebound in growth over the next three months might be expected as the

restraining effect of the higher interest rates that emerged in the spring

and early summer dissipates. Moreover, underlying transactions needs and

income growth are likely to be fairly sizable, as indicated by the staff

projection of about a 9 percent growth in nominal GNP in the fourth quarter.

Even with the acceleration in monthly growth rates under alternative B, on

a quarterly average basis M1 is projected to increase at only a 5-1/2 per-

cent annual rate in the fourth quarter. The implied increase in velocity

would not be especially large when compared to other expansion periods,

but it would represent a further quickening of M1 velocity growth rates

following the turn-around to small increases in the second and third

quarters.

(12) M2 growth is also expected to accelerate under alternative

B--as well as M3 growth to a degree--as expansion in its nontransactions

component picks up from the unusually sluggish pace of recent months. The

anticipated decline in Treasury deposits from their very high end-of-

September level should be accompanied by more aggressive efforts by banks

to obtain funds from the public generally. The staff does not expect the

decontrol of most time deposits on October I to affect growth of the aggre-

gates very significantly over time, given the earlier availability of

ceiling-free MMDAs and longer-term time accounts. Active promotion of

the new accounts does not appear to be widespread, according to results

of a Reserve Bank survey, though there are reports of emerging price

competition in a few key markets. The money paths allow for only



small near-term effects--in the direction of restraining M1 and increasing

M2 growth.

(13) Federal funds under alternative B would be expected to

trade in the area of 9-1/4 to 9-1/2 percent, and adjustment plus seasonal

borrowing might average between $550 and $750 million. Nonborrowed and

total reserves would be expected to increase at 9 and 6 percent rates,

respectively. It is difficult to foresee any significant change in

market interest rates more generally under this alternative. Rates could

back up a little in the degree that some market participants are antici-

pating more of an easing in monetary policy given the recent weakness

in money supply. Any increase in rates should be quite limited, though,

as incoming data are expected to continue to show money growth well with-

in the FOMC's ranges and economic activity expanding only moderately.

(14) The debt of domestic nonfinancial sectors is projected to

increase in the fourth quarter at about the 9 percent annual rate of the

third quarter. This would bring growth for the year to around 10-1/4 per-

cent, in the middle of the Committee's 8-1/2 to 11-1/2 percent monitoring

range. Borrowing by the U.S. Government is expected to continue at about

the pace of the third quarter as an increased deficit is financed by the

Treasury drawing down its unusually large cash balance. The increase in

household mortgage indebtedness should also be roughly the same in the fourth

quarter as in the third, but consumer installment credit may pick up a

little further with the strengthening in consumer durables purchases.

Business borrowing may remain modest as a quite moderate growth in invest-

ment spending is accompanied by a further rise in profits.

(15) Alternative A contemplates that the federal funds rate

would need to fall to an area just above the current 8-1/2 percent



-10-

discount rate--with a drop in borrowing to the $200 to $400 million range--

if the Committee were to seek the more rapid growth rates in money specified

by this alternative. These specifications include a 9 percent M1 and 9-1/2

percent M2 growth from September to December; such growth rates would leave

MI in the upper part of its long-run range in the fourth quarter on average,

and M2 close to its midpoint. M3 would approach its upper limit.

(16) A substantial rally in financial markets would probably

accompany an easing in bank reserve positions of the dimensions suggested

in alternative A, with the 3-month bill rate falling to the neighborhood of

8-1/4 percent. A further decline in CD rates would put downward pressure

on the prime rate, which might be reduced 1/2 percentage point, or perhaps

somewhat more, given the relatively wide spread that already has developed

between the prime and short-term market rates. The easing in market

conditions would probably lead to resumption of balance sheet restructuring

by businesses through increased issuance of bonds--and also of stocks as

equity prices tended to improve along with the drop in bond yields. The

downward pressure on mortgage rates that would be generated under this

alternative would tend to limit the drop in housing starts that currently

seems in store. The foreign exchange value of the dollar would decline

further.

(17) Whether the rate declines contemplated under alternative

A, with money market rates hovering around the current discount rate,

would be sustained into next year is, at this point, questionable.

Assuming moderate continuing strength in the economy, interest rates

might have to rise later this year or early next to begin restraining

MI and M2 growth to rates within the Committee's reduced longer-run



-11-

ranges for 1984 tentatively set at 4 to 8 percent and 6-1/2 to 9-1/2

percent, respectively.

(18) Alternative C--which calls for some tightening of money

money market conditions in the period ahead--would tend to restrain M2

growth within the lower part of its longer-run range, while bringing M1

growth to its midpoint. This alternative implies M1 growth at 5 percent

from September to December, about the same as in the previous three

months, while M2 and M3 growth would accelerate only modestly.

(19) The federal funds rate under alternative C would be

expected to rise to around 10 per cent, with discount window borrowing

rising to around $1 billion, as reserve provision is constrained relative

to demand. Other market interest rates would move up substantially.

The 3-month bill might increase to around 9-1/2 percent, and yields on

bonds and mortgages would adjust upward by perhaps 50 to 75 basis points

over the near term. Over a longer horizon, though, with higher interest

rates damping money demand and probably slowing the economic expansion

relative to staff forecasts, interest rate increases might be expected at

least to be reversed and perhaps move to levels somewhat below those

currently prevailing to sustain a moderate pace of economic recovery

next year.



-12-

Directive language

(20) Given below is a suggested operational paragraph for the

directive, with proposed deletions of language and the numerical specifi-

cations adopted at the meeting on August 23 shown in strike-through form.

The Committee seeks in the short run to (maintain/INCREASE

SLIGHTLY/DECREASE SLIGHTLY) the existing degree of reserve re-

straint. The action is expected to be associated with growth of

M2 and M3 at annual rates of around [DEL: 8] ____ AND ____ percent

RESPECTIVELY from [DEL: June-to] September TO DECEMBER, consistent

with the targets established for these aggregates for the year.

Depending on evidence about the strength of economic recovery

and other factors bearing on the business and inflation outlook,

lesser restraint would be acceptable in the context of a

significant shortfall in growth of the aggregates from current

expectations, while somewhat greater restraint would be

acceptable should the aggregates expand more rapidly. The

Committee anticipates that [DEL: a deceleration in] M1 growth to AT

an annual rate of around [DEL: 7] ____ percent from [DEL: June to] September

TO DECEMBER will be consistent with its [DEL: third] FOURTH-quarter

objectives for the broader aggregates, and that expansion in

total domestic nonfinancial debt would remain within the ranges

established for the year. The Chairman may call for Committee

consultation if it appears to the Manager for Domestic Opera-

tions that pursuit of the monetary objectives and related

reserve paths during the period before the next meeting is

likely to be associated with a federal funds rate persistently

outside a range of [DEL: 6-to 10] ____ to ____ percent.
