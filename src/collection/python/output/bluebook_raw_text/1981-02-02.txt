Prefatory Note 

 
 

The attached document represents the most complete and accurate version 
available based on original copies culled from the files of the FOMC Secretariat at the 
Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System.  This electronic document was 
created through a comprehensive digitization process which included identifying the best-
preserved paper copies, scanning those copies,1 and then making the scanned versions 
text-searchable.2  Though a stringent quality assurance process was employed, some 
imperfections may remain. 
 

Please note that this document may contain occasional gaps in the text.  These 
gaps are the result of a redaction process that removed information obtained on a 
confidential basis.  All redacted passages are exempt from disclosure under applicable 
provisions of the Freedom of Information Act.    

 

                                                 
1 In some cases, original copies needed to be photocopied before being scanned into electronic format.  All 
scanned images were deskewed (to remove the effects of printer- and scanner-introduced tilting) and lightly 
cleaned (to remove dark spots caused by staple holes, hole punches, and other blemishes caused after initial 
printing). 
2 A two-step process was used.  An advanced optimal character recognition computer program (OCR) first 
created electronic text from the document image.  Where the OCR results were inconclusive, staff checked 
and corrected the text as necessary.   Please note that the numbers and text in charts and tables were not 
reliably recognized by the OCR process and were not checked or corrected by staff.

MONETARY AGGREGATES AND
MONEY MARKET CONDITIONS

Recent develcoments

(1) Rather than posting a small increase as expected at the time

of the last FOMC meeting, the narrow monetary aggregates fell sharply

in December. In the early weeks of January, actual M-1A and M-1B were con-

siderably affected by shifts into NOW accounts, which were much larger than

anticipated. Other checkable deposits (OCD) in January--the first month of

nationwide NOW accounts--appear to be increasing by about $16Â¾ billion,

some $13 billion more than expected at the time of the last Committee

meeting.1/ Surveys of commercial banks and inspection of reported data

suggest that in early January four-fifths of the net OCD growth came from

demand deposits rather than the two-thirds previously estimated. Adding

back that proportion of OCD growth to M-1A, and reducing M-1B by estimated

shifts from other assets to OCD, provide an estimate of the "adjusted"

growth in these aggregates, that is, growth as if nationwide NOWs had

not occurred. This adjusted growth can then be compared with the target

paths that were specified to abstract from NOW account shifts. As shown

by the first two rows of each panel in the table on the next page, the

rebound in "adjusted" growth of M-1A and M-1B in January still left these

2/
aggregates well below target path levels.-

1/ About 85 percent of the growth in OCD occurred at commercial banks,
mainly in the first two weeks of the month.

2/ All monetary aggregates data in this Bluebook reflect benchmark adjust-
ments, as described in Appendix I.

(2) M-2 growth accelerated considerably in January, as M-1B

strengthened and as money market mutual funds, whose posted yields came

to exceed market rates, increased by a record amount. However, growth

in M-2 for the December-January period was at only about a 5 percent

annual rate, less than expected at the time of the last meeting. Total credit

growth at large banks appears to have been strong in the early weeks of Jan-

uary, but business loans at these institutions grew at the lowest rate

since July. Although nonfinancial businesses in January relied considerably

more on the commercial paper market as the spread between the paper and prime

rate widened further, total short-term borrowing by these firms appears to

have moderated; on the other hand, their capital market financing increased

from the depressed levels of recent months.

(3) Growth in nonborrowed reserves was substantial over the past

two months. About two-thirds of the expansion was offset by a decline

in adjustment borrowing, despite the continuation generally of a wide

spread of the federal funds rate over even the surcharge discount rate;

total reserves and the monetary base grew much less than nonborrowed

reserves. Excess reserves remained higher than expected over the past

several weeks.- The persistently large excess reserve levels are somewhat

puzzling, but appear to be related to implementation of the Monetary Control

Act. The larger excess reserve holdings have been concentrated at member

banks, with no indications of a concentration in particular Districts or by

size of institution. Only a very small part of the higher excess reserves

that emerged beginning in November was held by nonmember commercial banks and

thrifts.

1/ Targeted paths were adjusted to reflect the increased demands for
excess reserves, as well as other factors affecting the multiplier. See
Appendix II for reserve targecs and adjustments.



(4) In the first three weeks of January, despite the further

decline in adjustment borrowing, the federal funds rate remained high,

trading generally in the 19 to 20 percent zone. More recently, the funds

rate has been in the 17 to 19 percent area, even as borrowing ran markedly

above earlier levels. Short-term rates fluctuated considerably over the

intermeeting period, responding to published money stock data and other

economic news. On balance, money market yields are 2 1/2 to 4 percentage

points below their highs in mid-December prior to the last FOMC meeting.

(5) Bond yields have moved in a pattern similar to short rates in

recent weeks and are currently 3/4 to 1 percentage point below their December

highs. Corporate bond issuance has recovered from the low November-December

level. The Treasury has continued to raise substantial amounts of new

money with coupon offerings--$11 1/4 billion over the past two months. In the

February mid-quarter financing just announced, the Treasury will raise another

$3 billion. Mortgage commitment rates have changed little since mid-December,

remaining around 14-7/8 percent.

(6) The dollar has risen more than 4 percentage points on a weighted

average basis since the last FOMC meeting, with most of the increase in the

last week; small declines against sterling and the yen were more than offset

by rises against continental European currencies. Developments surrounding

the Iranian settlement appeared to have little net effect on exchange

markets. U.S. authorities

sold $1.3 billion in official intervention over the period.

rates of change, in percent, for selected monetary and financial flows over

Alternative Longer-Run Targets

(8) The December Bluebook contained a discussion of alternative

longer-run monetary strategies for the 1981-83 period, and their implications

for economic activity and prices. Against that background, this Bluebook

focuses on possible alternative growth ranges for 1981 (QIV '80 to QIV '81)

which must be reported to Congress in February. Various ranges that might

be considered are shown in the table below, where the ranges abstract from

impacts of shifts during the year into NOW accounts (to be discussed in

paragraph 11).

Alternative Memo:
Target Tentative target target ranges Actual
ranges ranges for 1981 for 1981 growth

for 1980 announced in July I II in 1980

1/M-1A 3Â½ to 6 3 to 5Â½ 3 to 5Â½ 2Â½ to 5 5.0-

M-1B 4 to 6Â½ 3Â½ to 6 3Â½ to 6 3 to 5Â½ 7.3 1/

M-2 6 to 9 5Â½ to 8Â½ 7 to 10 6Â¾ to 9Â¾ 9.8

M-3 6Â½ to 9Â½ 6Â½ to 9Â½ 7Â½ to 10Â½ 7Â¼ to 10Â¼ 10.0

Bank Credit 6 to 9 6 to 9 6Â½ to 9Â½ 6Â¼ to 9Â¼ 7.9

1/ M-1A and M-1B growth in 1980 was affected by shifts from demand and
savings accounts to ATS/NOW accounts. The staff estimates that as a
result of larger-than-anticipated shifts actual M-1A growth was reduced by
about 1Â¼ percentage points more, and M-1B increased by about Â½ percentage
point more, than had been assumed at the time the 1980 targets were estab-
lished. Adjusting for the effects of these unanticipated shifts, growth in
M-1A and M-1B last year would be about 6Â¼ and 6Â¾ percent respectively.

(9) The tentative target ranges for 1981 adopted by the Committee

in July, shown in the second column of the table, incorporate one-half

percentage point reductions in the announced 1980 ranges for M-1A, M-1B, and

M-2. Alternative I also involves Â½ percentage point reductions in the ranges

for 1981 for M-1A and M-1B, but presents higher ranges for the broader



-7-

aggregates than tentatively adopted. These higher ranges reflect the staff's

current estimates of growth rates consistent with the M-1A and M-1B targets

and associated GNP and interest rate projections. Alternative II specifies

a one percentage point reduction from 1980 in target ranges for M-1A and M-1B

as well as associated estimates of consistent growth ranges for the other

aggregates.

(10) Alternative I underlies the staff's GNP projection for the

current year. It implies the continuation of considerable restraint on

economic activity, with real output projected to show little change over

1981; the rate of price increase is expected to decelerate in the course

of the year (though for the year as a whole remaining near the 1980 pace).

Interest rate levels that might be associated with that alternative are

shown in the table below, which assumes that nominal GNP over the year

expands by about 9Â½ percent.1/

Mortgage rate 14Â¾ 14-7/8 14-7/8 15 15-1/8

1/ According to the Board's quarterly econometric model, alternative I implies
around a 2 percentage point downward shift in money demand. On the other
hand, a modification of this model to include the effects of changing cash
management techniques induced by high market rates of interest, suggests
a slight upward shift in money demand associated with the staff's GNP and
interest rate projections.

(11) The longer-run alternatives presented in paragraph (8)

abstract from the impact of nationwide NOW accounts, which will, of course,

depress actual M-1A growth and inflate M-1B expansion. Implied ranges for

the actual growth in the narrow aggregates under alternatives I and II that

take account of the expected amount of shifting into NOW accounts are shown

in the table below; shifts would not affect M-2 and M-3 to any significant

extent. The size of NOW-account distortion depends on the assumed growth in

OCD and is also highly sensitive to the proportion of shifts from demand

deposits and other assets, mainly savings accounts. In the December Bluebook,

the staff had assumed that the midpoint of the range of likely growth in OCD

over 1981 was about $23 billion and that about two-thirds of the growth of OCD

would represent shifts from demand deposits and one-third shifts from other

assets. In view of the very large inflows into NOW accounts during January,

the staff has raised the midpoint of the range of likely growth in OCDs to

about $40 billion (on the assumption that about half of the shift for the year

has already taken place). In addition, the staff now assumes that, by early

spring, the proportion of NOW growth representing shifts from demand deposits

will be gradually reduced from the 4/5 estimated for January to the 2/3

originally assumed; this reflects an expectation that the bulk of large demand

deposit holders will have shifted by the end of the first quarter. Given

these assumptions, the actual growth ranges for M-1A and M-1B over 1981

consistent with those that abstract from shifts to OCD should be about



-9-

7 percentage points lower for M-1A and 2Â½ percentage points higher for

M-13. As additional information becomes available about the extent and

sources of NOW account growth, adjustments will be made to keep the actual

ranges consistent with the "effective" targets set by the Comittee.

Short-run alternatives

(12) Alternative policy approaches to the first three months

of the year are shown below for Committee consideration. Growth rates for

M-1A and M-1B are specified abstracting from the impact of nationwide NOW

accounts. Actual growth rates that would be consistent with these targets

will of course depend on flows into NOW accounts. The staff's current

estimates of such actual measured growth are shown in parentheses in the

table on pp. 10 and 11, which also contains additional and more detailed

data on the various aggregates.

(13) As shown in the upper panel of charts 1 and 2 on the following

pages, alternative A is based on growth in M-1a and M-1B at a rate that would

bring the level of these aggregates by March to the midpoints of their

tEntative longer-run ranges adopted in July. This implies growth in M-1B

over the first three months of the year at about a 7Â½ percent annual rate,

given the shortfall that developed in December. Alternative 3 achieves

the midpoint of the alternative II longer-run path by March, and implies

growth in M-1B at a 6Â¾ percent annual rate over the first three months of

1/
the year.1/ Alternative C accepts the December shortfall, at least for the

first quarter, and specifies from that lower base the same growth rate in

the narrow aggregates over the first three months of the year that had been

adopted by the Committee at its December meeting. This alternative implies

relatively slow growth in February and March, as shown in last column of the

middle panel of the table on page 9.

(14) We have assumed that funds will flow into OCD at a progressively

slower pace in February and March--increasing about $1Â½ billion and $750 million

per week in those months, respectively. (In the first week of January OCD

increased by about $9 billion, but in the last week of the month such accounts

are estimated to have risen only about $2Â¼ billion.) On these assumptions

actual growth in M-1A would be reduced by about 13 percentage points over

February and March and M-1B growth would be increased by about 4Â½ percentage

points. This would mean, for instance, that under alternative A actual M-1A

1/ Under alternatives A and B, M-1A would grow at the same rates as M-1B over
the December to March period. This seeming anomaly (whereby M-1B does not
grow percentage point faster than M-1A) is simply the arithmetic result
of the particular relationships of these aggregates in December 1980 to
their QIV '80 averages.

2/ All of the short-run alternatives imply a March level of M-1B that is
lower than would have been attained if this aggregate had grown in
December at the 3.2 percent rate projected at the time of the December
FOMC meeting (instead of declining 9 percent) and then at a 4Â¾ percent
annual rate targeted for the first three months of 1981. Growth of M-1B
in February and March would have to be about 9Â¾ percent at an annual
rate to attain the March level implicit in the Committee's December
decision.



-13-

would decline at a 5Â½ percent annual rate, and actual M-1B increase at a

12 percent rate. As can be seen in the lower panels of charts 1 and 2, the

relatively large degree of shifting in the early months of 1981 results in

a temporary deviation of actual M-1A and M-1B growth from their expected

ranges for the year.

(15) Under all three alternatives, the growth of M-2 over the

first quarter would offset the December shortfall and leave this aggregate

in March at a level in the middle to upper part of the Committee's tentative

long-run growth range for 1981. (See the upper panel of chart 3.) Growth

in the non-transactions component of M-2 over the next two months is expected

to be buoyed by the growth of money market funds, which is projected to be

relatively strong as MMMF yields remain high in comparison to market rates.

Growth of bank credit and, consequently, the issuance of large CDs is

expected to moderate in the months ahead from the recent very rapid pace,

contributing to some deceleration of M-3 expansion in February and March.

Nonetheless, as shown in the lower panel of chart 3, owing to the relatively

high current level of M-3, such growth will leave this aggregate in March

above the upper end of the tentative longer-run range under all of the

short-run alternatives.

(16) All of the alternatives imply a substantial slowing in

growth of the transactions-related aggregates on a quarterly average basis

in the first three months of 1981. For example, implied quarterly average

growth in M-1B ranges from a high of 3Â¾ percent under alternative A to a low

of 2 percent under alternative C. This suggests substantial monetary

restraint against a projected expansion in nominal GNP for the quarter at an

annual rate of more than 13 percent. The sizable implied velocity increases



-14-

would indicate little room for further short-term interest rate declines.

Under alternative A, rates might be near, or perhaps a bit below, current

levels over the balance of the quarter. Alternative B might involve somewhat

higher interest rates, while alternative C seems quite likely to entail an

increase in interest rates over the balance of the quarter. Of course,

great uncertainty attaches to these interest rate projections, with market

reaction to the forthcoming economic program of the new Administration

likely to be a critical factor in near-term rate movements.

(17) The aggregate specifications of alternative A would appear

to involve growth in total reserves at a 1/1Â½ percent annual rate from January

to March, and, as noted earlier, only a small decline, if any, in the funds

rate from the recent trading range of 17 to 19 percent. While an average

level of borrowing at the discount window of about $1Â¼ billion might be

associated with attainment of the alternative A specifications, borrowing

demands have been erratic recently--with the funds rate first staying high

as borrowing declined and then falling as borrowing rose. Over the next

two months total reserve growth under alternative B would be only percent

at an annual rate and reserves would decline at a 3 percent annual rate

under alternative C. Under both alternatives relatively more reserves

would be expected to be provided through borrowing at the discount window,

given the current discount rate structure and assuming that these alterna-

tives involve some upward short-term interest rate pressure. Under

alternative 3, borrowing might be $1Â½ billion, or a little less, and under

alternative C $1Â¾ billion or a little more.

(18) Credit demands over the months immediately ahead are expected

to remain substantial. Business credit demands are projected to be well



-15-

maintained; however, relative to the fourth quarter of last year, more of

the borrowing may be shifted to bond markets with less occurring at banks. But

should interest rates again begin rising, business firms could once more

postpone capital market financing and temporarily increase reliance on banks

and the commercial paper market. The market will also have to absorb a

sizable amount of new Treasury issues for cash over the next two months

(perhaps $8Â½ billion of new bills and $10 billion of intermediate-term bonds)

before the seasonal swing to budget surplus in the second quarter.

(19) Given these credit demands, longer-term bond yields are not

likely to decline significantly over the weeks ahead. And there could be

some increase if short-term rates were to rise in consequence of restraint

on reserve growth in line with short-run money targets. Any rise in bond

rates under such conditions may be limited if borrowers backed away from the

market in anticipation of more receptive conditions later. Reactions to the

Administrations' forthcoming economic program will also strongly influence

longer-term rates. The possibility of a significant rise in longer-term

rates cannot be discounted if tax cuts are in prospect without accompanying

near-term expenditure cutbacks, but a rally in markets may develop if con-

vincing signs of a move to fiscal restraint emerge or if evidence of economic

weakness begins to cumulate.

(20) Should market rates remain near current levels, or even fall

slightly, conventional home mortgage rates likely would remain around 15

percent; if market rates were to move back toward the recent peak levels,

however, mortgage rates could well move significantly higher. In any

event, housing activity and mortgage credit flows would be expected to

moderate in the current quarter from the pace of the fourth quarter of 1980.



-16-

Commitment activity at S&Ls declined over the final months of last year,

and it is expected that continuation of the high mortgage rates recently

attained will cut further into housing demand. At the same time, the

willingness of thrift institutions to extend new mortgage commitments

probably will be limited by their concern about the cost and size of

prospective deposit flows. The severe pressure on earnings margins of the

thrift institutions would continue even if market interest rates were to

drop appreciably in the next several months; the higher average cost of funds

created by recent rollovers of MMCs has effectively ensured aggregate losses

for S&Ls and MSBs in the first half.



Directive language

(21) Given below is a suggested operational paragraph for the

directive. The language calls for expansion of reserve aggregates con-

sistent with desired rates of monetary growth over the three-month period

from December to March. The language used in December to specify the federal

funds rate constraint is retained. The specifications adopted at the

December meeting are shown in strike-through form.

In the short-run the Committee seeks behavior of reserve

aggregates [DEL: associated] CONSISTENT with growth of M-1A, M-1B, and

M-2 [DEL: over the first quarter] FROM DECEMBER TO MARCH AT ANNUAL RATES

OF ____ PERCENT, ____ PERCENT, AND ____ PERCENT RESPECTIVELY, ABSTRACTING

with the ranges for growth in 1981 contemplated earlier, which

will be reviewed in February 1981. These ranges, abstracting from

the effects of deposit shifts connected with the introduction of NOW

accounts on a nationwide basis, imply growth in these aggregates

centered on 4Â½ percent, and 7 percent respectively.] It

is recognized that [DEL: the introduction of] SHIFTS INTO [DEL: NOW and ITS] SUCH

accounts [DEL: nationwide at the beginning of 1981 is likely to widen the

and M-1B to an UNPREDICTABLE extent, [DEL: that cannot now be accurately

light of evaluation of those [DEL: differences as they emerge] DISTORTIONS.

[DEL: In the light of the rapid growth of monetary and credit aggregates

in recent months, some shortfall in growth would be acceptable in the

near term if that developed in the context of reduced pressures in



-18-

the money market. If it appears during the period before the next

meeting that fluctuations in the federal funds rate, taken over a

period of time, within a range of [DEL: 15 to 20] _____ TO ____ percent are

likely to be inconsistent with the monetary and related reserve paths,

the Manager for Domestic Operations is promptly to notify the Chairman,

who will then decide whether the situation calls for supplementary

instructions from the Committee.



Appendix I

Money Stock Benchmarks

During the intermeeting period money stock measures and related

data were benchmarked to the December 1979 and March 1980 call reports. In

addition, daily deposits data from all nonmember commercial banks with total

deposits greater than $15 million as of December 1979 were incorporated

1/
into the series.- These nonmember banks have been reporting daily deposits

data since November of last year in conjunction with the implementation of the

Monetary Control Act of 1980. This revision also includes revised estimates

of deposits at credit unions and other minor deposit items at all thrift

institutions. In addition, the revision incorporates benchmarks for overnight

and term RR's and the "L" series--M-3 plus other liquid assets--has been

revised back to late 1969 to incorporate new estimates of term Eurodollar

assets of U.S. nonbank holders.

The benchmark adjustments had only minor impact on the levels of

M-1A and M-lB. The level of M-1A was raised $100 million in December 1979

and lowered $900 million in April of 1980. By the end of 1980 the downward

adjustment was only $500 million. Benchmark adjustments raised the level of

M-13 about $500 million at the end of 1979 and about $1.0 billion at the end

of 1980. The M-1B adjustment reflects faster growth in the other checkable

deposits component (NOW/ATS and share draft deposits at credit unions).

The net adjustments to M-2 and M-3 were somewhat larger, on average.

The level of M-2 was raised roughly $500 million in late 1979 and nearly

$5.0 billion in late 1980. M-3 was unchanged in late 1979, but by the end

1/ Deposits of nonmember banks with less than $15 million in total deposits
will continue to be estimated from call report data until data from
quarterly reporting, which began with the week ending January 21, are

available. Data from these reports are not expected until mid-February,

however.



of 1980 the level of the series had gradually been raised over $6.5 billion.

The major factors contributing to these upward adjustments were revised

estimates of RP components based on March call report data. In addition, the

net adjustments reflect stronger savings deposits and weaker small-time

deposits. M-3 also reflects a downward revision in the large time deposits

at banks component. The average level of the "L" series was raised sub-

stantially in 1980 reflecting the adjustments to M-3 plus a %12 billion

increase in the term Eurodollar component. As indicated, the Eurodollar

adjustments were carried back to late 1969 with the amounts added decreasing

over time. These adjustments reflect Eurodollar CDs held in custody by banks

in London for the account of banks in the U.S. which are beneficially owned

by nonbank U.S. residents.

Table I-A shows the impact of the benchmark adjustments on M-1A

and M-1B growth rates. As the table shows the impacts on growth rates were

minimal for the year as a whole. M-1A for the year 1980 was about unchanged

and M-1B growth was raised less than 1/4 of a percentage point. The growth

patterns over the year were modified slightly. The revised series show a

bit less growth in the first half of 1980 and slightly faster growth in the

second half of the year. Changes in monthly growth rates were generally

small with the largest change in M-1A growth occurring in April of last year.

Table I-B shows M-2 and M-3 growth rates on an old and a revised

basis. For these series the impacts of the benchmark adjustments were

also small.
