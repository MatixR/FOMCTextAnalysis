created through a comprehensive digitization process which included identifying the best-
preserved paper copies, scanning those copies,1 and then making the scanned versions 
text-searchable.2  Though a stringent quality assurance process was employed, some 
imperfections may remain. 
 

Please note that this document may contain occasional gaps in the text.  These

MONETARY POLICY ALTERNATIVES

Prepared for the Federal Open Market Committee

By the staff Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System

MONETARY POLICY ALTERNATIVES

Recent Developments

(1) During the period since the November 16 FOMC meeting,

the federal funds rate has averaged very close to the intended level

of 3 percent.1 Most short-term interest rates were little changed

2 3over the intermeeting period.2,3 Recent economic data have been

interpreted by market participants as increasing the odds of a tight-

ening of monetary policy, but not necessarily over the very near term.

In longer-term markets, yields are up 10 to 15 basis points on bal-

ance. Rates were pushed up by signs of stronger economic growth and

firming in some commodity prices, though that pressure was offset to

some degree by declines in oil prices. Longer-term rates now stand 40

to 60 basis points above their mid-October lows. Over the inter-

meeting period, most major stock price indexes fell 1 to 2 percent,

but the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose about 1 percent on strong

performances by a few firms to post new highs near the end of the

period.

(2) The dollar's weighted-average foreign exchange value

showed little net change over the intermeeting period. It rose about

3 percent against the yen in light of deteriorating prospects for the

1. The allowance for adjustment and seasonal borrowing was reduced
in two steps of $25 million each to $50 million during the intermeet-
ing period, reflecting autumnal declines in the demand for seasonal
credit. In the two maintenance periods ending since the November
meeting, actual borrowing averaged somewhat below its allowance.
Adjustment borrowing was quite low during the intermeeting period,
setting a postwar weekly average low of $1.6 million in the week of
December 8.

2. Market quotations are as of noon on Friday, December 17.
3. Premiums for year-end funding that are implicit in money market

interest rates are down from 6 to 7 percentage points at the time of
the last FOMC meeting to 1 to 3 percentage points most recently.



Japanese economy and heightened expectations of further easing by the

Bank of Japan. Stock prices in that country fell about 4 percent, and

short- and long-term interest rates dropped 25 to 40 basis points.

The dollar was about unchanged against the German mark, but declined

somewhat against other European currencies. In Europe, interest rates

generally decreased 10 to 50 basis points, about in line with market

expectations, while stock prices continued to advance, with indexes in

several countries reaching new highs.

(3) Growth of M2 and M3 strengthened appreciably in November

and, at rates of around 4-1/4 percent for both aggregates, was some-

what more rapid than projected by the staff in the last bluebook.

Developments in the capital markets may have contributed to this pick-

up: Flows into longer-term mutual funds, probably responding to the

capital losses associated with the decline in bond prices in late

October and November, slowed appreciably during the weeks of Novem-

ber. Some of the unexpected strength in M2 and M3 was in money

market mutual funds--a likely repository of funds for investors moving

out of longer-term mutual funds. Ml growth in November was at a

10-1/2 percent rate, as projected in the last bluebook. Currency

growth stayed near October's moderate rate; a considerable decelera-

tion in this component over the past two months appears to be due in

part to slower growth of foreign demands for U.S. currency. Mortgage

refinancing activity likely helped fuel continued rapid expansion of

4. The strengthening of M2 showed through to M2+ (which adds bond
and stock mutual funds to M2). M2+ is estimated to have expanded at a
7-1/2 percent rate last month, up from October's 6-1/4 percent pace.



demand deposits last month.5 The strengthening of M3 owed to a

surge in term Eurodollars as well as to the stepped-up growth in M2.

(4) M2 and M3 in the fourth quarter are projected to be

about 1-1/2 and 1/2 percent, respectively, above their average levels

for the fourth quarter of 1992, leaving them both about 1/2 percentage

point above the lower bounds of their downward-adjusted annual

ranges. Although the growth rate of M2 was roughly the same as in

1992, its velocity rose less rapidly--at an estimated 3-1/2 percent in

1993, down from 5 percent in 1992.7 Moreover, some of the increase

in velocity in 1993 can be explained by a rise in short-term oppor-

tunity costs, as deposit rates continued to adjust downward in re-

sponse to previous declines in market interest rates. Thus, despite

record growth of bond and stock mutual funds, there are some indica-

tions that the unusual shifts out of M2 may be beginning to abate,

perhaps as portfolios become adjusted to the steep yield curve and

the greater availability of mutual funds, as consumer loan rates come

down, and as households become more comfortable with their financial

positions. Nonetheless, the rise in M2 velocity this year still

was greater than forecast by traditional models, and the level of M2

velocity in the fourth quarter of 1993 is 17 percent above the level

5. The monetary base expanded at an 8-3/4 percent rate last month,
up a little from October's pace but down considerably from the third-
quarter rate.

6. At the July meeting, the range for M2 for 1993 was revised down
1 percentage point to 1 to 5 percent, while that for M3 was lowered
1/2 percentage point to 0 to 4 percent. A detailed analysis of the
behavior of the aggregates in 1993 is contained in an appendix to the
Greenbook.

7. Special factors, including increases in demand deposits related
to prepayments of mortgages and heavy foreign demands for U.S. cur-
rency in the first three quarters, boosted growth of M2 in 1993 and
depressed its velocity by an estimated 1 percentage point--the same as
in 1992.

8. M2+ is projected to have expanded 5-1/2 percent during 1993.
The velocity of this aggregate is expected to have fallen about 1/2
percent this year.



these models expect, given the actual behavior of short-term oppor-

tunity costs.9  The velocity of M3 also is projected to have risen

less sharply in 1993 than last year. Contributing to the slower

increase in V3 has been somewhat stronger credit growth at deposi-

tories, although this effect has been offset somewhat by an even

greater reliance than last year on nondeposit sources of funds.

(5) Nonfederal debt growth appears to be running somewhat

stronger in the third and fourth quarters than previously thought,

and, at a projected average rate of 4-3/4 percent over these two

quarters, is noticeably above the pace of the first half of the year.

The faster growth has been evident mainly in the household sector,

where sounder balance sheets and perhaps less concern about economic

prospects evidently have prompted a greater willingness to borrow.

Consumer installment credit has been particularly robust, expanding at

a 12-3/4 percent pace in October; bank data suggest that consumer

borrowing fell off a bit last month but nevertheless remained well in

excess of income growth. Mortgage borrowing is estimated to have

picked up appreciably in the third quarter and to be continuing apace

in the fourth quarter, reflecting strong housing activity as well as

some equity extraction. In the business sector, however, net borrow-

ing has remained quite modest. Internal funds have been nearly ample

enough to cover the high level of capital outlays, and elevated share

prices have induced many firms to tap equity markets. Gross issuance

of corporate bonds has flagged in recent months, partly owing to the

backup in long rates, while borrowing from shorter-term sources has

remained subdued. The rise in long rates likewise has taken a toll on

9. M2 velocity in 1993 increased by 2 percentage points more than
would have been predicted by the new broader model of M2 demand that
includes rates on intermediate-term securities and consumer loans.

bond issuance in the state and local sector. Federal debt, though,

rebounded in November from a decline in October, bringing estimated

total debt growth last month to a 6-1/2 percent rate. Through Novem-

ber, total domestic nonfinancial sector debt is estimated to have

risen at a 5 percent rate from its 1992:Q4 base, leaving this aggre-

gate somewhat above the 4 percent lower bound of its monitoring range.

Policy Alternatives

(6) Three alternatives are presented below for Committee

consideration. Under alternative B, federal funds would continue to

trade around 3 percent in association with adjustment plus seasonal

borrowing at the discount window of $50 million. Under alternative C,

the federal funds rate would move up to 3-1/2 percent and the borrow-

ing allowance to $75 million. In the case of alternative A, the

federal funds rate would decline to 2-1/2 percent and borrowing would

fall, perhaps to $25 million.

(7) Alternative B is consistent with the policy assumptions

underlying the staff economic forecast. In that forecast, short-term

rates are maintained at around current levels through most of 1994.

The spurt in output in the current quarter, related importantly to

production adjustments in the automobile industry, is not sustained.

Output decelerates in the first quarter, and then settles into a

growth pace broadly in line with that of potential over the balance of

the year, held down to an extent by scheduled fiscal retrenchment.

With economic slack persisting, albeit at around the current

diminished level, prices decelerate modestly further. Relative to the

staff forecast, market participants appear to be anticipating a bit

more strength in aggregate demand through next year, and have built

into interest rates substantial odds that policy will begin to tighten

in the first part of the year to keep inflation from increasing.

Nonetheless, market interest rates are unlikely to move down much on

balance under the steady funds rate of alternative B in coming months,

since the market would continue to expect a tightening before long.

The foreign exchange value of the dollar under alternative B should

stay around current levels.

(8) Growth of the broad monetary aggregates, shown in the

table above, is expected to slow a little through March under alterna-

tive B from the faster pace of recent months, but to stay above the

pace of 1993 as a whole. This moderation is entirely accounted for by

identifiable special factors. In particular, the recent falloff in

mortgage refinancing applications portends a marked reduction in

demand deposits associated with this activity. This effect subtracts

around 3 percentage points from the expansion of M1 and 1 percentage

point from M2 over the November-to-March period. (Increases in

refinancing over the summer and early fall added an estimated 1-3/4

and 1/2 percentage points of growth to M1 and M2 from August to

November.) Abstracting from this factor, growth of M2 is projected to

pick up a little in coming months. Shifts from M2 should continue to

moderate a little as balance sheets become better aligned with the

current structure of interest rates. We expect flows into long-term

mutual funds to average below the record pace of most of 1993, react-

ing also to heightened investor perceptions of risk after the backup

in yields and associated capital losses of October and November.

(9) Nonetheless, substantial portfolio shifts are expected

to persist, as the yield curve remains relatively steep, and these

shifts will continue to damp the growth of M2 relative to nominal

income. The velocity of M2 in the first quarter would rise at a

4 percent rate, down only a bit from the 4-1/2 percent rate projected

for the current quarter. M2 by March would have expanded at a 2 per-

cent annual rate from its fourth-quarter 1993 base under alternative

B, placing this aggregate well above the lower end of its provisional

1 to 5 percent growth range for next year. However, monthly money

growth in the first quarter could be especially volatile and difficult

to interpret. Seasonal factors were distorted by policy-induced

surges in money in early 1991 and 1992. In addition, amounts and

patterns of tax payments, and associated adjustments in money hold-

ings, could be atypical, given the uncertain effects of the new tax

law.

(10) Under alternative B, M3 would advance at a 1 percent

annual rate over the November-to-March period; by March this aggregate

would be 1-1/4 percent above its fourth-quarter 1993 base, well within

its 0 to 4 percent provisional range for 1994. Bank credit should

continue to expand around the 5 percent pace of 1993, and banks are

expected to persist in funding much of the growth with lower cost,

non-M3 sources, in part to avoid deposit insurance premiums. The debt

of the nonfederal sectors will grow at a 4-3/4 percent rate through

March, in line with the stepped-up pace of the second half of 1993.

Household borrowing is expected to continue to be strong, reflecting

more comfortable financial positions and the high level of spending on

housing and durable goods. Overall financing needs of businesses are

expected to grow as advances in capital spending outstrip growth in

internal funds, and as net equity issuance is held down by a major



-11-

merger. Total debt of nonfinancial sectors is projected to increase

at a 5-3/4 percent pace from the fourth quarter of 1993 to March, well

above the lower end of its provisional 4 to 8 percent range for next

year.

(11) The rise in the federal funds rate under alternative C,

to 3-1/2 percent, would come sooner than now anticipated by market

participants and built into markets interest rates. Rates at the near

end of the maturity spectrum would rise by almost the full 50 basis

point increase in the funds rate; intermediate- and long-term rates

would go up, but as usual by less. The extraordinary spread of the

prime rate over funding costs and the more aggressive lending posture

of commercial banks suggest that the prime rate might notch up only

1/4 percentage point. The eventual increase in long-term rates could

be limited because such a tightening at this time might be seen as

better ensuring continuing moderate expansion and disinflation in the

years ahead. Quality spreads would be expected to remain fairly nar-

row as a firming in the policy stance in the context of market expec-

tations of a more solid economic expansion would not be likely to

raise many concerns about credit quality. Higher yields on dollar

assets would put upward pressure on the exchange value of the dollar.

M2 would grow at a 1-3/4 percent annual rate over the November-to-

March period, restrained by higher opportunity costs. M3 would expand

under alternative C at only a 3/4 percent pace over the November-to-

March period.

(12) Alternative C might be preferred if there were concerns

about the inflation outlook. Such concerns could arise from a view

that current-quarter strength in economic activity suggested that the

economy was on an appreciably higher growth track, perhaps because

financial factors damping expansion have faded, allowing the current



accommodative stance of monetary policy to show through more fully

into aggregate demand. In that event, the output gap would be closing

more quickly than in the staff forecast, raising the risks of an

overshooting of activity relative to its potential and hence greater

inflationary pressures over time. A timely firming in policy now

could obviate a more aggressive tightening later to keep inflation

from picking up, involving perhaps even higher real interest rates if

delays permitted inflation expectations to deteriorate.

(13) The easing of policy under alternative A would come as

a surprise to market participants, and short-term interest rates would

fall by about the 50 basis point drop in the federal funds rate.

Intermediate- and long-term rates would decline by less; indeed, the

extent of any decline would be quite limited if the easing were seen

by market participants to be unsustainable. The dollar would weaken

on foreign exchange markets. Under alternative A, M2 would expand at

a 2-1/4 percent pace, close to that evident since midyear, buoyed

partly by less of a slowdown in M1 than under alternatives B and C,

M3 would grow at a 1-1/4 percent pace from November to March.

(14) Alternative A might be favored if the current strength

in the economy were seen as likely to give way to a significant weak-

ening in the pace of expansion next year, considering the greater

fiscal restraint in train and the backup in long-term interest rates

and the dollar since mid-October. Moreover, even if the staff fore-

cast is judged to be the most likely outcome, the lack of much pro-

gress in reducing the unemployment rate may be deemed to be unaccep-

table. Moreover, recent softness in the oil market could suggest

lessened risk to the inflation outlook from an easing, at least in the

near term.

Directive Language

(15) Presented below is draft wording for the operational

paragraph that includes the usual options for Committee consideration.

OPERATIONAL PARAGRAPH

In the implementation of policy for the im-

mediate future, the Committee seeks to DECREASE SOME-

WHAT/maintain/INCREASE SOMEWHAT the existing degree of

pressure on reserve positions. In the context of the

Committee's long-run objectives for price stability and

sustainable economic growth, and giving careful con-

sideration to economic, financial, and monetary develop-

ments, slightly (SOMEWHAT) greater reserve restraint

(WOULD/MIGHT), or slightly (SOMEWHAT) lesser reserve

restraint (WOULD) might be acceptable in the intermeet-

ing period. The contemplated reserve conditions are

expected to be consistent with [DEL: modest] MODERATE growth in

M2 and M3 over COMING MONTHS [DEL: the balance of the year.]
