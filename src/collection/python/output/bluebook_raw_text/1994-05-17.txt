MONETARY POLICY ALTERNATIVES

Recent Developments 1

(1) In keeping with a strategy of moving away from an

accommodative stance in reserve provision at this stage in the eco-

nomic expansion without severely unsettling financial markets, the

intended federal funds rate was raised 25 basis points, to 3-1/2 per-

cent, immediately following the March 22 FOMC meeting. On April 18.

with incoming data having confirmed considerable momentum and dimin-

ishing slack in the economy, and financial markets seemingly more able

to absorb further tightening, the intended funds rate was raised

another 25 basis points, to 3-3/4 percent. Throughout the intermeet-

ing period, the funds rate generally has traded near its intended

level. 2

(2) As indicated in the upper left panel of Chart 1, just

prior to the March FOMC meeting federal funds futures had embodied a

rising path for the funds rate, including expectations of a 25 basis

point tightening at that meeting and some probability of another move

in April. As shown in the lower panel of the exhibit, the markets

rallied after the March meeting, but only briefly. On March 24, banks

increased the prime rate 25 basis points, to 6-1/4 percent, and over

the next week and a half, market rates backed up, particularly after

the release on April 1 of the strong March employment report:

1. Financial market quotations in this section are taken as of
noon, Friday, May 13.

2. The allowance for adjustment plus seasonal borrowing was raised
to $175 million in four $25 million steps, two to implement the policy
moves and two to reflect usual seasonal increases. On average, bor-
rowing ran about $12 million above its allowance over the intermeeting
period.

(3) Shorter-term market rates rose further when the System

tightened in mid-April--although less than the quarter-point increase

in the funds rate. 3 The mid-April action caught market partizi-

pants somewhat unawares and was interpreted as putting policy tighten-

ing on a steeper trajectory with a higher endpoint, as can be seen in

the upward revision to federal funds futures. Short-term rates

continued to edge up in the latter part of the month. Nonetheless,

there was little net movement in intermediate- and long-term rates

over most of April. as data indicated subdued trends in costs and

prices. However, in late April, rates across the maturity spectrum

began rising again with the release of data suggesting to the market

considerable additional vigor in economic activity. Weakness in the

dollar over this period appeared to contribute to the upward movement

in interest rates, because it implied additional price pressures in an

economy operating at high levels of output and provided a rationale

for more aggressive policy action.

(4) On balance, since the day before the March meeting.

while the funds rate has been raised 50 basis points, other short-term

interest rates have risen 60 to 85 basis points, intermediate rates

85 to 100 basis points, and long-term rates 60 to 75 basis points.

The weakness in the dollar suggests that a portion of the increase in

interest rates likely represents a market view that some of the

developing price pressures will ultimately show through into higher

actual inflation than previously anticipated. However, real rates

probably also have risen, judging in part by declines in major stock

price indexes of 5-1/2 to 10 percent over the intermeeting period.

Some of the increase in real rates likely resulted from the effect of

heightened uncertainty on term premiums. The upper right panel of the

exhibit shows that expected volatility inferred from near-term options

on bond prices rose sharply toward the end of March. The rise in

expected volatility probably owed to the persistence of higher actual

price volatility and to uncertainties about the course of monetary

policy and inflation in the face of strong aggregate demand.

(5) Increased uncertainty premiums in U.S. interest rates.

not fully matched by similar increases abroad, would reduce the demand

for dollar assets, and thus could explain part of the downward

pressure on the foreign exchange value of the dollar, despite

increases in nominal interest differentials in favor of dollar assets.

The dollar's weighted average exchange value declined a little more

than 1 percent, on balance, over the intermeeting period. Monetary

authorities in several key foreign countries eased their policies.

Three-month interest rates declined 75 basis points in Germany, and

the Bundesbank reduced its discount and Lombard rates 1/4 percentage

point on April 14 and 1/2 percentage point on May 11. Nonetheless.

bond rates rose 25 basis points in Germany. Three-month and ten-year

rates declined 15 and 40 basis points, respectively, in Japan. The

political disarray in Japan seemingly had the perverse effect of

strengthening the yen against the dollar, on the grounds that the new

minority government would have greater difficulties in implementing

trade reforms; the yen would therefore have to appreciate to help

reduce Japan's huge current account surplus. For most of the inter-

meeting period, the market believed that the U.S. government would

welcome a further decline in the dollar against the yen and perhaps a

weaker dollar generally. In part to dispel such impressions, the Desk

intervened on two occasions to purchase dollars against yen and marks.



Both operations were accompanied by statements from the Secretary of

the Treasury: The first emphasized countering disorderly markets; the

second highlighted concerns of U.S. authorities with the dollar's

weakness, which was viewed as inconsistent with economic fundamentals.

and rejected an undervalued dollar as a U.S. policy objective. The

second intervention was coordinated with a substantial number of

foreign central banks. In total, U.S. authorities purchased $1,950

million against yen and marks, equally divided between System and

Treasury accounts.

(6) The broad monetary aggregates accelerated somewhat more

than expected at the time of the March FOMC meeting. M2 rose at a

4 percent rate and M3 at a 2-1/2 percent rate over March and April.

compared with projected growth rates of 3-1/4 and 1-3/4 percent, re-

spectively. These increases left M2 somewhat below the midpoint of

its 1-to-5 percent range for 1994 and M3 somewhat above the lower end

of its 0-to-4 percent range. Data through early May suggest a slowing

in the growth of both aggregates.

(7) The strengthening of the broad aggregates, which runs

counter to what might normally be anticipated with rising interest

rates, appears mainly attributable to a reassessment on the part of

households of the attractiveness of investing in capital market in-

struments. Bond mutual funds suffered substantial net redemptions

over March and April, and there was a corresponding surge in retail

money funds: in addition, a slowing in runoffs of small time deposits

may represent reduced shifting to stock and bond funds. The broad



money aggregates were also boosted in March and April by hefty in-

creases in overnight and term repurchase agreements, which helped

banks fund sizable net acquisitions of government securities. The

rise in short-term opportunity costs does seem to have had its usual

effect of restraining demand for a number of components of M2, espe-

cially liquid retail deposits. M1 expanded at only a 1-1/2 percent

rate over March and April. held down by a drop in mortgage refinanes

ings as well as the wider opportunity costs.4  In addition, savings

deposits (including MMDAs) registered a small decline in April.

(8) Bank credit expanded rapidly in March and April, re-

flecting strong growth in consumer and business loans, as well as the

increase in securities holdings. An early May survey revealed con-

tinued increases in the willingness of banks to lend to households and

a further easing of credit standards for businesses. The strength in

bank credit in part represents a rise in the share of banks in house-

hold and business debt creation. As capital market prices have

dropped, firms have cut back on bond and stock issuance: mounting

external financing needs have been concentrated more on commercial

banks.

(9) While the backup in rates has altered the pattern of

financing and discouraged refinancing of outstanding obligations, it

appears to have little affected nonfinancial debt growth. Debt of the

nonfederal sectors has increased at a 4-1/2 percent rate in recent

months, about in line with the more rapid pace of the second half of

1993. Overall business borrowing has remained subdued. Consumer

credit is growing briskly, but household mortgage indebtedness appears

to be expanding only moderately. State and local governments have

slowed their net debt issuance of late, owing to improved fiscal

positions and considerable previous advance refunding. While federal

debt growth surged in March, it now appears to be slowing, even after

allowing for the usual tax-season swings, as fiscal restraint and

strong economic performance reduce deficits. Total domestic nonfinan-

cial debt is estimated to have grown at a 5 percent pace from the

fourth quarter through March. leaving this aggregate somewhat above

the lower bound of its 4-to-8 percent monitoring range for 1994.

Policy Alternatives

(10) Three monetary policy alternatives are presented below

for Committee consideration. Under alternative B. federal funds would

continue to trade around 3-3/4 percent, in association with the al-

lowance for adjustment plus seasonal borrowing remaining initially at

$175 million.5  Under alternative C, the federal funds rate would

move up 1/4 percentage point (one-half the usual adjustment shown in

previous bluebooks for "alternative C") to 4 percent, effectuated by

increasing the initial borrowing allowance to $200 million. Under

alternative D, the federal funds rate would be raised to 4-1/4 per-

cent, either by increasing the initial borrowing allowance to $225

million or by raising the discount rate to 3-1/2 percent, while keep-

ing the initial allowance for discount window borrowing at $175 mil-

lion.

(11) In the staff's economic forecast, the federal funds

rate is assumed to be raised gradually to 4-1/2 percent by the fall of

this year and maintained at that level through the end of next year.

Long-term interest rates are seen as holding close to their most re-

cent levels in the face of the assumed policy tightenings, but sub-

sequently to drift lower, as market participants come to realize that

economic trends imply lower inflation and a lesser degree of needed

policy restraint than now built into market rates. In effect, this

funds rate path is broadly consistent with the attainment of "policy

neutrality," in that real GDP, after moving into the vicinity of its

estimated potential in the current quarter, grows about in line with

its potential over the next six quarters. The unemployment rate

remains near its estimated natural rate of about 6-1/2 percent, and

core CPI inflation runs just below a 3 percent rate through the end

next year. Variations in the timing and size of the steps taken to

raise the funds rate to 4-1/2 percent by this autumn probably would

not have a persistent influence on economic activity but could affect

inflation expectations for a time and the near-term paths of financial

market prices.

(12) Compared with the staff's assessment, financial market

participants now appear to be anticipating appreciably more Federal

Reserve tightening by the fall, judging by the rate of 5-1/4 percent

on federal funds futures for October. Many in the market expect the

Committee to increase the funds rate 50 basis points at this meeting,

though others anticipate only a 25 basis point increase, and the

federal funds futures quote is in between. Very short-term rates

might thus increase slightly under alternative D. The behavior of

rates on instruments of a few months' maturity or longer would depend

importantly on whether the market interpreted the larger increase of

alternative D as indicating a steeper trajectory of future policy

actions, and perhaps the need for greater cumulative tightening. If

expectations were to ratchet up in this manner, as appeared to have

been the case in some of the tightenings earlier this year, there

could be sizable hikes along the maturity spectrum. However, several

factors suggest that the market may react more favorably this time.

For one, such a move--larger than recent ones--might assuage concerns

that the Federal Reserve was "falling behind the curve." A rise in

the foreign exchange value of the dollar, which would be expected

under this alternative, would also help to reduce inflation concerns.

Moreover, an action of this magnitude coupled with a discount rate



-10-

increase, depending perhaps on the wording of the associated announce-

ment, might be seen as suggesting that the Federal Reserve thought it

had reached the neighborhood of "neutrality." If the action is seen

this way, policy would be expected to be kept on hold for a while, or

at least to tighten more slowly and be more dependent on incoming

data. With one source of uncertainty diminished, at least for a time,

investors who had been avoiding longer-term instruments pending the

Federal Reserve's action might be tempted to extend maturities. Bond

yields could still back up somewhat in the aftermath of an announce-

ment of the Federal Reserve's choice of alternative D, but these other

influences should limit any increase and work to reduce yields over

time. provided incoming data on the economy indicate a moderate path

for activity, in line with the staff forecast.

(13) The case for increasing the intended federal funds rate

only 25 basis points as under alternative C would seem to hinge on the

judgment that financial market participants have exaggerated the like-

ly strength of future spending relative to the economy's potential and

hence of prospective inflation pressures. In this view, taking the

fundamentals reasonably into account, the markets have gotten "ahead

of the curve" and the risk of disappointing them should not be allowed

to divert the Federal Reserve from a gradual course of 25-basis-point

adjustments in the stance of policy toward neutrality. With the loca-

tion of a neutral funds rate itself a moving target--and lower to the

extent that real long-term interest rates are higher--such an approach

would allow more time to assess the needed federal funds rate in-

creases as new information on the economy and prices becomes avail-

able. Short-term rates likely would edge off immediately after a

modest policy tightening. The initial reaction in capital and foreign



-11-

exchange markets could be adverse if the small size of the move were

seen as signalling a reluctance to move aggressively to head off an

inflationary buildup. However, the odds on such a reaction may have

been reduced by the recent favorable price data. In this context,

market participants might be more inclined to interpret the smaller

move as sufficient to counter coming inflation pressures and to

project a lower trajectory of short-term rates, which would pass

through to lower longer-term rates.

(14) The case for standing pat, alternative B, is a more

extreme version of the rationale for alternative C: In this case, the

market assessment, and even that of the staff, of the strength of

aggregate demand would be judged to be seriously off the mark, perhaps

because the rise in long-term rates, along with the decline in house-

hold wealth, will have a more significant restraining influence on

aggregate demand. Choice of alternative B would come as a consider-

able surprise--and disappointment--to financial markets; very short-

term interest rates would be likely to fall appreciably, but this

alternative risks a significant sell-off in the bond market before

weakness in aggregate demand becomes apparent.

(15) Material differences in nominal spending and overall

borrowing under the three policy alternatives outlined above are un-

likely to emerge in the next several months. Under all three alterna-

tives, the debt of domestic nonfinancial sectors should expand at

around a 5 percent rate from March through September, matching its

pace this year through March. A pickup in growth of nonfederal debt

is expected to fill in the gap left by a softening of federal govern-

ment borrowing. Higher long-term rates and lower price-earnings



-12-

ratios present a less favorable environment for balance sheet restruc-

turing, but borrowers will continue to find banks and other inter-

mediaries to be willing lenders. Business borrowing should remain

well above last year's meager pace, as corporate capital spending

rises appreciably further relative to internally generated funds.

Households too are likely to continue taking on consumer debt more

quickly than they did on average last year, although with recent in-

creases in mortgage rates restraining housing activity, mortgage debt

expansion is not anticipated to outpace last year's performance.

(16) Projected growth rates of the monetary aggregates from

April to September under alternatives B and D are shown on the table

below. (More detailed data are presented in the table and charts on

the following pages.) While we foresee M1 growth picking up some, at

around 3 to 4 percent, it remains damped relative to spending. The

recent increases in opportunity costs on liquid retail deposits aris-

ing from the previous tightenings in the stance of monetary policy,

and under alternative D from an additional firming move as well, will

serve to hold back growth of M1 and some of the other components of M2

and M3. With any further backup in long-term interest rates not ex-

pected to be sustained under either policy alternative, another surge

in outflows from bond mutual funds does not appear to be in the cards.

As a consequence, the effects of higher opportunity costs show through

able slowing from the stepped-up pace of March and April. Under both

Directive Language

(17) Draft language for the operational paragraph, including

the usual options and updating, is shown below. In light of the re-

commendations for a discount rate increase from all twelve Federal

Reserve Banks, wording is given in brackets in the first sentence

should the Committee wish to make reference in the directive to a

possible change in the discount rate. This suggested wording is

similar to that used by the Committee in comparable situations in the

past. Of course, the minutes would explain the Committee's approach

to implementation and its rationale.

OPERATIONAL PARAGRAPH

In the implementation of policy for the immediate future, the

Committee seeks to increase slightly (SOMEWHAT)/maintain/DECREASE

SLIGHTLY (SOMEWHAT) the existing degree of pressure on reserve

positions. [TAKING ACCOUNT OF A POSSIBLE INCREASE IN THE DISCOUNT

RATE]. In the context of the Committee's long-run objectives for

price stability and sustainable economic growth, and giving care-

ful consideration to economic, financial, and monetary develop-

ments, slightly (SOMEWHAT) greater reserve restraint MIGHT/WOULD

or slightly (SOMEWHAT) lesser reserve restraint might/WOULD be

acceptable in the intermeeting period. The contemplated reserve

conditions are expected to be consistent with moderate MODEST

growth in M2 and M3 over COMING MONTHS [DEL: the first half of 1994].
