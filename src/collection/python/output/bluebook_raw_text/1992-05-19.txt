MONETARY POLICY ALTERNATIVES

Recent Developments

(1) The degree of reserve pressures was left unchanged

immediately after the March 31 FOMC meeting, with the expected federal

funds rate remaining at 4 percent. However, reserve conditions were

eased on April 9, reducing the expected federal funds rate to 3-3/4

percent: The broad monetary aggregates had declined for several weeks,

bringing them to the lower ends of their target ranges and extending

their sluggish growth trends of 1991; moreover, the weakness in money

occurred in the context of indications that the economic expansion was

moderating from the pace early in the year and of fundamentals that

continued to point to long-run disinflation. Desk reserve management

during the intermeeting period was complicated by several factors.

These included uncertainties about whether the demand for excess

reserves might increase as a result of the cut in the reserve require-

ment on transactions deposits from 12 percent to 10 percent (implemented

on April 2). In the event, depository institutions appeared to adjust

smoothly to the lower level of required reserve balances; with combined

required reserve and clearing balances seasonally high and noticeably

above minimal clearing needs, little evidence of heightened demands for

excess reserves or of increased federal funds rate volatility emerged.

As a further complication, variable tax flows produced unusual fluctua-

tions in the Treasury balance, and, on average, somewhat larger reserve

supplies than projected. Over the five weeks since the April 9 easing,

the federal funds rate averaged about 1/8 percentage point below the



expected level. Borrowing averaged $108 million over the three complete

maintenance periods since the March meeting.

(2) The easing of policy, in conjunction with data suggesting

a subdued economic expansion and persistent weakness in broad money,

prompted sizeable declines in market interest rates. Most short-term

rates fell by more than the federal funds rate--registering declines of

around 45 basis points over the intermeeting period--as sentiment shift-

ed from expectations that the next policy action was more likely to be

toward tightening to the current sense that some further ease may be

more likely.2 Intermediate-term yields fell 20 to 45 basis points and

bond yields 5 to 15 basis points, while rates on fixed-rate mortgages

dropped 35 basis points. But these declines still leave intermediate-

and long-term rates about 1/4 to 3/4 percentage point above their lows

reached around the turn of the year. Buoyed by generally strong earn-

ings reports for the first quarter, price indexes for larger capitaliza-

tion firms are up 2 to 4 percent since the March meeting. Bank earnings

reports suggesting wide lending margins and generally less severe asset

problems than had been anticipated led to even larger increases in bank

stock prices; these price gains were trimmed somewhat late in the period

by the bankruptcy filing of Olympia and York.

(3) The shift in outlook for U.S. interest rates, along with

perceptions that any easing by the Bundesbank would be postponed, con-

tributed to a downward move in the foreign exchange value of the dollar

late in the intermeeting period. This recent decline largely accounted

for the net depreciation of the dollar of 2-1/4 percent on a weighted

1. The borrowing allowance was reduced by $25 million to $75 mil-
lion in implementing the easing action of April 9 and was subsequently
increased to $100 million on April 30 in anticipation of increases in
the demand for seasonal credit.

average basis over the entire period. In Germany, short-term interest

rates edged up on continued rapid money growth and adverse labor market

developments, while long-term rates were about unchanged. However, a

number of other countries took steps to ease monetary policy. Monetary

authorities in Japan and the United Kingdom lowered official interest

rates, and short-term rates in Canada also declined. Despite the Bank

of Japan's easing move, long-term rates rose about 20 basis points on

balance, possibly reflecting uncertainties associated with the effects

of the Japanese stock market decline and the policy response to it.

Major Japanese stock indexes rallied sharply in the first part of May,

but fell back late in the intermeeting period after the Olympia and York

filing. The net loss over the intermeeting period was 5 to 6-1/2 per-

cent.

The Desk did not

intervene in foreign exchange markets.

(4) The broad monetary aggregates contracted in April, falling

well below the track consistent with expectations at the time of the

last FOMC meeting that M2 and M3 would increase at 3-1/2 and 1-1/2 per-

cent rates, respectively, over March to June. M2 fell 2 percent at an

annual rate last month, while M3 contracted at a 3-1/2 percent rate,

after smaller declines for both aggregates in March. These decreases

left M2 and M3 in April slightly above and slightly below the lower ends

of their respective target ranges. Available data for early May suggest

a resumption in money growth, although on a month-average basis M2 and

M3 are likely to stay around the lower bounds of their ranges and below

the paths implied by the Committee's specifications.



(5) Some of the recent declines in the aggregates appears

attributable to temporary factors. Nonwithheld personal tax payments

were unusually weak, and the associated buildup of liquid balances in

March and April undoubtedly was less than incorporated in seasonal

factors. Partly as a result, expansion of transactions and other liquid

deposits slowed substantially in April. M1 increased at a much-reduced

5 percent rate, while the sum of savings, MMDAs, and money market mutual

funds expanded at an 8 percent rate, near the pace of March but down

considerably from that of the first two months of the year. In

addition, a surge in RTC activity around the end of the quarter likely

played a part in a further sharp drop in retail deposits. Along with

these factors restraining M2, M3 has been depressed by an appreciable

runoff of Yankee CDs by branches of Japanese banks over the last six

weeks; these banks have found some decreased acceptance of their

liabilities from investors concerned about the consequences of the

decline in real estate and stock prices in Japan.

(6) Even after taking account of these special factors, mone-

tary growth appears to have been unusually sluggish. Subdued demand for

M2 relative to income was reflected in an increase in velocity in the

first quarter, despite little change in average opportunity costs. The

unprecedented steepness of the yield curve and low rates on longer-term

retail time deposits relative to market rates have encouraged investors

to shift funds from deposits into the capital markets, as suggested by

very large flows into bond and stock mutual funds. Indeed, the backup

in intermediate- and long-term market interest rates that occurred

reserves to a 4-1/2 percent pace in April. Currency rose at an 8 per-
cent pace over the month and the monetary base at a 5 percent rate.



earlier in the year strengthened those incentives. Similarly, compara-

tively high rates on consumer debt may be prompting households to use

deposit balances to pay down or to limit increases in such indebtedness.

In addition, the deceleration of money growth after the surge early this

year may signal some tapering-off of actual and expected spending.

(7) Aggregate credit flows appear to have remained weak

through April, particularly outside the federal government. Private

debt growth edged up during the first quarter, but remained appreciably

slower than nominal GDP. The anemic expansion of debt likely reflected

continued weak demand, as lenders, if anything, seemed to be moving

toward an increased willingness to supply credit. In the business sec-

tor, little evidence of a further pickup in credit usage has emerged

recently. Business loans at commercial banks declined 6 percent at an

annual rate in April, despite indications that banks had been no more

restrictive in approving loans, and commercial paper of nonfinancial

firms ran off. Firms continued to issue sizable amounts of bonds in

public markets in April, where narrowing spreads suggested ample

appetite by investors. But a substantial proportion of the proceeds

were used to pay down high cost debt, and further equity issuance also

has limited demands on credit markets. Adjusted for securitizations,

consumer loans at banks declined slightly over the past two months,

despite evidence that some banks have become more willing to make such

loans, and borrowing from banks under home equity lines remained modest.

Judging from data on applications, mortgage borrowing likely is retreat-

ing somewhat from its strong pace of earlier in the year. State and

local governments continued to tap longer-term markets at a brisk clip

last month, but a sizable proportion of the proceeds went to refund

existing debt. Federal borrowing remained heavy, boosting overall debt

growth. Through March, total debt of domestic nonfinancial sectors grew

at a 4 percent rate from its fourth-quarter base, leaving this aggregate

a little below its 4-1/2 to 8-1/2 percent monitoring range.

Policy Alternatives

(8) Three policy alternatives are presented below for Commit-

tee consideration. Under alternative B, federal funds would continue

trading in the 3-3/4 percent area; extending the current assumption of

$100 million for adjustment plus seasonal borrowing would be expected to

preserve the current 1/4 percentage point spread of the funds rate above

the discount rate, at least over the first part of the intermeeting

period.4 Under alternative A, the federal funds rate would drop to

3-1/4 percent. This reduction could be accomplished at the current dis-

count rate by lowering the initial specification for borrowing to $75

million, placing the federal funds rate below the discount rate. The

same federal funds rate could be achieved by cutting the discount rate

1/2 percentage point to 3 percent and specifying borrowing at the

alternative B level of $100 million. Under the policy tightening of

alternative C, the federal funds rate would rise to 4-1/4 percent, in

association with higher initial borrowing of $125 million.

(9) Although market participants apparently view the prospects

for the next policy action as more heavily favoring an easing than a

tightening, no immediate policy change seems to remain the predominant

view. Consequently, prices in domestic credit and foreign exchange

markets probably would not show much reaction should the Committee main-

tain current reserve market conditions by choosing alternative B at this

meeting. Economic expansion along the lines projected in the greenbook

and money growth remaining near the lower end of the Committee's range

(discussed below) are likely to continue to foster some downward bias in

4. Upward technical adjustments to the borrowing assumption may be
required to allow for some continued uptrend in seasonal borrowing
during the spring; the extent of such adjustments will be limited by
the new market-based rate on such credit.



market expectations for reserve market pressures for a time. Maintain-

ing unchanged conditions over the entire intermeeting period eventually

could cause some short-term rates to edge higher and dollar exchange

rates to strengthen a little as markets reassessed the Federal Reserve's

intentions. However, long-term yields are likely to remain fairly

steady or possibly even edge down as expectations for growth and infla-

tion are trimmed back; the passage of an effective balanced budget

amendment would add to downward pressures on long-term rates.

(10) The extent of the easing of reserve market conditions

under alternative A would catch market participants unawares, and the

1/2 point drop in the federal funds rate would induce a nearly compar-

able decline in other money market interest rates. Commercial banks

are likely to pass through the funds-rate reduction fully to the prime

rate, while retaining a relatively wide spread over costs of funds.

Recent declines in long-term rates, occurring as markets were beginning

to build in a possible easing, suggest that a decrease in bond yields

might accompany such an action. However, following an easing move,

especially of the dimensions of alternative A, investors would become

more assured of sustained economic expansion, but also less confident of

any longer-term decrease in inflation, which together would limit any

reductions in long-term rates. With interest rates on dollar-denomi-

nated securities becoming less attractive relative to returns abroad,

the exchange value of the dollar would adjust downward.

(11) The more restrictive policy of alternative C would come

as a considerable surprise to market participants. Short-term interest

rates would rise at least commensurately with the federal funds rate.

Long-term rates might increase relatively little, as investors shifted

their concerns toward the potential for renewed economic weakness for a



-10-

time rather than inflationary pressures, in light of the signal of

Federal Reserve resolve to achieve disinflation gains. Stock prices

probably would slide as dividend streams expected by investors are

reduced and discounted at somewhat higher rates. Quality spreads on

private paper over Treasuries also could widen some from their current

narrow levels. The dollar would strengthen appreciably on foreign

exchange markets.

(12) Projected monetary growth under the three policy alter-

natives is given in the table below. (More detailed data are presented

in the table and charts on the following pages.) Under all three alter-

natives, M2 and M3 are expected to resume growing in May and June, as

the temporarily depressing effects on money demand in March and April of

low tax payments and accelerated RTC resolutions fade out, and as some

stimulus from the System's most recent easing takes hold. However,

decreases in the volume of mortgage prepayments in prospect will have a

depressing effect on demand deposits and MMDAs. The broader aggregates

would end up in June only around the lower bounds of their annual growth

cones--well below levels projected in the last bluebook. Although

projected growth in nominal GDP for the second quarter has been revised

down somewhat since the last greenbook, the staff is interpreting the

shortfall in money to an important extent as signifying weaker underly-

ing demands for money and credit relative to spending and interest rates

than anticipated at the last meeting--that is, a shift in money demand.

The forces that have held back depository intermediation in recent

years--households and businesses deleveraging, borrowers substituting

other financing for depository credit, and investors shifting from low-

interest retail time deposits out a steep yield curve into bond mutual

funds--seem to be persisting.

(13) Growth of M2 is projected to average 2-1/2 percent at an

annual rate over May and June with the essentially stable money market

interest rates of alternative B. Most of the pickup should stem from

the liquid components, as outflows to cover tax payments prove to be

smaller than implicitly anticipated by seasonal factors. In particular,

Ml is likely to return to a double-digit pace over May and June, led by

a sharp reacceleration of demand and other checkable deposits. Even

so, M2 growth from March to June would be only 1 percent, as would its

growth on a quarterly-average basis, far below the staff's projected

pace of 5 percent for nominal GDP. The staff believes that M2 velocity

will continue to increase in coming quarters but at a much slower rate

as the unusual factors inducing the current quarter's increase in M2

velocity wane. For the year as a whole, V2 is projected to be up about

2 percent in association with annual M2 growth of 3-1/2 percent.

5. Adjusted for the change in reserve requirements, total reserves
and the monetary base would grow by 10-1/4 and 7-3/4 percent, respec-
tively, over May and June.

(14) Under alternative B, the projected turnaround in M2 over

May and June should show through to M3, which is expected to register an

annual growth rate of 1-3/4 percent; from March to June, M3 would be

about unchanged. The slower expansion of M3 than of M2 would reflect

continued runoffs of large time deposits, as net credit extension at

depositories lags behind inflows to retail deposits. The decline of

business loans at banks might moderate as inventory liquidation slows

and banks become more willing to lend, especially to smaller businesses.

However, business credit demands are expected to be restrained overall,

as projected cash flow about matches capital spending, and to remain

focused on longer-term markets. The modest projected rise in spending

for new homes and durable goods, together with continuing cautious

attitudes toward debt, should limit household borrowing as well. Conse-

quently, growth of the debt of nonfederal sectors is projected to con-

tinue at only a 2-3/4 percent annual rate from March to June. Federal

debt, by contrast, is expected to post a more rapid 13 percent rate of

growth over these three months. Total domestic nonfinancial debt is

anticipated to expand at a little above a 5 percent rate over the second

quarter, lifting it in June to just above the lower bound of its 4-1/2

to 8-1/2 percent monitoring range.

(15) The growth of M2, M3, and debt through June would be

little affected by either the easing or tightening of reserve conditions

under alternatives A or C. More of the impact of these actions could be

expected to be felt in the second half of the year. If the lower funds

rate of alternative A is maintained through year-end, growth of M2 for

the year could be expected to come in around 4 percent. Some impetus to

money demand would derive from the reduced opportunity cost of holding

liquid balances and, later in the year, from added strength in spending.



-14-

If alternative C is adopted and the higher rates maintained, a 3 percent

annual pace for M2 would be more likely. Overall, based on recent ex-

perience, the impetus from changed short-term interest rates is project-

ed to have a considerably smaller effect on M2 growth than embodied in

historical relationships. While growth of M3 for the year of 2 percent

is expected under the constant funds rate of alternative B, this projec-

tion would have to be shaded up or down by perhaps 1/4 point if alterna-

tive A or C were chosen at this FOMC meeting and sustained for the rest

of the year.

Directive Language

(16) Draft language for the operational paragraph is present-

ed below. An alternative for the last sentence is shown in brackets.

This alternative would stress the Committee's expectation of a resump-

tion of growth in broad money over May and June, in contrast to the

traditional three-month specification, which would show little if any

monetary growth (for example, 1 percent for M2 and zero for M3 under

alternative B).

OPERATIONAL PARAGRAPH

In the implementation of policy for the immediate

future, the Committee seeks to DECREASE SOMEWHAT/maintain/

INCREASE SOMEWHAT the existing degree of pressure on reserve

positions. In the context of the Committee's long-run

objectives for price stability and sustainable economic

growth, and giving careful consideration to economic,

financial, and monetary developments, slightly (SOMEWHAT)

greater reserve restraint might (WOULD) or slightly

(SOMEWHAT) lesser reserve restraint (MIGHT) would be

acceptable in the intermeeting period. The contemplated

reserve conditions are expected to be consistent with growth

of M2 and M3 over the period from March through June at

annual rates of about ____ AND ____ [DEL: 3-1/2 and 1-1/2] percent,

respectively. [The contemplated reserve conditions are

expected to be consistent with a resumption of growth in M2

and M3 over the period from April to June to annual rates of

about ____ and ____ percent, respectively.]
