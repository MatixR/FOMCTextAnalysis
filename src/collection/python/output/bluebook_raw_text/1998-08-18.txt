Prefatory Note 

 
 

The attached document represents the most complete and accurate version 
available based on original copies culled from the files of the FOMC Secretariat at the 
Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System.  This electronic document was 
created through a comprehensive digitization process which included identifying the best-
preserved paper copies, scanning those copies,1 and then making the scanned versions 
text-searchable.2  Though a stringent quality assurance process was employed, some 
imperfections may remain. 
 

Please note that this document may contain occasional gaps in the text.  These 
gaps are the result of a redaction process that removed information obtained on a

scanned images were deskewed (to remove the effects of printer- and scanner-introduced tilting) and lightly 
cleaned (to remove dark spots caused by staple holes, hole punches, and other blemishes caused after initial 
printing). 
2 A two-step process was used.  An advanced optimal character recognition computer program (OCR) first 
created electronic text from the document image.  Where the OCR results were inconclusive, staff checked

Class I -- FOMC

MONETARY POLICY ALTERNATIVES

Recent Developments

(1) The stable policy adopted at the July Committee meeting came as no surprise to

market participants. In the event, the federal funds rate averaged just a little above its intended

level of 5-1/2 percent over the intermeeting period.1 Investors appeared mostly to shrug off

incoming data on the U.S. economy indicating more underlying strength in domestic demand and

economic activity than foreseen, focusing instead on overseas developments. In July, as the

prospects for meaningful policy initiatives in Japan initially appeared to improve with a change

in government and the yen/dollar rate stabilized, yields on Treasury notes and bonds rose

somewhat (chart). In August, however, optimism about Japanese policy faded; a weakening yen

against the dollar and its implications for a number of emerging market economies, especially

those in Asia with currencies tied to the dollar, along with deepening troubles in Russia, induced

a widespread shift toward safe-haven currencies and securities. Treasury yields moved lower

both on this flight to quality and on the assessment of market participants that a higher dollar and

weaker aggregate demand abroad would damp U.S. output and inflation in the medium term.

Concerns about the profit outlook, especially in light of continuing turmoil in Asia, weighed on

private securities markets in the United States. Equity prices, as gauged by the Wilshire 5000,

were down about 7-1/2 percent over the intermeeting period, and risk spreads on junk bonds rose

appreciably further. These developments apparently strengthened the conviction that monetary

1 The switch to lagged reserve requirements in the maintenance period beginning July 30
went smoothly for both depository institutions and the Federal Reserve System.

policy would be on hold for longer than previously anticipated and encouraged a minority view

that the next move could well be toward ease. On balance over the intermeeting period, Treasury

yields fell as much as 1/4 percentage point, with declines greatest in the intermediate-term

maturity range.

(2) Against the backdrop of waning confidence that Japanese authorities will deal

effectively with financial institution problems and provide adequate fiscal stimulus, the dollar

appreciated over the intermeeting period 5-3/4 percent against the yen, and the Japanese stock

market fell 5 percent overall, with bank stock prices down 18 percent. The weakness in the yen

renewed speculation that China may choose to devalue the renminbi, which added to downward

pressures on the Hong Kong dollar. Higher interest rates in Hong Kong, data showing

unemployment at a fifteen-year high, and poor earnings reports sent the Hang Seng stock price

index down more than 15 percent. In most other Asian economies, stock markets were off

significantly. Asset prices in Russia continued to fall in often disorderly markets. The ruble

traded near, and at times below, the lower edge of its official band, and banks encountered

funding problems as concerns mounted about the Russian budget and prospects for debt

repayment, in part stemming from further softness in oil prices. Russian equity prices plunged

more than 25 percent, and spreads on Russian Brady bonds over U.S. Treasuries soared more

than 61/2 percentage points. Credit-risk spreads for Brady bonds of other emerging market

countries increased from 40 to 400 basis points over the period. Declining oil prices and slack

demand for other commodities put pressure on other currencies as well, including the Mexican

peso and Canadian dollar. Most interest rates rose in Canada, as market participants increasingly

expected the currency's weakness to trigger monetary policy tightening, but the deepening crisis



-3-

in Asia and Russia induced decreases in market interest rates in other Western industrial

countries. Data releases showing a slowdown in U.K. economic growth contributed to an

unwinding of expectations for an imminent rate hike by the Bank of England and a rise in the

dollar against the pound. The dollar was little changed on balance against continental European

currencies.

The Desk did not intervene

during the period for the accounts of the System or the Treasury.

(3) After averaging nearly 6 percent over March to June, M2 growth moderated to a 5

percent rate in July. This slowing was expected and moved M2 growth down closer to the

projected third-quarter increase in nominal income. Recent stock market weakness seems to

have been associated with some shift in household investment preferences, as evidenced by the

cessation of flows into equity mutual funds and increased flows into M2 money funds in late July

and early August. M3 was about flat in July, even though bank credit grew at a 5 percent pace;

however, large time deposits ran off sharply, owing largely to substitution of overseas sources of

funding for deposits, particularly at the U.S. branches and agencies of European banks.

Institutional money funds also declined in July as investors evidently shifted into market

instruments around quarter end to take advantage of a temporary spike in short-term interest rates

that was only partially reflected in more slowly adjusting money fund yields. From the fourth

quarter of last year through July, M2 and M3 grew at rates of 7 percent and 81/2 percent,

respectively.

(4) Borrowing by households and businesses has edged down of late, but remains

brisk, boosted by the heavy pace of equity retirements and robust private spending. With long-



-4-

term interest rates low, borrowing has been concentrated in bond and fixed-rate mortgage

markets. Although investors in securities markets seem to have become a bit more cautious, the

August survey of senior loan officers suggested that standards at commercial banks were little

changed over the past three months and terms on business loans were eased slightly further on

net.2 The federal government has continued to pay down debt on a seasonally adjusted basis.

Growth of total domestic nonfinancial debt has slowed to the 5 percent area in recent months,

leaving its growth from the fourth quarter of last year through June at a 6 percent rate.

2 The slight narrowing of spreads reported in the survey is somewhat at odds with
anecdotal information from market sources that spreads have stabilized or ticked up for broadly
syndicated business loans.

Policy Alternatives

(5) Compared with the forecast prepared for the July Greenbook, the staff projection

now calls for slightly less core inflation, reflecting in part a higher foreign exchange value of the

dollar as well as somewhat less pressure in labor markets. Assuming an unchanged stance of

monetary policy, the Greenbook forecasts that real GDP will expand over the second half of this

year a little more slowly than the rate of growth of its potential. Next year, output growth

moderates to 1-3/4 percent, below the 2 percent lower end of the FOMC members' central

tendency range reported in July. The underlying pace of domestic final demand growth is

expected to ebb appreciably, owing partly to the drop in equity prices as well as to the

multiplier/accelerator effects of earlier downshifts in inventory investment and net exports. The

unemployment rate should edge up to a little more than 5 percent by the end of next year.

Although joblessness would remain below its estimated natural rate, the effects of tight labor

markets on inflation should be about offset by lower inflation expectations and the continuing

pass-through of dollar appreciation; abstracting from technical changes, core CPI inflation is

expected to hold steady in 1999. The staff projects that the overall CPI will rise about 2 percent

during 1999, a tad below its forecast for the June/July meeting and around the lower end of the

Committee members' central tendency range.

(6) If the Committee found the staff forecast, with inflation and unemployment both

staying relatively low, to be both a reasonable expectation and a desirable outcome, it

presumably would maintain the current 51/2 percent federal funds rate, as under alternative B.

The Committee could still favor alternative B even if it saw higher inflation eventually, but was

rather uncertain about its expectation of the eventual pickup in inflation, given the surprisingly



-7-

favorable price performance of recent years. The odds on a significant price acceleration within a

year or so may be seen as low; in such circumstances, delay would not materially jeopardize the

Committee's goal of containing inflation and would buy some time to accumulate information on

the evolving dynamics of inflation and hence the need for tightening. Moreover, the Committee

may want to weigh any concerns about higher inflation against the increasingly precarious

conditions in global financial markets. The greater fragility of these markets evident over the

intermeeting period may suggest that the potential for adverse effects of a tightening of U.S.

monetary policy on other economies has risen further.

(7) With inflation low, aggregate demand apparently decelerating, and the outlook for

Asia quite uncertain, market participants anticipate no policy action at this meeting, and market

interest rates are likely to be little affected by selection of alternative B. Under the Greenbook

forecast, information about prospective corporate earnings is likely to disappoint investors,

keeping equity prices from rebounding and possibly precipitating a further decline. Absent such

a decline, which could weaken the exchange value of the dollar as investments in the United

States looked less desirable, the dollar should edge higher in coming months, most notably

against the yen: The Japanese economy is likely to remain weak and skeptical market

participants probably will require substantial, concrete actions to deal with the financial system

and the economy before confidence can begin to recover. Should troubles in foreign markets

intensify and spread further, the dollar would tend to strengthen more noticeably, equity prices

would encounter additional downward pressures amid heightened worries about profits, and

interest rates in the United States would continue to decline across the yield curve, reflecting

both a more pronounced flight to quality and developing expectations of monetary policy easing.



-8-

(8) Although the staff forecast envisions a relatively benign domestic macroeconomic

outcome under current money market conditions, the Committee might be concerned either that

in the staff forecast progress toward price stability was stalling or that in its own view inflation

was more likely to escalate noticeably. In either case, it may prefer to apply additional monetary

restraint at this meeting, as in the 25 basis point increase in the federal funds rate of

alternative C. A prediction of worsening inflation pressures might be based in part on

unambiguously tight labor market conditions and the uptrend already evident in wages and

compensation. The odds on much softening of labor markets might be seen as low in light of the

surprising momentum of domestic demand, which has been sustaining growth of employment

and income. And while the Committee recently decided not to tighten, in part because of

unsettled conditions abroad, a continued absence of action would not be desirable if the

Committee were reasonably confident that the domestic economic situation was pointing to

higher inflation rates before very long. In such a situation, delay would only increase the degree

of tightening that would ultimately be necessary. Delayed but greater tightening could be even

more disruptive to financial markets, since economies abroad may not be sufficiently improved

and markets sufficiently settled to absorb the heavier blow.

(9) Markets would be somewhat unsettled by the 25 basis point firming action of

alternative C at this meeting, which would come as a surprise. Short-term market interest rates

probably would back up by at least the rise in the federal funds rate. Investors would project

lower earnings and use higher discount factors, and equity prices almost certainly would fall

significantly further. Boosted nonetheless by higher interest rates, the foreign exchange value of

the dollar likely would firm as well, with particularly large increases against the yen, and Asian



-9-

countries with currencies tied to the dollar would confront considerable pressures to adjust their

pegs. Longer-term dollar interest rates would probably jump initially in response to the rise in

short-term rates, but might reverse course before long if market participants began to question the

likely duration of the tightening move in view of the added strength in the dollar and lower

equity prices; still, real long-term rates are likely to remain at higher levels for a while. Credit-

risk spreads on domestic private debt, as well as on the obligations of a number of foreign

governments and firms, likely would widen noticeably.

(10) In view of recent developments in global financial markets, the Committee might

be inclined to consider a 25 basis point easing of monetary policy, as in alternative A.

Aggregate demand in the United States apparently has already decelerated appreciably, and

Committee members may believe that the staff forecast does not give enough weight to ongoing

deflationary forces coming from developments abroad. Moreover, the staff forecast may be

viewed as underplaying the restrictive effects of recent changes in U.S. financial markets, despite

declines in some nominal yields: The dollar has strengthened on net against a broad basket of

currencies; U.S. equity prices have fallen significantly; and declines in inflation expectations may

have largely accounted for the decline in nominal interest rates, leaving real rates little changed.

Even in the context of the staff view of the economic outlook, with domestic inflation currently

at low levels, the Committee may be willing to risk a slightly less satisfactory outcome in terms

of U.S. inflation performance to help foster a recovery in foreign economies, which would be in

the long-run interest of the United States. Lower interest rates would help ensure that domestic

demand in the United States remains reasonably vigorous. And lower rates, along with

somewhat less strength in the dollar, would benefit a number of foreign economies, even those



-10-

with currencies not tied to the dollar; for those in the latter group, credit-risk spreads would tend

to decline as concerns about foreign debt repayment abated a bit, and the tendency for their

currencies to appreciate would give them room to adopt a somewhat less restrictive monetary

policy.

(11) Under the unchanged money market conditions assumed in the staff forecast,

money and debt growth is expected to decelerate in coming quarters. Expansion of money and

debt, however, continues to outpace that of nominal GDP this year as well as next. Increases in

household sector debt should be restrained by slowing growth in nominal income and the less

rapid advance in expenditures on consumer durables and housing. In the business sector, lower

rates of growth of fixed investment and a slower pace of inventory accumulation will reduce

needs for credit, but this tendency is partly offset in the staff forecast by a leveling out of internal

funds as profits weaken and by the need to finance equity retirements associated with strong

merger and acquisition activity. As income growth slows and profits decline, lenders should

become a bit more cautious, but the projection does not include a substantial pulling back in

credit availability. Federal debt will continue to contract modestly, reflecting continued unified

budget surpluses. On balance, domestic nonfinancial sector debt is projected to expand at about

a 5 percent annual rate over the remainder of the year, leaving this aggregate on a track to expand

at about a 5-3/4 percent rate over 1998 as a whole, somewhat above the midpoint of its 3 to 7

percent annual range.

(12) M2 and M3 are forecast to expand at 5 and 7-3/4 percent annual rates, respectively,

from July to December under alternative B. The moderation in money reflects the expectation of

slightly slower growth in nominal GDP over the second half of the year. In addition, the staff



- 11 -

expects a less-rapid decline in M2 velocity in the second half, in part because the expansion of

mortgage refinancing activity, which had boosted M2 growth over the first half of the year,

comes to a halt. Bank credit is projected to rise less rapidly in the second half of the year than in

the first, reflecting a slowing pace of securities acquisitions as well as some moderation in loan

growth, damping banks' needs for funding through M3-type instruments. Despite the slowing in

M2 and M3 growth during the second half, both aggregates are expected to overshoot their

annual ranges for the year as a whole.3

3 According to elasticities based on staff econometric models, a rise in the federal funds
rate on the order of 1-1/2 percentage points at this meeting would be necessary to restrain M2 to its
annual range by the end of this year. Of course, this calculation does not capture any unusual
reactions that might arise in current circumstances from a tightening of this magnitude.

NOTE: Weekly data for columns 1 through 12 are week-ending averages. As of September 1997, data in column 6 are interpolated from data on certain commercial paper trades settled by the Depository Trust Company; prior
to that, they reflect an average of offering rates placed by several leading dealers. Columns 13 and 14 are 1-day quotes for Friday or Thursday, respectively. Column 14 is the Bond Buyer revenue index. Column 15 is

the average contract rate on new commitments for fixed-rate mortgages (FRMs) with 80 percent loan-to-value ratios at major institutional lenders. Column 16 is the average initial contract rate on new commitments for 1-

year, adjustable-rate mortgages (ARMs) at major institutional lenders offering both FRMs and ARMs with the same number of discount points.
