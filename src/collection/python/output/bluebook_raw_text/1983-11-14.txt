The attached document represents the most complete and accurate version 
available based on original copies culled from the files of the FOMC Secretariat at the 
Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System.  This electronic document was 
created through a comprehensive digitization process which included identifying the best-
preserved paper copies, scanning those copies,1 and then making the scanned versions 
text-searchable.2  Though a stringent quality assurance process was employed, some 
imperfections may remain. 
 

Please note that this document may contain occasional gaps in the text.  These 
gaps are the result of a redaction process that removed information obtained on a 
confidential basis.  All redacted passages are exempt from disclosure under applicable

1 In some cases, original copies needed to be photocopied before being scanned into electronic format.  All 
scanned images were deskewed (to remove the effects of printer- and scanner-introduced tilting) and lightly 
cleaned (to remove dark spots caused by staple holes, hole punches, and other blemishes caused after initial 
printing). 
2 A two-step process was used.  An advanced optimal character recognition computer program (OCR) first 
created electronic text from the document image.  Where the OCR results were inconclusive, staff checked 
and corrected the text as necessary.   Please note that the numbers and text in charts and tables were not 
reliably recognized by the OCR process and were not checked or corrected by staff.

MONETARY POLICY ALTERNATIVES

Recent Developments

(1) M2 is estimated to have expanded at about a 9 percent annual

rate in October, near the 8-1/2 percent pace specified by the FOMC for the

September-to-December period. The acceleration of M2 from its 4-1/2 per-

cent rate of September was attributable to faster growth in its nontransactions

components, other than savings deposits and MMDAs; small time deposits, which

have been growing rapidly since midsummer, were probably boosted a little by

the October 1 deregulation of interest rates. From its February-March base,

M2 had increased at a 7-3/4 percent annual rate by October, in the lower half

of its 7 to 10 percent longer-run range.

(2) M3 growth in October, at around an 8-1/4 percent annual rate,

also was close to the 8-1/2 percent pace sought by the FOMC for the September-

to-December period. While issuance of large CDs by thrift institutions

continued heavy, banks allowed large certificates to run off more rapidly in

October in the face of large inflows of other deposits. For the year-to-date,

M3 has increased at a 9 percent annual rate, somewhat below the upper end of

its 6-1/2 to 9-1/2 percent longer-term range.

(3) Expansion in M1, at about a 1-1/2 percent annual rate, re-

mained low in October for the third month in a row. Currency grew at about

a 10 percent annual rate, but other checkable deposits were about flat for the

second straight month, and demand deposits registered their third consecutive

monthly decline. By October, M1 was in the lower half of its longer-run

monitoring range of 5 to 9 percent, having increased at almost a 6 percent

annual rate since the second quarter.

(4) Growth in the debt of domestic nonfinancial sectors is esti-

mated to have slowed last month, dropping to about a 7 percent annual rate,

as funds raised by private sectors apparently moderated further. Growth

of debt from year end 1982 through October is now estimated at almost a

10-1/2 percent annual rate, as compared with its 8-1/2 to 11-1/2 percent

monitoring range. Household credit demands continued fairly large last

month, and business credit demands were again relatively light, probably

reflecting strong internal cash flows. Business borrowing recently has

shifted even more toward short-term sources. Commercial paper issuance

remained strong in October and business borrowing from commercial banks

picked up; business loans at large banks declined further, but sizable in-

creases were recorded at small banks and foreign branches of U.S. banks.

(5) Total reserves contracted in October at nearly a 4 percent

annual rate, reflecting a decline in required reserves associated partly

with weakness in interbank deposits at member banks. The monetary base, by

contrast, expanded at a 7 percent annual rate owing to the rapid growth of

currency. Over the intermeeting period, regular plus seasonal borrowing

at the discount window averaged close to the $650 million level assumed in

constructing the weekly nonborrowed reserve paths, as substantial borrowing

late in the period offset previous shortfalls. The variations in borrowing

resulted in part from unexpected changes on the last day of the statement

week in market factors affecting reserves.



(6) Federal funds have traded primarily in a 9-1/4 to 9-1/2 per-

cent range since the last FOMC meeting. Other market interest rates generally

have moved higher, however, in response to incoming data indicating continued

strength in economic activity and, most recently, to uncertainty about the

pattern of Treasury financing pending resolution of difficulties in raising the

debt ceiling. The largest rate increases have been in the bond area, where

yields have risen 25 to 35 basis points over the intermeeting period, while

short-term rates have moved up 5 to 15 basis points. In contrast, primary

conventional mortgage rates declined about 20 basis points since the early

October meeting, and the ceiling rate on FHA/VA mortgages was trimmed 1/2 of

a percentage point to 12-1/2 percent. Most broad-based stock price indexes

have fallen since early October, with some bank stocks registering sizable

declines amid intensified concerns about loans to developing countries; such

concerns are not evident in the CD market, however.

(7) The dollar has appreciated by about one percent, on a weighted

average basis, since the last FOMC meeting. The dollar's rise was associ-

ated with changing expectations about the likely course of U.S. interest

rates and with an intensification of geopolitical tensions. The German mark

was also affected by the revelation in early November of difficulties in a

German commercial bank.

. Gold declined by a further 3 percent

and silver by 15 percent since the last FOMC meeting. These declines

probably reflected in small part the recent rise in long-term U.S. interest

rates but, more importantly, sales from official silver stocks by Peru and

the associated increase in expected possible sales of precious metals by

other hard-pressed developing country borrowers.

(9) Alternative B involves the same growth in the broader

aggregates than is currently specified for the September-to-December

period; alternatives A and C call for somewhat faster and slower growth

in the broader aggregates. However, in all cases, expected M1 growth is

lower than the Committee's current short-run specifications, given the

unexpectedly slow growth of this aggregate in October. Under all of the

alternatives, the monetary aggregates would be expected to remain comfort-

ably within their longer-run ranges for 1983, with M1 and M2 in the lower

halves of their respective ranges and M3 in the upper part of its range;

growth rates from longer-run bases to the fourth quarter under each

alternative are shown in the detailed table.

(10) The specifications of alternative B are expected to be

consistent with little change in bank reserve positions and money market

conditions from those recently prevailing. Borrowing at the discount

window would be anticipated to be around $650 million and the funds rate

between 9-1/4 and 9-1/2 percent, perhaps closer to the latter rate. De-

spite a pickup in growth of transactions deposits, nonborrowed reserves

would probably change little under this alternative over the two-month

November-December period, owing primarily to the impact of lagged reserve

accounting and changes in the deposit mix.

(11) M2 growth is expected to slow a little in November and

December under alternative B from its rate in October, when its nontrans-

actions component was probably boosted slightly by the October 1 deregula-

tion. Although growth of 8-1/2 percent over the final three months of

the year would represent a considerable pickup from the pace of the

previous three months, on a quarterly average basis the expansion of

M2 would fall well short of projected nominal GNP growth for the second

consecutive quarter; nonetheless, the resulting increase in M2 velocity

of 3 to 4 percent would not be atypical for this stage of an economic

recovery. M3 growth is expected to be sustained at, or a little above,

its October pace. Should the decline in the Treasury cash balance be

exaggerated because of debt ceiling problems, growth in M2 and M3 may be

somewhat stronger as banks seek additional deposit funds to support

credit expansion in the absence of their usual Treasury balances.

(12) M1 is expected to accelerate over November and December

to about a 7-1/2 percent annual rate from its very low growth rates of

the past few months, primarily in response to the underlying strength



-9-

in transactions needs. We would not expect any very substantial effect

on M1--certainly not a lingering effect and perhaps not even a transitory

one--from a drop in Treasury cash balances because of debt ceiling problems;

some investors may leave funds in cash for a time while awaiting Treasury

issues delayed by the debt ceiling but for the most part such funds would

probably be invested in other instruments.

(13) Even with the substantial pickup in M1 growth expected

between now and year-end (with the largest increase anticipated for Dec-

ember on a monthly average basis) M1 growth from the third to the fourth

quarter would be only around 3-1/4 percent at an annual rate. Assuming

nominal GNP grows at the 11-1/2 percent annual rate forecast by the

staff, velocity growth would be by far the largest of the current recovery.

Such an increase in velocity is larger than is implicit in many econometric

equations predicting money demand-suggesting some unwinding of the

unusually large build-up in cash balances seen since late 1982. In the

absence of any further such unwinding, however, continuation of money

market rates around current levels could be associated with a tendency

for M1 in the first quarter to be in the upper part of the FOMC's tenta-

tive longer-term range for 1984.

(14) Market interest rates might tend to rise a bit under

alternative B, although the likelihood or extent of any such upward

pressure would depend in part on whether reserve paths led to federal

funds trading more consistently near 9-1/2 percent than has been the

case recently. In any event, credit markets will have to absorb a

large volume of new Treasury issues in a short period at a time when

private credit demands may be picking up. On balance, a 3-month Treasury



-10-

bill rate in an 8-3/4 to 9-1/4 percent range might be anticipated, with

bond yields unchanged or rising slightly.

(15) A pickup in debt issuance from the very moderate pace of

October is expected over the balance of the year. Over the fourth quarter

as a whole, the debt of all domestic nonfinancial sectors is projected to

rise at about a 9-1/4 percent annual rate, leaving this aggregate just

above the midpoint of its 8-1/2 to 11-1/2 percent 1983 monitoring range.

Consumer credit demands are likely to be stronger in the fourth than the

third quarter, while residential mortgage formation may be maintained near

its recent pace. At the current level of bond rates, much of business

borrowing would probably continue to fall on banks and the commercial

paper market.

(16) Alternative A involves an easing in bank reserve positions

and money market conditions over the next few weeks--with borrowing from

the discount window falling into the $350-450 million range and the federal

funds rate dropping to around 8-3/4 to 9 percent. Growth of nonborrowed

reserves would likely average around 5 percent at an annual rate over

November and December.

(17) M1 under this alternative would be expected to accelerate

in November and December sufficiently to bring growth for the last three

months of the year to around 6-1/2 percent, very near the Committee's

current specification. Growth of M2 and M3, however, would likely exceed

the Committee's current 8-1/2 percent short-term objective, although re-

maining within their longer-term ranges. However, much of the impact on

money growth of easier bank reserve positions late in the fourth quarter

would be felt beginning early next year, through the impact on money demand



-11-

both of lower interest rates and the transactions needs associated with

stronger GNP growth.

(18) The extent of easing in money market conditions contem-

plated under alternative A would probably result in a sizable decline

in other short-term interest rates, with the 3-month Treasury bill falling

into the 8 to 8-1/2 percent area, and a decline in the dollar on foreign

exchange markets. The reaction of bond yields may be more muted, espe-

cially if incoming data indicated not only continued strength in economic

activity but also a very substantial pickup in money stock growth.

(19) Somewhat tighter reserve conditions are contemplated under

alternative C, with discount window borrowing in the neighborhood of $800

to $900 million and the federal funds rate rising to around 10 percent.

Under these conditions, growth in M1 and M2 for 1983 would be expected to

move down further in the lower halves of their respective longer-term

ranges, while M3 would come in closer to the midpoint of its range.

Market interest rates would rise sharply from current levels under this

alternative. Such a tightening over the period immediately ahead does

not appear to be widely anticipated in the market despite the recent

strength of the economy, given growth of the monetary aggregates well

within their ranges and concerns generated by international debt problems.

The 3-month Treasury bill rate would probably move up in a 9-1/4 to 9-3/4

percent range, and bond yields would probably adjust similarly, at least

initially. The recent decline on yields in fixed-rate mortgages would

probably be reversed, and the dollar would appreciate further in foreign

exchange markets.

Directive language

(20) Given below is a suggested operational paragraph for the

directive with the numerical specifications adopted at the meeting on

October 4 shown in strike-through form.

The Committee seeks in the short run to (maintain, INCREASE

SLIGHTLY, DECREASE SLIGHTLY) THE EXISTING [DEL: the slightly lesser] degree

of reserve restraint [DEL: sought in recent-weeks]. The action is ex-

pected to be associated with growth of M2 and M3 at annual rates of

around [DEL: 8-1/2] ____ percent AND ____ PERCENT RESPECTIVELY from September

to December, consistent with the targets established for these

aggregates for the year. Depending on evidence about the strength

of economic recovery and other factors bearing on the business and

inflation outlook, lesser restraint would be acceptable in the con-

text of a significant shortfall in growth of the aggregates from

current expectations, while somewhat greater restraint would be

acceptable should the aggregates expand more rapidly. The Commit-

tee anticipates that M1 growth at an annual rate of around [DEL: 7] ____

percent from September to December will be consistent with its

fourth-quarter objectives for the broader aggregates, and that

expansion in total domestic nonfinancial debt would remain within

the range established for the year. The Chairman may call for

Committee consultation if it appears to the Manager for Domestic

Operations that pursuit of the monetary objectives and related

reserve paths during the period before the next meeting is likely

to be associated with a federal funds rate persistently outside

a range of [DEL: 6 to 10] ____ TO ____ percent.
