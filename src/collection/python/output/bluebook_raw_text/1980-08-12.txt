Prefatory Note 

 
 

The attached document represents the most complete and accurate version 
available based on original copies culled from the files of the FOMC Secretariat at the 
Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System.  This electronic document was 
created through a comprehensive digitization process which included identifying the best-
preserved paper copies, scanning those copies,1 and then making the scanned versions 
text-searchable.2  Though a stringent quality assurance process was employed, some 
imperfections may remain. 
 

Please note that this document may contain occasional gaps in the text.  These 
gaps are the result of a redaction process that removed information obtained on a 
confidential basis.  All redacted passages are exempt from disclosure under applicable 
provisions of the Freedom of Information Act.    

 

                                                 
1 In some cases, original copies needed to be photocopied before being scanned into electronic format.  All 
scanned images were deskewed (to remove the effects of printer- and scanner-introduced tilting) and lightly 
cleaned (to remove dark spots caused by staple holes, hole punches, and other blemishes caused after initial 
printing). 
2 A two-step process was used.  An advanced optimal character recognition computer program (OCR) first 
created electronic text from the document image.  Where the OCR results were inconclusive, staff checked 
and corrected the text as necessary.   Please note that the numbers and text in charts and tables were not 
reliably recognized by the OCR process and were not checked or corrected by staff.

MONETARY AGGREGATES AND
MONEY MARKET CONDITIONS

Recent developments

(1) Growth of the key monetary aggregates was somewhat slower in

July than in June, but nonetheless the pace of expansion of M-1B and

especially M-2 exceeded the Committee's minimum targeted rates for the third

quarter as a whole. M-1A still remains somewhat below its range for the

QIV '79 to QIV '80 period, but M-1B is now at the lower end and M-2 near

the upper end of their respective longer-run ranges. (See charts following

page 9.) The gap between the growth rates of M-1A and M-1B remained wide

in July, reflecting the continued strength of ATS accounts. The rapid

growth of ATS balances may have been related to the surge in passbook

savings generally, as well as to marketing efforts by banks to place them-

selves in better competitive position for the introduction of nationwide

NOW accounts. The nontransactional component of M-2 maintained the advanced

pace of other recent months, as money market mutual funds and overnight RPs,

along with savings deposits, continued to expand sharply. Small time

deposits, however, declined slightly in July. With large CDs continuing

to run off, growth in M-3 once again fell well short of that in M-2.

M-1B 10.7 8

M-2 17.0 8

M-3 11.4

(2) At its July meeting, the Committee again indicated that

monetary expansion moderately in excess of its minimum targets should be

accommodated by an increase in reserve paths. Such adjustments were made

in the early part of the intermeeting period as money growth slightly

exceeded the targets. After mid-July, however, as projections for both

M-1B and M-2 placed them well above the Committee's targets, the reserve

paths were not adjusted further to accommodate the additional demand for
1/

reserves. With the demand for reserves augmented by exceptionally high

excess reserves, adjustment borrowings increased to an average of about

$450 million in late July and early August from about $80 million in the

first two weeks of the intermeeting period. As shown in the table below,

both total and nonborrowed reserves grew only modestly in July,.despite the

continued rapid growth of the monetary aggregates. Not only did large

denomination time deposits continue to decline, thereby releasing reserves

to support growth in other deposits, but, in addition, a substantial pro-

portion of the growth of the monetary aggregates was in nonreservable

components. The relative strength of the monetary base reflected the

comparatively rapid growth of currency.

(3) The federal funds market eased slightly following the July

Committee meeting, with daily effective rates falling mainly in a range

of 8Â½ to 9 percent compared to 9 to 9 percent in the weeks just prior

to the meeting. However, given the somewhat less accommodative provision

of nonborrowed reserves by the System against a backdrop of an unusually

large demand for excess reserves, the market tightened in late July and

early August, and funds traded on some days in excess of the 10 percent

discount rate established on July 25. With the demand for excess reserves

apparently subsiding, federal funds have traded most recently in a range of

8-3/4 to a little over 9 percent.

(4) Short-term yields generally fluctuated narrowly until late

July when they came under substantial upward pressure in response to the

firming of the funds market and to changes in expectations prompted by

incoming monetary and economic data. Short-term rates are now roughly 1/2 to

3/4 of a percentage point above their levels at the time of the last meeting

and 1 to 2-1/2 percentage points above their June lows.--The bank prime rate

moved against this trend, dropping from 11-1/2 to 11 percent and to 10-3/4

at a few large banks. These latter institutions moved back to 11 percent

in early August when market rates firmed.

(5) Bond yields also have risen about 1/2 to 3/4 percentage point

since early July and are roughly 1-1/4 percentage point above their June lows.

The rise in these yields apparently reflected, in addition to the tightening

of the money markets and changing expectations, the continued heavy demands

placed on capital markets by private and governmental borrowers. Public

offerings of corporate bonds in July were just below the record second-

quarter pace, as corporations continued to lengthen the maturity of their

liabilities. Long-term offerings by State and local governments remained



sizable, and net coupon offerings by the Treasury have grown with the

deepening deficit. In its largest mid-quarter financing operation since

1976, the Treasury offered $8 1/4 billion of securities, raising $3 1/4 billion

of new cash.

(6) Bank credit is estimated to have expanded at a 6 percent

rate in July, following three months of decline, as holdings of securities

increased sharply and total loans stopped declining. Business loans

increased marginally, and real estate loans rose moderately; however,

consumer loans probably fell again. Given the strength of core deposits

and limited credit expansion, banks reduced slightly further their managed

liabilities.

(7) Domestic chartered banks continued in July to advance funds

to their foreign branches; from April to July net advances by these insti-

tutions totaled about $13 billion. About $3 billion of these funds were

used by foreign branches of member banks to finance lending to nonbank

U.S. residents in the last three months; the level of such loans had been

virtually unchanged for some time. At the same time, the interest rate

spread in favor of Eurodollar deposits narrowed, contributing to a cessa-

tion of acquisitions by U.S. residents of such claims.

(8) The dollar was fairly stable on exchange markets over most

of July. However, during the last week of the month, the rise in U.S.

interest rates--coupled with further indications of an easing in foreign

rates--sharply increased demand for the dollar. Relatively favorable

U.S. trade figures for June also contributed to the dollar's strength.

The dollar's rise since the July FOMC meeting amounted to 2 percent on

a weighted-average basis, and by larger amounts against the mark, yen, and

Swiss franc.

rates of change, in percent, for selected monetary and financial flows

Prospective developments

(10) Shown below, and depicted in the charts on the following

pages, are two alternative sets of targets for the monetary aggregates for

the current June to September policy period. The lower panel of the table

shows the implied growth rates of the aggregates from July to September.

Also indicated is a range for the federal funds rate over the intermeeting

period that it is believed would accommodate either of these growth patterns.

pp. 8 and 9.)

(11) Alternative A is indexed to the 7 percent growth rate of

M-A for June to September that the Committee established at its last

meeting, while alternative B is a more restrictive specification for-

mulated in light of the tendency for M-2 to run high relative to its

long-range target. Both alternatives call for slower growth in M-1B

and M-2 over the next two months than has occurred in the last two.

Even so, under either alternative, expansion of these aggregates over the

third quarter would exceed the 8 percent minimum growth rates targeted

-10-

by the Committee in July, and the September level of M-2 would be above

the upper end of that aggregate's 6 to 9 percent QIV '79 to QIV '80 growth

range. The specifications of both alternatives embody an assumption that

the recent rise in market interest rates will contribute to a slowing of

the extraordinarily rapid growth of ATS balances and regular passbook

savings that has occurred in recent months. Growth of MMMF shares is also

expected to moderate further as these yields appear less attractive relative

to those on other investments. The slower savings deposit and MMMF growth

is expected to be partly offset by a pick-up in small time deposit expansion

as MMC yields rise and as growth in the 30-month SSCs continues strong.

These projections imply that the gaps between the growth rates of M-1A and

M-1B, on the one hand, and M-1B and M-2, on the other, will narrow sub-

stantially from what has occurred in the past two months.

(12) Under alternative A, given the demand for transactions

balances implied by the staff's stronger economic projection for the

current quarter, money market interest rates are likely to remain at the

higher levels attained recently. Aggregate credit demands may pick up,

especially in the household sector. The runoff in consumer installment

debt likely will slow, while the demand for home mortgages probably will

strengthen somewhat. Borrowing by the Treasury and state and local

governments will remain quite large. In the business sector, although

total borrowing probably will rise in coming weeks, a significant portion

of the increase will reflect a rebuilding of liquidity positions.

(13) To achieve the growth in the aggregates specified under

alternative A, total reserves would have to expand at about a 5 percent

annual rate from July to September. Assuming a level of member bank

borrowing (excluding special borrowings) of about $100 million, nonborrowed



-11-

reserves would expand at about a 6-1/4 percent annual rate. With member

bank borrowings at such minimal levels, the federal funds rate would be

expected to fluctuate around the current 10 percent discount rate.

(14) Alternative B calls for a slower expansion in the aggregates--

with growth of M-1A below the minimum targets adopted by the Committee last

month--in order to counter the tendency for M-2 growth to exceed the

Committee's longer-run range. To achieve the alternative B targets, growth

in total reserves at about a 5 percent annual rate would be required. With

adjustment borrowings assumed to be about $200 million, nonborrowed reserves

would expand at a 4-1/4 percent annual rate. At the current discount rate,

these specifications suggest that the federal funds rate would move toward

the 11 percent area in the intermeeting period. Interest rates would be

expected to rise throughout the maturity spectrum. The bank prime rate

almost certainly would be increased, and home mortgate rates, already

under upward pressure from recent increases in other interest rates, pro-

bably also would rise significantly-especially in light of the greater

concerns about deposit flows that would develop among lenders. The recent

strength of the dollar in foreign exchange markets probably would

continue, moderated by U.S. official purchases of foreign currencies to

repay swap debt.

(15) A simple extrapolation of the June to September target

for M-1A under alternative A would yield a 4 percent growth of this

aggregate for the QIV '79 to QIV '80 period. Alternative B could be

viewed as consistent with M-1A growth over the longer period of 3 percent--

the lower bound of the Committee's long-run range. In either case, interest

rates at year-end would be expected by the staff to be significantly higher

than current levels, given our GNP projection. Even with such an increase



-12-

in rates, M-2 growth for the QIV '79 to QIV '80 period is likely to be

near or above the upper end of its 6 to 9 percent long-run growth range.



-13-

Directive language

(16) Given below are suggested operational paragraphs for the

directive consistent with the form of the directive adopted at the July

meeting. The language continues to call for expansion of reserve aggregates

at a pace consistent with the desired rates of monetary growth over the

third quarter, provided that the weekly average federal funds rate remains

within a specified range. The specifications adopted at the July meeting

are shown in strike-through form.

In the short run, the Committee seeks expansion of reserve

aggregates consistent with growth of M-1A, M-1B, and M-2 over the

third quarter of 1980 at annual rates of about [DEL: 7] ____ percent, [DEL: 8] ____ per-

cent, and [DEL: 8] ____ percent, respectively, provided that in the period

before the next regular meeting the weekly average federal funds

rate remains within a range of [DEL: 8-1/2 to 14] ____ to ____ percent.

If it appears during the period before the next meeting that

the constraint on the federal funds rate is inconsistent with the

objective for the expansion of reserves, the Manager for Domestic

Operations is promptly to notify the Chairman who will then decide

whether the situation calls for supplementary instructions from the

Committee.

In line with the decision of the FOMC, the targets as of July 18 reflected
projections of reserves needed to accommodate greater expansion in deposits

and money. This greater expansion was believed achievable with fewer re-
serves than were specified in the targets set on July 11 because of multi-

plier shifts. The reserve targets set on July 18 were retained in subse-
quent weeks, except for adjustments to reflect multiplier shifts.

NOTE: Government security dealer trading positions are on a commitment basis. Trading positions, which exclude Treasury securities
financed by repurchase agreements maturing in 16 days or more, are indicators of dealer holdings available for sale over the near-
term. Underwriting syndicate positions consist of issues still in syndicate, excluding trading positions. Weekly data are daily
averages for statement weeks, except for corporate and municipal issues in syndicate, which are Friday figures.
