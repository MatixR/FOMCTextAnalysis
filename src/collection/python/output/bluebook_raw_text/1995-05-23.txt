MONETARY POLICY ALTERNATIVES

Recent Developments 1

(1) At the time of the FOMC's March meeting, market par-

ticipants apparently anticipated that the stance of monetary policy

would remain unchanged for a time but that the next policy move would

be to tighten. The Committee's decision at that meeting to leave the

intended federal funds rate at 6 percent thus had little immediate

impact on financial markets. However, data becoming available since

the meeting have portrayed a considerably slower economic expansion

than had been thought, and market interest rates have fallen on

balance. Although the expectation that the federal funds rate would

stay at 6 percent over the near term was little affected by this news,

the market's assessment of the probable direction of the next policy

move has shifted toward ease. This can be seen, for example, in rates

on federal funds futures contracts five months ahead, which shifted

down almost 40 basis points to just under 6 percent--a level that

probably includes some liquidity premium (chart). In association with

this revision, most money-market rates edged down over the period;

federal funds continued to trade at rates averaging close to 6 per-

cent.

(2) Longer-term rates have dropped more than 1/2 percentage

point since the March meeting, with the largest declines at inter-

mediate maturities. Supplementing weaker economic data, signs that

1. Financial market quotations in this bluebook are taken as of

2. The borrowing allowance was raised in three steps during the
period, from $75 million to $175 million, to account for seasonal
increases. As in the previous intermeeting period, excess reserves
ran below levels suggested by historical patterns, a tendency that was
taken into account in reserve management decisions.

Congress was more serious about taking difficult steps to make major

reductions in budget deficits seemed to contribute to the drop in

yields. Among other effects, Congressional actions may have encour-

aged purchases of dollar assets as suggested by the simultaneous rise

in the foreign exchange value of the dollar late in the intermeeting

period. Intermediate-term rates now have fallen about 1-1/2 percent-

age points and long-term rates 1-1/4 percentage points from their

peaks in late 1994 and early 1995 (chart), reversing about half their

previous rise. The rally in securities markets was set back only

temporarily by the release of somewhat disappointing inflation numbers

for April. Available information from surveys of price expectations

along with relatively flat commodity prices suggest little change or

perhaps even a small improvement in the underlying inflation outlook

in recent months. Thus, the bulk of recent substantial declines in

yields since their peaks likely represents a drop in real rates.

Rising odds on sustained growth and low inflation, coupled with recent

positive corporate earnings surprises, have kept quality spreads on

private debt instruments narrow and have boosted broad indexes of

share prices to new records.

(3) The dollar's weighted average exchange value rose

1-1/4 percent, on balance, over the intermeeting period. The dollar

appreciated about 3-1/2 percent, net, against the mark, while depreci-

ating by lesser amounts against the yen and the Canadian dollar. The

dollar had continued to drop over the first half of the period, how-

ever, prompting U.S. intervention purchases of dollars against marks

and yen on two days in early April. The dollar moved sharply

against yen were equally divided between System and Treasury accounts.

higher in early May. Just as the dollar's weakness in April was not

obviously related to fundamentals, neither was the rebound in early

May; as noted above, though, markets did seem to be buoyed by the

budget actions taken in Congress. Foreign long-term interest rates

declined about as much on average as U.S. rates over the period, in

part benefiting from some reduction in political uncertainties in

France, Italy, and Canada. Foreign three-month rates declined more

sharply than those in the United States, about 70 basis points on

average; the Bundesbank and the Bank of Japan eased official rates to

offset the tightening effects of earlier appreciations in their

currencies. The financial situation in Mexico appears to have

stabilized a bit: The peso appreciated through April before levelling

out; over the period, interest rates have declined substantially and

stock prices have risen.

(4) M2 growth picked up in April to a 4 percent rate, close

to expectations at the time of the last FOMC meeting. M2 was boosted

last month by the need to fund unusually heavy payments of non-with-

held taxes resulting from last year's stronger economy and new tax

regulations allowing individuals to delay a larger share of federal

tax payments until April. In addition, processing delays earlier this

tax season caused refunds to run at a stronger-than-average rate in

April. 5 Moreover, after a year of increases, M2 opportunity costs

have edged down since January; ebbing household demands for securities

4. The Bank of Mexico rolled over its entire outstanding swap
drawing of $1 billion on the System on May 3 for an additional three-
month period.

5. M1 also strengthened in April, but to only a 2 percent annual
rate. Currency growth slowed a little but remained very strong, while
demand deposits contracted sharply. By contrast, other checkable
deposits edged up, posting the first monthly increase in nine months.



that compete with M2 are suggested by a substantial weakening in non-

competitive tenders at Treasury auctions in recent months. M2 in

April was in the lower half of its 1-to-5 percent growth range.

(5) M3 grew more rapidly in April than anticipated at the

time of the last FOMC meeting, expanding at around a 6 percent pace

for the second consecutive month. The strong performance of M3 again

reflected the needs of commercial banks to fund heavy credit demands.

Also contributing to the strength in M3 was a rapid expansion of in-

stitution-only money funds, whose rates lagged the decline in market

rates. M3 rose further above its 0 to 4 percent growth range in

April.

(6) The limited evidence available suggests that relatively

strong borrowing by households and businesses has continued in recent

months. Credit demands in the business sector have been focused main-

ly at the short end. Large accumulations of inventories have boosted

business loans at banks, while commercial paper expansion, importantly

to help fund mergers and acquisitions, also has been brisk. Banks

report that they have continued to ease terms and conditions for loans

and back-up lines of credit over recent months. Although the rally in

securities markets has sparked some increased bond offerings in recent

weeks, funds raised in longer-term debt markets by nonfinancial firms

have been limited overall. Consumer credit growth, though still quite

brisk, has edged lower, held down by reduced automobile financing, but

there are early signs that mortgage borrowing has begun to respond to

declines in rates. State and local bond issuance has picked up a bit

of late but remains well below the pace of retirements associated with

of bond funds, reflecting in part capital gains on these instruments,
kept M2+ advancing above an 8 percent rate over March and April,
following an extended period of lackluster growth.

advanced refundings. The growth of federal sector debt has slowed

most recently as a consequence of strong tax inflows and is running

below the pace of 1994. Total nonfinancial debt has expanded at about

a 5-1/2 percent pace through March, a bit above the midpoint of its

monitoring range.

Monetary Policy Alternatives

(7) Three monetary policy alternatives are presented below

for consideration by the Committee. Under alternative B, federal

funds would continue to trade around 6 percent. Under alternative C,

the federal funds rate would be boosted 1/2 percentage point, to 6-1/2

percent. Alternative A would reduce the intended trading level of the

funds rate to 5-1/2 percent. 7

(8) Incoming data show both rising inflation and a weakening

of economic activity over recent months. Looking forward, a key issue

for monetary policy is whether either of these developments will per-

sist. In the staff forecast, with short-term interest rates main-

tained at current levels, neither of these risks materializes. In

effect, interest and exchange rates close to their prevailing con-

figuration are seen as consistent with the economy producing just

above its long-run capacity. A near-term inventory correction limits

the expansion of production in the second and third quarters, taking

pressure off resources. The unemployment rate ends up close to the

natural rate, growth is at its potential, and the core rate of con-

sumer price inflation runs at just over 3 percent in 1996. If the

Committee sees the staff forecast as the likely and desired outcome

and the risks around it to be reasonably well-balanced, then selection

of unchanged reserve market conditions, as under alternative B, would

be favored.

7. To accommodate rising demands for seasonal credit, the allowance
for adjustment and seasonal borrowings would be raised initially to
$225 million under alternative B. Further increases would likely be
necessary during the intermeeting period under all of the alterna-
tives. Alternative C could be accomplished through an increase in the
borrowing allowance to $275 million, while alternative A could be
implemented by leaving the allowance for borrowing unchanged at $175
million in the face of seasonally elevated demand.



(9) Market participants generally anticipate no change in

the stance of monetary policy at this meeting. Thus, market rates

would not be expected to react to selection of alternative B by the

Committee. However, the recent shifts in the yield curve seem to

embody expectations of continued underlying softness in aggregate

demand sufficient to induce the Federal Reserve to ease policy later

in the year. Under the staff forecast, incoming information on spend-

ing would suggest a bit more vigor in the economy than would be con-

sistent with the market's outlook, and interest rates may tend to edge

higher on balance over the intermeeting period. Market conditions

could remain volatile. Expectations about the economic and policy

outlook may be especially prone to revision, given the size and

recency of the shift in sentiment. In addition, financial asset

prices may be sensitive to progress through the Congress of the

various fiscal policy initiatives currently under discussion.

(10) The fifty-basis-point firming of alternative C might be

favored by the Committee if it wished to provide more assurance that

pressures on resources would soon diminish, so as not to perpetuate

the recently elevated rate of inflation and, over time, to return the

economy toward a disinflationary path. The depreciation of the dol-

lar, the rise in bond and equity prices, and the continued relaxation

of terms and conditions on bank loans this year have in effect eased

financial conditions substantially. Markets seem to have reacted

strongly to what could prove to be only a moderate downshift in

underlying demand conditions, and current financial conditions may

therefore provide excessive stimulus to an economy already operating

around its potential.



(11) With markets apparently having concluded that rates are

unlikely to rise significantly further, the response in the financial

markets to the 50 basis point increase of alternative C could be sub-

stantial. Short-term rates, including the prime rate, would likely

rise by the full amount of the increase in the federal funds rate, and

intermediate-term rates would climb considerably as well. The boost

to nominal yields on long-term Treasuries would be limited by any

reductions in premiums for expected inflation, but yield spreads on

private paper--including bank funding instruments--could widen if

market participants saw a significantly greater risk of a downturn in

business activity or if higher interest rates were seen as impairing

profit margins. Bond market volatility could be appreciable as market

participants attempted to sort out the implications of unanticipated

tightening for inflation, the strength of the expansion, and credit

risks. The dollar probably would strengthen noticeably, extending the

firming evident over the past week or so.

(12) The Committee might consider the easing of monetary

policy under alternative A appropriate if it saw substantial risks

that the recent sluggish growth of final demand and the associated

inventory correction could develop into a prolonged period of growth

below potential. In this view, the declines this year in the dollar

and market interest rates might not be adequate in themselves to sus-

tain the expansion, given underlying trends in aggregate demand. Real

rates could be seen as still too high; for example, the 6 percent

funds rate implies short-term real rates above longer-term averages,

assuming inflation settles down at 3 percent as in the staff forecast.

Committee members might have particular concerns about the level of

real rates if they perceived strong odds of a significantly tighter



-10-

stance of fiscal policy than is incorporated in the staff forecast.

Such a policy shift would lower "equilibrium" real interest rates by

directly reducing government spending and, perhaps, by increasing

private saving propensities. Markets do not currently appear to have

built in a trajectory to a balanced budget and would probably respond

to credible measures to reach this target by bidding down longer-term

yields. These declines would, by themselves, help to bolster activity

in the near term. To cushion the fiscal restraint adequately, how-

ever, declines in long-term rates might need to be reinforced through

an easing in monetary policy.

(13) Short-term market rates under alternative A would like-

ly drop close to one-half percentage point. Long-term markets could

rally further and lower rates would persist, at least until economic

data pointed to a vigorous bounceback in economic activity. The

foreign exchange value of the dollar would decline.

(14) Growth of the monetary and credit aggregates under the

unchanged reserve market conditions of alternative B is presented in

the table below. (Additional data, including monetary projections

under alternatives A and C, are shown on the table and charts on the

following pages.)

(15) Credit flows to private sectors are expected to moder-

ate a little in coming months in the staff projection, and be more

concentrated in long-term markets and less at depository institutions.

With the financial position of most intermediaries solid, borrowers

showing few signs of being overextended, and macroeconomic conditions

still favorable, lenders should remain quite willing to extend credit,

although further easing of terms and conditions is less likely as the

economy settles into a pattern of sustainable growth. Credit demands

from the household sector should slow a little in association with the

diminished growth of spending on durables and housing. In the busi-

ness sector, the financing gap, while remaining wide, may narrow

slightly as inventory investment drops and growth of fixed investment

expenditures is trimmed, but merger activity will contribute to a

still-brisk (though diminishing) pace of borrowing. Lower market

interest rates and continued narrow quality spreads should encourage

a rebound in issuance of longer-term instruments, especially corporate

bonds, implying somewhat reduced reliance on bank loans and commercial

paper. Debt of state and local governments should continue to con-

tract, as bonds that had previously been refunded mature. In the

federal sector, strong tax receipts are leading to relatively light

borrowing in the second and third quarters. From the fourth quarter

of 1994 through September, the growth of domestic nonfinancial sector

debt is projected to edge down to about 5 percent under all of the

alternatives, leaving this aggregate in the middle of its 3-to-7 per-

cent monitoring range.

(16) M3 is projected to decelerate appreciably to a 3-3/4

percent pace over the April-September period. With business and

household credit growth running a bit slower than over the first few

months of the year and shifting toward longer-term markets, the growth

8
of bank loans should fall off some. Reduced funding needs will

likely prompt a slackened pace of issuance of managed liabilities,

including large time deposits, repurchase agreements, and borrowings

from foreign offices. Nonetheless, M3 is projected to remain above

the upper end of its current 0-to-4 percent annual range through

September under alternative B, and even the tighter reserve market

conditions of alternative C would not likely be adequate to bring M3

within its range by September.

(17) M2 growth, by contrast, is projected to edge up slight-

ly from that of the previous four months, to a 2-1/2 percent pace over

April through September; this aggregate would remain in the lower half

of its l-to-5 percent annual range under alternative B. Although

slower growth of nominal income over the second and third quarters

will damp the demand for money, opportunity costs of holding M2 assets

have leveled off and begun to fall; as the depressing effects of

earlier increases in opportunity costs diminish, M2 should grow more

closely in line with income. M2 velocity is projected to continue

8. The effect of the reduction in loan growth on bank credit is
expected to be buffered by slower runoffs of securities from bank
portfolios.

9. Despite reduced opportunity costs, M1 is projected to contract
at a 3/4 percent annual rate over the April-to-September period,
reflecting a reversal of the tax-related buildup in April and the
implementation of a new sweep program in early May.
(The sweeps are estimated to be lowering M1 growth by a little over
3 percentage points in May; because funds are swept into MMDAs, M2
is not affected.) The M1 projection assumes that no further sweep
programs will be instituted. With required reserves contracting in
association with the decline in M1 deposits, total reserves are

to rise over the second and third quarters, but at only a 1-1/2 per-

cent average annual rate--far more slowly than the 5 percent increase

over the previous four quarters. The projected growth rate of M2

averages just a bit below predictions of the standard staff model over

the second and third quarters--consistent with the recent small pre-

diction errors of the model and the staff's judgment that deposit

rates will run below what historical patterns would suggest. Flows

into stock and bond mutual funds are expected to continue at around

the modest pace experienced over the first four months of the year,

and M2+ is forecast to expand at about a 4 percent rate over the

April-September period, bringing its growth from the fourth quarter

of 1994 to 3-1/2 percent.

projected to fall somewhat over the April-to-September period; the
monetary base is nevertheless expected to expand at about a 7-1/4
percent annual rate, supported by continued strong net shipments of
currency abroad.

paragraph that includes the usual options for Committee consideration.

OPERATIONAL PARAGRAPH

In the implementation of policy for the immediate

future, the Committee seeks to DECREASE SOMEWHAT/main-

tain/INCREASE SOMEWHAT the existing degree of pressure on

reserve positions. In the context of the Committee's

long-run objectives for price stability and sustainable

economic growth, and giving careful consideration to

economic, financial, and monetary developments, somewhat

(SLIGHTLY) greater reserve restraint would (MIGHT) or

(SOMEWHAT) slightly lesser reserve restraint (WOULD)

contemplated reserve conditions are expected to be con-

sistent with moderate growth in M2 and M3 over coming

months.
