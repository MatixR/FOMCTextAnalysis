1  The average effective federal funds rate for the intermeeting period came in
close to 1.25 percent.  The Desk purchased $4.5 billion of Treasury securities in
outright operations: $2.1 billion of coupons in the market and $2.4 billion of bills
from foreign official institutions.  The outstanding amount of long-term RPs
increased from $16 billion to $19 billion.

MONETARY POLICY ALTERNATIVES

Recent Developments

(1) The FOMC’s decision at its May meeting to keep the intended federal

funds rate at 1¼ percent came as no surprise to most observers.  By contrast, splitting

the balance of risks into separate assessments about growth and inflation and

emphasizing a concern about further declines of inflation from an already low level

led market participants to mark down their policy expectations.  The announcement

also set the backdrop against which subsequent statements by Federal Reserve

officials regarding the possibility of deflation and available policy alternatives were

interpreted.  Options on federal funds futures indicate that market participants are

nearly certain of policy easing at this meeting, with a half-point cut given two-to-one

odds over a quarter-point cut.  Given the sense that Committee members have

become more concerned about inflation turning out too low than too high, market

participants now see a substantially longer period of low short-term interest rates;

indeed, the funds rate is expected to remain below its current level through this year

and most of next.1  (The box on the next page provides more detail on prevailing

market expectations.)

Policy Expectations

In addition to marking down the expected path of policy over the
intermeeting period, investors became more confident about their forecast for the
funds rate (Chart 1).  For example, based on options on eurodollar futures, the
width of the 90 percent confidence interval around the expected target level one
year ahead narrowed substantially over the period to stand at the lowest level in
many years.

A recently introduced options contract on federal funds futures on the
Chicago Board of Trade opens a new window on market participants’ near-term
policy outlook.  Prices of options at different strikes depend on investors’ subjective
probability assessment that the options will be in the money at expiration.  The
option-implied probability of no change in policy, the solid line in the bottom left
panel, remained above 50 percent until June 3, but has since dropped nearly to zero. 
At last reading, these option-implied probabilities suggest that investors consider a
half-point cut in the target rate about twice as likely as a quarter-point cut.  

Prices of options on Eurodollar futures can be used in a similar way to
construct the probability distribution of the target rate later in the year, shown in
the bottom-right panel.  The most recent distribution (in red) has shifted markedly
to the left and the weight on rates in the lower tail has been revised up significantly. 
Indeed, investors apparently place about a 15 percent probability on the funds rate
trading at or below ½ percent in six months.

(2) Consistent with a lower expected path for policy, yields on Treasury

coupon securities shed 35  to 60 basis points over the intermeeting period, with much

of the decline concentrated in implied forward rates at the three- to seven-year

horizon (Chart 2).  Inflation-indexed yields fell somewhat less, implying that inflation

compensation declined moderately.  The desire by managers of mortgage-backed

security portfolios to extend the duration of their holdings, which has been shortened

by the recent wave of mortgage refinancings, may have amplified the downward

pressure on longer-term yields.  With uncertainty about the future course of interest

2 Market attention focused for a time on Freddie Mac following the
replacement of its top management in the wake of questions about its accounting
practices.  Freddie’s stock price has declined 15 percent since the shakeup (Chart 3). 
To reassure investors about the liquidity of its issues and to demonstrate its own
financial health, Freddie conducted larger-than-usual buybacks of dollar- and euro-
denominated debt.  To date, however, there is little evidence that the increase in
Freddie’s cost of funds is having a negative impact on secondary mortgage market
activity.  Although not implicated in any irregularities, Fannie Mae saw its stock
decline in concert with Freddie Mac’s but by less.  Although the fallout from this
episode has been contained so far, credit default swap spreads show that market
participants’ perception of Freddie’s riskiness as a counterparty has edged up despite
the major rating agencies having reaffirmed the housing giant’s triple-A credit rating.  

rates reduced, term premia may have declined, adding to the drop in bond yields. 

(3) Yields on corporate bonds fell about in line with those on Treasuries

even as capital markets absorbed a surge in issuance by highly-rated firms.  Indeed,

even lower-tier issuers found markets receptive, taking advantage of historically low

bond yields to issue a record amount of debt in May.  Stock price indexes registered

sizable gains over the intermeeting period, buoyed by the decline in real yields as well

as the improved outlook for economic growth and earnings and, perhaps, the cut in

the tax rate on dividends and capital gains.2

(4) Since the May FOMC meeting, the dollar has slipped 3 percent further

against an index of major foreign currencies (Chart 4).  Contributing to the downward

pressure were comments by U.S. Administration officials that were interpreted on

balance as not opposing some depreciation of the dollar, and some heightening of

longstanding concerns about the availability of international capital flows to finance

the burgeoning U.S. current account deficit.  The dollar declined 4½ percent against

the Canadian dollar despite signs of slower activity in Canada.  The dollar also

dropped substantially against the euro, even as indicators pointed to lackluster

domestic demand in the euro area and an increasing drag on its exports from the

euro’s rebound over the past year.  The economic slowdown and lower rates of

inflation in the euro area have begun to stoke worries about deflation, especially in

Germany where the economy has been stagnating.  The ECB eased policy 50 basis

points on June 5, as had been widely expected.  The dollar was unchanged on balance

against the yen, as market participants took note of extremely large purchases of

dollars by Japanese authorities.3  The Bank of Japan raised its target somewhat for

reserve balances and also announced a new program to purchase asset-backed

securities.  Yields on foreign long-term government securities moved down but,

except for Canada, by less than in the United States.  Foreign stock markets largely

mirrored the continuing improvement in U.S. stock prices.

(5) The dollar has been about unchanged on net since the May FOMC

meeting against an index of the currencies of our other important trading partners,

amid divergent movements against individual currencies.  The dollar gained 3 percent

against the Mexican peso, as Mexico reported an unexpectedly large contraction of

GDP in the first quarter and signs of further weakness emerged.  In contrast, the

dollar lost ground against the Brazilian real, which strengthened 3½ percent, as

financial markets continued to reward Brazil for achieving progress on key structural

issues.  Brazil’s EMBI+ spread narrowed about 75 basis points more to about 7¼

percentage points, and Brazilian stocks moved up another 5½ percent.  Stock markets

in several Asian economies–Taiwan, Hong Kong, Korea, Thailand–were buoyed by

signs of recovery in the high-tech sector and indications that the impact of the SARS

epidemic may be waning.

(6) Households, businesses, and state and local governments continued to



5

take advantage of low longer-term yields in their funding.  Net bond issuance by

nonfinancial firms picked up over the period, but total borrowing remained fairly

weak as businesses continued to pay down short-term debt (Chart 5).  Despite the

stock market rally, gross equity issuance recovered only marginally from the depressed

levels of the preceding months, with initial public offerings remaining scarce.  Data

from commercial banks suggest that households continued to pile on mortgage debt

as further declines in mortgage interest rates fueled a brisk pace of home purchases

and another surge in refinancings.  Borrowing by the state and local sector picked up,

in part reflecting sizable advance refundings.  With tax receipts running on the weak

side and expenditures picking up, marketable Treasury borrowing surged, especially

after the debt ceiling was raised.  Given the extra impetus from the federal sector,

domestic nonfinancial sector debt remained on track to expand at a considerably

faster rate on balance in the second quarter than the 6½ percent pace registered in the

first quarter.  

(7) The money stock expanded briskly in May.  Even after accounting for

estimated special factors boosting M2, including tax effects and mortgage refinancing

activity, underlying growth was still quite strong. With M2 likely to grow at an 8

percent rate this quarter but nominal GDP growth shaping up to be 2½  percent, M2

velocity will most likely show a substantial decline even though opportunity costs have

fallen only slightly.  The decline in the overall cost of holding M2 masks substantial

changes in relative returns on some components of the aggregate.  In particular, the

average yield on taxable retail money market mutual funds (the solid line in the lower

left panel of Chart 5) has fallen to the point that those funds have lost their typical

rate advantage to MMDAs offered by banks (the dotted line).  Within the universe of

money market mutual funds, as portrayed in the lower right panel, about 12 percent of

assets are held by funds paying yields below ½ percent, suggesting that the scope for





6

continued large gross flows is considerable.  Some of those funds, though, would

likely shift to other money funds rather than to liquid deposits or out of the monetary

aggregates if short rates were reduced further.



7

Policy Alternatives

(8) Recent financial developments and the passage of a sizable tax cut over

the intermeeting period have created a more supportive outlook for aggregate demand

in the staff projection, but data on inflation have mostly run to the soft side of staff

expectations.  In the Greenbook, the staff now assumes that the FOMC will trim its

target by ¼ percentage point and then subsequently keep it unchanged.  At the same

time, the level of stock prices has been raised and those of the dollar and long-term

interest rates lowered in recognition of their respective net movements over the

intermeeting period.  The staff also has incorporated the greater fiscal stimulus

embodied in the recently enacted tax cut than had been anticipated in the prior

Greenbook.  Thus, while incoming data have moved real GDP growth down a notch

over the first half, real growth over the next six quarters has been raised nearly ½

percentage point--to 4¼ percent over the second half of 2003 and 5¼ percent over

2004.   This faster advance in production is expected to speed the decline in the

unemployment rate next year, which falls to 5.4 percent by late 2004.  Given the

generally lower-than-expected price data of late, core PCE inflation in the second

quarter has been trimmed a bit, implying that four-quarter inflation by this measure

will come in at 1 percent over this year.  Core inflation is projected to edge down

further in 2004, largely because slack in labor and product markets persists through

next year.  

(9) The staff outlook presents a picture of an economy moving towards, but

not yet attaining, equilibrium:  While there is still some slack in labor markets, the

growth of real GDP is above that of its potential, and both inflation and the real

federal funds rate are at unusually low levels.  To examine longer-term strategies for

monetary policy as these dynamic imbalances adjust, three scenarios were created with

the aid of the FRB/US model.  The Greenbook forecast is extended through 2008 by



8

making several judgmental adjustments to the model that preserve the central features

of the staff outlook.  In particular, trend multifactor productivity is assumed to climb

steadily at almost 1½ percent per year, which combined with a modest pickup in

capital deepening from its current pace implies potential GDP is expanding at a

roughly 3¾ percent rate later in the decade.  The natural rate of unemployment

remains close to 5 percent–the staff’s current long-run estimate.  The unified federal

budget is projected to settle into a deficit of about 2 percent of nominal GDP.  The

demand for U.S. exports is bolstered by 4 percent annual real depreciation of the

dollar, as well as the gradual recovery of the world economy, so as to cap the current

account deficit relative to nominal GDP at a little over 5 percent.

(10) The dynamics of the FRB/US model have the property that, given the

forces playing out in the staff forecast, the Committee has considerable time before it

needs to realign the current unusually low real federal funds rate to its gradually rising

equilibrium value.  Three alternative simulations were run to examine the

consequences for the economy and long-run inflation of varying degrees of delay in

beginning the process of realigning the federal funds rate.  In particular, these

scenarios envision the consequences of moving the real funds rate to its long-run

equilibrium level of about 2¾ percent relatively smoothly over the course of one year. 

The simulations differ according to when the Committee is assumed to start

tightening–either 2005, 2006, or 2007.  These simulations, shown in Chart 6, indicate,

quite obviously, that the longer the Committee waits to tighten, the more will

unemployment be worked down and inflation ultimately step up.  Were policy to

begin moving the real funds rate up in 2005, shown by the solid line in the upper left

panel, the unemployment rate would stay close to 5 percent after 2004 (the middle

panel), and core PCE inflation (the bottom panel) would settle around 3/4 percent. 

Delaying that process by one year–the dashed lines–or by two–the dotted lines–causes

the unemployment rate to fall below 5 percent for a time and leads to higher inflation

down the road, with growth in core PCE prices settling in at 1½ and 2 percent,

respectively.

(11) With regard to the immediate choice of policy, if the Committee both

shares the staff assessment that prospective slack in resource use could foster 

disinflation and views the current inflation rate as already on the low side, it may favor

a 25 basis point reduction in the intended federal funds rate.  Such a policy move,

by preserving much of the recent rally in financial markets, would provide support to

aggregate demand, thereby helping to counter any tendency toward further substantial

disinflation, which the Committee announced would be unwelcome in its statement

after the May meeting.  This benefit to the economy may be seen as coming at a low

cost, in that an unwanted upsurge in inflation may be viewed as unlikely in an

environment in which the level of output lies well below that of its estimated potential

and inflation expectations remain subdued.  Indeed, inflation expectations may have

ticked lower of late, necessitating a moderate downward adjustment of the nominal

rate to keep the real interest rate from rising.  Should the action prove to be

unnecessary, it could readily be unwound before any material harm is done.  And even

if inflation picked up a bit, the Committee might see that rise as desirable to increase

the size of the cushion against the possibility of having to approach the zero bound

on the nominal federal funds rate.  Indeed, the alternative long-run scenarios suggest

that the Committee may be able to hold the nominal funds rate near 1 percent for a

considerable period of time without putting significant upward pressure on inflation.

(12) Alternatively, the Committee may find the case for a 50 basis point cut

in the funds rate to a level of 75 basis points to be persuasive.  The Committee may

wish to push harder against the persistent substantial output gap, which the staff has

recently revised upward slightly to an estimated 2¾ percentage points of GDP in the

Elmendorf, Dave Reifschneider, and David Wilcox, which was sent to the FOMC on

second quarter.  As seen in Chart 7, with the real federal funds rate edging higher and

some estimates of its equilibrium level moving lower, a 50 basis point easing may be

seen as necessary merely to restore the degree of stimulus in place late last year.  If the

Committee thinks that the Greenbook is too optimistic about spending–perhaps

because the effects of higher oil prices of late are underplayed–then it may be

especially concerned about the chance of further disinflation as well.4  Even if the

Committee agrees with the Greenbook assessment of the economy, it may believe that

the projected inflation rate would be uncomfortably low given the problems likely to

emerge if the economy were to experience adverse shocks and the zero bound were to

become an important constraint on policy.  In this regard, the Committee may believe

that a 50 basis point cut in the funds rate could be taken back later, if need be, at less

cost to the economy than that potentially incurred by not moving now and increasing

the difficulty of countering future economic weakness because the zero floor to the

nominal funds rate became a binding constraint.

(13) If the Committee is reasonably confident that underlying economic

growth will turn out at least as strong as projected by the staff, it may view the

consequences of an unchanged funds rate as the best that are feasible, given the lags

with which monetary policy works.  In fact, because the staff would forecast rapid

GDP expansion over the next six quarters even with an unchanged funds rate, the

Committee may view any policy easing at this meeting as risking excessive pressures

on resources, exacerbating existing imbalances, or feeding an overshooting in financial

markets.  This concern could be especially pronounced if the Committee thinks that

additional easing would probably induce faster economic growth or a lower

stimulus evidently in train, the Committee may anticipate that a reduction in monetary

accommodation will be called for in the not-too-distant future, and another ease at

this meeting would make such a tightening action more sizable than otherwise. 

Instead, the Committee may wish to continue to await more readings on the economy

collected after the Iraq war before reconsidering the need for any further easing

action.

Directive and Assessment of Risks

(14) From January 2000 to January 2003, the Committee summarized its

views on the risks to the attainment of its goals of maximum sustainable economic

growth and price stability in terms of a single sentence–the “balance-of-risks”

assessment.  In March, the Committee dropped this sentence from the press

statement in light of the elevated uncertainties surrounding its outlook associated with

the looming onset of war.  The “balance-of-risks” language was refined in May, with

the press release including a three-part assessment of the economy that characterized

the risks individually surrounding the outlook for the growth of activity and inflation,

as well as their joint consequences for the balance of risks to achieving the

Committee’s goals. 

(15) The experience since the May 6th announcement suggests that the three-

part risk assessment served the Committee’s interests well, in that the public quickly

came to understand the Federal Reserve’s concerns about additional disinflation

without building alarm about the prospects for economic growth.  By departing from

the routinized words of the prior balance-of-risk statement, the three-point risk

assessment was widely seen as meshing more effectively with the rest of the statement.

Moreover, going forward, the three-part assessment would provide broader coverage

of the range of possible outcomes for the economy than the earlier language,

suggesting that the Committee would not be under pressure anytime soon to amend

the form of the statement significantly.

(16)  While the Committee reviewed the wording of the release in advance of

the policy vote in May, it formally voted on only the level of the intended federal

funds rate, as will be noted in the minutes of that meeting to be released on Thursday,

June 26th.  In the past, the members of the Committee appear to have been satisfied

with the practice of routinely reviewing the public announcement after the policy vote. 



13

Assuming that the Committee would prefer to return to including an assessment of

the risks to its outlook in its vote without reviewing the statement beforehand, it could

opt to vote both on the directive and the three-part risk assessment presented below. 

To retain flexibility, the language of the assessment of risks below conveys the

direction of each of the three parts without specifying the exact wording of the three

relevant sentences of the announcement. 

(1) Directive Wording

The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and financial

conditions that will foster price stability and promote sustainable growth

in output.  To further its long-run objectives, the Committee in the

immediate future seeks conditions in reserve markets consistent with

maintaining/INCREASING/REDUCING the federal funds rate at/TO

an average of around ___1-1/4 percent.

(2) Risk Assessment

The Committee desires that included in the official announcement

released after the meeting (but not included in the directive) be the

indications that, against the background of its long-run goals of price

stability and sustainable economic growth and of the information

currently available: The risks to its outlook for sustainable economic

growth over the next several quarters [ARE WEIGHTED TOWARD

THE DOWNSIDE]  [are balanced] [ARE WEIGHTED TOWARD

THE UPSIDE]; the risks to its outlook for inflation over the next

several quarters [are weighted toward the downside]  [ARE

BALANCED] [ARE WEIGHTED TOWARD THE UPSIDE]; and,

taken together, the balance of risks to its objectives  [are weighted

toward the downside]  [ARE BALANCED] [ARE WEIGHTED

TOWARD THE UPSIDE] in the foreseeable future.



14

Market Reaction and Monetary and Credit Aggregates

(17) Under any of the three policy alternatives, the Committee may elect to

retain the current structure and content of its assessment of the two component risks

and their balance overall.  It may again judge that equal risks of a shortfall or

overshoot in real economic growth, combined with downside risks for inflation,

would balance out overall risks to the downside for the foreseeable future.   In

addition to the assessment of the risks, market participants will pay close attention to

the wording of the rest of the announcement, especially for any hints that the

Committee considers the likelihood of deflation to be anything other than quite low. 

In that regard, some reports suggest the expectation that a 50 basis point move would

be accompanied by an explanation of the Committee’s plan for the alternative

implementation of policy, potentially including a rate target for a maturity longer than

overnight.

(18) With market participants predicting that an easing is likely at this meeting

and that a reduction of 50 basis points is more probable than one of 25 basis points,

the market reaction would be most pronounced if the FOMC were to decide to stay

on hold.  Given that the outlook for corporate earnings with an unchanged funds rate

would be less buoyant than market participants expect, a stock price decline would

follow such a decision.  Unless this decline were quite large, some backup in long-term

interest rates would likely be associated with the sizable rise in short-term interest

rates.  An easing move of 25 basis points would have some of these effects, albeit

more muted.  By contrast, a 50 basis point reduction would be larger than expected

and could induce initial increases in stock and bond prices.  Such a cut could cause

financial distress for some higher-cost money market mutual funds and also might

begin to raise market concerns about the remaining scope for further conventional

monetary policy stimulus.  Indeed, longer-term Treasuries might be bid up in price



15

over time as market participants come increasingly to anticipate large-scale purchases

by the Federal Reserve.

(19) The Greenbook assumption of a 25 basis point easing, combined with its

projection of nominal GDP growth at a 5 percent rate over the second half of this

year, probably would induce M2 growth of 7½ percent over the same period.  The

implied decline in M2 velocity of 2½ percent follows an estimated drop of 4 percent

over the first half of this year.  On a period-end basis, domestic nonfinancial debt is

expected to expand at a pace of 7½ percent over the second half of this year.  The

federal debt component would grow at an annual rate of 10½ percent, and nonfederal

sector debt is projected to record a growth rate of 6¾ percent over the next two

quarters, paced by the expansion of home mortgage debt.
