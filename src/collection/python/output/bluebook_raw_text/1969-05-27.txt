MCNEY MARKET AND RESERVE RELATIO SHIPS

Recent developments

(1) Interest rates generally rose markedly during the past

few weeks, reflecting the very tight conditions in the market for day-

to-day finance, sizable corporate and municipal bond offerings on top

of the Treasury refunding, and the dimming in near-term peace hopes.

Since the last meeting of the Committee, yields on municipal bonds

have jumped by around 25 basis points, while yields on corporate bonds

and U.S. Government coupon issues have risen by 10 - 20 basis points.

Short-term market rates, apart from Treasury bills, have adjusted up

by as much as 50 basis points. In the first three weeks of May, Treasury

bill rates rose from their recent lows at the time of the last Committee

meeting, but in the last few days bill rates have dropped back. The

latest quote on the 3-month bill was around 6 per cent bid, down 12

basis points from its high during the month, but still a few basis

points above the April 29 level. The recent decline reflects a scarce

market supply of short-bills in part growing out of the heavy foreign

official purchases related to recent speculative flows into the German

mark.

(2) The very tight conditions in the money market have been

expressed in a sharp further rise of the Federal funds rate in the

past three statement weeks to trading levels frequently in an 8 - 9 per

cent range, with an average effective rate over the past three weeks

close to 8-1/2 per cent. Dealer finance rates have risen commensurately

May 23, 1969.

to an 8-1/2 - 9-1/2 per cent range. In each case, rates have ranged

50 - 100 basis points above levels in the few weeks just before the

previous FOMC meeting. These taut conditions in money centers have

reflected market churning, including constricted Euro-dollar avail-

abilities connected with mark speculation; financing demands arising

out of the Treasury refunding; and Desk action to maintain pressure on

short-term markets in an environment in which the 3-month bill rate was

otherwise tending to move toward or below the low end of recent ranges.

Money market conditions were exacerbated as major banks, in the face of

large and unpredicted fund flows, managed money positions rather

conservatively and accumulated large reserve surpluses in a couple of

weeks around mid-May.

(3) The bank credit proxy is showing somewhat less weakness

in May than anticipated earlier, mainly because of stronger interbank

deposits, and is now projected to change little on average for the

month. The money supply is also expected to change little on average

from April to May, close to earlier projections, with an increase in

currency offsetting a small decline on average in private demand

deposits. Total time and savings deposit behavior has also been about

as anticipated. These deposits are now projected to decline in May at

around a 2 per cent annual rate, with outstanding CD's dropping $400 -

$500 million and with only a sluggish recovery in consumer-type time

and savings deposits following sizable net outflows in the first half

of April.



-3-

(4) Net borrowed reserves at all member banks have averaged

$1.1 billion in the last four statement weeks, up $300 million from

the preceding four weeks. Member bank borrowings have shown a similar

rise on average to $1.3 billion, with demands on the discount window

increasing at both reserve city and country banks. Banks have turned

increasingly to the discount window as they have

encountered adverse fund flows and constrictions in the availability

of day-to-day financing from other sources.

Prospective developments

(6) The relationships among Treasury bill rates, marginal

reserve measures, and day-to-day money rates will be subject to widely

variable influencesin coming weeks. For example, potentially heavy

tax period borrowing around mid-June will be shortly followed by

Treasury cash debt repayment of $1 billion in maturing June 15 bonds

not exchanged in the recent refinancing and an estimated $4 billion

of June tax bills that may not be turned in for taxes. Meanwhile, the

recent ebbing of tensions affecting foreign exchange and Euro-dollar

markets may lead to an improved availability of Euro-dollars to U.S.

banks during the next few weeks that could possibly moderate pressures

in day-to-day money markets. On the other hand, mid-year window dressing

by banks abroad may tend to withdraw some funds from the Euro-dollar

market later in June.

(7) Assuming no change in monetary policy, and recognizing

the probability of large and varying money market flows apart from

System operations, money market conditions may encompass a Federal funds

rate continuing to average around 8-1/2 per cent, member bank borrowing

in a $1 to $1-1/2 billion range, and net borrowed reserves generally a

little over $1 billion. The 3-month Treasury bill rate could fluctuate

widely, but may generally continue to be in a 5.90 - 6.20 per cent

range. An increase in the bank prime loan rate would enhance the

likelihood of the bill rate moving toward or above the upper end of

this range.



-5-

(8) The estimated $9.3 billion of corporate income tax

payments due for payment in June--some three-fourths larger than

payments in March and in April--together with increased Federal agency

debt financing are expected to exert heavy general pressure on commercial

banks and money and securities markets during the first part of June.

These pressures are likely to be reflected in a large further run-off

of large-denomination CD's at banks--running to perhaps $1 billion or

a little more for the full month of June out of an estimated $4-1/2 -

$5 billion of maturities. Such a CD attrition, however, would be no

worse than May, and probably somewhat better, after adjusting for

seasonal factors. Nevertheless, with commercial bank liquidity already

greatly reduced by the cumulative effects of continued monetary restraint,

banks' resources are likely to be brought under severe pressure,

particularly if the need to finance tax payments leads to another

large bulge in loans. As a result, in addition to continuing to

borrow abroad, major banks are likely to continue to press to expand

the new domestic financial arrangements that have been developed

recently to augment their flows of funds. In particular, bank holding

company sales of commercial paper and other similar transactions should

grow further and could become a significant source of upward interest

rate pressure in short-term markets.

(9) The large Treasury cash debt repayment noted earlier

represents a potential offset to these various June short-term market

pressures. Any reflows of foreign funds into Euro-dollars could have

a similar effect. In terms of the technical condition of the bill



-6-

market, the existing short supply of bills provides some short-run

leeway for dealers to absorb bills during the tax period, although

their willingness may be limited by the tightness in the market for

dealer financing.

(10) Given the short-term market conditions noted in

paragraphs (6) and (7), the change in the bank credit proxy in June

is expected to be in a -1 to +3 per cent, annual rate, range--with

Euro-dollar borrowings possibly adding another percentage point or

two on average. There is little basis for judging the likely increase

in domestic nondeposit sources of funds to banks, through holding

company affiliates or otherwise. Nor is it clear what proportion of

funds raised through these devices should be considered to be "bank

credit" in light of the similarity of various of the instruments to

conventianal commercial or finance company paper. However that may be,

it might be noted that each $250 million of such instruments issued

during the month, on average, would be the equivilent of about 1-

percentage point annual rate of increase in the bank credit proxy.

(11) Total demand deposits are expected to be an enlarged

source of funds to banks in June, and time and savings deposits are

also likely to be stronger on average than in May. A sharp rise in the

average level of private demand deposits is anticipated partly in

consequence of a decline in the average level of U.S. Government

deposits as Treasury debt is repaid. In addition, however, strong

loan demand, enhanced by tax payment needs, will probably lead to

further private deposit expansion. With currency outstanding also

continuing to rise, the money supply is expected to expand in a



-7-

7 - 10 per cent, annual rate, range in June. This would represent

an experience similar to April, when large tax payments also caused

credit demand and money to rise temporarily. Time deposits are likely

to rise in a 2 - 5 per cent, annual rate, range, as some recovery in

consumer-type time deposits continues, at least until the mid-year

interest-crediting period.

(12) Despite the projected rise in bank credit and money

for June, long-term interest rates are still likely to move up

further, particularly if concern about a credit crunch should spread.

Banks will be very limited in their ability to buy municipal securities,

and they, as well as insurance companies, now appear to be cutting

back on real estate loans. But so long as prospects for a cooling in

economic activity remain and investors and borrowers look toward a

tapering of interest rate pressures later in the year, a further

upward movement in long-term rates could be of limited proportions.

Explanation of Projections in Table 5

1. Changes in Federal Reserve credit indicate reserves needed to offset projected changes in
required reserves and factors affecting the supply of reserves.

2. Projected changes in currency outside banks reflect seasonal movements plus an allowance for
growth of about $50 million per week.

3. Projected effects of Treasury operations, included in "technical factors," reflect scheduled
and assumed calls in current two weeks and maintenance of Treasury balances with Federal Reserve
at $0.5 billion, thereafter.

4. Projected changes in required reserves assume the existing net reserve position of banks and
the structure of interest rates in the market, as well as the current economic outlook. On
the basis of these assumptions, projections reflect expected movements in bank credit and
money in the period ahead, including the effects of such elements as the public's loan demand,

repayments of previous loans, banks' investment preferences and willingness to supply loans,
banks' desires and abilities to obtain time and savings deposits, and the Government's financing

needs. The projections thus encompass normal seasonal developments, temporary bursts of
loans demand and expected associated repayments not currently reflected by the seasonals, and

whatever cyclical and growth demands for money and credit are expected in the projection period.

Assumed Treasury financing operations include: $-3.6 billion, June 16; $-4.2 billion, June 23.
