MONETARY POLICY ALTERNATIVES 

Recent Developments 

(1) With investors putting only small odds on a pause in the tightening cycle 

following Hurricane Katrina, there was little market reaction to the FOMC’s decision 

at the September meeting to raise the target federal funds rate 25 basis points to 

3¾ percent, to maintain its assessment that the risks to price stability and sustainable 

growth were balanced, and to retain the “measured pace” language. 1  The expected 

path for monetary policy shifted up in subsequent weeks though, as incoming data 

indicated that output had been expanding briskly prior to the hurricane and that the 

disruptions to economic activity from Hurricane Katrina and Rita were likely to be 

less severe than initially feared.  This upward pressure on interest rates may have been 

amplified by comments from a number of Federal Reserve officials that were read as 

stressing inflation concerns.  By the time of the release of the FOMC minutes, 

investors had reportedly anticipated their somewhat hawkish tone, and the market 

response to their publication was minimal.  Current readings on futures contracts 

indicate that the federal funds rate expected after the December meeting has increased 

about 25 basis points over the intermeeting period to nearly 4¼ percent, consistent 

with investors placing high odds on a quarter-point rate hike at each of the next two 

meetings (Chart 1).2  The level of the funds rate expected to prevail by June 2006 rose 

                                           
1 Over the intermeeting period, the effective federal funds rate was close to the target.  The 
Desk purchased $4.2 billion of Treasury coupon securities and $2.7 billion of Treasury bills, 
$1.5 billion of which were from foreign customers.  The volume of outstanding long-term 
RPs decreased $7 billion, to $11 billion.  
2 Today is the first day of the maintenance period that includes the upcoming FOMC 
meeting.  Judging from the October federal funds futures contract, market participants 
expect the funds rate to average about 17 basis points above the target, on average, over the

50 basis points, to a peak just above 4½ percent.  Respondents to the Desk’s latest 

dealer survey have similarly come to expect more policy tightening, with the majority 

now anticipating rate increases at the November, December, and January meetings.  

Most of the respondents expect little change in the measured pace and 

accommodative language, and six of twenty-two respondents indicated that recent 

statements by Federal Reserve officials had influenced their interest rate forecasts.  

Uncertainty about the expected path for policy over the coming six months, as 

measured by implied volatility read from eurodollar options, has decreased some since 

the September meeting, although it remains above its pre-Katrina levels. 

(2) Nominal Treasury yields rose 25 to 50 basis points on net, with most of the 

advance accounted for by increases in near-term forward rates.3, 4  In addition to 

stronger-than-expected economic data, declines in some energy prices likely 

contributed to a more positive economic outlook, helping to push yields higher.  

Increases at the longer end of the term structure, especially late in the period, may 

have been due in part to increased mortgage hedging flows, as suggested by anecdotal 

reports.  Despite a higher-than-expected reading on the overall consumer price index 

for September, TIPS-based measures of inflation compensation were about 

unchanged over the intermeeting period, although they remain 15 to 20 basis points 

above the levels seen prior to Hurricane Katrina.     

(3) Partly in response to the rise in interest rates, major stock price indexes fell 

3 to 4¼ percent over the period (Chart 2).  Although reported earnings for the third 

quarter appear to have largely met or exceeded expectations, investors may also have 
                                                                                                                                        
remaining days prior to the meeting.  Federal funds futures contracts for December and 
January are currently pricing in minimal year-end pressures in the federal funds market.      
3 President Bush’s announcement on October 24 that he was nominating Ben S. Bernanke to 
succeed Chairman Greenspan was accompanied by an increase of a few basis points in 
Treasury yields and a modest rally in equity markets.   
4 Open interest in the September ten-year Treasury futures contract remained elevated 
through its final days of trading.  Nonetheless, all the deliveries were met using the August 
2012 note, which was the cheapest-to-deliver security.

been concerned about the cautious tone to corporate guidance about future earnings 

growth.  Implied volatilities from equity options remained low but edged up a bit over 

the period in response to several announcements of corporate distress, including the 

sudden collapse of Refco, the bankruptcy filings by Delphi, Delta Airlines, and 

Northwest Airlines, and the announcement of an SEC investigation into the pension 

practices of General Motors (more details about the bankruptcies are provided in the 

box “Credit Market Developments”).  The timing of some of the bankruptcy filings 

may have been related to the implementation of new bankruptcy rules in October.  As 

a result of the problems at these firms, the number of downgrades of corporate bonds 

increased, as did the aggregate bond default rate.  However, corporate quality outside 

of the automobile and airline sectors remained solid.  Broad indexes of investment- 

and speculative-grade corporate bond yields moved largely in line with Treasury yields 

over the period, leaving spreads little changed.   

(4) The dollar’s foreign exchange value against major currencies rose about 

¾ percent on balance over the intermeeting period (Chart 3).5  Somewhat stronger-

than-expected U.S. economic data and the expressed resolve of U.S. officials to 

combat inflationary pressures reportedly supported the dollar.  A number of foreign 

central bankers conveyed similar determination, heightening expectations of monetary 

policy tightening abroad.  In Canada, the Bank of Canada raised its policy rate another 

25 basis points in mid-October, citing inflation concerns.  In most major industrial 

economies, yields on foreign long-term government securities rose a bit less than in 

the United States.   The dollar was little changed against the Canadian dollar and the 

euro, but gained 1¼ percent against sterling and almost 3¼ percent against the yen.  

Although recent Japanese data have been somewhat softer than during the first half of 

the year, that economy apparently advanced further.  Bank of Japan officials have

Credit Market Developments 

Four high-profile companies—Refco, Delphi, and Delta and Northwest Airlines—
filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in the last six weeks; corporate bonds 
with par value totaling slightly more than $8 billion were affected by these filings.  
Refco, a large derivatives broker, collapsed when clients deserted the firm following 
the revelation of accounting irregularities just two months after its initial public 
offering.  Delphi, the largest U.S. automobile parts manufacturer, cited its inability 
to reach cost-cutting agreements with unions and with General Motors—from 
which it spun off in 1999—as reasons for its filing.  Competition from low-cost 
carriers and soaring fuel prices were instrumental in the airlines’ defaults.  Some of 
these firms may have filed for bankruptcy more quickly than they otherwise would 
have in order to avoid the corporate provisions of the new bankruptcy law, which 
took effect on October 17. 

Delphi’s bankruptcy filing rekindled investors’ concerns about credit quality in the 
automobile sector—where spreads on several firms, including Ford and General 
Motors, initially rose sharply and have since remained volatile.  The airlines’ 
defaults, however, elicited little reaction, as they were largely expected.  Refco’s 
collapse had no discernible effect on financial market functioning, as its wind-down 
was orderly and its accounting troubles were seen as isolated.  Overall, the impact 
of the bankruptcies on the broad credit market appears to have been limited.  In a 
sign that investors expect little spillover from the recent defaults, a measure of the 
likelihood that future defaults in the investment-grade sector will be clustered—the 
so-called implied default correlation obtained from CDS index tranches—has 
remained extremely low.  The equivalent measure for the speculative-grade sector 
has picked up, but that increase reflects in part the considerable presence of 
automobile-sector firms in the high-yield CDS index.  Even with the recent 
increase, investors apparently still judge the likelihood of correlated defaults among 
speculative-grade firms to be lower than it was last spring.

continued to hint that, given their economic outlook, the quantitative easing regime 

will likely end during the first half of next year.  Share prices in Japan made solid gains 

during the intermeeting period, led by banking and other financial-sector stocks that 

reacted positively to passage of the postal reform bill.  Stock prices in other foreign 

industrial countries recorded declines of 2 to 7 percent, broadly similar to those in 

U.S. markets.   

(5) The dollar recorded a small gain against an index of currencies of our other 

important trading partners over the intermeeting period.  The dollar moved up 

¾ percent against the peso, as the Bank of Mexico eased its overnight lending rate 

25 basis points for the second time in recent months.  The dollar continued on its 

downward trend against the Brazilian real, and the Brazilian central bank surprised 

markets with a 50 basis point easing of its policy rate to counter weakening domestic 

demand.  Equity prices in many emerging market countries dropped fairly sharply, as 

investor demand for riskier assets appeared to abate with increases in U.S. interest 

rates.   

(6) Domestic nonfinancial debt is estimated to have advanced briskly in the 

third quarter, rising 8¼ percent on net (Chart 4).  Growth in household debt appears 

to have edged down in the third quarter owing to a slowing in mortgage debt growth, 

although the forecast of the latter remains at an elevated level.  Household 

bankruptcies surged in the weeks immediately before bankruptcy reforms went into 

effect on October 17.  The debt of nonfinancial businesses appears to have risen in 

the third quarter at a rate comparable to increases seen in the first half of the year.  In 

October, bond issuance has slowed as higher yields may have discouraged new longer-

term issues.  Commercial paper, which ran off at quarter-end, bounced back in early 

October.  Bank loans to businesses continued to advance briskly, and the results of 

the most recent Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey show some further easing of 

lending terms and standards for such loans.

(7) M2 expanded at an annual rate of 6 percent in September, bringing third-

quarter growth to 4 percent.  The increase in September was in part attributable to a 

surge in retail money market funds and to a boost to currency and liquid deposits 

resulting from Hurricane Katrina.6  Growth in nominal output in the third quarter 

likely exceeded that of M2, implying a further rise in velocity.  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

                                           
6 Through September, the Federal Emergency Management Agency had paid out about 
$2 billion in the Gulf region, and insurance transfers are estimated to have been about 
$1 billion, a portion of which will likely rest in liquid deposits for a time.  The staff assumes 
that by year-end, FEMA will have paid out about $6.5 billion and insurance companies will 
have delivered nearly $9.5 billion as a result of the hurricanes. 

Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) Page 10 of 36



Economic Outlook 

(8) The staff has revised down slightly its projection for real GDP growth since 

the September Greenbook, as the rise in longer-term yields, drop in equity values, and 

appreciation of the exchange value of the dollar over the intermeeting period 

established a launching-off point for the forecast consistent with more financial 

restraint than in the previous projection.  The outlook is predicated on the same 

cumulative amount of policy tightening, which brings the federal funds rate to 

4¼ percent, but is now based on an assumption that the process of firming will be 

completed this year, rather than in the middle of next year.  At the time of the 

September meeting, market participants had foreseen a little less tightening than the 

staff; now they foresee somewhat more.  As a result, bond yields are forecast to 

decline slightly as investors’ expectations for policy gradually come into line with the 

lower path in the staff outlook.  As in previous forecasts, the stock market generates 

risk-adjusted returns similar to those on fixed-income investments, while the foreign 

exchange value of the dollar depreciates modestly.  In the context of these financial 

conditions and the impetus to spending from a burst of rebuilding in the Gulf region, 

GDP grows a little faster than the 3 percent expansion of potential output next year 

and a little slower than that pace in 2007.  The unemployment rate in 2007 edges 

slightly above the estimated NAIRU of 5 percent and the output gap widens a bit to 

almost ½ percent.  Core PCE inflation picks up to 2¼ percent next year, in light of 

some pass-through to inflation expectations of recently elevated headline inflation.  

However, falling energy prices help bring overall PCE inflation down from 

3¼ percent this year to 2 percent in 2006 and 1¾ percent in 2007 and, along with a 

little economic slack, pull core inflation below 2 percent in 2007.  

Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) Page 11 of 36



Policy Alternatives 

(9) This Bluebook presents three policy alternatives for the Committee’s 

consideration, summarized by the draft statements in Table 1.  Under Alternative A, 

the Committee would leave its target for the federal funds rate unchanged at 

3¾ percent at this meeting; the statement emphasizes uncertainties surrounding the 

economic dislocations of the hurricanes and associated effects on consumer and 

business confidence, but still signals that remaining monetary policy accommodation 

could likely be removed at a measured pace.  Under Alternatives B and C, the 

Committee would raise the target federal funds rate 25 basis points.  Alternative B 

retains much of the statement the Committee issued after its September meeting, 

including the characterization that policy remains accommodative.  Alternative C 

takes a somewhat more aggressive tone and eliminates the balance-of-risks, 

accommodative, and measured pace language.7   

(10) Although core inflation readings have been favorable in recent months, 

Committee members may be concerned that, in light of some signs of sharply higher 

near-term inflation expectations and reports of greater pricing power, elevated energy 

and other costs threaten to pass through significantly to core price inflation.  If the 

Committee believes that a continued measured pace of policy firming will prove 

sufficient to contain these inflationary pressures, it might be inclined to raise the target 

funds rate another 25 basis points at this meeting and choose language as in 

Alternative B.  As seen in Chart 5, a 25 basis point increase in the target funds rate 

would move the real funds rate into the range of rates estimated by the staff to be 

broadly consistent with closing the output gap over the next few years.  However, the 

                                           
7  The box “Other Language Alternatives” at the end of this section considers other possible 
modifications to the language.  Given the wholesale changes proposed in the third row of 
Table 1, we have not followed the usual practice of striking out deletions and bolding 
insertions relative to the prior statement.

2. Output appeared poised to continue growing at a 
good pace before the tragic toll of Hurricane 
Katrina. The widespread devastation in the Gulf 
region, the associated dislocation of economic 
activity, and the boost to energy prices imply that 
spending, production, and employment will be set 
back in the near term. In addition to elevating 
premiums for some energy products, the disruption 
to the production and refining infrastructure may 
add to energy price volatility.   
While these unfortunate developments have 
increased uncertainty about near-term economic 
performance, it is the Committee's view that they 
do not pose a more persistent threat. Rather, 
monetary policy accommodation, coupled with 
robust underlying growth in productivity, is 
providing ongoing support to economic activity.  

Elevated energy prices and 
hurricane-related disruptions in 
economic activity seem to have 
slowed the growth of spending, set 
back employment, and weakened 
consumer and business confidence.  
The persistence of such effects is 
uncertain, but robust underlying 
growth of productivity and 
monetary policy accommodation are 
providing support to economic 
activity.   

Elevated energy prices and 
hurricane-related disruptions in 
economic activity seem to have 
temporarily slowed the growth of 
spending and set back employment.  
However, monetary policy 
accommodation, coupled with 
robust underlying growth in 
productivity, is providing ongoing 
support to economic activity.  
Spending will also be boosted by 
rebuilding efforts in hurricane-
affected areas. 

The disruptive effects of recent 
hurricanes seem likely to be 
temporary, especially in light of 
increased spending associated with 
rebuilding efforts.  Economic 
growth continues to be supported 
by robust underlying growth in 
productivity. 

Rationale 

3. Higher energy and other costs have the 
potential to add to inflation pressures.   
However, core inflation has been relatively 
low in recent months, and longer-term 
inflation expectations remain contained. 

High energy and other costs have 
added to inflation pressures.  
However, core inflation has been 
relatively low in recent months, and 
longer-term inflation expectations 
remain contained. 

The cumulative rise in energy and 
other costs has added to inflation 
pressures.  However, core inflation 
has been relatively low in recent 
months, and longer-term inflation 
expectations remain contained.    

Core inflation and longer-term 
inflation expectations remain 
contained. However, high energy and 
other costs have boosted near-term 
inflation expectations and price 
pressures, likely making further policy 
firming necessary. 

4. The Committee perceives that, with 
appropriate monetary policy action, the upside 
and downside risks to the attainment of both 
sustainable growth and price stability should 
be kept roughly equal.

Equilibrium Real Rate Chart: Explanatory Notes 
 

The equilibrium real rate is the real federal funds rate that, if maintained, would be projected to return 
output to its potential level over time.  For the first three measures listed below, the short-run 
equilibrium rate is defined as the rate that would close the output gap in twelve quarters given the 
corresponding model’s projection of the economy.  For the first two measures, the medium-run concept 
is the value of the real funds rate projected to keep output at potential in seven years under the 
assumption that monetary policy acts to bring actual and potential output into line in the short run and 
then keep them equal thereafter.  The TIPS-based factor model measure provides an estimate of market 
expectations for the real federal funds rate seven years ahead.  The actual real federal funds rate shown 
in the chart employs the log difference of the core PCE price index over the previous four quarters as a 
proxy for expected inflation, with the staff projection used for the current quarter. 
   

Measure Description 

Single-Equation 
Model  

The measure of the equilibrium real rate in the single-equation model is based on an 
estimated aggregate-demand relationship between the current value of the output gap and 
its lagged values as well as the lagged values of the real federal funds rate.  In light of this 
model’s simple structure, the short-run measure of the equilibrium real rate depends only 
on the recent position of output relative to potential, and the medium-run measure is 
virtually constant. 

Small Structural 
Model 

The small-scale model of the economy consists of equations for five variables: the output 
gap, the equity premium, the federal budget surplus, the trend growth rate of output, and 
the real bond yield.  Unlike the estimates from the single-equation model, values of the 
equilibrium real rate also depend directly on conditions associated with output growth, 
fiscal policy, and capital markets. 

Large Model 
(FRB/US) 

Estimates of the equilibrium real rate using FRB/US—the staff’s large-scale econometric 
model of the U.S. economy—depend on a very broad array of economic factors, some of 
which take the form of projected values of the model’s exogenous variables.  These 
projections make use of several simple forecasting rules which are appropriate for the 
three-year horizon relevant for the short-run concept but are less sensible over longer 
horizons.  Thus, we report only the short-run measure for the FRB/US model. 

Greenbook-
consistent  

Measures of the equilibrium real rate cannot be directly obtained from the Greenbook 
forecast, because the Greenbook is not based on a formal model.  Rather, we use the 
FRB/US model in conjunction with an extended version of the Greenbook forecast to 
derive a Greenbook-consistent measure.  FRB/US is first add-factored so that its 
simulation matches the extended Greenbook forecast, and then a second simulation is run 
off this baseline to determine the value of the real federal funds rate that closes the output 
gap.  The medium-run concept of the equilibrium real rate is not computed because it 
requires a relatively long extension of the Greenbook forecast. 

TIPS-based 
Factor Model 

Yields on TIPS (Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities) reflect investors’ expectations of 
the future path of real interest rates, but also include term and liquidity premiums.  The 
TIPS-based measure of the equilibrium real rate is constructed using the seven-year-ahead 
instantaneous real forward rate derived from TIPS yields as of the Bluebook publication 
date.  This forward rate is adjusted to remove estimates of the term and liquidity 
premiums based on a three-factor arbitrage-free term-structure model applied to TIPS 
yields, nominal yields, and inflation.  Because TIPS indexation is based on the total CPI, 
this measure is also adjusted for the medium-term difference—projected at 40 basis 
points—between total CPI inflation and core PCE inflation. 

 

Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) Page 15 of 36



Committee may believe that higher real interest rates and a bit more resource slack 

will be required to contain inflation, making it appropriate to issue a statement 

suggesting that more tightening is likely in store.  Such a policy course might also be 

favored if the Committee viewed the current rate of core inflation to be at or above 

the upper limit of a range consistent with price stability.  With most measures of labor 

compensation posting moderate gains and some reversal of the runup in energy prices 

in prospect, members may believe that remaining firming can be done gradually, 

consistent with the measured pace language of Alternative B.  While a policy hike at 

this meeting would place the funds rate at the high end of the prescriptions of several 

policy rules that are based on a 1½ percent objective for core PCE inflation, that is 

only a matter of timing because those rules indicate a need for an even higher funds 

rate by mid-2006 (Chart 6).   

(11) The Committee may wish to begin the rationale portion of the statement 

for Alternative B by reaffirming the view that adverse effects of the hurricanes will 

probably slow the pace of the expansion only temporarily.  Robust underlying growth 

in productivity may still be seen as a support for economic activity.  The statement 

could also note the boost to aggregate demand from increased private and public 

spending associated with rebuilding efforts in hurricane-affected areas.  While a 

25 basis point move would place the funds rate at about the midpoint of the staff's 

range of estimated equilibrium rates, the Committee may still prefer to characterize 

policy as accommodative in light of the underlying strength of demand and upward 

pressures on inflation.  As for inflation, the Committee could cite indications, evident 

in some producer prices and in surveys of near-term inflation expectations, that “The 

cumulative rise in energy and other costs has added to inflation pressures,” while still 

noting that “core inflation has been relatively low in recent months.”  The 

observation that “longer-term inflation expectations remain contained” may be seen 

as appropriate to convey a balanced view of the inflation outlook.

(12) Futures market quotes suggest that investors are virtually certain of a 

25 basis point firming of policy at this meeting, and surveys reveal that primary 

dealers expect little change in the nature of the statement.  Therefore, market prices 

would likely be essentially unaffected by a 25 basis point increase in the funds rate and 

the statement language as under Alternative B.   

(13) If the Committee wished to convey greater concern about upside risks to 

inflation, it might prefer to combine a 25 basis point increase in the target funds rate 

with the language included under Alternative C.  The Committee may especially 

favor this alternative if increases in energy and other costs were viewed as beginning 

to unmoor inflation expectations, potentially starting an upward shift in inflation 

dynamics that would be hard to reverse later.  Even if inflation expectations remain 

well anchored for a time, a sharper rebound in spending growth as rebuilding in the 

hurricane-affected areas picks up steam may put excessive strains on resources.  The 

proposed statement drops the characterization of policy as accommodative, but it 

indicates in the comments on inflation (row 3) that further policy firming likely is 

necessary on the thought that the Committee might soon envision moving the real 

funds rate past its neutral level—that is, to impose policy restraint.  The sentence on 

the balance of risks is also eliminated; the Committee might see that formula as 

redundant or possibly misleading about the extent of upside inflation risks at present.  

The final paragraph on the measured pace language is also dropped, allowing greater 

flexibility for possible future adjustments of policy.  The Committee may see this 

more forceful tone as warranted in light of the backup in market interest rates, 

increase in inflation compensation, and depreciation of the dollar in recent days, 

which might be viewed as signs of the emergence of inflation jitters in financial 

markets.  Indeed, the Committee may prefer to raise the target funds rate 50 basis 

points at this meeting in association with language similar to that under Alternative C 

to underscore its determination to resist an increase in inflation. 

Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) Page 19 of 36



(14) Market participants would be surprised by the removal of the measured 

pace and policy accommodation language and, perhaps, by the explicit indication that 

additional firming was likely to be necessary.  With a 25 basis point move and the 

language proposed under Alternative C, short-term interest rates and the exchange 

value of the dollar would likely rise, while stock prices would fall.  If markets revised 

down their outlook for longer-term inflation as a result of the statement, however, 

longer-term interest rates might increase only a little.  With a 50 basis point firming, 

market participants would likely raise their sense of inflation risks and the near-term 

path of expected monetary policy substantially; short- and intermediate-term market 

interest rates would jump, the dollar would rally, and the stock market could sell off 

sharply. 

(15) Committee members may wish to consider Alternative A if they think that 

the recent moderate rates of core inflation are likely to continue and if they see the 

outlook for the economy as especially uncertain because of the effects of the 

hurricanes and elevated energy prices.  Particularly if the Committee, like the staff, 

views the real federal funds rate as in the vicinity of its equilibrium level, a pause in 

policy firming might be seen as desirable, partly to await further readings on consumer 

and business sentiment and spending.  Such a pause may also be chosen if members 

believe that the real estate market is in the process of softening, which heretofore has 

been an important spur to household spending.  Under this alternative, the 

Committee might refer to “remaining” policy accommodation in the final risk 

assessment paragraph.  Markets would be surprised at the decision to leave the target 

funds rate unchanged.  Short-term interest rates would probably decline considerably 

as markets lowered the probability of near-term tightening moves.  Longer-term 

interest rates might be little changed or even back up if investors saw the FOMC as 

more tolerant than they expected of an increase in inflation.  The foreign exchange 

value of the dollar would likely fall, especially if inflation expectations deteriorated.

Money and Debt Forecasts 

(17)  Under the staff forecast, M2 is expected to expand 3¾ percent this year, 

almost 2½ percentage points slower than nominal GDP, owing to rising opportunity 

costs (Table 2).  With short-term market rates assumed to be unchanged in 2006 and 

2007, deposit rates should gradually catch up, partially unwinding the recent sharp 

increases in the opportunity cost of money holding.  As a consequence, M2 is 

projected to accelerate to a 4½ percent pace next year and 5 percent in 2007, a little 

below and above the growth rates of nominal GDP, respectively.  Domestic 

 

Other Language Alternatives 
 
Committee members have recognized for some time that certain features of its 
policy statement would not prove durable, not the least being its characterization 
of policy as accommodative and its prediction that this accommodation can be 
removed at a pace that is likely to be measured.  The assessment that policy is 
accommodative becomes increasingly problematic as the real federal funds rate 
enters the range of plausible estimates of its equilibrium level.  Moreover, the 
Committee may feel it necessary to move the real funds rate beyond its neutral 
level to unwind inflationary pressures or to roll back some of the rise in inflation 
over the past couple of years.  In doing so, the Committee might be reluctant to 
switch its characterization of policy from accommodative to contractionary.  Two 
alternatives might be considered. 
 
For one, if it is important to convey the sense that policy action will remain 
gradual, the statement could replace the description of the stance of policy with 
words describing the direction of its likely future action.  In particular, the key 
portion of row 5 could read: ". . .  the Committee believes that policy firming can 
continue at a pace that is likely to be measured." 
 
For another, the Committee could drop rows 4 and 5 in favor of a formula for its 
risk assessment.  One such formula, for example, was proposed in a box in the 
September Bluebook.  In that structure, the Committee would provide separate 
assessments of the risks to its two goals under the explicit assumption that the 
stance of policy remains unchanged for the next few quarters.

nonfinancial sector debt is expected to grow around 8¼ percent this year and then 

decelerate to a 6½ percent pace in 2007.  Less rapid home price appreciation tempers

presented in Table 1 are provided below. 

Directive Wording 
The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and financial 

conditions that will foster price stability and promote sustainable growth 

in output.  To further its long-run objectives, the Committee in the 

immediate future seeks conditions in reserve markets consistent with 

MAINTAINING/increasing/REDUCING the federal funds rate 

AT/to an average of around ____________ 3¾ percent. 

Risk Assessments  

A. The Committee perceives that, with appropriate monetary policy 

action, the upside and downside risks to the attainment of both 

sustainable growth and price stability should be kept roughly equal.  

With underlying inflation expected to be contained, the Committee 

believes that remaining policy accommodation can be removed at a 

pace that is likely to be measured.  Nonetheless, the Committee will 

respond to changes in economic prospects as needed to fulfill its 

obligation to maintain price stability.

Inflation Indicator Based on M2

Note: P* is defined to equal M2 times V* divided by potential GDP. V*, or long-run velocity, is estimated
using average velocity over the 1959:Q1-to-1989:Q4 period and then, after a break, over the interval from
1993:Q1 to the present. For the forecast period, P* is based on the staff M2 forecast and P is simulated using a
short-run dynamic model relating P to P*. Blue areas indicate periods in which P* is notably less than P.
Gray areas denote the projection period.
