The attached document represents the most complete and accurate version 
available based on original copies culled from the files of the FOMC Secretariat at the 
Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System.  This electronic document was 
created through a comprehensive digitization process which included identifying the best-
preserved paper copies, scanning those copies,1 and then making the scanned versions 
text-searchable.2  Though a stringent quality assurance process was employed, some 
imperfections may remain. 
 

Please note that this document may contain occasional gaps in the text.  These

scanned images were deskewed (to remove the effects of printer- and scanner-introduced tilting) and lightly 
cleaned (to remove dark spots caused by staple holes, hole punches, and other blemishes caused after initial 
printing). 
2 A two-step process was used.  An advanced optimal character recognition computer program (OCR) first 
created electronic text from the document image.  Where the OCR results were inconclusive, staff checked

STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL (FR) CLASS II FOMC

OCTOBER 31, 2002

MONETARY POLICY ALTERNATIVES

PREPARED FOR THE FEDERAL OPEN MARKET COMMITTEE

BY THE STAFF OF THE BOARD OF GOVERNORS OF THE FEDERAL RESERVE SYSTEM



1  The federal funds rate averaged close to 1-3/4 percent over the intermeeting period.  With
currency growth quite low relative to historical trends, the Desk made no outright purchases during
the period.  Other market factors generally added reserves, and the Desk responded by reducing the
outstanding volume of long-term System RPs from $11 billion to $6 billion.

Class II – FOMC

MONETARY POLICY ALTERNATIVES

Recent Developments

(1) Market participants had expected the FOMC to keep both the intended

federal funds rate unchanged and the risk assessment tilted toward economic

weakness at the September 24th meeting.  But the inclusion of concerns about

“heightened geopolitical risks” in the announcement and the indication of two

dissenting votes favoring an easing of monetary policy led markets to expect a lower

trajectory for the policy rate.  A subsequent rally in equity prices tended to buoy

market interest rates and policy expectations.  In recent days, however, generally

weaker-than-anticipated economic data and press reports suggesting that the FOMC

was inclined to ease by year-end left the expected path of policy lower on net over the

period (chart 1).1  Current futures quotes indicate that market participants place

considerable weight on policy easing at the November meeting, with survey evidence

suggesting that some are looking for a 50 basis point move.  With rates on further-

ahead futures contracts declining 20 to 45 basis points over the intermeeting period,

market participants are apparently anticipating that the funds rate will trough at

around 1-1/4 percent by spring 2003.

(2) After extending their decline in the opening days of the period, share

prices rallied sharply in October on better-than-expected profits news at several major

corporations.  In recent days, though, economic data on the softer side of market

expectations have resulted in a partial retracing of those gains.  On net, broad stock

price indexes increased about 6 percent over the period, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq

rose about 12 percent.  Equity prices were quite volatile over the period and, judging

from options on stock futures contracts, are expected to remain so.  As has been true

for a while, longer-term Treasury yields generally moved in tandem with equity prices. 

On balance over the intermeeting period, intermediate- and longer-term yields

increased 5 to 30 basis points, with the swing in ten-year Treasury yields reportedly

magnified by the efforts of holders of mortgage securities to manage the duration of

their portfolios.  Reflecting the heightened expectation of policy ease, though, yields

on Treasuries with maturities of two years or less fell on net.

(3) In the investment-grade corporate debt market, yields on higher-quality

bonds increased about as much as those on Treasuries over the intermeeting period

(chart 2).  Risk spreads on lower-quality investment-grade debt climbed 15 basis

points, as auto manufacturers and their captive finance companies in that index

underperformed, and spreads on broad high-yield debt indexes rose about 30 basis

points, suggesting further deterioration in perceived creditworthiness.  These elevated

spreads may also reflect a lack of liquidity in corporate markets, as bid-asked spreads

reportedly remained wide throughout the intermeeting period.  (The box on the next

page examines market liquidity.)

(4) The dollar moved within narrow ranges against the major foreign

currencies during the intermeeting period, and its trade-weighted value edged lower.  

Most foreign stock indexes and government bond yields followed the pattern seen in

U.S. markets, ending the period higher on net.  European ten-year benchmark bond

yields rose 20 to 25 basis points over the intermeeting period despite economic data

pointing to lackluster growth, especially in Germany.  Yields may have been

influenced by concerns over widening fiscal deficits in some key European

countries–including Germany and France–and the reopening of the debate over the

Market Liquidity

Recent evidence on market perceptions of the health of major financial
institutions and the functioning of financial markets is mixed.   Credit default swap
spreads for major commercial and investment banks rose significantly during the
summer (chart 3).  Although they have since reversed some of those increases, they
remain elevated on balance.  Credit swap spreads for finance companies have shot
up as much as 500 basis points on net. 

Increased perceptions of, and aversion toward, risk have probably been
associated with some withdrawal from market making, as reports suggest that
liquidity in many segments of the fixed-income markets has deteriorated since the
late summer.  In the Treasury market, premiums for on-the-run securities over their
off-the-run counterparts have risen since midyear, with the relatively larger increase
for the ten-year note probably related in part to its usefulness in hedging mortgage-
backed securities.  Information on bid-asked spreads and market depth is harder to
come by, but anecdotal evidence indicates that the Treasury market is functioning
well.  The deterioration in the corporate market has reportedly been more
pronounced, as market participants characterize dealing as much more difficult
than in the first half of the year.

fiscal provisions of the European Union’s Stability and Growth Pact.  In contrast,

Japanese stock prices extended their slump during the intermeeting period, with

banking shares shedding almost 9 percent.  On October 30, Japanese authorities

announced a draft version of their highly anticipated bank-reform package along with

new tax cuts, and the Bank of Japan stated that it would target a higher level of

liquidity and increase its purchases of government securities.  The announcement had

been delayed amid indications of political resistance, leading financial market

participants to scale back their expectations about the reforms.  In the event, those

market doubts appeared to be confirmed in that the announced steps were viewed as

insufficient to make much headway against Japan’s deep structural problems.

    .  The Desk did not intervene during the period for the

accounts of the System or Treasury.

(5) Against currencies of other important trading partners, the dollar was

about unchanged.  In Brazil, financial market pressures that had built up ahead of the

first round of voting on October 6 eased somewhat on perceptions that the Worker’s

Party candidate Lula (who clinched victory in the second round vote on October 27)

might be more sympathetic to business interests and more fiscally responsible than

previously thought.  Although the Brazilian real depreciated 1-1/2 percent against the

dollar over the period, Brazil’s EMBI+ spread over Treasuries narrowed about

3-1/2 percentage points (although it is still high at 18-1/2 percentage points), and its

major stock price index gained 9-1/2 percent.  The Mexican peso appreciated 2

percent against the dollar, while Mexico’s EMBI+ spread narrowed 60 basis points, to

about 385 basis points.  In emerging Asia, the rebound in technology share prices

helped Taiwan’s stock market gain 6 percent.  Korean stock prices also participated in

the mid-October technology-driven recovery, but still moved down for the period as a

whole.

(6) The weakness in borrowing of nonfinancial businesses that became

notable during the summer intensified in recent months.  Business loans, which had

leveled off in August, have been declining since then, and commercial paper

paydowns have continued (chart 4).  Corporate bonds outstanding, which had been

running off over the summer, have only stabilized in recent months.  The paucity of

borrowing appears mainly to reflect very limited needs to finance investment that

were met mainly by depleting stocks of liquid assets and tapping internally generated

funds.  Indeed, the majority of bank respondents to the October Senior Loan Officer

survey reported that C&I loan demand had declined further over the previous three

2 Banks have been reporting weaker loan demand and a tightening of standards and
terms for some time.  A special question on the October Senior Loan Officer survey asked
respondents to rank supply and demand factors as reasons for the very substantial decline in
C&I loans so far this year.  Weaker business funding needs by creditworthy borrowers was
the top reason by a wide margin. 

months, the chief reason being reduced spending on plant and equipment.  Business

lending standards and terms reportedly tightened again, on net, but by a somewhat

smaller proportion of respondents than in recent surveys.2  Households, by contrast,

continued to borrow heavily in mortgage markets and to take on additional consumer

debt through September.

(7) With the effects of past policy easings on money demand largely played

out and spending apparently softening, M2 growth has slowed to an estimated average

7-3/4 percent annual rate over September and October.  M2 likely would have

decelerated even more were it not for the boost to deposit growth provided by

increased prepayments of mortgages.  Currency growth slowed appreciably, reflecting

significantly weaker foreign demand and some moderation in domestic demand as

well.  Based on this morning’s GDP release, M2 velocity fell about 6 percent in the

third quarter even though measures of opportunity costs were little changed.  The

decline in velocity seemed largely to reflect strong flows into M2 prompted by the

volatility of financial markets and by heavy mortgage refinancing.



6

Policy Alternatives

(8) Over the intermeeting period, incoming data provided further

disappointments on production and employment and, on the whole, seemed to

suggest some flagging in the growth of consumption when compared with the

September Greenbook.  Accordingly, the staff has revised down its forecast for real

output growth over the next few quarters, but not to the point where continued

economic expansion seems to be in serious doubt.  Real GDP growth, after running

at a projected rate of only 1 percent in the current quarter, is expected to strengthen

gradually over most of the forecast period, although it remains below that of potential

growth until the second half of next year.  As a result, the civilian unemployment rate

is expected to move up to 6-1/4 percent early next year before edging lower after

mid-2003.  With economic slack persisting, core inflation is projected to drift lower,

bringing the annual rise in core PCE prices down to about 1-1/4 percent in 2003 and

2004.  This forecast assumes that the Committee keeps policy steady, as opposed to

the modest tightening built in toward the end of the forecast period in the September

Greenbook.  An unchanged funds rate is assumed to hold yields on long-term

Treasury securities near current levels, while rates on corporate issues should in time

decline somewhat as a gradual strengthening of the economic expansion results in

some unwinding of credit concerns.  Equity prices rise moderately over the forecast

period to keep risk-adjusted returns in line with those on fixed-income securities.  The

foreign exchange value of the dollar is assumed to decline a little, albeit from a current

level that is slightly higher than projected in the last Greenbook.

(9) Should the Committee believe that the business climate is still likely to

improve gradually at the current stance of policy, as conveyed by its announcement

after the September meeting, it might choose to leave the federal funds rate

unchanged at this meeting.  Such an outcome may be seen as broadly consistent with



7

3 The jagged movements in the real federal funds rate in the chart owe to swings in
the proxy for inflation expectations–the backward-looking four-quarter growth rate of core
PCE prices.  Core PCE prices were reduced significantly in the third quarter of 2001 by the
imputed payment by insurers of claims related to the destruction of the World Trade Center. 
Over time, as that observation enters and exits the calculation of the four-quarter growth
rate, PCE inflation and the associated real rate bounce around. 

the Greenbook forecast, in which output growth slowly builds momentum.  The

Committee may be particularly drawn to this policy approach if it views the current

degree of slack in resource use to be less pronounced than does the staff and hence

sees less scope for further disinflation than is embodied in the staff forecast.  In

addition, while estimates of the equilibrium real short-term interest rate have moved

lower over the past year–and some have been revised down ex post–the actual real

rate has been below the lower bound of the range of estimates since mid-2001.  Even

with the narrowing in that gap projected for the current quarter, the Committee may

be of the view that sufficient monetary stimulus is already in the pipeline given the

lags in the transmission of policy (chart 5).3  Indeed, the Committee may believe that

the Greenbook forecast, which is somewhat below the consensus outlook, is overly

pessimistic regarding prospects for aggregate demand.  As noted in the box on page 8,

while the staff projection for the next two years shows lower inflation and a higher

unemployment rate than in the prior few Greenbooks, the recent realizations of those

variables have moved the other way.  In the current quarter, higher energy prices have

boosted inflation and gains in estimates of household employment have been

associated with a lower unemployment rate than was thought likely a couple of

months ago.  The Committee might be inclined to keep policy on hold if it put more

weight on those outcomes than on forecast revisions.

Revisions to the Outlook Since the August Meeting

Economic forecasts by the staff and most market participants have turned
gloomier since mid-August when the Committee moved its assessment of the
balance of risks to one tilted toward economic weakness.  Some of that forecast
revision owes to changes in the assessment of aggregate demand and other
fundamental forces and some to changes in market rates and prices.  To get some
sense of the relative contribution of the former, a simulation was run using the
FRB/US model in which the August Greenbook was revised to incorporate the
current assumption of a flat federal funds rate (as opposed to the higher August
Greenbook path).  The dotted lines in chart 6 depict this adjusted August
simulation, while the solid lines depict the most recent Greenbook.

In the staff’s current assessment, real GDP growth is likely to take longer to
return to its potential than was the case in August, implying that the unemployment
rate runs higher.  With a larger cumulative buildup of resource slack, disinflation is
more pronounced.  However, near-term developments have led the staff to mark
the unemployment rate down and inflation up for this year.

Mechanical policy rules relying on current and lagged observations of
macroeconomic data, such as the Taylor rule, would take those near-term revisions
as reasons to raise the policy rate.  By contrast, mechanical policy rules relying on
current and projected variables, such as the policymaker perfect foresight path that
is discussed below, would put more emphasis on the revisions to the forecast and
call for easier policy than was the case in August.

(10) Market prices appear to embody significant odds that the Committee will

ease policy at this meeting.  Accordingly, a decision to leave policy unchanged,

presumably accompanied by the assessment expected in the markets that the risks

remain tilted toward economic weakness, is likely to have a noticeable effect on asset

prices.  Interest rates could move up, particularly at the short end of the yield curve,

and equity prices would probably fall.  The balance-of-risks statement, the wording of

the rest of the announcement, and the vote tally will influence the odds investors

place on policy easing going forward and thus affect the response of financial markets.

(11)   The Committee instead might ease policy 25 basis points if, in view

of signs of slowing aggregate demand growth, it now sees the likely degree of

economic slack several quarters ahead with an unchanged stance of policy as

unacceptable, especially given subdued readings on inflation expectations and the

prospects for further disinflation.  The incoming data suggest that spending by both

households and businesses has been weaker than expected by the staff, and the

Committee might be concerned that economic growth could turn out slower than in

the Greenbook outlook.  Also, whether financial conditions will prove to be as

supportive of growth as the staff expects is open to question:  Credit spreads and

liquidity conditions in segments of the corporate bond market have deteriorated, and

banks have continued to firm terms and standards on business loans, albeit in fewer

numbers than earlier in the year.  With some large financial intermediaries themselves

encountering market resistance, their ability to make markets and intermediate credit

flows could be crimped to a greater degree than anticipated by the staff, potentially

contributing to some diminution in market liquidity and credit availability.  In these

circumstances, the Committee may believe the time has come to bolster spending by

easing policy.  Presumably, the Committee would see a relatively small policy

adjustment of 25 basis points as not likely to put the risks back into balance,

particularly in view of the apparent weakening in the economic outlook since the last

meeting. 

(12) The Committee might view the signs of softening growth that have

become apparent over the past six weeks as especially troubling in association with

historically low inflation and nominal interest rates as well as the significant downside

risks already envisioned by the Committee since August.  In these circumstances, the

Committee might wish to move aggressively to shore up aggregate demand through a

50-basis-point easing of policy and might see little cost to doing so in terms of a

are depicted in chart 7 entail a substantial near-term easing of monetary policy, even

with an inflation target as low as 1 percent.  Moreover, while those simulations by

definition assume no uncertainty in forecasting economic relationships, the

Committee might be concerned that weaker spending propensities or more favorable

inflation-output tradeoffs could well result in still lower inflation rates.  The possibility

of significant further disinflation might be viewed as unduly heightening the risk that

the ability to lower real interest rates could be constrained by the zero bound to

nominal rates.  Although the Committee might be reluctant to claim that a 25-basis-

point easing would balance the risks to the economy and inflation, a move of 50 basis

points might more plausibly do so.

(13) A 25-basis-point reduction in the target federal funds rate, coupled with

a statement that the risks remained weighted toward economic weakness, likely would

provide a small boost to financial markets, lowering yields and raising stock prices,

although the magnitude of these influences could be affected considerably by the

content of the Committee’s statement.  If the statement emphasized a need to combat

weakness in aggregate demand as the primary rationale for the policy action, the effect

on equity prices could be muted and that on longer-term interest rates accentuated,

but if the statement suggested that the principal motivation was to provide greater

assurance of a satisfactory expansion, gains in equity prices and declines in corporate

bond yields could be more noticeable while the net effects on Treasury bond yields

might be smaller.  A 50-basis-point cut in the funds rate target, even if accompanied

by a statement that the risks to the outlook were seen as balanced, likely would

prompt sizable drops in yields across the maturity and credit spectrums, although the

fall in long-term Treasury yields could be limited if equity markets rally strongly.

The perfect foresight simulations extend the key assumptions of the staff outlook (other than the path for monetary policy) through 2008:
      ●      potential output grows at about 3-1/2 percent per year
      ●      the relative price of oil stabilizes at its 2005 level
      ●      the exchange value of dollar measured in real terms falls at a 3 percent clip
      ●      modest growth in federal expenditures allows an improvement in the federal budget balance

1.  The real federal funds rate is calculated as the quarterly average nominal funds rate minus the four-quarter lagged core PCE inflation
rate as a proxy for inflation expectations.

(14) Under the Greenbook forecast, the growth rate of nonfederal debt edges

down over the next couple of quarters.  Household debt growth is projected to

moderate as spending on motor vehicles slows and as mortgage refinancing activity

turns down from its current stratospheric levels.  Business borrowing strengthens

slightly but remains comparatively weak in coming months as inventory and fixed

investment turns up only gradually.  With economic growth increasing only tentatively

and investment projects seen as entailing considerable risks, the availability and terms

of credit facing businesses are expected to change little in the near term, although they

should ease somewhat later in the projection period as it becomes more evident to

market participants that the expansion is gaining traction.  Federal borrowing is likely

to be reduced somewhat in the current quarter by the Treasury’s unexpectedly high

cash balance at the end of the third quarter but is expected to rebound in the first

quarter as the effects of deficits again fully show through.  On balance, domestic

nonfinancial sector debt is projected to expand at around a 6 percent pace in the

fourth and first quarters, slightly slower than over the first three quarters of 2002. 

M2 growth is also expected to moderate in coming months from its pace over the past

several quarters, owing to projected reductions in mortgage refinancing, the ebbing

influence of past reductions in short-term interest rates and opportunity costs on

money demand, and a more attractive equity market.  Over the four quarters of 2002,

M2 is projected to expand 7 percent, while its velocity declines 2-3/4 percent.

Directive and Balance-of-Risks Language

(15) Presented below for the members' consideration is draft wording for

(1) the directive and (2) the “balance of risks” sentence to be included in the press

release issued after the meeting (not part of the directive).

(1) Directive Wording

The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and

financial conditions that will foster price stability and promote

sustainable growth in output.  To further its long-run objectives, the

Committee in the immediate future seeks conditions in reserve markets

consistent with maintaining /INCREASING/REDUCING the federal

funds rate at/TO an average of around ___1-3/4 percent.

(2) “Balance of Risks” Sentence

Against the background of its long-run goals of price stability and

sustainable economic growth and of the information currently available,

the Committee believes that the risks [continue to be weighted mainly

towards conditions that may generate economic weakness]  [ARE

BALANCED WITH RESPECT TO PROSPECTS FOR BOTH

GOALS] [ARE WEIGHTED MAINLY TOWARD CONDITIONS

THAT MAY  GENERATE HEIGHTENED INFLATION

PRESSURES] in the foreseeable future.
