Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System.  This electronic document was 
created through a comprehensive digitization process which included identifying the best-
preserved paper copies, scanning those copies,1 and then making the scanned versions 
text-searchable.2  Though a stringent quality assurance process was employed, some 
imperfections may remain. 
 

Please note that this document may contain occasional gaps in the text.  These

MONETARY POLICY ALTERNATIVES

CLASS I - FOMC February 2, 1990

MONETARY POLICY ALTERNATIVES

Recent developments

(1) The federal funds rate eased from 8-1/2 percent to the vicin-

ity of 8-1/4 percent immediately after the December FOMC meeting, follow-

ing the decision at that meeting to seek a slightly more accommodative

stance of policy. Funds traded near 8-1/4 percent throughout the inter-

meeting period, except for some firming in the last week of the year owing

to reserve shortfalls and year-end pressures. Adjustment plus seasonal

borrowing ran above the $125 million allowance during the intermeeting

period, averaging $309 million over the three completed maintenance

periods. Initially, the above-path borrowing reflected the reserve short-

falls and a propensity for larger institutions to borrow over the long

holiday weekends. Most recently, borrowing by the Bank of New England has

boosted adjustment credit considerably.1 Abstracting from borrowing by

this institution, adjustment plus seasonal borrowing averaged $160 million

in the statement period ending January 24, and $125 million through the

first eight days of the current maintenance period.

(2) Conditions in capital markets deteriorated over the inter-

meeting period, as bond yields surged about 1/2 percentage point and stock

indexes plunged nearly 8 percent from highs registered at the start of the

year. Bond yields began to rise right after the December meeting as in-

coming information on the economy and prices was seen as pointing away

1. The Desk has viewed this borrowing as special-situation borrowing,
akin to nonborrowed reserves, though it has not yet been classified
officially as extended credit.



from recession and as suggesting little if any moderation in underlying

inflation trends. As a result, investors apparently reevaluated prospects

for an extended period of policy easing. By mid-January, tightening mone-

tary policy abroad and published reports that certain Board members would

not support easing policy at that time sparked a backup in short-term

rates and pushed long-term rates up further. A striking aspect of inter-

est rate developments during the intermeeting period was the parallel

surge in bond yields worldwide--about 50 basis points in Germany and near-

ly 100 basis points in Japan, where political worries also came into play.

As in the United States, these developments partly reflected growing ex-

pectations of a bias toward a less accommodative monetary policy in the

context of heightened concerns about inflation. In addition, however, the

historic changes now taking place in Europe may have signalled the pros-

pect of significantly greater economic opportunities there, as evidenced

by the relatively strong performance of the German stock market. A re-

direction of global asset demands, particularly out of Japan, to take

advantage of the higher expected real returns associated with those

opportunities would be consistent with investors requiring higher real

returns in U.S. markets and elsewhere, as well as with the observed

weakening of both the dollar and the yen against continental European

currencies.

(3) Spreads between private and Treasury rates narrowed over the

intermeeting interval, except in the junk bond market where they were

relatively constant. Returns on private instruments at the 3-month matur-

ity declined about 1/4 point and the 3-month Treasury bill rate rose about



1/8 point; a similar narrowing occurred between longer-term Treasury debt

and both investment-grade bonds and mortgage instruments. Some narrowing

might have been expected on the basis of the passing of year-end pres-

sures, and the usual lags of rates on private paper behind Treasury

yields. But the extent is somewhat surprising, especially in light of

concerns about commercial banks' real estate portfolios and the deterio-

rating condition of a number of highly leveraged borrowers. Supply con-

siderations may have contributed: Corporate and municipal borrowing

dropped to unusually low levels, especially in bond markets; at the same

time attention began to be given to the possibility of considerable addi-

tional government borrowing to support the thrift bailout, and the private

sector has had to absorb greater amounts of bills as Federal Reserve and

foreign official holdings ran down.

(4) The decline in the dollar against the mark amounted to 3-1/4

percent. However, the dollar was relatively firm against the currencies

of Japan and Canada.

; the Desk sold $600 million

against the yen. On a weighted-average basis, the dollar fell 2-1/2 per-

cent over the intermeeting period.



(5) Growth in M2 slowed in January, owing primarily to a decline

in transaction deposits.2 M2 expanded at about a 5 percent rate last

month, bringing growth over December and January to 6-1/2 percent, below

the 8-1/2 percent pace expected at the December FOMC meeting. As of

January, M2 stood just below the upper end of its tentative 1990 range.

Growth of the nontransaction component of M2 in January moderated somewhat

from its rapid pace of late 1989, despite a pickup of inflows to money

market mutual funds, which reportedly benefitted from flows out of weaken-

ing stock and bond markets. Demand deposits plunged at a 9 percent annual

rate, after a 4 percent growth rate in December, and OCDs grew at only a

1 percent pace in January, down from December's 12 percent rate. Demand

deposits have been especially weak over time, and have retreated to their

June 1989 level despite the subsequent policy easing.3  Still, with cur-

rency surging at a 14 percent annual rate in January, M1 eked out a

gain.

2. The monetary data presented throughout this bluebook incorporate
benchmark and seasonal factor revisions, as well as a minor redefinition
that reclassifies the overnight repurchase liabilities of thrift in-
stitutions as a component of non-M1 M2 rather than of non-M2 M3. (The
redefinition affects the level of M2 only.) The revised data are sum-
marized in Appendix A. These data should be considered confidential
until their release on February 15.

3. The growth of demand deposits has been well below model simulations
for several years. On a not-seasonally adjusted basis, demand deposits
have shown a pattern of increasing runoffs in January from year to year.
(This year's review of seasonal factors brought the growth rate of de-
mand deposits in January up from about -20 percent.) These data are
suggestive of a concentration at the start of the year of ongoing
switching from compensating balance arrangements to fees on the part of
firms.
4. Owing to the increase in currency, the monetary base accelerated to
a 10-1/2 percent rate of growth in January from 9-1/2 percent in Decem-
ber.



-5-

(6) M3 increased at around a 3-1/4 percent rate in December and

January--compared with the 5-1/2 percent pace expected by the Committee--

and is slightly below the lower limit of its tentative 1990 range.5

Runoffs of managed liabilities at thrifts accelerated in December and

January relative to November. Commercial bank managed liabilities in M3

dropped over the two months; bank credit declined in December--the first

decrease in 10 years--and the modest increase in January was funded

through continued brisk inflows of core deposits.

(7) In line with the weakness in bank credit, nonfinancial debt

growth likely slowed around year-end. The business sector has trimmed

borrowing the most, particularly in the area of highly leveraged transac-

tions, where activity has been slashed by softer business conditions and

tighter standards at lenders. Bond issuance has slackened with the rise

in interest rates, and C&I lending at banks contracted between November

and January. Commercial paper issuance has remained brisk, however, per-

haps reflecting the long delay in lowering the prime rate. (C&I lending

does appear to have rebounded and commercial paper issuance weakened some

in the weeks since the prime was cut.) Federal debt growth slowed tem-

porarily in December and January, and bond issuance also has eased in the

municipal sector so far this year. The expansion of consumer credit

strengthened in December, as weak auto-related borrowing was offset by

increased balances held on credit cards; at banks, growth of consumer

5. Foreign currency deposits amounted to $1.3 billion in January,
mostly in large time deposits. Virtually all of these deposits
apparently had been in place before this year. Consequently, the sub-
traction of these deposits, which is being implemented with the current
benchmark, is having no effect on recent growth rates.

credit was well maintained into January. Mortgage borrowing appears to

have expanded at about a steady 9 percent rate in the fourth quarter.

However, bank real estate lending slowed in January, perhaps reflecting

the recent backup in interest rates and a tightening of nonprice terms for

commercial lending.

Long-run strategies

(8) As background for Committee consideration of the ranges for

money and credit for 1990, the table below presents three alternative

longer-run strategies for monetary policy through 1994 and their conse-

quences for output and prices. Strategy I is the baseline forecast, en-

compassing the staff greenbook projections and associated policy assump-

tions for 1990 and 1991, with an extension through 1994 based on the

staff's large-scale econometric model, simulated with a presumed policy

objective of gradual progress toward price stability over time. In this

model, inflation expectations are formed on the basis of past inflation

and embody no independent "credibility effects" concerning Federal Reserve

intentions. Strategies II and III embody somewhat tighter and easier

monetary policies, respectively, as indexed by M2 growth 1 percentage

point above or below the baseline scenario. The outcomes associated with

these two strategies are derived as deviations from the baseline using the

econometric model.

(9) Under the baseline strategy policy imposes enough restraint,

through moderate upward movement in nominal and real interest rates, to

keep real GNP growth below its potential through 1991 and until 1992.

This induces a gradual increase in the unemployment rate to 6-1/4 percent

by 1992, somewhat above its assumed natural rate of 5-1/2 to 5-3/4 per-

cent. The added slack, which is maintained through the projection hori-

zon, fosters an easing of the inflation rate beginning in 1992, although

the assumption that the exchange value of the dollar stabilizes in 1992

after a period of moderate depreciation also contributes. Inflation is

reduced by about 1/3 percentage point per year, getting down to 3-1/4

percent by 1994. The slowing in inflation and nominal GNP after 1992

occurs despite a slight pickup in M2 growth, which is boosted by a drop in

nominal rates in those years (in line with the drop in inflation), and as-

sociated small decreases in velocity.

(10) Under the tighter policy of strategy II, inflation is

brought down more rapidly, but at the cost of temporarily greater slack in

the economy. The slower M2 growth of this strategy requires a more force-

ful increaes in nominal short-term interest rates through 1991. With the

accompanying higher real values of both interest and exchange rates rela-

tive to the base case, both real domestic demand and net exports are more

restrained, and the unemployment rate is farther above its natural rate.

Inflation decelerates 1/2 percentage point in 1993 and in 1994, ending up



-10-

at 2 percent, more than 1 percentage point below its pace in the base

case. By 1994, nominal interest rates have fallen a bit below their base

case levels, given the moderation in inflation. Were the results of the

early tightening under this alternative to strengthen people's convictions

about the Federal Reserve's commitment to attain price stability, nominal

interest rates would be still lower and progress against inflation could

be achieved with less slack in the economy.

(11) The easier policy of strategy III accommodates real GNP

near its potential after 1990, keeping the unemployment rate below 6 per-

cent, in the vicinity of its natural rate. Inflation increases a little

through 1992 owing to a more rapid depreciation of the dollar, before

stabilizing just below 5 percent. After declining this year, nominal

short-term interest rates would need to rise in 1991 and 1992 to hold M2

expansion to only 1 percentage point above the base case, given the faster

nominal GNP growth.

(12) Inflation rate predictions derived from the staff's P* model

are presented below for the same three M2 growth strategies. By the end

of the forecast horizon, the results of the P* model are essentially the

same as those of the simulations reported above. The pattern of price

movements in the intervening years is somewhat different, however. Infla-

tion is slightly lower in the near term in the P* simulations than in the

large-scale model simulations, likely owing to the influence of assumed

dollar depreciation on price forecasts in the judgmental projection that

provided the baseline for the latter projections. Moreover, the P* model

gives a somewhat different flavor than the other simulations for inflation



-11-

in 1995 and beyond. In the baseline case, the price level is equal to P*

at the end of 1994, implying no downward pressures on inflation at that

time; but in the large-model simulation the unemployment rate at the end

of 1994 is above its natural rate, which is consistent with a further

slowing of price increases.

Long-run ranges

(13) The table below shows the tentative ranges adopted last July

for growth of money and the debt of nonfinancial sectors over 1990, along

with three alternatives. (Appendix B gives the ranges and outcomes for

money and debt growth since 1978.) Alternative II might be considered

roughly equivalent to the current tentative ranges, with technical adjust-

ments to take account of the effects of thrift restructuring on M3 and of

ebbing equity retirements on debt growth, both of which are larger than

contemplated when the tentative ranges were adopted. Alternative I would

allow for a somewhat easier policy and alternative III somewhat tighter.

-13-

(14) M2 would be expected to grow about 6-1/2 percent in 1990

under the greenbook forecast of 5-3/4 percent nominal GNP growth, with

interest rates remaining around recent levels. The lagged effects of

decreases in market interest rates through the end of last year should

continue to boost M2 demand early in 1990, accounting for the slight de-

cline in velocity for the year (shown on chart 1).7 The increase in M2

is in the middle of the range of model forecasts. However, the M2 projec-

tion is subject to some downside risk from thrift restructuring. As

thrifts are closed in 1990, substantial amounts of core deposits are ex-

pected to shift to commercial banks; in reaction, banks may trim rates on

retail deposits, which would restrain M2. The M1 component of M2 is ex-

pected to increase 4 percent in 1990.8 The rise in M1 velocity would be

a little more than its underlying trend, despite the carryover effect of

lower interest rates; demand deposits are projected to continue their

relatively weak performance, which may reflect ongoing shifts from com-

pensating balances to fees to pay for bank services.

(15) M3 will be substantially affected by the shrinkage of the

thrift industry. The extent and effect of the restructuring is difficult

to foresee. At this time, the staff projects that total assets at SAIF-

insured institutions could decline on the order of $130 billion this year,

as compared with a previous trend of asset growth that would have implied

a $60 to $70 billion increase. Some of these assets will be absorbed by

7. The staff M2 forecast makes no allowance for any new tax-favored
savings instruments. Currently, IRAs are excluded from the aggregates
owing to their extreme illiquidity. In addition, the money projections
incorporate negligible shifting from the aggregates to the newly
authorized foreign currency deposits.
8. The monetary base is projected to increase 5 percent in 1990.

the RTC as it resolves institutions, and be financed, we assume, by

government or agency debt, not by liabilities in M3. Banks are likely

to acquire a substantial portion of assets that would otherwise have been

held by thrifts, but the bulk, even of those assets outside the RTC, will

end up with other holders. The staff expects growth in bank credit out-

side of mortgage assets to moderate a little further in 1990, as demand

eases off with the slowing in nominal income growth and as capital re-

quirements and concern about credit quality reduce the incentives to

supply credit. On net the total of credit intermediated through depos-

itories likely will remain quite subdued in 1990. The damping of associ-

ated funding needs will be mirrored in substantial runoffs of managed

liabilities, including those in M3, holding the growth of M3 once again

below that of M2. M3 is projected to grow 4 percent over 1990, up a

little from 1989, as the pickup in funding from M2 core deposits replaces

some non-M3 managed liabilities as well as those in M3.

(16) Growth of the debt of nonfinancial sectors is projected to

slow to 7 percent in 1990 from 8 percent in 1989. To a degree, this re-

flects greater caution in granting credit in the face of a soft economy

and rising credit difficulties. This effect is most apparent in the

reduced pace of corporate restructurings, which account for close to half

of the deceleration. The restructuring of the thrift industry, which is

greatly affecting the channels of mortgage financing, is not expected to

have a major impact on the cost and availability of residential mortgage

capital to be raised in effect in the brokered deposit market--one of
the options under consideration.



-15-

credit, though there reportedly are dislocations in access to construction

financing. Diversified lenders are likely to continue to fill the gap

left by the thrifts, as they apparently did in the second half of 1989,

when spreads of rates on mortgages over Treasury issues remained constant

over the second half of the year in the face of major decreases in thrift

mortgage holdings. Federal government borrowing should decelerate in 1990

as the budget deficit narrows; the latter development is contingent on RTC

working capital being raised outside the federal sector.10 On balance, the

slowing of debt growth is not much more than the slowing of nominal GNP,

and the velocity of debt (see chart 2) is projected to continue to de-

cline.

(17) As noted above, alternative II could be considered equiv-

alent to the tentative ranges adopted in July. The staff projection of

nominal GNP and associated M2 growth over 1990 is little different than in

July, so that keeping the 3 to 7 percent range for that aggregate implies,

as it did last July, about the same greater scope for a tighter than for

an easier policy relative to that in the staff forecast. The reductions

in the M3 and debt ranges do not reflect a tighter policy stance. In the

case of debt the decrease is roughly comparable to the staff's reduced es-

timate of net equity retirements, rather than a decrease in funds to

finance spending. The reduction in the M3 range recognizes that a smaller

share of mortgage flows will be financed by depository institutions. The

decline in the M3 range of only 1/2 percentage point represents only 1/4

of the estimated effect of the rechanneling of flows on M3 growth. In the

gate would raise its growth by 1/2 percentage point.



-16-

absence of the thrift restructuring, the staff likely would be projecting

about 6 percent M3 growth, unchanged from that projected last July.

(18) The higher upper end of the M2 range in alternative I allows

greater scope for an easier monetary policy should the Committee wish to

foster a stronger economy in 1990 (more in line with strategy III) albeit

with less chance of making progress on inflation in later years. In addi-

tion, the higher upper end of the range would provide room for a more

expansionary policy to counter an unexpected shortfall in aggregate de-

mand. For example, simulations with the model suggest that 7-1/2 percent

M2 growth for the year, and a drop of about 1 percentage point in interest

rates, would be needed to achieve the fourth-quarter level of real GNP in

the staff forecast if there were a 1/2 percent shortfall in demand in the

first half of the year. The lowered M3 and debt ranges still would allow

for considerably more rapid M3 and debt growth than in the staff forecast,

and thus are consistent with the faster M2 possible under this

alternative.

(19) Alternative III would lower all the ranges from their tenta-

tive levels, and might be considered most consistent with strategy II

above, intended to make more certain progress in slowing inflation.

Although the tentative M2 range would allow for a substantially tighter

policy than assumed in the forecast, the 6-1/2 percent upper limit of the

M2 range of alternative III conveys an intention to respond promptly and

forcefully to any tendency for inflation pressures to intensify. The M2

range of this alternative also would tend to constrain any easing response

to a weaker economy, signalling a willingness to take risks on that side



-17-

to better assure a lessening of price pressures. The M3 and debt growth

ranges would be reduced by 1 percentage point to allow room for the slower

growth that might be associated with a tighter policy, given expectations

for sluggish growth in these measures under the staff forecast.



-18-

Short-run policy alternatives

(20) Three short-run alternatives are given below for Committee

consideration. Alternative B involves federal funds continuing to trade

in the 8-1/4 percent vicinity, in association with adjustment plus sea-

sonal borrowing of $150 million. The 7-3/4 percent funds rate for al-

ternative A appears roughly consistent with $100 million of borrowing,

while the 8-3/4 percent funds rate of alternative C would be accompanied

by about $200 million of borrowing. The borrowing levels for all three

alternatives abstract from any special-situation adjustment borrowing by

the Bank of New England, but incorporate an upward technical adjustment of

$25 million in part to take account of the initial stages of the typical

upswing in seasonal borrowing from January lows. Further adjustments

likely will need to be made later in the intereeting period as seasonal

borrowing continues to rise. Under alternative B, adjustment credit may

average only $75 million, not far above the frictional amount, as the

reluctance of depositories to tap the window for such credit is rein-

forced by questions about the general health of the banking industry that

are raised by developments in the real estate and LBO lending areas and by

the problems of the Bank of New England. The Desk would be expected to

continue to exercise flexibility in its approach to the borrowing assump-

tion.

(21) The anticipated paths for the monetary aggregates from

December to March for the three alternatives are shown in the table

growth from December to March appears weaker than at the time of the last

FOMC meeting. The easing at that meeting has not shown through in Trea-

sury bill rates as it has in private short-term rates, limiting declines

in average opportunity costs on M2 balances. In addition, nominal income

has been revised down, and the shortfall in demand deposits is showing

through into the broader aggregates. The staff now foresees the level of

M2 in March in the vicinity of, rather than noticeably above, the 7 per-

cent upper bound of its tentative annual growth rate range under all the

alternatives. Based on the experience in December and January, the out-

look is for less buoyant bank credit and larger declines in thrift managed

liabilities than foreseen at the last FOMC meeting. As a result, M3 by

March is predicted to be around the 3-1/2 percent lower bound of its ten-

tative range under the alternatives, rather than around the midpoint.

This projection assumes that the RTC will be relatively inactive until

11. The base for the short-term range has been shifted from November to
December, since data for the latter month are now firm.

very late in the quarter and that capital-impaired thrifts continue to

scale down their assets at the trend seen over the second half of last

year.

(22) Under alternative B, the continuation of the federal funds

rate around 8-1/4 percent would accord with current market expectations

for the near term. At some point, the narrow spreads between Treasury

bills and private paper will widen, but any tendency for this to occur as

runoffs of official accounts abate will be offset to a degree by large

bill issuance through the end of March and by the continued potential of a

further increase to finance RTC working capital. Treasury bond yields may

edge down once the mid-quarter refunding issues are distributed, espe-

cially if foreign interest appears to be holding up. However, without a

surprise in macroeconomic fundamentals or monetary policy, only limited

scope for a flattening of the Treasury yield curve seems in prospect.

Increases in bond yields since the last FOMC meeting have restored the

more typical upward-sloping term structure, apparently on the basis of

expectations that federal funds trading not far from current levels will

be consistent with continued economic expansion and underlying inflation

persisting at its recent pace.

(23) Growth in M2 under alternative B is expected to strengthen

in February and March from its January pace, owing largely to a rebound in

transaction deposits. Demand deposits in particular should recover ap-

preciably after their sharp January slide considering the presumed in-

crease in desired holdings in response to the fall in short-term interest



-22-

rates over the second half of last year. M1 expansion would be brought

up to a 6-3/4 percent pace over February and March. Together with a

slight pickup in its nontransaction component, M2 is projected to grow at

a 7-3/4 percent rate over the two months, and 7 percent from a December

base. M2 would continue to outpace nominal GNP in the first quarter,

implying a contraction of its velocity at a 1-1/2 percent rate.

(24) Under alternative B, M3 would grow at a 3-1/2 percent rate

from December to March. Thrift assets continue to run off rapidly. Bank

credit expansion, though picking up a little, is expected to remain moder-

ate, and bank issuance of managed liabilities to continue subdued in the

face of stronger core deposit growth. Inflows to institution-only money

market mutual funds should pause after the bulge in January, as their

yields move down into more normal alignment with market rates. Overall

debt of domestic nonfinancial sectors is expected to grow at an 8 percent

rate from December to March, placing this aggregate a bit below the mid-

point of its 6-1/2 to 10-1/2 percent tentative monitoring range. In the

federal sector, borrowing quickens over the balance of the quarter, while

the average growth of the overall debt of the other sectors should about

maintain the estimated January pace.

(25) The policy easing embodied in alternative A, with the funds

rate moving to 7-3/4 percent, would induce a nearly comparable decline in

other short-term interest rates. The lowering of U.S. short-term rates

12. Currency growth should work as a partial offset, retreating from
its rapid January pace. Despite the acceleration in total reserves in
line with that of transaction deposits, the monetary base is projected
to slip to around an 8 percent average rate of growth in February and
March.



-23-

would cause a sharp downward adjustment in the foreign exchange value of

the dollar. Nonetheless, some declines in bond rates are probable, as

investors scale down their forecasts of the intermediate-term path of

short rates. But the declines would be muted to the extent that the

policy easing and accompanying dollar depreciation were to intensify con-

cerns about future inflation pressures and the scope for further policy

easing. M2 demands would be boosted, to perhaps an 8-1/2 percent average

rate of growth over February and March, bringing December-to-March growth

to 7-1/2 percent and leaving M2 a bit above the 7 percent upper end of its

tentative range. M3 would rise at a 4 percent rate over the two months,

rapidly enough to engender a December-to-March growth rate of 3-3/4 per-

cent and place this aggregate a little above its 3-1/2 percent tentative

lower bound.

(26) By contrast, the 1/2 percentage point increase in the funds

rate under alternative C would restrain December-to-March growth of M2 and

M3 to 6-1/2 and 3-1/4 percent, respectively, positioning them just below

the upper bound and at the lower bound of their respective tentative

ranges by March. Most short-term rates would rise in tandem with the

federal funds rate; some widening of risk premiums could occur if reces-

sionary concerns reemerged, given already heightened attention to credit

problems. Such concerns, along with a sense that policy might be more

focused on achieving price stability, would tend to damp the rise in bond

yields. Higher interest rates and lower expected inflation could prompt

an upward movement in the exchange value of the dollar.

Directive language

(27) Presented below for Committee consideration is draft lan-

guage relating to the Humphrey-Hawkins ranges for 1990 and to the operat-

ing paragraph for the intermeeting period.

1990 RANGES

The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and

financial conditions that will foster price stability,

promote growth in output on a sustainable basis, and con-

tribute to an improved pattern of international transactions.

In furtherance of these objectives, the Committee at THIS [DEL: its]

meeting [DEL: in July reaffirmed the ranges it had] established

RANGES in February for growth of M2 and M3 of ____ TO ____ [DEL: 3

to 7] percent and ____ TO ____ [DEL: 3-1/2 to 7-1/2] percent, respec-

tively, measured from the fourth quarter of 1989 [DEL: 1988] to the

fourth quarter of 1990 [DEL: 1989]. The monitoring range for growth

of total domestic nonfinancial debt also was SET [DEL: maintained]

at ____ TO ____ [DEL: 6-1/2 to 10-1/2] percent for the year. [DEL: For 1999,

on a tentative basis, the Committee agreed in July to use the

same ranges as in 1989 for growth in each of the monetary

aggregate and debt, measured from the fourth quarter of 1989

to the fourth quarter of 1999.] The behavior of the monetary

aggregates will continue to be evaluated in the light of

movements in their velocities, developments in the economy

and financial markets, and progress toward price level

stability.



-25-

OPERATIONAL PARAGRAPH

In the implementation of policy for the immediate

future, the Committee seeks to decrease slightly (SOMEWHAT)/

MAINTAIN/INCREASE SLIGHTLY(SOMEWHAT) the existing degree of

pressure on reserve positions. Taking account of progress

toward price stability, the strength of the business expan-

sion, the behavior of the monetary aggregates, and develop-

ments in foreign exchange and domestic financial markets,

slightly (SOMEWHAT) greater reserve restraint (WOULD)(MIGHT)

or slightly (SOMEWHAT) lesser reserve restraint would (MIGHT)

be acceptable in the intermeeting period. The contemplated

reserve conditions are expected to be consistent with growth

of M2 and M3 over the period from [DEL: November] DECEMBER through

March at annual rates of about ____ AND ____ [DEL: 8-1/2 and 5-1/2]

percent respectively. The Chairman may call for Committee

consultation if it appears to the Manager for Domestic

Operations that reserve conditions during the period before

the next meeting are likely to be associated with a federal

funds rate persistently outside a range of ____ TO ____ [DEL: 6 to 10]

percent.



APPENDIX A

MONEY STOCK REVISIONS

Measures of the money stock have been revised to incorporate a
change in the definition of M2, as well as the results of the annual
benchmark and seasonal factor review. The attached tables compare
growth rates of the old and revised series. These data should be
regarded as strictly confidential until their release scheduled for
February 15.

Redefinition

Overnight repurchase agreements issued by thrift institutions,
formerly counted with term repurchase agreements in the non-M2 component
of M3, have been included in M2 instead. (Overnight repurchase
agreements issued by commercial banks have been included in M2
since 1980.) This redefinition has no effect on the levels of M1 or M3,
but it does raise the level of M2 by the amount of thrifts' overnight
repurchase agreements--between $2 billion and $4-1/2 billion in 1989,
for example. Because the amount of overnight repurchase agreements
issued by thrift institutions declined in 1989, the redefinition
accounts for a reduction in the growth of M2 over 1989 of 0.1 percent.

Benchmark Revisions

Deposits of commercial banks and thrift institutions have been
benchmarked using call reports through June 1989 and other sources. The
benchmark revisions had minor effects on monetary growth rates over 1989
and on the quarterly pattern of growth within the year.

Seasonal Factor Revisions

The seasonal factor review continued to employ the X-11 ARIMA
procedure. Beginning with this review, separate seasonal factors were
computed for OCDs at commercial banks and thrift institutions
(previously OCDs were seasonally adjusted as a whole). In addition,
for the first time, seasonal factors were computed for MMDAs at
comercial banks and at thrift institutions, and for general purpose and
broker/dealer money market mutual funds (a component of M2) and
institution only money market mutual funds (a component of M3). These
new procedures had a minimal effect on M1 seasonal factors, and no
effect at all on seasonally adjusted M2 or M3 as these broader
aggregates are constructed using separate seasonal factors for the non-
M1 component of M2 and for the non-M2 component of M3.

Overall, revisions to seasonal factors had little effect on the
broad pattern of growth during 1989, though some growth was
redistributed from the second half to the first half of the year. For
example, on a second quarter to fourth quarter basis, the revised
seasonal factors reduce M1 growth by 0.7 percent, M2 growth by 0.5
percent, and M3 growth by 0.5 percent.

nonfinancial sector debt.
2. At the February 1979 meeting the POMC adopted a QIV'78 to QIV'79 range for M1 of 1-1/2
to 4-1/2 percent. This range anticipated that shifting to ATS and NOW accounts in New
York State would slow Ml growth by 3 percentage points. At the October meeting it was
noted that ATS/NOW shifts would reduce M1 by no more than 1-1/2 percentage points. Thus,
the longer-run range for Ml was modified to 3-6 percent.
3. The figures shown reflect target and actual growth of M1-B in 1980 and shift-adjusted
M1-B in 1981. Mi-B was relabeled ML in Janauary 1982. The targeted growth for MI-A was
3-1/2 to 6 percent in 1980 (actual growth was 5.0 percent); in 1981 targeted growth for
shift-adjusted Ml-A was 3 to 5-1/2 percent (actual growth was 1.3 percent).
4. When these ranges were set, shifts into other checkable deposits in 1980 were expected
to have only a limited effect on growth of MI-A and MI-B. As the year progressed,
however, banks offered other checkable deposits more actively, and more funds than
expected were directed to these accounts. Such shifts are estimated to have decreased M1-
A growth and increased M1-B growth each by at least 1/2 percentage point more than had
been anticipated.

5. Adjusted for the effects of shifts out of demand deposits and savings deposits into
other checkable deposits. At the February FOMC meeting, the target ranges for
observed M1-A and M1-B in 1981 on an unadjusted basis, expected to be consistent with
the adjusted ranges, were -4-1/2 to -2 and 6 to 8-1/2 percent, respectively. Actual
M1-B growth (not shift adjusted) was 5.0 percent.
6. Adjusted for shifts of assets from domestic banking offices to International
Banking Facilities.
7. Range for bank credit is annualized growth from the December 1981-January 1982
average level through the fourth quarter of 1982.
8. Base period, adopted at the July 1983 FOMC meeting, is QII'83. At the February
1983 meeting, the FOMC had adopted a QIV'82 to QIV'83 target range for M1 of 4 to 8
percent.
9. Base period is the February-March 1983 average.
10. Base period, adopted at the July 1985 FOMC meeting, is QII'85. At the February
1985 meeting the FOMC had adopted a QIV'84 to QIV'85 target range for M1 of 4 to 7
percent.
11. No range for M1 was specified at the February FOMC meeting because of
uncertainties about its underlying relationship to the behavior of the economy and its
sensitivity to economic and financial circumstances.
