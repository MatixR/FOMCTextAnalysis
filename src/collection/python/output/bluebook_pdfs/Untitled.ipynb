Output appeared poised to continue growing at a \\ngood pace before the tragic toll of Hurricane \\nKatrina. The widespread \\ndevastation in the Gulf \\nregion, the associated dislocation of economic \\nactivity, and the boost to energy prices imply that \\n\\nspending, production, and employment will be set \\nback in the near term. In addition to elevating \\npremiums for some energy products, the disruption \\n\\nto the production and refining infrastructure may \\n\\nadd to energy price volatility.   \\nWhile these unfortunate developments have \\nincreased uncertainty about near-term economic \\n\\nperformance, it is the Committee's view that they \\n\\ndo not pose a more pers\\nistent threat. Rather, \\nmonetary policy accommodation, coupled with \\n\\nrobust underlying growth in productivity, is \\n\\nproviding ongoing support to economic activity. \\n Elevated energy prices and \\nhurricane-related disruptions in \\neconomic activity seem to have \\nslowed the growth of spending, set \\nback employment, and weakened \\nconsumer and business confidence.  \\nThe persistence of such effects is \\nuncertain, but robust underlying \\ngrowth of productivity and \\nmonetary policy accommodation are \\nproviding support to economic \\nactivity.   Elevated energy prices and \\n\\nhurricane-related disruptions in \\neconomic activity seem to have \\ntemporarily slowed the growth of \\nspending and set back employment.  \\nHowever, monetary policy \\naccommodation, coupled with \\nrobust underlying growth in \\nproductivity, is providing ongoing \\nsupport to economic activity.  \\nSpending will also be boosted by \\nrebuilding efforts in hurricane-\\naffected areas. \\nThe disruptive effects of recent \\nhurricanes seem likely to be \\ntemporary, especially in light of \\nincreased spending associated with \\nrebuilding efforts.  Economic \\ngrowth continues to be supported \\nby robust underlying growth in \\nproductivity. Rationale 3. Higher energy and other costs have the \\npotential to add to inflation pressures.   \\nHowever, core inflation has been relatively \\nlow in recent months\\n, and longer-term \\ninflation expectations remain contained.\\n High energy and other costs have \\nadded to inflation pressures.  \\n\\nHowever, core inflation has been \\n\\nrelatively low in recent months, and \\nlonger-term inflation expectations \\nremain contained.
