0,1999-12-21,1999-12-22,Financial Times,Y2K concerns hold down rates.,"The US Federal Reserve put its determination to ensure a smooth financial transition into the New Year ahead of concerns about the rapid pace of domestic economic growth and left interest rates unchanged yesterday. The central bank's policy-making federal open market committee (FOMC) left its key short-term interest rate, the fed funds target rate, at 5.5 per cent at its last meeting of the year. And, to underline its eagerness to prevent financial problems from the computer date changeover to the next century, the committee also said it was leaving its policy ""bias"", which indicates what the next move in rates might be, unchanged, at neutral. But the Fed hinted that this position was only temporary and indicated that, after the Y2K computer bug hurdle, concerns about the frenetic pace of domestic growth would dominate. ""Based on the available evidence the Committee remains concerned with the possibility that increases in demand will continue to exceed the growth in potential supply, even after taking account of the remarkable rise in productivity growth. Such trends could foster inflationary imbalances that would undermine the economy's exemplary performance,"" it said. Most economists believe the Fed would probably have raised rates at its meeting yesterday were it not for lingering fears of financial disruption from the century date change. The Fed is committed to maintaining plentiful liquidity in case of funds shortages over the New Year period and an interest rate increase might have complicated that task. The central bank had been expected to signal a bias towards tightening at yesterday's meeting but policymakers were concerned that the possibility of a Y2K disruption, however small, required the central bank to adopt a more cautious approach. An increase still seems highly likely after the next FOMC meeting on February 2. Money market rates indicate investors are betting on at least a 0.5 percentage point increase in short-term rates over the first half of the year. There are scant signs of inflation in the US economy. In the year to November, core consumer prices rose by a meagre 2.1 per cent, a rate virtually unchanged over the last year. But Fed officials have expressed mounting concern in recent weeks that the rapid pace of US expansion in the last six months is not sustainable and will eventually produce an acceleration in wages and prices. In the three months to September, gross domestic product expanded at an annual rate of 5.5 per cent. That pace has slowed a little in the final quarter of the year, but most private sector economic forecasts put the rate of growth at still above 4 per cent. Domestic demand growth is rattling along at an even faster pace - last month, for example, retail sales grew by 0.9 per cent from a month earlier. Even some formerly sceptical Fed officials acknowledge growing evidence that technological and structural changes have raised the economy's long-term potential rate of growth. But policymakers consider the pace too fast for inflationary comfort. The Fed has raised rates three times this year by a combined 0.75 percentage points. Copyright Financial Times Limited 1999.

1,1999-12-21,1999-12-22,Financial Times,Fed puts interest rates on hold.,"The US Federal Reserve put its determination to ensure a smooth financial transition into the New Year ahead of concerns about the rapid pace of domestic economic growth when it left interest rates unchanged yesterday.

""Based on the available evidence, however, the Committee remains concerned with the possibility that over time increases in demand will continue to exceed the growth in potential supply, even after taking account of the remarkable rise in productivity growth.

2,1999-12-21,1999-12-22,Financial Times,INTERNATIONAL CAPITAL MARKETS - Treasuries modestly higher.,"US Treasuries posted only modest gains yesterday after the Federal Reserve's Open Market Committee left interest rates unchanged in its last meeting of the year, and announced that it had no bias for future tightening of monetary policy. The meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee did not make a statement until after European and Asian markets closed, causing Monday's dearth of trading activity to continue. With interest rates in the US, the UK and continental Europe expected to rise early next year, bond analysts from most institutions are predicting no end to the bear market until the second half of 2000. Investors are likely to avoid shorter-dated bonds where spreads will carry on widening, and instead focus on buying longer maturities. Apart from predictions on the outcome of the FOMC meeting, the market had little data to trade on. The firmer euro helped to support the bond markets, but liquidity did not recover from the low levels of the last week. In Frankfurt, the future on the 10-year German bund settled up 0.53 at 105.15. The future on the 10-year UK gilt rallied during the day but still ended the trading session down 0.1 at 112.70. The Bank of England's Monetary Policy Committee will release its final GDP and balance of payments figures for 1999 at 9.30am today, which could affect the performance of the gilt markets for the rest of the week. In midday trading on Wall Street, the benchmark 30-year US Treasury bond was 5/32 higher at 96, pushing its yield down to 6.428 per cent. Similarly, the 10-year note gained 3/16 to 97 5/8, to yield 6.331 per cent, while the five-year note edged up 5/32 to 98 1/2 to yield 6.233 per cent. Saumil Parikh, analyst at Warburg, Dillon Read, said bond investors' restrained reaction to the news was appropriate. ""It's clear that the Fed is not entering the new year with a neutral bias. They highlighted all the same problems with the economy - namely the build up in supply and inflationary pressures,"" he noted. None of the leading dealers expected the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates at yesterday's meeting, given the proximity of the millennium change-over and the accompanying fears about a lack of liquidity in financial markets. However, many predicted the body would shift to a bias for future tightening of monetary policy to bring a speeding US economy under control. The market has already priced in a 25 basis points increase in the Federal funds rate, which many believe will come at the FOMC's next meeting scheduled for early February. The economic board of Bond Market Association, a securities industries group with a broad Wall Street membership, has predicted two such increases next year that would lift the Fed funds rate to 6.00 per cent. Although headline economic data has yet to reveal any signs of inflation in the economy, those expectations have firmed in recent weeks with new reports that reveal its ongoing strength. Retail sales figures reported for November were almost double analysts' expectations when they were released last Tuesday, touching off a week-long slide in Treasury prices. Yields have since climbed above the 6.40 per cent level that had served as a recent ceiling. The yield on the 30-year benchmark at yesterday's close, 6.440 per cent, was its highest level since October 1997. Meanwhile, Japanese government bonds futures firmed yesterday, with the March JGB up 0.12 to 132.22. Copyright Financial Times Limited 1999. All Rights Reserved. "

4,2001-03-20,2001-03-21,Financial Times (FT.Com),Bolognese rules OK.,"Twenty-four hours is a long time in the life of Romano Prodi. On Tuesday, the president of the European Commission went on Swedish TV and criticised the Swedish presidency of the EU for lacking any ambition. Yesterday he used a Brussels briefing, ahead of this week's EU Stockholm summit, to offer a mea culpa. Far from intending to criticise the Swedish presidency for being unambitious, Prodi pleaded that once again he may not have expressed himself clearly. Having salved his conscience he then outlined a bewildering wish list of what the Commission would like to see happen in Stockholm. Among the items he listed was the Spanish-British impasse over Gibraltar airport, which threatens to bring the Commission's air traffic control programme to a halt. So keen is Prodi to get the issue solved that he's been searching for answers in his Latin version of the 1713 Treaty of Utrecht - which handed Gibraltar over to Britain. Prodi then raised the thorny issue of which languages should be used for some EU bureaucracy. He suggested English, French and German - but joked that if his proposal were rejected he would impose his native Bolognese dialect. In reverse? When Noel Goutard, the veteran chairman of Valeo, named Andre Navarri as his successor in June 1999, he described the former Alsthom executive as ""un garcon superbe"". Less than a year after Navarri replaced Goutard at the helm of the auto components group, he was shown the door on Wednesday. Apparently, the Valeo board was unimpressed by Navarri's long-term strategy for reviving the company. It was more interested in short-term restructuring action and plans to improve shareholder returns. Observer understands that one of those calling for his head was Ernest Antoine Seilliere, chairman of MEDEF, the French employers' association. Seilliere's CGIP investment company is the largest shareholder in Valeo, with 20.6 per cent of the shares, almost 30 per cent of the votes and four representatives on the Valeo board. It's thought that CGIP wanted to see a better return from Valeo. So exit Navarri and re-enter Goutard, who will chair a new supervisory board. Insiders insist Goutard will not be running the company but advising on strategy. For a company that claims to be a leader in clutches and transmissions, this reads a little like engaging reverse gear. Miracle man? Spare a thought for Ricardo Lopez Murphy. The respected economist was called into service to right the troubled Argentine economy but was chewed up and spat out by the voracious Argentine political system in just 15 days. Still, Lopez Murphyshould take heart - hehas lasted longer thanmany others in his position. Joaqun de Las Heras took the post during the military coup in 1976 but survived just six days in office before he was replaced. Jorge Wehbe was appointed to the ill-fated post in 1962, only to find that the president who had chosen him was overthrown by the army. He was 12 days in office. Finally, Lopez Murphy should take comfort in the fact that he left the post with his health intact. Miguel Angel Roig, who was appointed to the economy ministry by the last president, Carlos Menem, died of a heart attack after just seven days in the office. In fact, Argentina's longest-serving economy minister is the one who has just returned: Domingo Cavallo. He served for an unprecedented five years under Carlos Menem and yesterday appeared very much in his element, threatening congressmen and chastising journalists. Close collaborators described his mood as ""euphoric"". Forget about whether he's the best man for the job; it's quite possible that he's the only man. Travel light Pity Kim Woo-choong, the fugitive founder of the bankrupt Daewoo group. The author of the business guide Every Street is Paved with Gold has been reduced to staying in third-class hotels in Europe and surviving on hamburgers. His only possessions are several pairs of underpants, while he depends on the charity of friends for living expenses. That at least is the picture portrayed by Kim's lawyer to rebut suggestions that the businessman is living the high life as Interpol mounts a search to arrest him for an alleged $20bn accountancy fraud - the world's biggest. But the tale of woe, which brought down the Daewoo group in 1999, doesn't end there. Kim, 65, is suffering from suspected stomach cancer and is receiving treatment for hardening of the arteries. ""He's on the run not to avoid punishment but to put order into his life by writing his memoirs,"" says his lawyer. The lawyer adds that Kim may yet return home to clear his name. Cohen's poem The strain of trying to prop up the US stock market has clearly taken its toll on Abby Joseph Cohen, the US strategist and patron saint of the 1990s bull run. She has turned to poetry. Her latest note, ""Alan at the Bat"", is apparently a pastiche of a poem by Ernest L. Thayer, although it reads more like McGonagall than Marlowe.

5,2001-03-20,2001-03-21,Financial Times,THE AMERICAS - US investors thumb their noses at Fed's declaration of independence FED FUNDS RATE CUT TO 5%.,"Has the Federal Reserve declared its independence from the US stock market? One of the interesting sidebars to the drama over whether the US will stumble into a full-blown recession this year has been a cat-and-mouse game under way between the Federal Reserve and US equity markets. Every downward lurch in stock prices this year inflamed expectations of big rate cuts, as the Fed embarked on the biggest, fastest wave of monetary easing in any three-month period since 1982. The Fed's policy-making open market committee voted yesterday to cut short-term interest rates by a widely expected half-point, driving the Fed funds rate to a 20-month low of 5 per cent and almost completely erasing the rate increases that followed the 1997-98 global financial crisis. But many investors clearly hoped for more, thumbed their noses at the decision and went back to their regularly scheduled asset selling. The battered, tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite index erased its gains for the day and sank more than 3 per cent within an hour of the Fed's decision. Other stock indices followed suit. While the Fed, in a statement following the decision, acknowledged faltering investment and spending, subsequent inventory build-ups and excess capacity that could keep production ""soft"" for some time, it shied away from giving investors the ""surprise"" they expected. A re-reading of Alan Greenspan's repeated and vehement denials of any direct connection between stock prices and monetary policymaking might have tempered such expectations. The period September to November 1998 was the last time the Fed aggressively slashed interest rates. Equity prices were plunging at the time. But Mr Greenspan later explained that the Fed acted in its widely accepted role as lender of last resort to pre-empt a panic and a ""seizing up"" of debt markets following Russia's debt default and a feared implosion of the Long-Term Capital Management hedge fund. In testimony to congressional lawmakers in December 1998, the Fed chairman acknowledged that ""equity prices can play an important role in the economy, which the central bank must take into account"", but he insisted that the Fed was not attempting ""to prop up equity prices, nor did we plan to continue to ease rates until equity prices recovered, as some have erroneously inferred. This has not been, and is not now, our policy or intent."" With a liquidity crisis much less apparent now than in 1998, the Fed faced the possibility of reviving faith in a ""Greenspan put"", if only by default. It appeared mindful of that, said David Jones, an economist with Aubrey G. Lanston in New York. ""The Fed basically signalled that it's going to key its future rate cuts to the economy, not to the stock market,"" he said. ""The only way the market can influence the Fed is indirectly, through what it does to spending, and spending has held up better than expected."" While economic conditions in the US have deteriorated, the unemployment rate has held remarkably steady and retail sales have not collapsed. It is even possible that the US economy has recovered and more rate cuts could exacerbate any imbalances in the economy. ""There's an ambiguity in the data that precludes (the Fed) from being more aggressive at this time,"" said John Lipsky, the chief economist at JP Morgan Chase. But the Fed statement used wording that presaged surprise inter-meeting cuts in the past. It said it would ""monitor developments closely"" and reaffirmed its view that risks remained tilted toward more ""economic weakness in the foreseeable future"". Financial markets appeared to take that promise seriously. After the statement's release, futures prices quickly registered expectations for the Fed funds rate to drop as much as 75 basis points to 4.25 per cent by mid-year. Full statement from the FOMC The following is the full text of the Federal Open Market Committee statement. ""The committee at its meeting today decided to lower its target for the federal funds rate by 50 basis points to 5 per cent. In a related action the board of governors approved a 50 basis point reduction in the discount rate to 4 1/2 per cent. ""Persistent pressures on profit margins are restraining investment spending and, through declines in equity wealth, consumption. The associated backup in inventories has induced a rapid response in manufacturing output and, with spending having firmed a bit since last year, inventory adjustment appears well under way. ""Although current developments do not appear to have materially diminished the prospects for long-term growth in productivity, excess productive capacity has emerged recently. The possibility that this excess could continue for some time and the potential for weakness in global economic conditions suggest substantial risks that demand and production could remain soft. ""In these circumstances, when the economic situation could be evolving rapidly, the Fed will need to monitor developments closely. ""The committee continues to believe, against the background of its long-run goals of price stability and sustainable economic growth and of the information currently available, the risks are weighted mainly toward conditions that may generate economic weakness in the foreseeable future. In taking the discount rate action, the Fed approved requests submitted by the boards of directors of all 12 reserve banks."" "
6,2001-03-20,2001-03-21,Financial Times,CURRENCIES &MONEY - Dollar up as Fed cuts rates by 50bp.,"The dollar initially spiked higher after the decision of the Federal Reserve to cut rates by 50 basis points, as equity markets gave a warm response to the move. ""The key to the rise in the dollar has been the good performance of equity markets,"" said Ray Attrill, director of research at economic consultancy 4Cast. The US currency had been trading around half a cent lower against the euro ahead of the decison. Many said that the impact of the shift in monetary policy on the dollar would only become clear over the next few trading sessions. The reaction of the equity markets is thought to be key. Until last week the dollar was thought to be vulnerable to falling equity markets. With share ownership higher in the US than Europe or Japan, sliding stocks are expected to take a bigger bite out of US consumer spending and therefore economic growth. But at the end of last week the dollar was seen to benefit from safe-haven flows into the bond market as investors fled falling stock markets. Trading ahead of the FOMC decision was subdued. With Japanese traders on holiday, trading in the yen was especially thin. The yen settled into a narrow range after the volatility following Monday's monetary easing by the Bank of Japan. By the end of London trading the dollar stood at Y122.6, compared to Y122.2. * Argentina provided an element of drama to an otherwise subdued pre-Fed markets yesterday, with the resignation of the economics minister again unsettling the markets. The departure of Ricardo Lopez-Murphy, following his failure to secure agreement on a $4.45bn two-year cost cutting plan, caused some to worry over the long-term viability of Argentina's currency board. The peg with the dollar has been been inflicting ever greater pain on the Argentine economy. ""Argentina has been suffering from a classic gold standard problem,"" said Peter von Maydell, senior currency economist at Credit Suisse First Boston. Earlier in the week the dollar, and hence the Argentine peso, hit a record high against the Brazilian real. This has undermined the competitiveness of the Argentine economy - which conducts around 30 per cent of its trade with Brazil - and sent unemployment to 14.5 per cent. Aside from devaluation, deflation has been the only way to regain competitiveness. But so far the situation in Argentina has failed to spill over into other emerging markets. This is partly because most expect the currency peg to survive. The appointment of Domingo Cavallo as finance minister did something to ease nervousness. Mr Cavallo, who introduced the fixed exchange system in 1991, is thought by many to be more likely to secure political approval for budget cuts than his predecessor. Implied one-month yields in the non-deliverable forwards market - seen as a gauge of the prospect of a peso devaluation - have fallen steeply since Friday. ""Things have calmed down but Argentina is still in some kind of crisis mode,"" said David Lubin, emerging markets economist at HSBC in London. But he added that convertibility was a tough nut to crack. ""It would be possible to see the currency board surviving even a debt default."" Mr von Maydell said that Argentina's economic problems had not yet become unsustainable. ""Although unemployment is rising, it is still some distance from the 18.4 per cent it touched back in May 1995,"" he said. * Atriax, the foreign exchange internet portal, has said it plans to expand into bond and derivative markets. Dan Morehead, the chief executive of Atriax, said clients would prefer an internet platform which would allow them to trade a range of assets. The portal, which plans to go live between April and June, was formed last October by Deutsche Bank, Chase, Citibank and Reuters. "
7,2005-03-22,2005-03-23,Financial Times,Investors focus on inflation comments.,"GLOBAL OVERVIEW By Dave Shellock The US Federal Reserve gave global financial markets exact ly what they wanted yesterday, raising the Fed funds rate by 25 basis points to 2.75 per cent and, more crucially, retaining its vow to keep its ""measured"" approach. The central bank also referred to more robust growth while hinting at greater concern about inflation risks. ""These discreet changes by the FOMC reflect the Fed's increasing concern over disrupting the liquidity of the US economy by pressing too hard on the brakes - at a time when the US engine risks facing obstacles from rising oil and from spillover effect from a GM downgrade,"" said Laidi Ashraf, chief currency analyst at MG Financial in New York. The rate rise - the seventh consecutive tightening - was widely expected and had been factored into share prices. Investors took the view that the wording of the accompanying statement implied a continuation of the Fed's modest quarter-point rate increases. However, Wall Street wobbled in the immediate aftermath of the announcement. The Dow Jones Industrial Average, up 0.4 per cent shortly before the news, fell briefly into negative territory before recovering to stand 0.1 per cent higher at 10,578. The S&P 500 was 0.2 per cent higher while the technology-heavy Nasdaq was up 0.3 per cent. European stock markets - which closed before the Fed delivered its statement - made modest progress, with the FTSE Eurofirst 300 index rising 0.2 per cent to 1,081.66. Asian stock markets had a generally negative day, with Tokyo's Nikkei 225 Average slipping 0.3 per cent and Hong Kong 0.4 per cent. The dollar moved to its best level of the day following the Fed's announcement. Earlier, its recent rally had stalled in spite of strongerthan- expected US inflation data. US consumer price data for February are due for release today. Treasury bond yields spiked to their best levels in eight months immediately after the announcement. US oil futures fell sharply as the market pondered the possibility of further quota increases by the Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries. Elsewhere in commodities, the price of gold managed to stay above key support at the Dollars 430-an-ounce mark as the dollar's recent rally slowed. On Monday, gold fell to its lowest level for two weeks, triggering demand for the metal from jewellers. "

9,2005-03-22,2005-03-23,Financial Times,Fed increases interest rates.,"* Inflation fears prompt rise to 2.75 per cent * Further quarter-point moves expected * 10-year Treasury yield hits 8-month high The US Federal Reserve yesterday signalled increased concern about inflation, as it again raised interest rates by a quarter point to 2.75 per cent. The rise was widely expected, and the policymaking Federal Open Market Committee repeated in its statement that it expected to continue raising rates at a ""measured"" pace, generally interpreted to mean quarter point increases. But the central bank held out the possibility that it might have to move more aggressively to curb inflationary pressures, or at least to continue with quarter-point increases for longer than investors had been expecting. ""Though longer-term inflation expectations remain well contained, pressures on inflation have picked up in recent months and pricing power is more evident,"" the statement said. The FOMC said it saw the risks to growth and inflation as roughly equal. But, in contrast to its statement in January, it made clear that this judgment was based on ""appropriate monetary policy action"". The Fed also said output was expanding at a ""solid"" pace, a more upbeat assessment than its previous view of ""moderate"" growth, despite rising energy prices. Peter Hooper, chief US economist at Deutsche Bank, said: ""They got about as hawkish as they could without changing the key policy language. They are inclined to continue with 25 basis point increases, but wanted to reassure the market they would do more if necessary."" Bonds and stocks sold off on the announcement, with the yield on the 10- year Treasury note rising above 4.6 per cent, an eight-month high. The dollar strengthened against the euro and yen. Yesterday's rise was the seventh consecutive quarter-point move since the Fed started tightening policy in June. Each time, the Fed said it expected to continue raising rates ""at a pace that is likely to be measured"". Some Fed policymakers say the forward-looking guidance should be dropped altogether because it constrains their room for manoeuvre. While some regional Fed presidents have become increasingly concerned about inflation risks, others fear structural drags on growth from the trade deficit and the low savings rate might dampen the economy. Yesterday's statement made it clear that a shift to 50 basis point increases was more likely at this stage than a pause in tightening. The FOMC also repeated that after yesterday's move, the stance of monetary policy remained ""accommodative"". The so-called neutral or equilibrium federal funds rate - where monetary policy neither stimulates nor restricts the economy and is consistent with price stability - is typically described by policymakers in a range centred about 4 1/4 per cent over time. Data released since the February meeting have confirmed the Fed's bank consensus forecast of robust, above-trend growth this year. As confidence in the economy's strength has increased, Fed policymakers have turned their attention to inflation risks. While policymakers are confident continued rate increases will prevent inflation rising, at a time when strong growth is using up spare capacity and labour market slack there is greater sensitivity to inflation risks. The core producer price index, excluding food and energy, rose by 0.1 per cent last month, data out yesterday showed. It was below January's 0.8 per cent rise, but in the year to February, the core PPI was up by 2.7 per cent. Lex, Page 16 Short view, Page 17 World Stocks, Page 28 "

It was below January's 0.8 per cent rise, but in the year to February, the core PPI was up by 2.7 per cent. World Stocks, Page 44 "
11,2005-03-22,2005-03-23,Financial Times,Fed raises rates and signals inflation concerns.,"The US Federal Reserve yesterday raised interest rates by a quarter point to 2.75 per cent and signalled increased concern about inflation pressures. In its statement, the policymaking Federal Open Market Committee repeated that it expected to continue raising rates at a ""measured"" pace. It was the seventh consecutive quarter point rise since the Fed started tightening policy in June. Yesterday, however, the committee said: ""Though longer-term inflation expectations remain well contained, pressures on inflation have picked up in recent months and pricing power is more evident."" While it saw the risks to growth and inflation as roughly equal, the FOMC made it clear that this judgment was based on ""appropriate monetary policy action"". The Fed also said that output was expanding at a ""solid"" pace, a more upbeat assessment than its previous view that growth was expanding at a ""moderate"" pace, in spite of the rise in energy prices. Peter Hooper, chief US economist at Deutsche Bank, said: ""They got about as hawkish as they could without changing the key policy language. They are inclined to continue with 25 basis point increases, but wanted to reassure the market they would do more if necessary."" Bonds and stocks sold off after the rise, with the yield on the 10-year Treasury note reaching 4.6 per cent, an eight-month high. Even after yesterday's rate increase, policy remained ""accommodative"", the Fed said. The so-called neutral or equilibrium federal funds rate - where monetary policy neither stimulates nor restricts the economy and is consistent with price stability - is typically seen by policymakers in a range centred about a 4 1/4 per cent average over time. Data released since February's meeting have confirmed the Fed's forecast of robust above trend growth this year. However, there is increased sensitivity to mounting inflation pressures, shown in the producer price index and also in some measures of consumer inflation, at a time when strong growth leaves less slack in the economy. The core producer price index, excluding food and energy, rose only 0.1 per cent after January's 0.8 per cent rise, it was announced yesterday. In the 12 months to February, the core PPI was up by 2.7 per cent. Peter Kretzmer, economist at Bank of America, pointed to a ""continued upward tilt"" in core producer price inflation. ""For the Fed, the report gave little reason to further ratchet upward inflation concerns but also did little to reduce concerns that are already present,"" he said. The Fed, in its Beige Book released before the meeting, had noted reports of increased pricing power from manufacturers, though this was not yet showing up in retail prices.

12,2005-03-22,2005-03-23,Financial Times (FT.Com),FT.com site : Dollar rallies after Fed statement.,"The dollar rallied to a one-month high against the euro in European morning trade on Wednesday as the Federal Reserve made hawkish noises about monetary tightening and a key measure of the state of the German economy disappointed. As expected, the Federal Open Market Committee raised the Federal funds rate by 25 basis points to 2.75 per cent overnight, and reiterated its view that policy accommodation can be removed at a ""measured"" pace. But the FOMC warned that ""pressures on inflation have picked up in recent months and pricing power is more evident"", and said output was expanding at a ""solid"" pace, a more upbeat assessment than its previous view of ""moderate"" growth. The comments led to renewed speculation that the Fed, which has raised rates by 25 basis points at each of its last seven meetings, may decide to slip in a 50-point hike at some point - boosting yield support for the dollar by pushing Treasury yields higher, and potentially making dollar-funded carry trades more expensive. ""Although the measured reference was left intact, the Fed's increased inflationary vigilance coupled with a discreet upgrade in its growth assessment promise the cusp of further interest rate hikes along with the possibility of faster rate hikes,"" said Ashraf Laidi chief currency analyst at MG Financial. Monica Fan, global head of forex strategy at RBC Capital Markets, said the tightening cycle could now extend beyond January, with rates potentially exceeding RBC's forecast of 4 per cent by the year-end, although an acceleration in inflation would be needed to produce a 50-point rate hike. ""The risk to our year-end Fed fund forecast of 3.75 per cent is now clearly to the upside,"" added James Knightley, economist at ING Financial Markets. This sentiment allowed the dollar to strengthen to $1.3037 to the euro, 1.6c better than before the Fed statement, Y105.68 against the yen, Y0.6 better, $1.8794 against sterling, 1.85c better, and $0.7768 versus the Australian dollar, 1.4c better. The New Zealand dollar was particularly badly hit, falling 1.4c to $0.7255 as New Zealand's current account deficit widened to NZ$3.1bn in the fourth quarter, against expectations for NZ$2.4bn. The deficit equalled 6.4 per cent of GDP in 2004 as a whole. The euro's cause was not helped by the Ifo index of German business sentiment, which fell to 94 in March, from 95.4 in February, with the retail and manufacturing sectors both gloomier. The euro drifted Y0.3 to Y137.75 against the yen, although it held firm at GBP0.6933 against sterling. The pound was little affected by the release of the March monetary policy committee minutes, which showed the MPC voted by a 7-2 majority to keep interest rate on hold at 4.75 per cent. Despite the vote being narrower than of late, the consensus was that the minutes were broadly dovish. ""The minutes noted that for most members, the evidence on the two pivotal issues of consumer demand and inflation had not changed substantially since the February meeting. On balance, and given the slightly softer run of the data since this meeting, it is not clear that the next move from the MPC will necessarily be up, even if this is the direction that some committee members have been moving,"" said Rob Carnell, economist at ING Financial Markets. ""To judge by the largely dovish tone of these minutes, the doves are going to take considerable convincing if they are to flip and vote for a hike. 'Wait and see' remains the order of the day. Thus, the market will have to revisit their expectations for a hike, and the current sell-off in sterling has further to run,"" added Daragh Maher, senior forex strategist at Calyon. "
13,2005-03-22,2005-03-23,Financial Times (FT.Com),FT.com site : Fed shows first signs of becoming less friendly.,"The Federal Reserve on Tuesday left the key policy language unchanged in its statement accompanying the latest quarter point increase in interest rates. But the policymaking Federal Open Market Committee sent the signal that it was alive to growing inflation risks and would act, as needed, to prevent accelerating inflation. ""This may be the beginning of the less friendly Federal Reserve,"" said Ethan Harris, chief US economist at Lehman Brothers. Speculation before the meeting had centred on whether the Fed would drop its forward-looking guidance that it expects to continue raising rates at a ""measured"" pace. Instead the committee maintained that assurance, generally seen as pointing to quarter point increases, while changing the rest of the statement, including more upbeat language on growth. The statement, which spoke of a pick-up in inflation pressures in recent months and more evident pricing power, echoed the Fed's recent Beige Book report that manufacturers were finding it easier to pass on higher commodity prices. While accelerating inflation is not an immediate danger, commodity price increases continue to feed into higher producer prices, compounded by pressure from a weaker dollar. The high oil price is seen as an inflation risk, in contrast to last year's concerns that it would sap growth. Modest increases in unit labour costs are not a reason to worry but the prospect that wages may pick up over the next year is a cause for vigilance. The wild-card is productivity growth, which is helping to keep a lid on inflation but may not continue to do so. While the Fed on Tuesday stuck with its judgment that the risks to the inflation and growth outlook remained balanced, it placed a new stress on the fact that this depended on ""appropriate monetary action"". For now the appropriate response is seen as continuing quarter point rises. The committee may have maintained the ""measured"" language so as not to signal a 50 basis point increase when it meets next in May. But it can be seen as a warning to investors to expect a longer tightening cycle. Some committee members have also expressed concerns about structural drags on growth, though Tuesday's statement confirmed that those worries have diminished. At some point, attention may also turn from removing what is seen as unnecessary policy ""accommodation"" from a still low 2.75 per cent federal funds rate to seeking to dampen growth at a time when spare capacity and labour market slack is being used up. ""If you are going to worry at all about inflation then you have to start restraining growth,"" Mr Harris said. When Alan Greenspan, Fed chairman, gave testimony on behalf of the committee last month, he expressed surprise that the yield on the 10-year Treasury bond was only 4 per cent, in spite of the Fed rate increases since last June. Since then the 10-year yield has risen to 4.5 per cent still low based on past experience, economists say. Tuesday's signal of a less friendly Fed was enough to push it above 4.6 per cent. "
14,2006-06-29,2006-06-30,Financial Times,Markets rally after statement from Fed *Nuanced announcement accompanies rate rise.,"The Federal Reserve fuelled a rally in the markets yesterday after it issued an unexpectedly nuanced statement to accompany the 17th successive rise in interest rates to 5.25 per cent. While the Fed hardened its previous language on inflation, and signalled a bias to tighten further in the future, it fell short of suggesting a cast iron commitment to raise rates again at the next policy meeting on August 8. The S&P 500 index, which was already up 0.7 per cent before the Fed issued its statement, jumped nearly 1.5 per cent on the news. Bond prices also rose, while the dollar tumbled more than a cent against the euro as investors reconsidered the interest rate outlook. Futures traders, meanwhile, priced in a reduced probability of an August rate rise - still about 70 per cent, but down from about 90 per cent the day before. Fed officials will probably be happy with that result, as it reduces the risk that they will be boxed in by market expectations as to what their next policy move will be. ""Flexibility seems very important to the Federal Open Market Committee now, suggesting we may be close to the peak in rates,"" said Tony Dolphin, director of economics at Henderson Global Investors. The statement has two main components, a renewed emphasis on inflation and inflation risks, partly offset by a confident assertion that the slowdown in growth, which the Fed desires in order to ease inflation pressure, is taking place. The Fed said ""economic growth is moderating"" - a shift from May, when it said only that growth was ""likely to moderate"". But it toughened up its description of inflation, stating that ""readings on core inflation have been elevated in recent months"" and that high levels of capacity utilisation and energy prices ""have the potential to sustain inflation pressures"". As if to underline that the Fed is paying close attention to inflation, the statement mentioned the word six times, compared with four times in its previous statement. The most significant change came towards the end of the statement, where the Fed junked the phrase ""some further policy firming may yet be needed to address inflation risks"". It replaced this with a new sentence that said: ""Although moderation in the growth of aggregate demand should help to limit inflation pressures overtime, the committee judges that some inflation risks remain."" The Fed said the ""extent and timing of any additional firming that may be needed to address these risks"" would depend on the way current data revises its forecast for ""both inflation and economic growth"". The mention of growth alongside inflation was taken by investors to signal that the Fed would be careful not to overtighten and kill economic growth in response to short term inflation data. The statement appeared to reflect the preference of Ben Bernanke, the chairman, for more natural language, greater emphasis on the forecasts. "
15,2006-06-29,2006-06-30,Financial Times (FT.Com),FT.com site : Dollar extends fall after Fed rate call.,"The dollar continued to fall on Friday, adding to the sharp losses of the previous session prompted by expectations that US interest rates will soon be held in check after two years of steady increases. The Federal Reserve lifted the main refinancing rate by 25 basis points to 5.25 per cent on Thursday, a widely expected move and the 17th consecutive increase. But the central bank was less hawkish on inflation than many in the currencies market had anticipated, sending the dollar, which had stood near a two-month high against the euro, to a three-week low. Inflation remained a concern, the Federal Open Market Committee said, putting more emphasis on moderating growth conditions. ""The dollar will lose its interest-rate support and cyclical growth support here,"" said analysts at BNP Paribas. Standing at $1.2529 ahead of the FOMC statement, the euro spiked 1 per cent against the dollar to $1.2658 within minutes. The euro resumed its rise into Asian trade, and by mid-morning in London was up to $1.2711. The pound got an additional boost from an upward revision to first-quarter UK growth. Year-on-year gross domestic product growth in the quarter was revised modestly up to 2.3 per cent. ""The upward revisions to GDP growth since 2001 will increase the Bank of England's concern about the amount of spare capacity in the UK economy, which was highlighted as one of the main upside risks to inflation in the June Monetary Policy Committee minutes,"" said Howard Archer at Global Insight. He added: ""This increases the odds of an interest rate hike before the end of the year, although the MPC currently seems in no hurry to act and we believe that it will wait until 2007."" Sterling also spiked 1 per cent within minutes of the FOMC announcement and continued its rally against the dollar to $1.8329, up 0.3 per cent on the session. "

The S&P 500 index jumped 1.4 per cent after the announcement to close 2.2 per cent higher as interest rate fears receded. Emerging market stocks soared, with Mexico's IPC index up 4.5 per cent and Brazil's Bovespa up 4.7 per cent. These markets had suffered heavily since May when the prospect of higher US rates rattled investors, some of whom unwound exotic leveraged trades, causing turmoil in local markets. Bond prices also rose, with 10-year yields falling 4 basis points to 5.21 per cent, while the dollar tumbled, losing more than a cent against the euro. Asian bourses leapt on Friday morning led by exporters, on the prospect that a possible end to US rate rises may boost its demand for Asian products. Japan's Nikkei stock average rose 2 per cent in morning trading, led by carmakers such as Nissan, which soared 5.6 per cent. South Korean shares rose 2.35 per cent to four-week high, while India's BSE jumped 3.4 per cent by early morning. The Fed statement was a jolt to market expectations, but did not obviously represent a major shift in thinking inside the Fed.

18,2008-12-16,2008-12-17,Financial Times,Upbeat news about financials bolsters equities,"global overview Goldman's loss not as bad as feared US consumer prices dip largest on record Better news on the banking front offered support to US and European equity markets yesterday although activity was subdued ahead of a Federal Reserve interest rate decision. Goldman Sachs' fourth-quarter loss of $2.1bn was the investment bank's first shortfall since going public in 1999, but was not as bad as some in the markets had feared. Meanwhile, the federal open market committee was widely expected to cut interest rates by at least 50 basis points from 1 per cent. Analysts said the key to the market's response would lie more in comments from the central bank on quantitative easing - a policy where the banking system is flooded with money to promote lending. US economic releases yesterday did little to undermine the view that interest rates were heading further towards zero. US consumer prices tumbled by 1.7 per cent last month - the largest drop since records began in 1947 - taking the annual rate of inflation down to 1.1 per cent, as commodity prices continued to plunge. ""With gasoline prices still falling, there is now a real chance that deflation could be a reality by the end of the year,"" said Paul Ashworth at Capital Economics. ""By the middle of next year inflation could be at minus 2 per cent."" Meanwhile, housing construction collapsed to a record level in November, heightening concerns about the potential depth of the US recession. The figures helped drive US government bond yields to fresh historic lows. The yield on the 30-year bond touched 2.91 per cent, the lowest for five decades, while the 10-year yield briefly fell to 2.47 per cent. A narrowing gap between the two and 10-year yields underscored investors' concerns about a protracted recession and a deflationary spiral. European government bonds also maintained a firmer tone, with the 10-year Bund yield down 7bp at 3.14 per cent and the 10-year UK gilt yield 6bp lower at 3.40 per cent. UK consumer price inflation fell by less than expected last month, but the markets paid little heed to the figures. ""This is very much yesterday's news regarding the problems facing the UK economy,"" said Howard Archer, chief UK and European economist at IHS Global Insight. ""Indeed, inflation seems set to plunge over the coming months."" On the currency markets , sterling steadied following its recent slide against the euro as the focus remained firmly on the dollar ahead of the FOMC decision. The US currency set a fresh two-month low against the single currency and hovered near a 13-year trough against the yen. The euro was helped by ECB president Jean-Claude Trichet's comment that eurozone interest rates could not be cut forever. ""President Trichet app-eared very marginally to restate the view that the ECB was not preparing for a further policy rate cut at its January 15 meeting,"" said Julian Callow, chief European economist at Barclays Capital. Goldman's earnings helped buoy financial stocks on both sides of the Atlantic, driving equity markets higher. By midday in New York, the S&P 500 was up 1.9 per cent, while the pan-European FTSE Eurofirst 300 index ended 0.9 per cent higher. But Asian bank stocks put in much less positive performances ahead of the Goldman results. In Tokyo, the Nikkei 225 average fell 1.1 per cent, while Australian shares shed 1 per cent. The better tone in equities allowed US and European cred it spreads to tighten. The iTraxx Europe index - a gauge of the cost of insuring against investment-grade companies defaulting on debt - dropped 9bp to 198bp while its US counterpart, the CDX North America index, fell 9.5bp to 254.5bp. In the money markets , interbank lending rates generally continued to ease although two-week dollar and euro Libor rose sharply, reflecting year-end tightness. Oil continued to dominate commodities markets ahead of today's Opec meeting, which is expected to result in hefty output cuts. There was much talk that Russia could also reduce supply in tandem with an Opec move. The benchmark US crude price was up 59 cents at $45.10 a barrel, after briefly spiking above $50 on Monday. Gold fell 0.3 per cent."
19,2002-12-10,2002-12-11,Financial Times,WORLD STOCK MARKETS - Bourses firm as Fed holds rates.,"It was a mainly positive picture in the stock markets as the US Federal Open Markets Committee kept interest rates on hold as expected. Traders and analysts had predicted no change given that the FOMC cut rates by a surprise 50 basis points last month. The best performer in Europe was Germany as technical rebounds by financial stocks helped the Dax index climb more than 3 per cent. French stocks were also stronger in the main but weakness in London and elsewhere left the Eurotop index just 0.3 per cent higher at the close of European trading. However, Nokia's warning about sales for the fourth quarter put a cap on the technology sector. IT stocks such as Nokia, Ericsson and Alcatel were among the laggards, while power stocks surged ahead, including a 4.7 per cent rise for Germany's Eon. German stocks shrugged off a dispiriting outlook on the economy as the ZEW institute's expectations indicator fell by more than expected for the sixth month in a row. The indicator was 0.6, down from 4.2 last month and only just above the level at which contraction in the economy is forecast. The index is based on a survey of about 300 analysts and institutional investors. Last month it showed its biggest fall for many years. Wall Street was buoyed by better-than-expected data on wholesale inventories, which fell 0.3 per cent compared with forecasts of a slight rise. It is the first time in six months that stocks of goods on wholesalers' shelves have fallen. One of the best performing stocks was Maxtor Corp, a maker of computer disc drives, which raised its fourth quarter outlook because of strong sales of new products. The shares surged 25 per cent.

20,2002-12-10,2002-12-11,Financial Times,THE AMERICAS - Fed keeps short-term interest rates steady.,"The Federal Reserve decided to keep short-term interest rates unchanged yesterday, in something of an anticlimax to recent dramatic developments on the US policy front. But it appeared to leave open the possibility of future rate cuts if the economy failed to emerge from its current ""soft spot"". The Fed's policymaking Open Market Committee (FOMC) voted unanimously at its last scheduled meeting of the year to leave the Fed funds rate at a 40-year low of 1.25 per cent. The rate regulates overnight lending of reserves among banks. Surprising signs of economic weakness have emerged over the past two weeks, raising doubts among investors about the strength of the recovery. But those signs failed to sway the Fed from its position that it had done enough for now. Explaining its decision, it said its previous rate cuts and strong productivity growth were ""providing important ongoing support"" to the economy, but the central bank acknowledged significant uncertainty, adding that it needed more readings on the economy before it could justify new policy moves. The Fed last month reduced rates by half a percentage point as extra insurance against further weakness. In its previous assessment, the FOMC said the economy was working its way through a ""soft spot"", although it acknowledged apprehension among businesses and consumers about risks to the economy. It said again yesterday that the economy might still be stuck in a soft spot. Economic reports continue to send mixed signals - suggesting investment is tentatively turning around and the US economy is stabilising. But businesses are still reluctant to expand operations. Recent data have suggested a sharp drop in demand for unemployment benefits, rebounds in consumer spending and confidence and an acceleration in the growth of service-sector activity. But there have also been indications of a slowdown in the growth of income and home prices and declines in advertised job openings, manufacturing activity and employment. Yesterday, the Institute of Supply Management, a group of purchasing executives, predicted a long ""jobless recovery"". Wholesalers, deeply sceptical about the economy's direction, continue to keep stockpiles extremely lean. The Commerce Department reported the ratio of inventories to sales had recently fallen to an 18-year low. London Edition 2. "
21,2002-12-10,2002-12-11,Financial Times,CAPITAL MARKETS - Treasuries lower as Fed sits tight.,"US government bondswere lower yesterday after the Federal Reserve kept interest rates unchanged and indicated that the risks remain equally balanced between inflation and economic stagnation. In its last policy meeting this year, the Fed's Open Market Committee said the economy is working its way through its ""soft spot."" The decision had no impact on the Treasury market, which had not expected the Fed to alter the 1.25 per cent Federal funds rate. Some bond market strategists said yesterday that further cuts in rates have become more unlikely following Treasury Secretary Paul O'Neill's resignation last week. Mr O'Neill's departure has cleared the way for the Bush administration to push ahead with more fiscal stimulus. ""The fiscal stimulus might provide the support needed (for the economy),"" said Joseph Schatz, government bond strategist at Merrill Lynch, adding that this might make it less likely that the Fed would have to ease rates again next year. After the FOMC meeting, the 10-year bond was 5/32 lower at 99 17/32 to yield 4.056 per cent, while the 30-year bond had also lost 5/32 to 106 1/2 with a yield of 4.944 per cent. The two-year note had fallen 1/16 to 100 7/32 with a yield of 1.878 per cent. Short-dated eurozone government bonds again outperformed the long end as comments from the European Central Bank and German economic data suggested a further cut in interest rates early next year. The two-year German schatz, whose yield had earlier hit a3 1/2-year low at about 2.85 per cent, was yielding 2.91 per cent, down 3 basis points. The yield on the 10-year bund was 4.37 per cent, down 1bp. The market benefited from the German ZEW economic sentiment survey, which fell 3.6 points to 0.6 in December, indicating an economy on the brink of recession. Moreover, Otmar Issing, the ECB's chief economist, said late on Monday the central bank was worried about the public perception that inflation was higher than it actually was. The German government will today auction Euros 9bn of new 3 per cent two-year schatz notes, having increased the amount of the issue by Euros 2bn. ""The 20bp rally in two-year yields suggests that the market is not set up for the auction,"" said analysts at UBS Warburg. ""The cover on German auctions has fallen through the year and big auctions (have) suffered more from poor bidding."" UK gilts ended little changed, with the short end of the curve narrowly outperforming longer-dated paper. Although the FTSE 100 equities index suffered a record long eight-day decline, early gains on gilts faded on profit-taking ahead of the US Federal Reserve's interest rate announcement. Long maturities were also hit by talk that the government, which is about to sharply increase gilt issuance, was mulling introducing a new bond maturing between 2035 and 2040. The two-year gilt was yielding 3.822 per cent, down 1bp. The yield on 10-year paper was up 1bp at 4.561 per cent. Japanese government bond prices ended little changed as investors exercised caution ahead of the finance ministry's announcement next week on JGB issuance in the next fiscal year. Investors were also wary of fluctuations in the yen-dollar rate following the appointment of John Snow as US Treasury secretary. London Edition 1. "
22,2009-11-04,2009-11-05,Financial Times,Fed spells out stance on rates decisions,"Levels close to zero expected for 6 months Statement allows for changing conditions The Federal Reserve yesterday signalled that it still expected to keep interest rates near zero for at least six months, but for the first time identified factors that could lead to earlier rate rises. In a shift foreshadowed in the Financial Times, the US central bank tweaked guidance in its policy statement that had been unchanged since March, edging away from a simple forecast that it expects to keep rates at ""exceptionally low levels"" for an ""extended period"" - commonly understood to mean at least six months. Policymakers kept the ""extended period"" phrase but for the first time set out the conditions on which this guidance is based: ""low rates of resource utilisation, subdued inflation trends and stable inflation expectations"". The statement implies that if these conditions are not met - because of an upside surprise on growth, a pick-up in inflation or a rise in inflation expectations - the Fed may have to raise rates within the six-month period. In making this change, the US central bank spelt out what the market should watch for in terms of the factors that could lead to rate rises. Meanwhile, the Federal Open Market Committee decided to shave $25bn off the planned $200bn purchase of debt issued by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. The decision was justified on technical grounds reflecting ""the limited availability of agency debt"". The reduction only makes the tiniest dent in the Fed's overall $1,750bn asset purchase programme. However, it was notable that the committee cut the $25bn rather than using it to buy Fannie and Freddie mortgage-backed securities. This suggests that it would take a lot to persuade mainstream Fed officials and hawks to increase the MBS purchases - an option some Fed doves want to consider. In spite of public disagreements between Fed hawks and doves in the run-up to the meeting, the statement was unanimously endorsed by the committee. This reflects the fact that there was something in it for both camps. Hawks will be able to point to the reference to ""subdued inflation trends and stable inflation expectations"" as indicating red lines for rate policy. Doves will say that this is obvious and changes nothing, while the reference to ""resource utilisation"" rather than growth highlights the importance of unemployment. If the forecast plays out as expected and the Fed's conditions are met, the Fed will not be raising rates in the next six months. But, the fact that the committee saw the need to tinker with the statement highlighted that this is far from certain."
23,2009-11-04,2009-11-05,Financial Times,Fed sees six more months of low rates,"First steps in return to more hawkish stance $25bn shaved off asset purchases The Federal Reserve yesterday took baby steps in the direction of a more hawkish stance on rates, tweaking its guidance on future policy for the first time since March and shaving a token $25bn from planned asset purchases. In a shift first foreshadowed in the Financial Times, the US central bank edged away from a simple forecast that it expects to keep rates at ""exceptionally low levels"" for an ""extended period"" - commonly understood to mean at least six months. For the first time, policymakers identified the assumptions on which this interest rate guidance is based: ""Low rates of resource utilisation, subdued inflation trends and stable inflation expectations."" Implicitly, the statement indicates that if these conditions are not met - because of an upside surprise on growth, a pick-up in inflation or a rise in inflation expectations - the Fed may have to raise rates within the six-month period. In doing so, it clarifies the conditional nature of the Fed rate guidance. Meanwhile, the Federal open market committee decided to shave $25bn off the planned $200bn purchase of debt issued by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. The decision was justified on technical grounds reflecting ""the limited availability of agency debt"". The reduction only makes the tiniest dent in the Fed's $1,750bn asset purchase programme. However, it was notable that the committee simply cut the $25bn rather than transferring it to purchases of mortgage-backed securities backed by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. This underscores that it would take a lot to persuade mainstream Fed officials and hawks to increase purchases of MBS - an option a handful of Fed doves want to consider. In spite of public disagreements between Fed hawks and doves ahead of the meeting, the statement was unanimously endorsed by the committee. This probably reflects the fact there was something in it for both camps. Hawks will be able to point to the reference to ""subdued inflation trends and stable inflation expectations"" as indicating red lines for rate policy. Doves will say this is obvious and changes nothing. The net result is to give the Fed a little more flexibility in the months ahead without signalling imminent rate increases. If the forecast plays out as expected the Fed will not be raising rates in the next six months. But, the fact that the committee saw the need to tinker with the statement highlights that this is far from 100 per cent certain. After the Fed released the policy statement, stocks pared some of their earlier gains, the dollar came under mild selling pressure, while long-term Treasury yields briefly surged."
24,2009-11-04,2009-11-05,Financial Times,Evolution Group retreats following investor share sale,"LONDON Evolution Group came into focus yesterday afternoon after one of its biggest shareholders attempted to sell its stake. Shares in the mid-cap investment bank closed 3 per cent lower at 152.7p amid talk that 22m shares, or 9.4 per cent of the company, was being offered to the market. Only two Evolution shareholders hold that much stock; Portuguese bank Banco Espirito Santo (BES) and BlackRock. The talk in the market was that the seller was BES, disposing of what was now deemed to be a non- core holding. The shares are thought to have eventually been placed with new investors at about the 150p level by stockbroker Execution. When Banco first revealed its holding in January 2008, it fuelled speculation that it could be the prelude to a full bid for Evolution, which has been on an aggressive expansion drive in the past year. The FTSE 100, meanwhile, recouped all of Tuesday's losses, rising 70.7 points, or 1.4 per cent, to 5,107.9, helped by a strong opening on Wall Street following the release of positive service sector and employment data. Trading volumes were light, however, with many investors choosing to sit on the sidelines ahead of the statement from the US Federal Open Market Committee. Elsewhere, the FTSE 250 jumped 236 points, or 2.7 per cent, to 8,992.7. Retailers led the market higher. Marks and Spencer rose 6 per cent to 361½p as half-year results impressed and the company said it expected a further improvement in margins. Analysts responded by increasing their full-year pre-tax profit forecasts by about 7 per cent to £620-£630m, although good Christmas trading could trigger further upgrades. Next added 5.6 per cent to £19.12 after better-than- expected third-quarter results and upgrading its sales and profit guidance for the rest of the year. ""Sales of autumn/winter clothing appear to have been boosted by an improved product offering and are currently trading ahead of management guidance,"" said Merrill Lynch. Randgold Resource was also in demand as the price of gold hit a record high. Its shares finished 4.6 per cent higher at £45.06. Meanwhile, Mexican silver miner Fresnillo rose 9.2 per cent to 820p as the price of silver advanced in tandem. British Airways rallied 6.6 per cent to 191.8p following reports that Spain's Iberia had hired JPMorgan to help it close a planned merger with its UK rival. Cadbury , however, failed to join the rally. Shares in the group slipped 1.4 per cent to 766p as the share price of its US suitor, Kraft, fell in the wake of disappointing results. ""Kraft's third-quarter results disappointed on top-line growth for the fourth quarter in a row with 0.5 per cent like-for-like sales growth contrasting with Cadbury's impressive 7 per cent,"" said Panmure Gordon. There was speculation that Kraft was poised to go hostile with its original cash-and-stock offer, which is now worth about 723p a share. If that happens, Kraft would then have 28 days to post its offer document and 46 more to increase the terms of its offer to an acceptable level. Housebuilders were the standout feature in the mid- caps. The sector rose sharply after Taylor Wimpey , up 8.2 per cent to 40p, said trading conditions had improved and it was now fully sold for 2009. That news saw Persimmon rise 10.6 per cent to 424p and Barratt Developments put on 12.7 per cent to 136.3p. Barratt also announced a 92.3 per cent take-up for its rights issue and placed the unwanted shares at 120.9p. Chip designer Imagination Technologies moved up 12.7 per cent to 225p after Panmure Gordon issued a ""buy"" recommendation. Increasing its target price to 250p, from 200p, analyst Nick James said the company was bullish on the prospects for Meta, its processor core, which could be used in Android-powered mobile phones. ""It appears licences have already been sold for this type of application and it would be reasonable to expect a partner to be shipping product within a one-two year timeframe."""

But the fact that the committee tinkered with the statement highlights this is not certain. After the Fed released the policy statement, stocks pared some of their earlier gains, the dollar came under mild selling pressure and long-term US Treasury yields briefly surged. The Fed said it would only buy $175bn and not its original target of $200bn in agency debt, and its purchase programme has helped markets absorb record Treasury issuance this year. After a knee-jerk bounce higher, the S&P 500 was trading 0.6 per cent higher on the day, after being up 0.9 per cent before the decision. With the FOMC maintaining its easy policy stance, the yield on the 10-year note briefly rose to 3.56 per cent from 3.51 per cent as investors sold longer-dated bonds. Gold remained in record territory, shy of $1,000 an ounce, while oil prices were trading above $80 a barrel."
26,1994-02-04,1994-02-05,Financial Times,WORLD STOCK MARKETS - AMERICA - FED CREDIT CURBS SEND DOW TUMBLING.,"Wall Street US stocks yesterday suffered their worst setback in over two years after the Federal Reserve announced that its policy-making body had decided to tighten credit conditions, writes Frank McGurty in New York. The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished down 96.24 at 3,871.42. It was its biggest fall in the single day since November 15, 1991. The more broadly based Standard and Poor's 500 plunged 11.41 to469.81. In the secondary markets, the American SE composite was 8.89 lower at 478.29, and the Nasdaq composite 20.51 off at 777.28. Volume on the NYSE was very heavy, with 377m shares traded by the close. Declining issues outnumbered advances by 2,032 to 296. After a soft opening, the market went into a tail spin after Mr Alan Greenspan, the Fed chairman, said that the Federal Open Market Committee had voted to increase pressure on reserve positions, a move associated with a slight rise in short-term rates. Share prices, which have prosperedunder the Fed's long-held policy of accommodation, plunged on the news, with the Dow index falling about 40 points within minutes of the statement. Stocks pulled off of their session lows soon after, helped in part by indications that the Fed would nudge up its target for the key Fed Funds rate by only 25 basis points to 3.25%. While an early move had been expected, the financial markets were nevertheless surprised by the unprecedented announcement of the Fed's intentions. At first, the bond market displayed a cooler reaction than equities in the face of the long-anticipated Fed move, intended to staunch incipient inflationary pressures in the economy. But losses started to mount in the afternoon, especially in the intermediate segment of the maturity range, with the five-year note down 19/32 at 98 21/32 and the yield rising to 5.303% late in the day. When bonds started to sag, the sell-off in stocks accelerated, with the Dow finally hitting bottom at the close. Financial issues and utilities, which are the most sensitive to fluctuations in interest rates, were among the worst performers. Citicorp was marked down $2 to $40 1/2, Chase Manhattan $1 1/2 to $33 3/4 and Wells Fargo $6 5/8 to $128 7/8. Brokerage houses were also hit hard, with Morgan Stanley dropping $3 5/8 to $74 5/8 and Merrill Lynch shedding $2 3/4 to $41 1/2. Amid the fresh indication that the economy may not have fared as well as expected last month, cyclical issues, including automobile, metals and heavy equipment companies, were also down. General Motors dropped $1 3/8 to $61 5/8, Alcoa $2 1/8 and 3M $2 1/4 to $104 1/2. On the Nasdaq, technology stocks led the retreat. Microsoft lost $3 1/4 to $82 1/4, Sun Microsystems $1 5/8 to $25 1/2 and Wellfleet Communications $3 3/8 to $70 3/8. Canada The Toronto TSE-300 composite index recordedits largest single-day drop since October 1989, in continued heavy trading. It fell 113.09 points, or 2.48%, to 4,447.19, with declines trouncing advances 694 to 194. (c) The Financial Times Limited 1994. "

Trading remained cautious prior to today's US unemployment figures and as dealers watched the Fed closely for any signs of a change in monetary policy. In late trading, some long-dated issues were quoted 1/2 point higher, while the Treasury's benchmark long bond stood 3/8 point up for a yield of 8.09 per cent. The short end of the market was up around 1/8 point, reflecting some caution after outperforming the long end earlier in the week. The dollar was quoted well above earlier lows of Y137.85 and DM1.8790 to stand at Y138.85 and DM1.8860 in late trading. This was the key factor helping bond prices yesterday.

The consensus forecast is for a rise in the non-farm payroll of just over 200,000 compared with May's gain of 101,000. The June figures include five rather than four weeks of unemployment statistics, which accounts for the larger expected rise in the non-farm payroll. A figure of anywhere around 200,000 would be construed as showing enough economic weakness for the Fed to ease Fed funds by another 1/4 point. A figure of 250,000 or more would be interpreted as restraining any easing move by the Fed. Bond economists cautioned that there is considerable risk that the bond market could suffer more from a strong gain in the non-farm payroll than benefit from a weak number because expectations of a soft number are so widespread. * * * The French Government yesterday carried out its first auction of Ecu-denominated state bonds, following the successful syndicated sale of the same Ecu bond in April. The Government accepted bids for 352 m Ecus, 45 per cent of the bids submitted, at a cut-off price of 99.55 per cent, giving a weighted average yield of 8.56 per cent. April's placing, bought mostly by individual investors, had a yield of 8.66 per cent. Dealers said that the first auction tranche should go a considerable way towards making the 8.5 per cent 1997 Fcu bond into a reference for the market. Most of the April placing is firmly held, but around 100 m Ecus worth is still to be traded. The dealers said that yesterday's tranche, bought mostly by international institutions, would add perhaps 300 m Ecus to the float. At the same auction, the Government sold FFr 8.7 bn of French franc bonds, including FFr 3.77 bn of the 10-year fixed rate OAT 8.125 per cent 1999. The Government accepted less than a quarter of the bids submitted, and the cut-off price gave an average yield on the 10-year bond of 8.7 per cent, 23 basis points below the last auction of this bond in May. Only FFr 2 bn was sold of the floating rate OAT TME 2001, indexed on the average of government bond secondary market yields. The margin of 40 basis points below the index was considerably tighter than the 63 basis points recorded when the bond was last auctioned in April. The FFr 2 bn accepted at a price of 97.4 per cent was well clear of the rest of the market. The remaining FFr 5.75 bn of bids went no higher than 97.2 per cent. * * * The success of the French auction helped push the Paris government bond market higher, and prices ended the day 20 to 25 centimes above Wednesday's close. It thus provided a contrast to most of the other European markets, where the prospect of today's US unemployment figures and the feeling that the dollar's recent sharp declines may be due for a temporary reversal made for a cautionary approach. Nevertheless, with a current yield differential of more than 2 per cent above its German counterpart, there are still expectations that the French market can outstrip the performance of its neighbours. The German market turned lower, despite purchases in the market by the Bundesbank, even after a firmer start. The announcement of revised inflation figures, showing inflation in the year to June at 3.1 per cent, instead of the provisionally estimated 2.9 per cent, led the market to lose its early morning gains. The market closed about 10 pfennigs weaker, with some US investment banks reported to be switching out of the German market into US Treasuries and into the French market. The Dutch market kept in step with the German, preserving a yield premium of about 40 basis points. The UK market's three-day rally stalled too, with investors becoming cautious about whether sterling can indefinitely sustain the gains of the past couple of weeks. Sterling's trade-weighted index was 0.1 point higher at 91.9, but conventional gilt prices were up to 1/4 point lower. "
29,1991-10-01,1991-10-02,Financial Times,Leading Indicators Point To Weak Economy.,"The US composite index of leading indicators failed to rise in August, signalling possible future weakness in the US economy, the Commerce Department said yesterday. A separate report by purchasing managers indicated manufacturing industry continued to expand in September, but at a slower pace than earlier in the summer. The figures, suggesting a mixed economic outlook, were released as the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), the US central bank's policy-making committee, met to discuss interest rate policy. The committee was expected to lean towards further easing of monetary policy, but its deliberations will not be made public for six weeks. The index of leading indicators was flat in August after steady gains in the preceding six months. Six of its 11 components signalled contraction, including orders for plant and equipment, claims for unemployment insurance and real money supply. Taken together, the behaviour of the indicators supports the view that the economic recovery faltered in late summer, but it does not yet suggest an economic relapse. The purchasing managers' index, a closely watched measure of manufacturing health, rose to 55 per cent last month, compared with 54.8 per cent in August. Yesterday's figures and FOMC meeting follow high level discussions between Mr Alan Greenspan, Fed chairman, and the White House. (c) The Financial Times Limited 1991. "
30,1991-10-01,1991-10-02,Financial Times,US indicators point to weak economy: White House economists urge new measures to ease 'credit crunch',"THE US composite index of leading indicators failed to rise in August, signalling possible future weakness in the US economy, the Commerce Department said yesterday. A separate report by purchasing managers indicated manufacturing industry continued to expand in September, but at a slower pace than earlier in the summer. The figures, suggesting a mixed economic outlook, were released as the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), the US central bank's policy-making committee, met to discuss interest rate policy. The committee was expected to lean towards further easing of monetary policy, but its deliberations will not be made public for six weeks. The index of leading indicators was flat in August after steady gains in the preceding six months. Six of its 11 components signalled contraction, including orders for plant and equipment, claims for unemployment insurance and real money supply. An index of coincident indicators - designed to measure current economic conditions - fell slightly and has shown no growth since June. Taken together, the behaviour of the indicators supports the view that the economic recovery faltered in late summer, but it does not yet suggest an economic relapse. The purchasing managers' index, a closely watched measure of manufacturing health, rose to 55 per cent last month, compared with 54.8 per cent in August. The increase was smaller than in recent months but indicates that prospects in manufacturing remain brighter than in the larger services sector. The index has been above 50 per cent - the level that indicates the manufacturing economy is expanding - for four months. Mr Robert Bretz, for the National Association of Purchasing Managers, said the economy 'seemingly paused to catch its breath' last month. However, the fifth consecutive monthly increase in new orders indicated 'moderate growth' in the final quarter of this year. Yesterday's figures and FOMC meeting follow high level discussions between Mr Alan Greenspan, Fed chairman, and the White House. Administration economists are urging new measures to alleviate the alleged 'credit crunch' - artificial restrictions on the supply of credit due to the weakness of the banking system - which is seen as inhibiting economic recovery. One option being considered is to relax bank capital requirements slightly to stimulate fresh lending. Economists are split over the importance of credit restrictions. The Shadow Open Market Committee, a group of monetarist economists formed to second-guess official monetary policy, says the economy is on track for 2-3 per cent growth and does not require additional stimulus. Prof Allan Meltzer, the group's leader, says the credit crunch is a 'red herring'. Bankers are applying tighter lending standards in weak sectors. But weak credit growth generally reflects weak demand, normal at this stage of the business cycle. "
31,2003-05-06,2003-05-07,Financial Times,Fed's new tools shape expectation.,"Fed's new tools shape expectation - The central bank betrays a fear of deflation by splitting its assessment, says Alan Beattie. The Fed's unusually detailed outlook on the economy that accompanied its decision on interest rates yesterday represents a significant step towards greater transparency in one of the more cryptic central banks. The Fed's decision to split its balance of risks assessment into separate judgments about growth and inflation was hailed by former Fed policymakers as a welcome move towards explaining its thinking. But the fact that it took such an unexpected step suggests it was prodded by concern about deflation, and took a calculated risk in making its views so explicit. The normal assessment of the balance of risks to the economy - which several years ago replaced an even more opaque statement that gave the ""policy bias"" of the committee - weighs the risks of too-low growth against the risk of too-high inflation. But these choices appear redundant at a time when inflation is falling dangerously close to zero, and the Fed is anxious to stop deflationary psychology taking hold. Janet Yellen, a former Fed governor now at the University of California at Berkeley, says: ""A statement where the only possibilities are growth being too weak or inflation being too strong doesn't really characterise the current situation."" By splitting out the assessment of growth and inflation risks, the Fed has given itself more tools to manage expectations. With yesterday's statement, it signalled that higher growth in the absence of imminent inflationary pressure would not necessarily cause it to raise interest rates. Economists said the implicit focus on avoiding deflation was extraordinarily strong. As Robert DiClemente at Citigroup put it: ""Policymakers are comfortable that chances for better growth have improved. That judgment could have run the risk of igniting premature expectations of higher policy-driven interest rates. Today, the FOMC has severed that logic."" In this sense, the statement can be read as a mild version of the strategy that the Fed has already discussed internally: a binding commitment to keep interest rates on hold until the risk of deflation has been banished. ""This statement appears designed to keep bond yields low to protect the stock market,"" Prof Yellen says. That strategy was not without risks: the overall judgment that the risks were weighted towards weakness might have spooked the markets. But if the Fed's intention was as Prof Yellen surmises, it worked just fine yesterday, with interest-rate expectations falling with little dent in the stock market's hefty gains. Other former Fed officials joined Prof Yellen in praising the subtlety of the move. Stephen Cecchetti, former chief economist at the New York Fed, said it was a significant improvement. Larry Meyer, a former Fed governor now at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said: ""This is an intelligent way of signalling that the threshold for cutting rates in coming months has become lower."" But both Mr Cecchetti and Mr Meyer questioned why an overall assessment of risks, adding inflation and growth, was published when separate judgments had been given. ""The only question I would raise is the need to publish a potentially confusing and redundant final sentence (in the statement),"" Mr Meyer said. Indeed, maintaining the overall risk assessment raised the possibility that the disaggregated version would be discontinued if the deflationary threat goes away. But if the pleased reaction of former Fed officials means anything, it might well be here to stay. US Edition 2. "
32,2003-05-06,2003-05-07,Financial Times,US economy - THE LEX COLUMN.,"The Federal Reserve, in its decision to leave its primary interest rate on hold at 1.25 per cent and to fudge its statement, followed the lead set by Alan Greenspan in his testimony before Congress last week. The Federal open market committee is hoping for a noticeable improvement in economic activity now that the war in Iraq and $40 a barrel oil are behind us. So far, consumer confidence surveys aside, the only sign of such a postwar rebound has been a more buoyant stock market and tighter credit spreads. The Treasury market is another story. The recent readings on production and employment - and the balance of data since last November - have been disappointing. With interest rates so low, and the prospect that unorthodox monetary policy might unnerve investors, the FOMC is waiting for a clearer read of the postwar data. That is reasonable. But it is hard to see how the upside and downside risks to growth are roughly equal. The Fed says that ""the probability of an unwelcome substantial fall in inflation, though minor, exceeds that of a pickup in inflation"". In that case, it seems obvious that the balance of risks between maintaining price stability and sustainable economic growth are weighted towards weakness. The tortuous wording of the Fed's statement must reflect disagreements on the FOMC. But, word play aside, if the data remain weak the Fed is going to have to act. London Edition 2. "
33,2004-05-04,2004-05-05,Financial Times,Fed paves way for future rate increase AMERICAS.,"US stocks yesterday took in their stride the much-anticipated announcement from the Federal Reserve that it would leave interest rates on hold, with any eventual raising taking place in a ""measured"" manner. Having spent much of the day locked in a tight range, the indices jerked upward immediately after the central bank declared victory over deflation and said it would be cautious in lifting borrowing costs from their 46-year lows. However, they settled back in a narrow range after traders such as Jay Suskind at Ryan Beck &Co concluded that ""this is the best that we could have hoped for"". By the close, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up fractionally to 10,317.20 while the S&P 500 index inched up 0.2 per cent to 1,119.51. The Nasdaq Composite added 0.6 per cent at 1,950.48. As expected, the Fed's statement accompanying the decision did not contain ""patient"" in reference to the central bank's stance on monetary policy. ""With inflation low and resource use slack . . . the (policy-making Federal Open Market) committee believes that policy accommodation can be removed at a pace that is likely to be measured,"" the statement said. Even though the Fed said price stability had been achieved, several economic indicators have hinted at increasing inflationary pressures. As such, traders and investors are only concerned with, and have struggled to prepare for, the timing of an interest rate increase and its consequences for the economy and profits. Prompted by the amount of talk about monetary policy, Ned Riley, the chief investment officer at State Street Global Advisors, wrote to clients: ""We must end this mindless and useless speculation about which FOMC meeting will mark the beginning of the end. We all know it will happen. . . . What's the big deal?"" Ryan Beck's Mr Suskind concurred. ""I think (a rate rise) is already priced in, the market is already ahead of the Fed"". He added that rising interest rates in a growing economy were preferable to low interest rates in a recessionary climate. ""A gradual slowdown in economic activity may actually be quite beneficial to facilitating positive longer-term prospects for the economy and stock market,"" added Mr Riley. However, last week Citigroup's technical analysis team warned the market might react more sharply to the first interest rate rise of this cycle. On the corporate front, a handful of companies were still left to report earnings. Tyco, the industrial conglomerate, increased its full-year earnings estimate as it reported above-forecast first-quarter results. Shares were up 3.9 per cent to Dollars 29.07 by the close.

34,2004-05-04,2004-05-05,Financial Times,Measure for measure - THE LEX COLUMN.,"Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve, is no longer making a virtue of patience. The outlook for both sustainable economic growth and for inflation is now balanced. That makes the case for retaining the emergency federal funds rate of 1 per cent for much longer look weak. There is, however, a long journey ahead before the Federal Reserve gets within sight of a ""neutral"" level, which many put at above 3.5 per cent. Given the continuing slack in the US economy, high productivity growth and low levels of inflation there is little rush. And there will be fevered debate at what level ""neutral"" really is in today's world. But the Fed's challenge is to kick off the tightening process without unnerving the markets. So far, so good. The Federal Open Market Committee will no longer be ""patient in removing its policy accommodation"", but it will remove it at a pace that is ""likely to be measured"". That should reassure investors that the Fed has learnt from 1994 - when a sharp tightening cycle caused turmoil in the bond markets. It offers no guarantees, however. While the Fed has signalled it is ""likely"" to move gingerly, it has left itself the option of more aggressive action. In reality investors learnt little yesterday they had not worked out for themselves. Interest rates are set to go up. The Fed has no plans to go for a kamikaze increase. But the outlook has already shifted dramatically in a matter of months. The Fed's desire for a ""measured"" approach will remain at the mercy of job creation and inflation data as the year progresses. "
35,2004-05-04,2004-05-05,Financial Times,Fed Reserve paves way for future rate increase AMERICAS.,"US stocks took in their stride the much-anticipated announcement from the Federal Reserve that it would leave interest rates unchanged but would raise them in a ""measured"" manner. Having spent much of the day locked in a tight range, the indices jerked upward immediately after the central bank declared victory over deflation and said it would be cautious in lifting borrowing costs from their 46-year lows. However, they settled back in a narrow range after traders such as Jay Suskind at Ryan Beck &Co concluded that ""this is the best that we could have hoped for"". Shortly after the Fed's announcement, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 0.1 per cent to 10,324.80 while the S&P 500 index inched up 0.2 per cent to 1,119.81. The Nasdaq Composite added 0.5 per cent at 1,949.05. As expected, the Fed's statement accompanying the decision does not contain ""patient"" in reference to the central bank's stance on monetary policy. ""With inflation low and resource use slack . . . the (policy-making Federal Open Market) committee believes that policy accommodation can be removed at a pace that is likely to be measured,"" the statement says. Even though the Fed said price stability had been achieved, several economic indicators have hinted at increasing inflationary pressures. As such, traders and investors are only concerned with, and have struggled to prepare for, the timing of an interest rate increase and its consequences for the economy and profits. Prompted by the amount of talk about monetary policy, Ned Riley, the chief investment officer at State Street Global Advisors, wrote to clients: ""We must end this mindless and useless speculation about which FOMC meeting will mark the beginning of the end. We all know it will happen. . . . What's the big deal?"" Ryan Beck's Mr Suskind concurred. ""I think (a rate rise) is already priced in, the market is already ahead of the Fed"". He added that rising interest rates in a growing economy were preferable to low interest rates in a recessionary climate. ""A gradual slowdown in economic activity may actually be quite beneficial to facilitating positive longer-term prospects for the economy and stock market,"" added Mr Riley. However, last week Citigroup's technical analysis team had warned the market might react more sharply to the first interest rate rise of this cycle. On the corporate front, a handful of companies were still left to report earnings.

36,2004-05-04,2004-05-05,Financial Times,Shift in stance as Fed leaves interest rates on hold.,"The US Federal Reserve yesterday signalled a shift in its stance on monetary policy, leaving interest rates unchanged while saying that inflation risks are now balanced and that rates would be raised ""at a pace that is likely to be measured"". The Fed's latest hints about the looming US rate rise come as the Bank of England's monetary policy committee meets to discuss raising rates for what would be the third time since November. In its statement, released after the meeting of its rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee, the Fed dropped its commitment to be ""patient in removing its policy accommodation"". Instead, it said: ""At this juncture, with inflation low and resource use slack, the Committee believes that policy accommodation can be removed at a pace that is likely to be measured."" The decision to leave the federal funds rate on hold at 1 per cent was universally expected, and attention was focused on changes to the statement for clues to the FOMC's intentions for the future. Futures markets suggest expectations of a quarter point increase in the fed funds rate by the time of the FOMC's August meeting. The statement did little to discourage such expectations or to encourage the idea that the Fed will raise rates when it meets at the end of June. In Britain, independent economists overwhelmingly expect that the Bank of England will raise its main interest rate a quarter point to 4.25 per cent tomorrow. However the MPC is also seen as likely to proceed slowly with further increases. The futures markets, which MPC members have suggested are a useful benchmark for expectations, imply the Bank's main interest rate will be about 4.75 per cent at the end of the year, and about 5 per cent at the end of next year. Household borrowing figures and two business surveys yesterday reinforced the case for higher rates. The CBI reported a surge in retail sales in April; in its distributive trades survey, 51 per cent of respondents said sales were up on a year ago, while 21 per cent said they were down. In the manufacturing industry, for which the official output data have been disappointing in recent months, the Chartered Institute of Purchasing and Supply reported a strong rise in its purchasing managers' index from 53.8 in March to 55.1 in April.

37,2004-05-04,2004-05-05,Financial Times (FT.Com),Dollar falls as FOMC dashes talk of June rate rise.,"The dollar fell to a four-week low against the euro in London morning trade on Wednesday after the US authorities said they could afford to be ""measured"" in raising interest rates from 46-year lows. As widely expected, the Federal Open Market Committee said the upside and downside risks to sustainable growth were now ""roughly equal"" and the risks to price stability have ""moved into balance"". The well-worn phrase that the FOMC could be ""patient"" in removing its policy accommodation also disappeared this time around. But the replacement: ""that policy accommodation can be removed at a pace that is likely to be measured"", created almost as many questions as it answered. Most took the statement to mean that US rates will not rise in June. With no meeting planned for July, August would thus be the first opportunity for a hike - at the dovish end of prior expectations. ""The FOMC has set itself up to where its earliest hike can't come until August 10 because the statement is insufficient to prep the market for a June 30 rate hike,"" said Aziz McMahon, currencies strategist at ABN Amro. Simon Derrick, head of currency research at Bank of New York, argued against a June rise on the grounds that several Fed officials have called for ""several months"" of continued improvement in the jobs market before sanctioning a rate rise, a desire probably not satisfied by the FOMC's assertion that ""hiring appears to have picked up"". National Australia Bank and Credit Agricole Indosuez also plumped for an August tightening, but Ashraf Laidi, chief currency analyst at MG Financial, broke ranks by calling the meeting a ""stepping stone towards a June hike. ""Failure to raise rates in June shall induce risks of being behind the curve in the face of a potentially strong June labour report, due in July 2 when there is no FOMC meeting, and in the face of a strong July labour report, due in August 6."" said Mr Laidi. ""Thus if the Fed stands pat in the June meeting, its next meeting won't be until August, three payroll reports later. Should those reports show strong job creation, the Fed will then have to tighten by 50 basis points in August, which may appear to be too late, always a negative for the markets and the dollar."" However with the more dovish argument holding sway, the dollar extended Tuesday's sell-off, slipping a further cent against the euro to $1.2157, a four-week low. The greenback also fell to a two-week low against sterling at $1.7977 and lost Y1 against the yen at Y109.08. Even the Australian dollar made headway against its US namesake, rising a US cent to $0.7315, despite the Reserve Bank of Australia holding rates at 5.25 per cent overnight. "

40,2007-09-18,2007-09-19,Financial Times,Cheering greets Fed announcement.,"Whooping and hollering traders and soaring stock prices yesterday offered little evidence of the nagging concerns that the Federal Reserve's aggressive 50 basis point rate cut amounted to an admission that problems in the US financial system ran deeper than the Fed's governors first thought.  Charles Diebel, fixed income strategist at Nomura in London, said that by cutting the rate by more than the market expected, the Fed had opted for ""shock and awe"".  Arthur Hogan, chief market analyst at Jefferies &Co said he was taken aback by the traders' emphatic response, reacting to the cut ""as if Ben Bernanke (Fed chairman) has come up with a cure for cancer"".  The half percentage point cut, the result of a unanimous decision by the Federal Open Market Committee, surpassed what most people in the market expected. The consensus before the decision had been for a quarter-point cut.  An instant poll of more than 1,000 readers of FT.com showed that two thirds disagreed with the FOMC's decision.  Stocks soared, led by financial stocks and homebuilders, the two sectors most obviously affectedby the subprime mortgage market meltdown of recent months and its resultingfallout.  Trading both on exchange and over-the-counter markets had earlier been relatively light as Wall Street looked to Washington for direction.  Mr Hogan warned that the rate cut could in fact be viewed as an admission that the Fed sees a problem that is bigger than anticipated. Many other observers warned that there might be a reassessment today.  One trader said: ""The market seems to be taking solace in the aggression of the Fed. There were lots of cheers and not a small degree of shock and surprise. But I think there has to be a collective effort not to forget the backdrop of the serious problems in the credit derivatives market.""  Alfred Goldman, chief market strategist at AG Edwards, said: ""In the short term, the market likes pleasant surprises. The initial reaction was that the Fed came to the rescue, almost like the cavalry charging over a hill. But the risk is a hangover as people may ask 'what does the Fed know that we don't?' ""  Interest rate futures continued to price in rate cuts over the next 12 months with three-months rate seen at 4.25 per cent by September 2008, down from 4.45 per cent earlier in the day.  A Funds rate of 4.25 per cent - implying two further cuts of 25bp each - is now priced as a certainty by the meeting in January. At the beginning of the day, the market put the odds of this happening at barely 25 per cent.  The announcement was a surprise: Fed funds futures had pointed to a 33 per cent chance of a 50bp rate cut before the announcement. Analysts said further rate cuts would depend on the nature of forthcoming economic data.  ""The Fed is trying to tread a fine line and the 50bp cut is an attempt to restore confidence in the financial sector,"" said Dominic Konstam, head of interest rate strategy at Credit Suisse. ""The Fed has to wait for a meaningful slowdown in the economy and lower inflation before it can cut again. They are saving their bullets for the economy.""  Max Bublitz, chief strategist at SCM Advisors, said: ""This was the right thing to do, although I would have preferred more of a cut in the discount rate.  ""My guess is that more cuts will follow the rather weak data I expect to see this autumn.""  Mr Diebel said that the Fed ""really stepped up to the plate"" by cutting 50bp: a move clearly aimed at crisis of confidence as a result of credit concerns. ""It makes a cut in October look debatable but will not be the only move of the cycle in our view. If the data weaken further as we suspect then another move in December looks likely. The move should lessen some of the money market tensions.""  Citigroup drew a parallel between recent market conditions and those prevailing in 1998. ""History never repeats itself exactly, and the parallels between today's events and those of the Russia/LTCM crisis are not perfect. However, they are symbolic. Fed easing into a disrupted financial system in September-October 1998 was followed by solid equity market gains.""  In a possibly inflationary sign, oil prices climbed to a new high above Dollars 82 a barrel. Tom Sowanick, chief investment officer of Clearbrook Financial, pointed out that while stocks moved sharply higher, the bond market turned sceptical, in part because the market was adjusting to the reality that the Fed had entered into a risky trade-off between price inflation and economic growth. ""The bond market is essentially saying that the Fed's actions will risk a return to a higher inflation environment, supported by low short-term interest rates and perhaps, more importantly, a substantial decline in the US dollar.""  He pointed out that the action had the potential to usher in a cycle of renewed inflation risks. ""In our view, these risks are not small and, if realised, will be difficult to reverse. In the meantime, the Fed rate cuts are a green light for stocks and commodities.""  "
41,2007-09-18,2007-09-19,Financial Times (FT.Com),FT.com site : Regulators rethink bank rules.,"As Northern Rock has crumbled in recent days, Adam Applegarth, chief executive of the UK mortgage lender, has made little attempt to conceal his shock. ""Nobody could [fore]see the squeeze on global liquidity ... Watching liquidity disappear has been astonishing,"" he declared last week, adding that ""life changed on August 9"" when a sudden money market intervention by the European Central Bank revealed a broad freeze in the funding system.  Such comments about the unpredictability of events are unlikely to placate investors in Northern Rock's shares, let alone the depositors who queued to get their money out. But Mr Applegarth's comments highlight a crucial point about the spreading credit squeeze: behind the scenes many other private sector bankers, central bankers and regulators are also expressing astonishment at the turn of events.  Until this summer, most financiers had assumed that it was extremely unlikely that widespread problems in the money markets - on which financial institutions depend to fund their day-to-day operations - would occur. Thus, while financial institutions of almost every hue have been pouring resources into computer models designed to assess future risks, they had spent relatively little time analysing the events that have brought Northern Rock crashing down.  At the Bank of England, for example, officials had this year started warning about liquidity risks and creating new frameworks for measuring these, ahead of almost all of the central bank's counterparts in the western world. But the Bank had not rushed to finish this framework, since it thought a systemic funding freeze was unlikely. ""Nobody expected a complete money market freeze of this kind,"" confesses one senior continental European central banker. ""Every-one was looking for idiosyncratic financial shocks or worrying about subprime or credit being mispriced - that was the focus.""  Or as the treasurer of one big investment bank admits: ""What we are seeing now is like a natural disaster - whole parts of the financial system which we took for granted have stopped working. But that was not something that people had really prepared for.""  To a certain extent, this lack of preparation reflects the perennial tendency of experts in risk management to keep fighting the last financial war - in this case, the implosion of Long Term Capital Management, a US hedge fund, in 1998. The scenario that banks' planning meetings have focused on has been the possibility of another large-scale hedge fund collapse.  In some respects, this LTCM obsession has delivered welcome benefits. This summer, almost two dozen hedge funds ran into serious problems, including two linked to Bear Stearns, the Wall Street investment bank. These jolts have been handled relatively smoothly - in part because banks and regulators prepared so thoroughly for this scenario. ""Hedge funds have not been the issue this time,"" says one senior international regulator, who suggests this outcome may help to defuse demands from politicians for greater regulation of hedge funds in the coming months.  But while a focus on LTCM has helped the industry survive some of this summer's troubles, it may also have distracted risk managers from considering other potential shocks. That in turn highlights a bigger problem: in recent years regulators and investors have tended to play down the risks attached to banks, because they tended to assume that the biggest threats to financial stability lay elsewhere, most notably in unregulated areas such as hedge funds.  The reason for this lopsided view is that a fundamental shift has been under way in the financial system.  Banks used to be considered the dominant pillars of the financial world, since they provided credit to companies and individuals and retained the risk that these loans would turn sour. That meant that if a company defaulted, banks were left on the hook. As a result of this vulnerability, regulators required banks to hold large reserves of spare capital and pools of liquid assets to ensure they could cope with sudden credit shocks.  However, this decade has brought a move to what bankers describe as an ""originate and distribute"" model - meaning that although banks still tend to make (or ""originate"") loans, these are increasingly sold (or ""distributed"") to other capital market investors rather than retained on the banks' books. Since they have been selling on these loans, regulators have assumed that the banks would be less vulnerable if loans turned bad. Thus they have been willing to let the banks hold smaller cushions of capital relative to the volume of loans they create.  This shift towards an ""originate and distribute"" system has been good news for investment bankers, since it has enabled them to increase the volume of business they can do. One reason why Northern Rock, for example, expanded its mortgage book so fast this decade is that when the lender started turning its home loans into securities, regulatory rules permitted it to lend three times as much per unit of capital.  Until now regulators have generally tolerated - if not actively encouraged - this ""originate and distribute"" trend, since there was a widespread belief that the financial system would be safer if credit risk were spread around. In particular, policymakers assumed that the fact that banks were selling risks into the capital markets was making them less vulnerable to any future financial turmoil. Thus, it was presumed that there was now far less chance that a crisis would ever erupt in, say, the interbank lending market than among the hedge funds who were buying the credit risk from banks.  However, this summer's events have shattered some of these comforting assumptions. What has become clear in recent weeks is that banks' offloading of risks into the capital markets has not eliminated their vulnerability to a shock; on the contrary, although banks have shoved risk out through the ""front door"" (as evidenced in their published accounts), they have been re-acquiring it in other, indirect - or backdoor - ways.  One issue creating problems is that banks have been acquiring loans from each other, repackaged as new instruments via the capital markets. Thus as the value of subprime securities has fallen, for example, it has hurt not only the hedge funds and other non-bank institutions but the investment portfolios of banks too.  Another problem is that banks have been selling their credit risk to investment vehicles or conduits. Until recently, it was widely assumed that these were separated from the banks, because they raised finance in the capital markets. But the current crisis has forced banks to prop up these vehicles, by unexpectedly extending liquidity lines - meaning that risky assets are in effect moving back on to the banks' balance sheets again.  Worse still, as the market shock has spread, investors have started to lose confidence in techniques that have underpinned the ""originate and distribute"" model, such as securitisation (or the practice of taking loans and using these to issue bonds).  That, in turn, has made it impossible for banks to sell assets into the capital markets - such as loans to risky borrowers. ""Markets for a wide range of securities have de facto disappeared,"" says Marco Annunziata, chief analyst at Unicredit. The net result of this is that, to cope with an influx of assets, banks are scrambling to plump up the cash cushions they had let grow thin in recent years. In place of the ""originate and distribute"" model, in other words, a new pattern of ""re-intermediation"" is emerging, in which banks are again on the hook for risk. ""Re-intermediation by banks is a likely consequence of the current situation,"" note analysts at Dresdner Kleinwort Benson, who warn that this trend will ""stretch capitalisation and reduce returns on assets"" for most banks.  Some think this could herald a sea-change in 21st-century finance that would see banks returning to a much simpler business model instead of endlessly slicing and dicing risk. Others insist that the current pattern is simply a short-term response to a specific financial crisis that will quickly abate.  ""For financial innovation, there is no reverse gear,"" argues Moody's, the credit rating agency (and an institution that has greatly benefited from the securitisation trend in recent years). ""The old days of the bank-based intermediation system are gone. It is improbable that a dramatic reversal, a scaling backof securitisation and credit risk transfer will take place.""  But even if this second view is correct and the ""originate and distribute"" model is here to stay, the recent shocks are already forcing policymakers to rethink some of their approaches. This is likely to trigger some specific, micro-level reforms in the coming months: in the UK, for example, policymakers are scrambling to improve the system for protecting bank depositors from financial turmoil. While officials have been aware for several years that this system contained potential flaws - and had been mulling changes - efforts to reform it had not had much urgency before, precisely because a bank run was considered a low-risk event.  The events of recent weeks may also trigger a broader review, well beyond the UK, of the way regulators treat banks. Central bankers are already considering taking steps to force banks to prepare more effectively for liquidity shocks in their trading operations, for example, when a new set of rules about capital adequacy comes into force next year, known as Basel II.  Some policymakers also think pressure could grow for banks to hold more capital on their books against loans - even if they have sold on the credit risk. ""One of the things we will have to look at is whether we should require banks to hold more capital against stuff they have distributed off their books, but where there is a risk they may need to take this back on to their books for legal or reputational reasons,"" says David Dodge, governor of the Bank of Canada. A rethink is also looming about the treatment of off-balance-sheet vehicles. ""This is an area where there will definitely need to be a debate,"" admits one senior European financial official. Meanwhile, policy-makers of almost every hue are now united in calling for far greater transparency of complex finance. Or as Moody's notes: ""Looking forward, there will be ... a higher demand for capital and liquidity buffers throughout the financial system, which will marginally increase the cost of capital.""  Such measures will be disliked by bankers, who know that a tougher regulatory regime could make finance far less lucrative. But the longer the current market turmoil continues, the more the recriminations will grow - and, with them, the pressures for reform.  One thing is already clear: just as risk managers have spent the last decade discussing LTCM, the next 10 years will now be shaped by an equally intense debate about the lessons to be learnt from Northern Rock and the shock being felt by Mr Applegarth and others.  All at once, interest rates are on the turn  By Crhis Giles  In the space of two short months, financial turmoil in credit markets has blown apart the outlook for interest rates in the world's advanced economies.  Back in mid-July, economists and investors in money markets confidently expected interest rates to be on hold or to rise. The near-universal view was that the US Federal Reserve would hold its target for the Fed funds rate at 5.25 per cent, that the European Central Bank intended to raise its main refinancing rate by a quarter of a percentage point to 4.25 per cent in September, that the Bank of Japan would find sufficient grounds to push its interest rate up from 0.5 per cent and that the Bank of England was about to raise the price of money, also by a quarter point, to 6 per cent.  Now, the landscape is much changed, with interest rate rises seemingly off the agenda everywhere and central banks cutting rates or considering whether they should loosen monetary policy in response to the financial market upheavals.  In a period when central bankers have been unusually frank behind the scenes about each other's weaknesses in dealing with the chaos in money markets, they are now singing from the same hymn sheet on strategy. Everyone agrees that interest rates should be set low enough to guard against the market havoc having a knock-on effect on the real economy.  The view, plainly expressed by central bankers, is that they increasingly think there will be tangible effects on the economy. This is what led to Tuesday's rate cut in the US as well as a rethink of expected rate rises by other central banks.  Ben Bernanke, the Fed chairman, took the boldest action by cutting rates to 4.75 per cent and releasing a statement saying: ""Today's action is intended to help forestall some of the adverse effects on the broader economy that might otherwise arise from the disruptions in financial markets and to promote moderate growth over time.""  The same logic was apparent in Japan, the world's second largest economy, where the Bank of Japan held interest rates on Wednesday at 0.5 per cent despite a strong desire within the BoJ to restore rates to a more normal level. Toshihiko Fukui, the central bank's governor, warned of growing uncertainty in the global economy in the wake of the US subprime mortgage crisis and said: ""It is hard to see signs of improvement. The situation is still unstable.""  He added: ""There is no change in the need to adjust interest rates if the economy moves in line with our scenario.""  While most attention on the Bank of England on Wednesday was focused on its extraordinary U-turn in accepting lower quality collateral in return for central bank money - just days after insisting such action would sow the seeds of a future financial crisis - the minutes of its September rate-setting meeting were published. Looking at five possible ways the UK and global economies could be harmed by the financial market turmoil, the monetary policy committee said the issue was ""the extent to which developments in financial market intermediation would affect the wider economy and hence the outlook for inflation"". The MPC added that it was still too early to know the answer - but the heavy hint was that the market wobbles would reduce both economic growth and upward pressures on inflation, thus opening the door for interest rate cuts.  Jean-Claude Trichet, ECB president, made the same noises two weeks ago at his monthly press conference and, for the first time, did not raise interest rates the month after uttering the phrase ""strong vigilance"", the ECB's code for a coming rate rise.  Many will see the central banks' actions as tantamount to bailing out the risky decisions of the financial sector, but the policy-makers insist that they distinguish between action to ensure that growth does not slow unnecessarily and inflation does not slow too much on the one hand, and on the other their money market operations designed to ensure financial stability without bailing out banks.  Lower rates will by themselves mean a greater threat of inflation and there are plenty of reminders that such a risk remains serious: oil prices are at record highs, food prices are rising and China, manufacturer to the world, is suffering from an upward spiral in its costs.  The Fed acknowledged that inflation was far from dead when it said on Tuesday that its rate-setting Federal open market committee ""judges that some inflation risks remain, and it will continue to monitor inflation developments carefully"". Alan Greenspan, Mr Bernanke's predecessor as Fed chairman, has made similar points this week in interviews coinciding with the publication of his memoirs.  This threat of inflation was reflected in bond markets, where a concern was evident that the Fed favoured short-term growth over long-term inflation control. They reacted to the Fed's action by pricing higher inflation expectations into longer-term credits. The long US bond yield rose to 4.76 per cent, while gold rose to a 28-year high of $726.95 an ounce - a further pointer to concerns about the outlook for consumer prices, as the precious metal is seen as the ultimate protection against inflation.  Rising longer-term interest rates might also undermine the central banks' actions when they cut official rates, because these higher market rates offset the effect of the cheaper money lent at shorter maturities.  Two years ago, Mr Greenspan said a global conundrum existed because, however much the Fed raised rates, long-term market rates hardly budged, damping the effect of policymakers' actions. That conundrum might no longer exist but an equally large problem seems to have taken its place.  As central bankers ease monetary policy relative to expectations, investors are beginning to worry about inflation - boosting longer-term interest rates and mitigating the action the policymakers thought was necessary.

42,2007-09-18,2007-09-19,Financial Times (FT.Com),FT.com site : Wall Street continues to climb.,"Wall Street shares continued to surge on Wednesday following the Federal Reserve's decision to cut interest rates and were led higher by homebuilder and financial stocks.  Despite disappointing earnings news from Morgan Stanley relatively benign consumer price inflation data galvanised investor confidence as the S&P 500 rose to within 1.4 per cent of its all time high, set in July.  At midday the S&P 500 was 0.8 per cent higher at 1532.42. The Nasdaq Composite index put on 0.8 per cent to 2672.08 while the Dow added 0.7 per cent to 13832.30.  The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies saw particularly buoyant trading, climbing 1.6 per cent to 819.29.  News of a decision by the regulator for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the government-chartered companies which own or guarantee 40 per cent of US home loans, to allow them to buy more subprime mortgages, caused homebuilder stocks to surge.  The S&P homebuilder index jumped 7.5 per cent in early trading before settling 4.1 per cent higher at midday, despite more bad data on home construction starts.  Of the leading ten sectors, materials led the S&P500, reflecting renewed confidence in the construction sector. Energy stocks continued to attract buyers as oil remained at $81.32, just shy of its record high.  Consumer staples were flat, as traders bet against the possibility of a recession following the larger than anticipated interest rate cut.  ""The Fed's decision to cut both the fed funds rate and discount rate by 50 basis points and the fairly clear language offered by the FOMC statement were meaningful salves for equity markets,"" said Tobias Levkovich, chief US equity strategist at Citigroup. ""Specifically, 2 per cent surges are usually followed by strong markets in ensuing months.""  Mr Levkovich also said: ""We maintain our constructive view of equity markets for the next six to nine months and remain overweight the Financials,Consumer Discretionary, Technology and Energy sectors. In our minds, it seems late for defensive portfolio positioning though we suspect volatility is still likely to stay elevated.""  Morgan Stanley was the latest broker to report third-quarter earnings and posted a 7 per cent decline in third-quarter profit on continuing operations as it wrote down $940m in loans. The result was below that anticipated by the market.  John Mack, the bank's chief executive, said the quarterly performance reflected the ""impact of the severe market disruption on some areas of the firm, including our credit products, leveraged lending and quantitative strategies businesses.""  Morgan's shares fell 2.2 per cent to $67.80. The stock had climbed 5.5 per cent on Tuesday following news of the Federal Reserve decision.  Lehman Brothers on Tuesday surprised the market by posting a smaller than expected decline in earnings. Lehman's shares closed more than 10 per cent higher but at midday yesterday the stock was off 0.5 per cent.  Goldman Sachs and Bear Stearns report their results today and yesterday investors demonstrated a divergent views on the stocks. Goldman was trading 2.2 per cent higher at midday but Bear slid 2.5 per cent to $116.17.  In economic news home starts fell to their lowest level in 12 years, down 2.6 per cent in August. Building permits were also sharply lower, down 5.9 per cent to 1.31m, their lowest level since June 1995.  But the disappointing construction news was overshadowed by a decision by the Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight to relax restrictions on Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac's home-loan portfolios.  The move is planned to ""provide greater assistance to subprime borrowers and others who may have trouble refinancing their existing mortgages,"" James Lockhart, OFHEO director, said.  Consumer price inflation fell 0.1 per cent in August, the first time overall inflation has declined since October 2006. Core CPI, which strips out food and energy prices, rose 0.2 per cent, in line with analyst expectations.  ""The Fed has embraced the agenda that the credit story of August has given way to an economic story today.""said David Ader, bond strategist at RBS Greenwich Capital.  "

The S&P homebuilder index gained 7.5 per cent in early trade after the regulator for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the government-chartered companies which own or guarantee 40 per cent of US home loans, said it would allow them to increase their home loan portfolios.  After Wall Street's best day in more than four years on Tuesday, when the Federal Reserve cut interest rates by 0.5 per cent, the S&P 500 climbed again on Wednesday, up 0.9 per cent to 1533.11 in early trading, just 1.3 per cent off its all time high.

Morgan's shares lagged the market on Wednesday morning, edging 0.5 per cent higher to $68.87. The stock gained 5.5 per cent on Tuesday following news of the Federal Reserve decision.  Morgan's results follow third-quarter earnings news at Lehman Brothers, which on Tuesday surprised the market by posting a smaller than expected decline in earnings.  Lehman's shares closed more than 10 per cent higher on Tuesday and in early on Wednesday were trading 3.5 per cent higher. Goldman Sachs and Bear Stearns report their results on Thursday.  Elsewhere, General Mills, the cereal maker, increased profit by 8.2 per cent after it was able to offset cost increases by raising its prices. In the three months to August 26 net income increased from $266.9 million to $288.9 million while revenues grew 7.4 per cent to $3.07 billion.  Consumer price inflation fell 0.1 per cent in August, the first time overall inflation has declined since October 2006. Core CPI, which strips out food and energy prices, rose 0.2 per cent, in line with analyst expectations.  ""The Fed surprised with a unanimous vote for a 50 basis point cut and language that left the door open for more as necessary,"" said David Ader, bond strategist at RBS Greenwich Capital.

44,2006-01-31,2006-02-01,Financial Times,Prospect of more rate rises hits stocks WALL STREET.,"US stocks fell yesterday after investors interpreted comments that accompanied a widely expected quarter-point interest rate rise by the Federal Reserve to mean that the US central bank was not done with its cycle of monetary tightening. The Federal Open Market Committee raised its benchmark interest rate to 4.5 per cent and signalled in its accompanying statement that further interest rate rises might be implemented to keep inflation at bay. The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed down 0.3 per cent at 10,864.86 while the S&P 500 traded 0.4 per cent lower at 1,280.08. The Nasdaq Composite managed to recover most of its earlier losses however and ended the session one point lower at 2,305.82. Scott Wren, senior equity strategist at AG Edwards and Sons, said the statement was more vague than he expected. ""I find it disheartening that they would let economic data dictate what they would do with their (rate) policy,"" he said. ""You want the Fed to be proactive not reactive. By the time they get the data, it's already in the rear view mirror."" Along with the Fed statement, the market was also pondering renewed worries over decelerating earnings growth after Altria and Goodyear Tire &Rubber delivered mixed results. Goodyear was the session's worst perfomer, plunging more than 16 per cent to Dollars 15.64 after it delivered weaker-than-expected earnings for the fourth-quarter. The results prompted analysts at Deutsche Bank to cut their rating on the stock from ""hold"" to ""sell"", citing among other things, concerns over the persistence of high raw material costs. The news also prompted a run on fellow tyremaker Cooper Tire &Rubber, down 8 per cent at Dollars 14.99 Cigarette maker Altria and drugmaker Wyeth added to investors' disappointment. Altria, owner of Kraft Foods and Philip Morris International, fell 2.1 cent to Dollars 72.34 after its fourth-quarter earnings came in below analyst estimates. Although Wyeth swung into a fourth-quarter profit, the figure came in a little below market forecasts, causing its shares to fall 1.5 per cent to Dollars 46.25. On the upside, ailing drugmaker Merck said cost-cutting and strong demand for its asthma and cholesterol medicines helped push its fourth-quarter profit slightly higher to beat Wall Street forecasts. Its shares edged up 0.1 per cent to Dollars 34.50. Fellow drugmaker Sepracor surged 17.6 per centto Dollars 56.91 after it topped market expectations with its results. Elsewhere, Napster, the digital music company, shot up 25.3 per cent to Dollars 3.91following reports that Google might be looking to buy it in an attempt to develop its own online music service. Google, which reported its quarterly results after the close, rose 1.4 per cent to Dollars 432.66 "
45,2006-01-31,2006-02-01,Financial Times,Greenspan ends Fed era with final rise in rates.,"The US Federal Reserve yesterday raised interest rates another quarter point, a decision that brought to a close Alan Greenspan's long chairmanship of the central bank but not necessarily the campaign of rate increases. In its accompanying statement, the policymaking Federal Open Market Committee said ""some further policy firming may be needed"" to keep the outlook for sustainable growth and price stability in balance, dropping the reference to ""measured"" policy firming that was included in December. By changing the language in its statement, Fed policymakers were attempting to avoid the impression of committing Ben Bernanke, the new Fed chairman, to further increases, while signalling that further rate increases remained likely, depending on the economic data. The committee appeared to dismiss concerns about weak growth in the fourth quarter, saying: ""Although recent economic data have been uneven, the expansion in economic activity appears solid."" Maintaining its focus on inflation risks, it repeated the language from its December statement that while whole core inflation had stayed relatively low and inflation expectations were contained, ""possible increases in resource utilisation as well as elevated energy prices have the potential to add to inflation pressures"". ""Decisions now will be pretty much data driven, but the way they see the data at the moment suggests there will be more,"" said Peter Hooper, chief US economist at Deutsche Bank. Mr Bernanke will take over as Fed chairman today. Yesterday's was the 14th consecutive increase since June 2004 and brought the federal funds rate to 4.5 per cent. Market reaction was muted, as the change to the policy outlook was much as expected. In December, the Fed had altered its policy outlook for the first time during the tightening cycle, dropping the judgment that monetary policy remained accommodative and toning down the signal that further rate increases were pre-programmed. Futures markets suggest a high probability of another rate increase at the first meeting Mr Bernanke will chair, at the end of March. The federal funds rate is now virtually the same as the yield on two-year and 10-year Treasury notes. As well as reflecting expectations that inflation will remain under control, the flat yield curve suggests investors expect the Fed will have to cut the federal funds rate from its peak level by the end of this year. In his 18 1/2 years at the Fed, Mr Greenspan has chaired 155 FOMC meetings, including a small number of emergency meetings, and more than 1,000 meetings of the Federal Reserve board. "
46,2006-01-31,2006-02-01,Financial Times,Greenspan era ends in subdued fashion GLOBAL OVERVIEW.,"The end of the Greenspan era at the US Federal Reserve was marked yesterday by a subdued reaction to the tone of the central bank's latest statement on interest rate policy. There were no big surprises for investors to emerge from the last meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee to be overseen by chairman Alan Greenspan after 18 years at the helm of the bank. As Ben Bernanke prepared to take over as Fed chairman today, the central bank raised its benchmark Fed funds interest rate by25 basis points to 4.5 per cent. In the announcement of the rate rise, the Fed also dropped its long-standing reference to the likelihood of further ""measured"" rate increases. But shares on Wall Street eased a little after the announcement on the Fed's statement that ""some further policy firming may be needed to keep the risks to the attainment of both sustainable economic growth and price stability roughly in balance"". ""Core inflation has stayed relatively low in recent months and longer-term inflation expectations remain contained."" Some share investors appeared to have hoped for a more dovish statement with a clearer signal that rate rises were coming to an end. By midday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was0.15 per cent lower, the S&P 500 was 0.43 per cent weaker and the Nasdaq Composite was 0.31 per cent down. US treasuries were largely unchanged while the dollar pared early losses. Ian Shepherdson, chief US economist at High Frequency Economics, said Mr Greenspan ""did not leave behind an entirely blank canvas for Mr Bernanke"". ""The Fed's bias remains on the upside, given 'solid' but 'uneven' data. This is realistic; we think strong data will leave Mr Bernanke with no choice on March 28 (to raise rates at the FOMC's next meeting),"" he said. Mr Shepherdson said the ""best bet"" was still that the Fed would raise rates by 25 basis points at the March meeting and there was a ""real risk of more"". The transition overshadowed news of a rise in US consumer confidence to the highest levels in three years in January and weaker-than-expected manufacturing activity around Chicago. In Europe, the FTSE Eurofirst 300 index rose just 0.05 per cent to 1,319.57 in cautious trade. Credit Suisse warned yesterday that financial markets might be too complacent with its measures of risk appetite hitting a 20-year high last Friday. "
47,2006-01-31,2006-02-01,Financial Times,Treasuries receive fillip off Fed GOVERNMENT BONDS.,"US Treasury prices dipped and yields rose yesterday after the Federal Open Market Committee raised interest rates and left the door open for at least one more increase. Economists had unanimously predicted the quarter-point rate rise to 4.5 per cent at Alan Greenspan's last meeting as Fed chairman. Instead, their focus was on the wording of the FOMC's statement. The committee removed any reference to the need for further ""measured"" tightening, saying only that additional rate increases ""may be needed"". Analysts said the changes were consistent with giving Ben Bernanke, Mr Greenspan's successor, a free hand. ""The Fed has effectively left the March policy direction to be decided with the inclusion of Bernanke, while suggesting the potential for further rate hike(s),"" said analysts at Briefing.com. Data earlier in the day showed employment costs rising in line with expectations and strong consumer confidence. Shortly after the FOMC statement was released, two-year yields were up 2.1 basis points at 4.532 per cent and 10-year yields were 1.8bp higher at 4.549 per cent. Gilt prices pushed higher and yields lower amid mixed consumer data. UK house prices rose more than expected in January and mortgage approvals in December rose. Confederation of British Industry data suggested retail sales in January were unexpectedly weak. ""The mixed news indicates little chance of an imminent rate change,"" said James Knightley, analyst at ING Financial Markets. David Brown, chief European economist at Bear Stearns, said: ""The message from the weaker than expected CBI retail sales survey for January is lower interest rates in the near future."" In late trading, the yield on two-year gilts was down 0.4bp to 4.308 per cent and yields on the 10-year gilt fell 2.4bp to 4.148 per cent. Short-dated eurozone government bonds were lower as investors awaited the European Central Bank's interest rate decision on Thursday. Interest rates are widely expected to stay at 2.25 per cent. The yield on the two-year Schatz was down 1.1bp to 2.949 per cent but the 10-year Bund yield added 1.2bp to 3.468 per cent. The yield on the benchmark 10-year Japanese government bond rose 0.5bp to 1.560 per cent, responding cautiously to patchy rises in Japanese stocks. "

By mid-afternoon, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 0.2 per cent at 10,879.67 while the S&P 500 traded 0.5 per cent lower at 1,278.82. The Nasdaq Composite, already hurt by profit-taking in technology stocks, was off 0.3 per cent at 2,299.03. Christopher Johnson, director of quantitative analysis at Schaeffer's investment research, said the statement was largely expected. ""The Fed statement basically said that we are close to neutral at the moment and that economic data will dictate what they will do with their policy,"" he said. Meanwhile in the wider market, the earnings season continued with mixed results from Dow components Altria and Merck. Altria, owner of Kraft Foods and Philip Morris International, fell 1.6 cent to Dollars 72.73 after its fourth-quarter earnings came in below analyst estimates. Drugmaker Wyeth and tyremaker Goodyear Tire &Rubber also disappointed investors. Although Wyeth swung into a fourth-quarter profit, the figure came in a little below market forecasts. Its shares fell 2.9 per cent to Dollars 45.56. Goodyear plunged more than 16 per cent to Dollars 15.69 after it delivered weaker-than-expected earnings for the fourth-quarter. The results promptedanalysts at Deutsche Bank to cut their rating on the stock from ""hold"" to ""sell"", citing concerns over thepersistence of high raw material costs. On the upside, ailing drugmaker Merck said cost-cutting and strong demand for its asthma and cholesterol medicines helped push its fourth-quarter profit slightly higher to beat Wall Street forecasts. Its shares edged up 0.3 per cent to Dollars 34.56. Fellow drugmaker, Sepracor, surged 15.6 per centto Dollars 55.94 after it topped market expectations with its results. Elsewhere, Napster, the digital music company, shot up 21.5 per cent to Dollars 3.79following reports that Google might be looking to buy it in an attempt to develop its own online music service. Google, which is also due to report its quarterly results after the close, jumped 1.8 per cent to Dollars 434.42.

50,2006-01-31,2006-02-01,Financial Times (FT.Com),FT.com site : Overview: Wall Street mulls over interest rate rises.,"Wall Street stocks gained on Wednesday in spite of the prospect of further rises in US interest rates as investors put disappointing earnings from search engine Google into context. As Ben Bernanke was sworn in as chairman of the US Federal Reserve, there was speculation that the central bank would tighten monetary policy further than many investors had expected. This lifted the dollar against the euro and yen and weakened treasuries. However, a strong performance from Boeing, the aerospace group, pushed the Dow Jones Industrial Average 0.8 per cent higher. The S&P 500 rose 0.2 per cent, as did the Nasdaq Composite, in spite of a sharp fall in Google shares. After the Federal Open Market Committee raised its benchmark Fed funds rate by a quarter point to 4.5 per cent on Tuesday and warned that fresh rises ""may be needed"", some analysts indicated that the peak of the current cycle of monetary policy tightening might still be some way off. This was in spite of the release on Wednesday of firm but slightly weaker than expected data for manufacturing activity in January from the Institute for Supply Management. Ed Yardeni, strategist at Oak Associates, said: ""The Fed isn't done. I see two more 25 basis point hikes to 5.0 per cent over the next two FOMC meetings."" However, David Rosenberg, chief North American economist at Merrill Lynch, said: ""The current rate-hiking cycle is on its last legs, which is a good thing for financial assets in general."" Merrill Lynch pointed out that the cumulative 350 basis point rise in the Fed funds rate in the current cycle of increases represented ""the most intense tightening campaign in a quarter-century"". Many analysts are looking to the release on Friday of US payrolls data for January for signals of rate policy. Binit Patel, economist at Goldman Sachs, said that although job market conditions were expected to ease as the year progressed, his bank had forecast 300,000 additions to non-farm payrolls in January compared with a market consensus of about 240,000. Stephen Lewis, analyst at Monument Securities, said attention was now shifting to Mr Bernanke's testimony to Congress on February 15 amid speculation about how the new chairman would handle a crisis. ""The markets are already several hours into the post-Greenspan era and there have been no crises yet. Even so, a strong presumption is developing among investors that there will be a financial crisis soon, on the grounds that this is what usually happens early in the tenure of a Fed chairman,"" he said. ""There are not all that many observations on which to base such a generalisation."" Across the Atlantic, eurozone bond yields rose in line with US treasuries in spite of the release of weaker-than-expected manufacturing data for the region. The rise came amid speculation that the European Central Bank might signal an increase in its benchmark interest rate today from the current 2.25 per cent. European shares made solid gains on a flurry of takeover speculation, with the FTSE Eurofirst 300 index gaining 1.04 per cent to a fresh four-and-a-half-year high of 1,333.32. In London, the FTSE 100 index closed above 5,800 for the first time since June 2001. In Asia, Tokyo broke a six-day streak of gains with the Nikkei 225 Average falling 1 per cent to 16,480.09. Mumbai came within 6 points of hitting the 10,000 mark on the BSE 30 Index. "

As Ben Bernanke was sworn in as chairman of the US Federal Reserve, there was speculation that the central bank would tighten monetary policy further than many previously expected. This lifted the dollar against the euro and yen, weakened treasuries and restrained equities. By midday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 0.4 per cent at 10,913.13.

However, David Rosenberg, chief North American economist at Merrill Lynch, said: ""The current rate-hiking cycle is on its last legs, which is a good thing for financial assets in general and potentially spares the economic outlook from the vagaries of an inverted yield curve."" Merrill Lynch pointed out yesterday that the cumulative 350-basis-point rise in the Fed funds rate in the current cycle of increases represented ""the most intense tightening campaign in a quarter-century"". Many analysts are now looking to the release Friday's US employment data for January for signals of rate policy. Binit Patel, economist at Goldman Sachs, said that although job market conditions were expected to ease as the year progressed, his bank had forecast 300,000 additions to non-farm payrolls in January compared with a market consensus of about 240,000. Stephen Lewis, analyst at Monument Securities, said attention was now shifting to Mr Bernanke's testimony to Congress on February 15 amid speculation about how the new chairman would handle a crisis. ""The markets are already several hours into the post-Greenspan era and there have been no crises yet. Even so, a strong presumption is developing among investors that there will be a financial crisis soon, on the grounds that this is what usually happens early in the tenure of a Fed chairman,"" he said. ""There are not all that many observations on which to base such a generalisation."" Across the Atlantic, eurozone bond yields rose in line with US treasuries in spite of the release of weaker-than-expected manufacturing data for the region. The rise came amid speculation that the European Central Bank might signal an increase in its benchmark interest rate today from the current 2.25 per cent. European shares made solid gains on a flurry of takeover speculation, with the FTSE Eurofirst 300 index gaining 1 per cent to a fresh four-and-a-half-year high of 1333.32. In Asia, Tokyo broke a six-day streak of gains with the Nikkei 225 Average falling 1 per cent to 16,480.09. Mumbai came within 6 points of hitting the 10,000 mark on the BSE 30 Index "
52,2006-01-31,2006-02-01,Financial Times (FT.Com),FT.com site : Bernanke takes the helm at the Fed.,"Ben Bernanke took over on Wednesday as chairman of the Federal Reserve's board of governors and its policymaking Federal Open Market Committee. He is the 14th chairman since the US central bank's founding in 1913. A smooth transition is expected. Mr Bernanke, who was a Fed governor from 2002 until last summer, when he became chairman of President George W. Bush's Council of Economic Advisers, is a widely respected economist whose broad approach to policymaking is expected to be very similar to that of Alan Greenspan, who stood down on Tuesday. Mr Bernanke took the oath of office in the Fed's office at the start of the day, sworn in by Roger Ferguson, the Fed's vice-chairman. He has a four-year term as chairman and a 14-year term as a member of the board. Mr Greenspan, who chaired his last FOMC meeting on Tuesday, led the Fed for 18l years. Mr Bernanke has stressed the importance of continuity at the Fed - hardly surprising after the strong performance of the economy during his predecessor's long tenure - but also made clear at his confirmation hearings that he remained committed to introducing a more formal definition of the Fed's inflation objective. Rather than a radical change, that commitment can be seen as a continuation of the gradual shift to greater transparency at the Fed that has been gaining pace in recent years. On Tuesday the Fed raised interest rates for the 14th time by a quarter-point to 4.5 per cent. Its accompanying statement further toned down the language on the likelihood of further rate increases, to avoid the appearance of tying Mr Bernanke's hands. The committee noted that inflation pressures remained a concern and it judged that ""some further policy firming may be needed"" to keep growth and inflation in balance. Mr Bernanke will deliver testimony before Congress on February 15 on behalf of the FOMC and update lawmakers on the central bank's outlook, when he presents twice-yearly monetary report to Congress. He will chair his first FOMC meeting at the end of March, at which investors are pricing in a high probability of another quarter-point increase, expected to be the last in the long series of rate increases that started in 2004. However, a number of prominent forecasters expect strong growth in the economy and concerns about inflation to prompt a further rate increase in May. Fed policymakers shrug-ged off the slowdown in the economy in the fourth quarter and expect the it to continue to expand this year at close to its trend rate - commonly put at 3-3.5 per cent - following growth of 3.5 per cent for the whole of 2005. One of the key uncertainties in the outlook is the impact that signs of a slowing housing market might have on consumer spending. Futures market pricing and the flat yield curve suggests that investors expect the Fed to have to cut interest rates from their peak level by the end of this year. One question is whether Mr Bernanke will seek to address such expectations in his testimony in two weeks. In contrast to past tightening cycles, when the Fed was trying to slow the economy below its trend rate to reduce inflation, on this occasion the central bank described its strategy as seeking to return rates to a more normal footing. That objective follows the emergency action taken in the wake of the bursting of the stock market, the September 11 attacks, and other shocks that hit the economy, to keep inflation expectations contained. "
53,2006-01-31,2006-02-01,Financial Times (FT.Com),FT.com site : Market Insight: Bernanke faces early test.,"In his State of the Union address, President George W.?Bush spoke of the pre-eminence of the US economy. He did not mention the contribution to that status of Alan Greenspan, who the same evening stepped down after more than 18 years as chairman of the Federal Reserve. Perhaps Mr Bush thinks the Fed is bigger than any figurehead. The markets seem to share that view, so far. Reaction to Tuesday's rate rise by the Federal Open Market Committee was as measured as the steady upward march of short-term rates that began in June 2004. The message accompanying the FOMC's action surprised few, ensuring a smooth handover of the chairmanship to Ben Bernanke, who was sworn in yesterday morning. The FOMC removed its reference to the need for further ""measured"" tightening, and said additional increases ""may be needed"". They had previously been billed as ""likely"". ""What's the difference? Perhaps an implication that the Fed has less bias?.?.?.?and will investigate data that 'may' support additional tightening, or may not,"" said Barbara Rockefeller, president of Rockefeller Treasury Services. The game theorists say Mr Bernanke will have to raise rates at least once more when he chairs his first FOMC meeting on March 28 to establish credibility. Fed funds futures contracts are pricing in a better than even chance of that. Others are not so sure. ""A move at Mr Bernanke's first meeting?.?.?.?will not hinge on his desire to flash his anti-inflation credentials or his need to carry on what Alan Greenspan started,"" said David Rosenberg, North American economist at Merrill Lynch. ""Remember, this is the decision of an entire committee, and it would seem a 'wait and see' consensus has finally been cobbled together."" The debate over future rate increases is intensifying because most economists believe the Fed funds rate is now at or near a level that is neutral, neither stoking growth nor stifling it. That has allowed the FOMC to change its message in recent months, and - coincidentally - to leave Mr Bernanke with a relatively free hand. The flexibility only exists because the FOMC's next move is not obvious. This could mean Mr Bernanke's ability to build a consensus among committee members will be tested early. Whether rates go up again or not, he will have to convince the markets he has done the right thing. His views are documented, but Mr Bernanke's style at the Fed remains to be seen. Ed Yardeni, chief investment officer at Oak Associates in the US, noted the new chairman's background as a Princeton academic: ""That's the sort of job that requires herding rather than leadership skills. Mr Bernanke is likely to be more of a consensus builder than a domineering leader. I don't know if this will be good or bad. It will just be different from what we all are used to."" As for managing the market's expectations, early hints could emerge in a fortnight's time when Mr Bernanke is due to present the Fed's twice-yearly monetary policy report to the US Congress for the first time. The new Fed chairman is known to favour transparency in policymaking. But Mr Rosenberg at Merrill Lynch doubts that the Fed would make its thinking completely clear, even if it were inclined to hold rates steady. ""Bottom line as Fed policymaker is that you don't lay down your cards all at once,"" he said. ""The threat of another tightening is there, but not necessarily at the next meeting."" Maintaining the Fed's inflation-beating credibility will be a priority. Market confidence in the US central bank has helped damp volatility, keep longer-term bond yields low and shrink risk premiums on investments in equity and debt in the US and further afield. Kingsmill Bond, head of global emerging markets strategy at Deutsche Bank, sees no reason for that to change. ""Only time will tell, but the gradual increase in Fed Funds rates and low long-term yields have kept the external environment very supportive for emerging markets,"" he said. ""With the US economic growth outlook still solid, we see little risk of a marked change in this scenario under a Bernanke-led Fed."" "
54,2006-01-31,2006-02-01,Financial Times (FT.Com),FT.com site : Dollar gains as market eyes March rate rise.,"The US dollar rose on Wednesday as the market concluded that Tuesday's Federal Reserve statement increased the probability of a March interest rate increase. As expected, the Federal Open Market Committee raised US rates by a quarter of a point for the fourteenth consecutive meeting, taking rates to 4.5 per cent. The accompanying statement said that further tightening ""may be needed"". Although this was softer language than the phrase ""is likely to be needed"" that featured in the FOMC's December statement, the wording was taken to mean that the committee was minded to put into effect a further rate rise in March. The futures market is pricing in an 84 per cent probability of such an outcome. ""The new wording still implies a bias towards further tightening,"" said Paul Ashworth, economist at Capital Economics, although he still expected a housing-led slowdown to send rates sliding to 3 per cent by the end of 2007. Derek Halpenny, senior currency economist at Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ, was more hawkish: ""The FOMC erred on the side of tightening. We expect incoming economic data to justify not one but two 0.25 point increases before the FOMC decides to pause."" The dollar rose as high as $1.2075 to the euro, a cent above its level prior to the FOMC statement. However, the gains were pared on the release of soft US economic data. A slide in pending home sales in December to the lowest levels in two years allied to weak mortgage approvals revived fears over the state of the housing sector. The Institute for Supply Management's manufacturing index managed to combine a weaker headline reading with rising inflationary pressures, echoing last week's gross domestic product data. ""The cracks are starting to appear. Inflation numbers are a little bit on the high side but activity data is starting to show some weakness,"" said Ian Stannard, currency strategist at BNP Paribas. Mr Stannard believes the data remain consistent with one more rate rise, but he forecasts a cut by the end of the year, a view starting to be factored into the futures market. The dollar slipped back to $1.2087 to the euro by mid-session in New York trade and sat at Y117.92 to the yen, a gain of 0.9 per cent since the FOMC statement, and $1.7780 against sterling, a rise of 0.3 per cent. Sterling exhibited broad strength, rising 0.5 per cent to GBP0.6797 to the euro and 0.5 per cent to Y209.65 against the yen, a seven-week high. The pound was supported by talk of sterling-positive merger and acquisition flows, with Lloyds TSB and Unilever reportedly on the block, as well as a solid manufacturing survey. The Canadian dollar remained firm at C$1.1406 to the greenback, within 0.3 cents of the 14-year high it set late on Tuesday. With speculative positioning still unstretched, Mitul Kotecha, global head of FX strategy at Calyon, suggested the loonie, which has risen alongside commodity prices and Toronto's buoyant equity market, ""may continue to push higher over the short term"". He said the currency had outperformed weak natural gas prices in recent weeks, breaking a correlation that existed in 2005. ""With potential for some catch-up with the drop in natural gas prices, the Canadian dollar will look increasingly vulnerable over coming weeks."" The South Korean won hit another eight-year high of won957.3 to the dollar, despite a pull-back in Seoul's equity market, before slipping to won962 amid suspected central bank intervention. Inflation came in at 0.8 per cent month on month in January, leading HSBC to predict a Korean rate rise a week today, supporting its bullish view on the won. "
55,2006-01-31,2006-02-01,Financial Times (FT.Com),FT.com site : Dollar gains as market eyes March rate rise.,"The US dollar rose in European morning trade on Wednesday as Tuesday's Federal Reserve statement opened the door to a March rate rise. As widely expected, the Federal Open Market Committee raised US rates by a quarter of a point for the 14th straight meeting, taking short-term rates to 4.5 per cent. However most attention was on the accompanying statement, which said further tightening ""may be needed"". Although this was softer language than the phrase ""is likely to be needed"" that figured in the FOMC's December statement, the wording was taken as suggesting that the committee is minded to implement one further rate rise in March, with the futures market pricing in an 80 per cent probability of such an outcome, compared to 75 per cent prior to the statement. ""The new wording still implies a bias towards further tightening,"" said Paul Ashworth, economist at Capital Economics, although he still expected a housing-led slowdown to send rates spiralling to 3 per cent by the end of 2007. A more hawkish Derek Halpenny, senior currency economist at Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ, said: ""The FOMC erred on the side of tightening. We fully expect incoming economic data to justify not one but two 0.25-point increases before the FOMC decides to pause."" Such sentiment supported the dollar, which rallied to $1.2096 against the euro, 0.75c better than prior to the statement, Y117.51 against the yen, a rise of Y0.60, and $1.7763 against sterling, a gain of 0.7c. The greenback also firmed to C$1.1414 against the Canadian dollar, recovering from the fresh 14-year low of C$1.1379 it hit on Tuesday. With speculative positioning still unstretched, Mitul Kotecha, global head of FX strategy at Calyon, suggested the Canadian dollar, which has risen alongside commodity prices and Toronto's buoyant equity market, ""may continue to push higher over the short term"". However Mr Kotecha saw the loonie looking more vulnerable in the weeks ahead. ""One of the biggest drivers of the Canadian dollar over 2005 was natural gas prices, but the correlation with the currency has effectively collapsed over recent weeks, saving it from the negative influence of the sharp fall in natural gas prices recently,"" he said. ""With potential for some catch up with the drop in natural gas prices, the Canadian dollar will look increasingly vulnerable over coming weeks."" Elsewhere sterling made some gains on Wednesday as the UK's manufacturing purchasing managers' index ticked up from 51.3 in December to 51.7 in January, better than expected. Employment growth fell below the 50 break-even level, but rising output prices hinted at inflationary pressures, reducing the scope for looser monetary policy. In contrast, the equivalent measure for the eurozone missed expectations, dipping a fraction from December's reading. As such, the pound firmed 0.25p to GBP0.6809 against the euro and Y0.2 to Y208.75 against the yen. The South Korean won hit yet another eight-year high of Won957.3 to the dollar, despite a pullback in Seoul's equity market, before slipping back to Won962 amid suspected central bank intervention. Hans Redeker, head of currency strategy at BNP Paribas, said a 0.8 per cent month-on-month rise in consumer prices in January ""suggests that the central bank will remain focused on inflation, suggesting rates will move up keeping the won supported. We see further won upside potential against the dollar and the yen."" "

After initial losses, the blue-chip FTSE 100 moved 0.5 per cent higher to 5,789.7 as bid speculation surrounded high-street bank Lloyds TSB, with Spanish banking giant BBVA and Wells Fargo, Bank of America and Citigroup of the US named a possible suitors. BBVA refused to comment on the rumours, though traders noted a bid for LLoyds might might be a stretch for the bank currently looking to expand in the Italian market. Shares in Lloyds rose7.2 per cent to 546lp as talk suggested that such a bid could be priced at around 700p a share. The news lifted the wider financial services sector, rekindling expectations of consolidation in the industry. Barclays rose 2.5 per cent to 616p, HBOS was 1.1 per cent stronger at 999lp and Standard Chartered made gains of 2.1 per cent to GBP14.24. The mid-cap FTSE 250 ticked 0.1 per cent higher to 9,177.6. Overnight in New York, US investors were betting that the Federal Reserve's programme of rate tightening would not end with Alan Greenspan's tenure at the central bank. The Federal Open Market Committee raised its benchmark interest rate to 4.5 per cent and signalled that further interest rate rises might follow to counter inflationary pressure. The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed down 0.3 per cent at 10,864.86 while the S&P 500 traded 0.4 per cent lower at 1,280.08. The Nasdaq Composite managed to recover most of its earlier losses however and ended the session one point lower at 2,305.82. Back in London, bid speculation also surrounded Unilever, the consumer goods conglomerate, as its shares put on 2.4 per cent to 605p. Private equity firms were believed to be running the rule over the group, the attraction being that each of its assets could be sold in its own right - a potentially lucrative proposition. British Sky Broadcasting held gains throughout the morning, rising 1.8 per cent to 464.2p after it said 215,000 new customers signed up to its pay TV packages in the second quarter, taking its total subscriber number to 8.1m. The company said it remained on track to reach its target of 10m subscribers by the end of the decade. Analysts at Investec said they believed there was a high level of short interest in BSkyB, so shares could bounce nicely on theses ""decent"" figures, but warned well-known competitive issues were still there and Easynet and higher marketing cost downgrades were yet to happen. Upbeat broker comment from Commerzbank on Partygaming attracted investors to shares in the world's biggest online poker house, which rose 6 per cent to 136p. The mining sector reacted to the change in mood as its volatile run continued. Xstrata was 3 per cent firmer at GBP16.24 and Antofagasta rose 2 per cent to GBP20.77. Rio Tinto put on 1.7 per cent at GBP29.15 There were further significant losses for Cable &Wireless, down 6.1 per cent to 96p, as brokers digested Tuesday's profit warning and news of a root and branch restructuring at the alternative telecoms provider. Deutsche Bank lowered its from 127p to 90p on the stock, saying they saw little likelihood in the short term of a prospective takeover. "

59,1994-03-22,1994-03-23,Financial Times,LONDON STOCK EXCHANGE - EQUITY FUTURES AND OPTIONS TRADING.,"A squeeze in stock index futures at the close of trading enlivened what had been an erratic session in derivatives. The late rally in futures fuelled strong buying of the underling FT-SE 100 Index ahead of the close of the stock market, writes Joel Kibazo. The June contract on the FT-SE 100 closed at 3,211, which was about 2 points ahead of its fair value premium to cash of 10 points, with the strong finish attributed to a late advance in UK gilts. Volume at the official close was 10,275 lots. Bonds had also been firmer earlier in the day when June opened at 3,208, and good buying drove the contract to the day's peak of 3,229. However, a bout of nervous trading ahead of the US Federal Open Market Committee meeting saw June surrender early gains and it fell to a low of 3,183 in the early afternoon. In Liffe FT-SE Mid-250, June traded 97 contracts and it closed at 3,850. The screen showed no turnover in the same contract on the OMLX. In Liffe traded options, turnover improved to 43,697 contracts ahead of today's expiry of the March stock options. Volume in the FT-SE 100 option was 17,973 lots and 2,594 in the Euro FT-SE option. Bid speculation made Argyll Group the busiest stock option with a total of 4,530 lots. (c) The Financial Times Limited 1994. "
60,1994-03-22,1994-03-23,Financial Times,GOVERNMENT BONDS - US TREASURIES JUMP AS FED NUDGES RATES HIGHER.,"US Treasury bond prices jumped yesterday afternoon amid relief that the Federal Reserve had ended weeks of anticipation by signalling a small increase in short-term interest rates. Late in the session, the benchmark 30-year government bond was 1 1/32 higher at 92 11/32, with the yield easing by about 10 basis points to 6.853%. At the short end, the two-year note was 7/32 better at 99 11/32, to yield 4.948%. The rally, especially at the short end of the yield curve, was surprising. It suggested that the market had already factored a rate increase into bond prices. News of the move came in a mid-afternoon announcement by the Fed that its policy-making Federal Open Market Committee had decided to increase 'slightly' reserves in the banking system. Analysts interpreted the statement as an indication that the FOMC had voted to lift its target for the Federal Funds rate by 25 basis points to 3.50%. Early on, bond traders were content to remain on the sidelines until the Fed made clear its intentions. Prices across the yield curve were showing moderate improvement in light trading before the announcement. The reaction to the Fed's decision was immediate. Institutional investors poured money into the market, suggesting that yields, after moving markedly higher over the past few weeks, were attractive at current levels. The results of the Treasury's auction of $17bn in new two-year notes suggested as much. The offering, which was awarded at 5.15% only minutes before the Fed's move, drew good demand even though confusion over monetary policy still reigned. European government bond markets pared their gains yesterday afternoon following early indications that the US Fed might leave monetary policy unchanged. Analysts had been surprised by the Fed's lack of action in the morning session, since most traders had expected it to sanction a rise of a quarter-point in the Fed funds rate to 3.5%. The lack of a morning move by the Fed extended the markets' long vigil for evidence that European bonds were in the process of de-coupling from the US market. Analysts said that if the Fed had left monetary policy unchanged, it would have been easier for the Bundesbank to cut its repo rate today. The market had expected the Bundesbank to lower the rate by up to eight basis points from 5.88%. UK gilts generally outperformed other European government bond markets, supported by hopes of favourable inflation data for February due to be released today. The market expects a monthly rise of 0.4% in the retail prices index, bringing the annual rate, excluding mortgages, down to 2.6% from 2.8% in January. Media reports of a Gallup poll showing consumer confidence at a four-year low also supported gilt prices since the findings kept hopes of a further cut in interest rates alive. The June long gilt future on Liffe traded at 109 in the late afternoon, up 17/32 on the day, off the day's high of 109 31/32 but well up on the worst level of 109 5/32. Analysts expressed disappointment at the size of the Bank of England's first floating-rate gilt for 15 years. They had been confident that the novelty value of the issue would encourage the Bank to set the amount at between #3bn to #3.5bn. However, the Bank chose to raise only #2.5bn, indicating to the market that it was comfortable with its funding programme. The other terms of the issue were in line with market expectations - a minimum price of 99.50, a coupon of three-month Libid less 1/8 point and a five-year maturity. German government bond prices see-sawed after news of the Fed's inaction. The June bund future on Liffe stood just under a half-point higher at 96.45 in the late afternoon, below the day's high of 96.60 but off the low of 95.84. (c) The Financial Times Limited 1994. "
61,1994-03-22,1994-03-23,Financial Times,MARKETS REPORT - FED LIFTS INTEREST RATES.,"The US Federal Reserve yesterday confirmed US interest rates are on a gradual upward path when it tightened monetary policy for the second time in two months, writes Philip Gawith. The Fed did not specify the extent of the move, but it was taken for granted in the market that the announcement involves a 25 basis points increase in the federal funds rate, to 3.50%. This follows a similar rise to 3.25% on February 4th. The tightening had been largely discounted in the market and there was little reaction. The dollar rose just over half a pfennig to trade at DM 1.6870 from DM 1.68 before the announcement. It was little changed against the yen hovering at the Y 106 level. Mr Alan Greenspan, chairman, said the Fed's policy-making Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) had decided to increase pressure on bank reserves in order to raise interest rates. 'This action is expected to be associated with a small increase in short-term money market interest rates,' said Mr Greenspan. The announcement was made after the FOMC meeting at 19h20 GMT. Attention will now switch to the Bundesbank which is today expected to announce a further cut in its repo rate. The combination of a rise in US rates and a lowering of German rates could well give the dollar a significant upward lift. In the UK, meanwhile, the release of the February retail price index is keenly awaited. Some observers believe a good number could trigger a cut in interest rates, but this is a minority view. Mr Steve Hannah, head of research at IBJ International, said the Fed's action 'confirms that Greenspan is still in a gradualist mode. The strong implication is that it is a 25 basis point increase in the fed funds rate, not an increase in the (more significant) discount rate.' Mr Hannah said the nature of the Fed's move also 'adds a degree of predictability about the timing of Fed interest rate moves. This could help the markets to settle down a bit.' The February 4th tightening - the first increase in US rates in five years - sent financial markets into turmoil with bond yields rising sharply in all western countries. For the second time in a row the central bank acted after an FOMC meeting, in the process also showing that it was not responding to specific economic data. The IBJ analyst described the Fed's move as 'not so much tightening as normalising on a gradualist path.' Mr Greenspan made clear in February that he felt real interest rates had fallen to abnormally low levels. The timing of the move caught the market slightly off-guard. Earlier in the day the Fed had, in its normal open market operations, added reserves with two-day system repos which suggested no change in monetary policy. This led many to believe that the Fed would not act until today. The dollar continues to be wrapped in bearish sentiment. With last night's Fed tightening already in the market, one view was that the fate of the dollar was more in the hands of the Bundesbank than the Fed. Mr Avinash Persaud, head of currency research at JP Morgan (Europe), commented: 'What really matters is if the Fed can tighten in tandem with a Bundesbank move. That is the only thing that will lend significance to a 25 basis point Fed tightening.' Ahead of the Fed announcement, the D-Mark was firmer across the board in Europe. It closed at FFr 3.418 from FFr 3.407 on Monday against the French franc. Analysts warned that if the Bundesbank did not quicken the pace of monetary easing, the steady weakening over the past week of the franc could continue. The Bundesbank announced it was holding another variable rate repo. The lowest bid accepted last week was 5.88%, a reduction of six basis points in the repo rate. Analysts are predicting a fall of up to ten basis points. Overnight rates firmed slightly, from 5.70/5.80% to 5.80/5.90 ahead of the repo, but analysts doubted whether this would have any adverse effect. Ms Phyllis Reed, European bond strategist at BZW, noted that the mid-point of the overnight rate was still below the repo rate and this normally favoured a larger drop in the repo rate. 'Banks tend to be quite ambitious on the bidding,' she said. Last week the overnight rate fell to the repo rate level only at the time of the auction. Sterling finished more than a pfennig weaker against the D-Mark, closing in London at DM 2.5094 from DM 2.5205. Traders said the UK currency was being affected by speculation about an interest rate cut. Mr Robin Marshall, chief economist at Chase Manhattan, warned there was a danger of a rate cut backfiring. If it upsets the gilts market, this will put upward pressure on mortgage rates. In the discount market the Bank of England dispatched a shortage of #750m without difficulty. Sterling futures firmed slightly with the June contract a basis point up at 94.85. (c) The Financial Times Limited 1994. "
62,1994-03-22,1994-03-23,Financial Times,WORLD STOCK MARKETS (EUROPE) - BOURSES MARK TIME AWAITING US NEWS.,"European equity markets marked time yesterday in advance of the decision by the US Federal Reserve's policy-making body, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), to raise the federal funds rate by from 3.25 to 3.50%, as they watched for clues from Washington. Before the close of trading on European bourses the only guidance available was that the committee was still reviewing economic conditions and had not yet discussed the direction it wanted to set for interest rates over the coming eight-week period. FRANKFURT consolidated its position with a day's gain in the Dax index of 10.06 to 2,141.34, but off from the session high of 2,155.31. Traders said that a weakening in the futures market contributed to the easing. Turnover was modest at DM 7.6bn. The banking sector attracted attention with further results due out in the next couple of weeks. James Capel, in a research note issued on Monday, noted that its forecasts for 1994-95 had been shaded down for two main reasons. It said: 'We have probably been too optimistic for the pace of recovery in terms of lending growth and falling bad debts.' The note added: 'This years trading profits have been adversely affected by the markets' reaction to the trend reversal in US interest rates'. Bayerishe Hypo, which pleased the market with results yesterday, added DM 1.50 to DM 469, while Bayerishe Vereinsbank, results due later this week, gained DM 2 to DM 491. Volkswagen, up DM 3.50 at DM 490.50, strengthened on hopes of good 1993 figures due tomorrow. ZURICH finished higher as domestic institutional buyers returned at current lower prices but the day's best levels were not maintained. The SMI index rose 20.4 to 2,824.7, after a high of 2,843.3. Ciba registered rose SwFr 40 to SwFr 855: the company has filed an application with the US Food and Drug Administration to produce a rival to Glaxo's Zantac anti-ulcer drug. Nestle, with results due this week put on SwFr 21 to SwFr 1,241. Sandoz, with results scheduled for tomorrow, rose SwFr 50 to SwFr 3,920 amid suggestions that the introduction of its Lescol cholesterol drug could spark a price war in the US. Georg Fischer rose SwFr 50 to SwFr 1,310: the mechanical engineering group said it expected to break even in this year after a 1993 loss of SwFr 34m. Holderbank rose SwFr 3 to SwFr 963 in response to its 12.3% rise in 1993 net profit. PARIS fell back from its session high in a volatile session, the CAC-40 index finally closing down 2.01 at 2,200.68. The index moved between a high of 2,222.52 and a low of 2,196.12. BNP, which the government said would have its stake in UAP cut from 19% to 15% as part of the insurers privatisation, lost FFr 2.70 to FFr 251.80. UAP was unchanged at FFr 189.90. AMSTERDAM drifted down, with the AEX index losing 1.91 to 414.33. Pakhoed, the storage and transport group, which repeated its forecast that 1994 earnings per share were set to rise, lost Fl 1.50 to Fl 53.80. In a separate development PTT, the Dutch post and telephone utility, announced that its first tranche of shares could be floated on June 7. MILAN was steady, helped by the positive early tone in other European markets and having found technical support at Monday's lower levels. The Comit index edged 0.34 lower to 664.68 as election uncertainties remained at the centre of attention. Industrials led the way. Fiat rose L61 to L4,999, Pirelli L58 to L2,431 and Montedison L43 to L1,238. Olivetti put on L65 to L2,593 as hopes remained high for a swift decision on Italy's second mobile telephone licence. ISTANBUL fell 4.8%, wiping out Monday's gains, in uncertain trade ahead of Monday's local elections. The composite index lost 747.76 to 14,838. The elections are viewed as a key test of whether Prime Minister Tansu Ciller's coalition government can be trusted to tackle the looming economic crisis. Analysts agree that the election will be followed by sharp price rises as the government relaxes restraints on loss making state run companies, but observers are divided on what effect the polls will have on financial markets, hit by a plunging lira and soaring interest rates.

63,1994-03-22,1994-03-23,Financial Times,WORLD STOCK MARKETS (AMERICA) - STOCKS REACT CALMLY TO FOMC RISE IN RATE.,"Wall Street US stocks reacted with relative calm yesterday to a signal by the Federal Reserve that it had decided to nudge up short-term interest rates, writes Frank McGurty in New York. The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished 2.30 lower to 3,862.55, after jumping about seven points on the Fed's announcement that its policy-making committee had voted to add reserves to the banking system. Analysts said the statement was an indication that the central bank was lifting its target for the federal funds rate for the second time in two months. Other important market indices also showed little change on the day, defying forecasts of a sharp downturn on the news of a rate increase. The more broadly based Standard and Poor's 500 was 0.26 better at 468.80, while the American SE composite inched 0.96 ahead to 471.73. The Nasdaq composite slipped 0.95 to 796.35. NYSE volume, at 282m shares, was moderate. Advancing issues led declines, 1,015 to 929. Investors were tentative as the market opened, as attention was fixed on a policy meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee in Washington. Most analysts were expecting the members of FOMC to vote for a further tightening. But the morning brought no indication of a shift to tighter money, and blue-chip stocks, in parallel with bonds, moved moderately higher in early trading. The Fed's announcement finally came during the mid-afternoon and the reaction was immediate. In the bond market, prices across the yield curve jumped amid relief that the long-anticipated Fed action had finally come to pass. Stocks also improved, but the upturn was more modest and short-lived. By the close, the Dow industrials were barely changed on the day. Among individual issues, Alcoa added $1 1/2 to $78 3/8 and Disney was up $5/8 to $46 3/4, but Philip Morris lost $1 7/8 to $52 1/8 on news of a congressional recommendation to raise federal taxes on cigarettes. In pharmaceuticals, Merck dropped $1 5/8 to $30 1/2 on reports that its cholesterol-reducing drug would soon face competition from a cheaper product from Sandoz. Bristol-Myers Squibb, down $1 1/2 to $53 1/8, was also hit hard by the news. On the Nasdaq, investors showed a lack of confidence in Novell's decision to mount a challenge to Microsoft's dominance of the market for personal computer software. The stock slumped $3 3/4 to $20. Mexico Mexican stock prices rallied sharply after Mr Manuel Camacho Solis announced he would not run for the president, putting to rest speculation that has rattled the bolsa in recent weeks. The key IPC index of 36 leading shares gained 128.91 points or 5.41% to end at 2,511.92. It was the biggest one-day percentage rise since January 1991. Canada Toronto stocks closed higher in moderate trading. The TSE-300 composite index was up 28.38 points, or 0.63%, to 4,551.88, with advances edging declines 424 to 423. Volume rose to 67.28m shares from 62.36 shares. Trading value was C$706.8m. (c) The Financial Times Limited 1994. "
64,1994-03-22,1994-03-23,Financial Times,"LONDON STOCK EXCHANGE - FOOTSIE 3,200 MARK CHALLENGED IN NERVOUS TRADE - MARKET REPORT.","A highly-charged session saw the UK stock market struggle to hold on to the 3,200 mark on the FT-SE Index as it closed just ahead of the US Federal Reserve's decision to signal a modest rise in short-term interest rates. In mid-afternoon, the London stock market plunged sharply to a new trading low for the year of 3,186.9 in the face of a sell-off in stock index futures. The market was dominated throughout the day by the prospects for the meeting of the Federal Reserve's Open Market Committee (FOMC). London closed a few minutes ahead of the Federal Reserve's actions in the US money markets, and UK analysts were left to ponder the implications overnight. The session opened strongly, with UK government bonds leading equities ahead and interest rate confidence heartened in Europe by the Bundesbank announcement of another variable rate money market repos tender today. UK company news also continued to help sentiment, as Prudential, the UK life and general insurance group, joined the list of leading British companies to increase its dividend payment; but the Prudential share price became a casualty of the market setback later in the day. Although trading volume was unimpressive at this stage, the Footsie climbed by more than 22 points and the market appeared confident in spite of the uncertainty ahead of the FOMC meeting. But the stock market was halted in its tracks and then driven sharply downwards when the June futures contract on the Footsie ran into trouble. Although selling of the contract, still in its early days, was not heavy, the price quickly fell through the 3,200 mark and took the underlying stock market with it. Traders suspected that futures selling came from securities houses suddenly nervous ahead of the FOMC meeting. The stock market fell into important support territory before rallying, once again taking its lead from the stock index futures sector. Concern was expressed at the evident power of derivatives markets to influence the underlying stock market. In part, this reflected the lack of volume and nervousness in equities while bond markets remain so fickle. The FT-SE Index struggled back into positive territory to close at 3,201.5, a net gain of 3.5 on the day. London traders were then left on the sidelines to watch the response of the US credit markets to the Federal Reserve's actions which, it was then clear, were likely to lead to an early tightening in credit policies in the US. The FT-SE Mid 250 Index followed the market trend, ending the day with a loss of 1.4 at 3,853.1. Seaq volume picked up in the second half of the session to record a total of 678m shares, a third higher than on Monday, when retail business in equities was worth #1.19bn. The retail number, the most significant guide to genuine investment activity in the stock market, was at the lower end of daily averages for the past twelve months. While some Far Eastern stocks rebounded strongly behind the 4% upturn in the Hong Kong market, the rest of the UK market was unable to escape from the shadow cast ahead of the FOMC meeting. The erratic performance from bond markets over the past week has underlined the dependence of equities on the interest rate drama currently being acted out in Europe and the US.

67,2001-08-21,2001-08-22,Financial Times (FT.Com),US leaders prepare for budget battle.,"US leaders were on Tuesday positioning themselves for the final battle over the budget in the autumn and with an eye to next year's congressional elections. President George W. Bush, speaking in Independence, Missouri - home of late President Harry Truman - said a budget report due out on Wednesday would show ""in plain terms"" that the shrinking US budget surplus was still large enough to protect the Social Security and Medicare trust funds, and meet his priorities for education and defence. ""Our budget is in strong financial shape despite an economic slowdown that began last year,"" he said. Harry Truman, he said, had been ""a plainspoken fellow ... who brought a lot of wisdom to Washington"". Not coincidentally, perhaps, it is the image Mr Bush is seeking to project as he vacations at his Texas ranch for a month, flying to other US destinations for occasional speeches in which he refers to Washington DC as if it were a foreign country. But on Wednesday in Washington, the president's Office of Management and the Budget is to issue a mid-session budget review, containing estimates of the extent to which revenues have lagged behind projections made earlier this year. Preparing the ground for bad news, the president warned that ""inevitably, the slowing economy has resulted in slowing tax revenues, lower corporate profits and in some cases, layoffs"". But to loud applause, he said the federal budget would have the second-largest surplus in history ""because this administration took immediate action to address the downturn"". He did not mention that the surplus consisted almost entirely of Social Security funds. Democrats, who have launched their own assault on his tax and budget policies this week, were quick to respond. Gene Sperling, former Clinton economic adviser, noted in a telephone briefing on Tuesday that the Bush administration had originally tendered no plan to distribute tax returns this year, but had only agreed at the last minute to a Democratic proposal for economic stimulus. Congressman Richard Gephardt, the House Democratic leader, called the speech ""an exercise in public relations, pure and simple"". The OMB report would demonstrate that the tax cut had left no funds for other priorities. He went blamed the Bush tax cut for ""wiping out the surplus"" - although the only piece of it implemented so far is in the refund cheques proposed by the Democrats. The president, meanwhile, warned Congress to adhere to fiscal responsibility and not to attempt ""appropriation gamesmanship. I'm going to be watching carefully for the last-minute budget additions,"" he said. Mr Bush also said he would make sure Congress did not use the Social Security funds for the general budget, but to pay down $100bn of the US debt. The full text of the Federal Open Market Committee statement 'The Federal Open Market Committee at its meeting today decided to lower its target for the Federal funds rate by 25 basis points to 3.5 per cent. In a related action, the Board of Governors approved a 25 basis point reduction in the discount rate to 3 per cent. Today's action by the FOMC brings the decline in the target federal funds rate since the beginning of the year to 300 basis points. Household demand has been sustained, but business profits and capital spending continue to weaken and growth abroad is slowing, weighing on the US economy. The associated easing of pressures on labour and product markets is expected to keep inflation contained. Although long-term prospects for productivity growth and the economy remain favourable, the Committee continues to believe that against the background of its long-run goals of price stability and sustainable economic growth and of the information currently available, the risks are weighted mainly toward conditions that may generate economic weakness in the foreseeable future.'. "
68,2001-08-21,2001-08-22,Financial Times (FT.Com),Old economy shares boost Dow.,"After an early stumble, US equities gathered steam on Wednesday and posted gains with old economy stocks lifting the market. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 102.78 to 10,276.90 while the S&P 500 index added 8.05 to 1,165.31. The Nasdaq Composite gained 28.72 to 1,860.02. The Federal open market committee's decision to cut short-term interest rates by 25 basis points on Tuesday was fully anticipated by Wall Street. Investors, however, showed their disappointment with the Fed's grim economic outlook earlier in the day by selling into the news. Sentiment picked up by midday with momentum helping to push technology stocks into positive territory. But uncertainty remained firmly in place as investors chose to gravitate towards defensive stocks such as energy and capital goods. ExxonMobil helped bolster the Dow, up 0.8 per cent to $40.71. Chevron and Texaco tacked on gains, up 1.65 per cent to $91.95 and 1.1 per cent to $70.09, respectively. GM was the one of the leading Dow components, up 2.7 per cent to $57.20, after the carmaker said it expected to top Wall Street's third-quarter revenue targets and meet its sales expectations for the rest of the year. Other Dow leaders included Philip Morris, up 0.5 per cent to $45.62, and United Technologies, up 1.4 per cent to $72.85. ""There's a lack of [positive] earnings news so the money is going into defensive areas like food and tobacco and coming out of techs and telecoms,"" said David Memmott, trader at Morgan Stanley. Technology stocks were mixed with software companies drifting lower while semiconductors received a boost from positive comments on semiconductor orders by a trade group. The Philadelphia Semiconductor index rose 5 per cent while shares in Intel, the world's biggest chipmaker, tacked on 3.3 per cent to $27.96 to be the leading Dow mover. Microsoft was down 0.2 per cent to $60.66 while Cisco System reversed course to end up 3 per cent higher at $16.48. Intuit jumped 22.4 per cent to $36.04 after the software maker reported earnings that beat Wall Street expectations. The company was also lifted by a ratings upgrade from Prudential Securities. Shares in AOL Time Warner fell 1 per cent to $39.50 after the company announced 1,700 job cuts as part of a reorganisation of its online division. "
69,2001-08-21,2001-08-22,Financial Times (FT.Com),US investors return to buying but tech remains hesitant.,"US stocks tentatively rose in early trading but jitters remained a day after the Federal Reserve's negative comments on the economy. By midsession, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 60.90 to 10,235.04 while the S&P 500 index rose 4.17 to 1,161.43. The Nasdaq Composite gained 4.26 to 1,835.56. The Federal open market committee's decision to cut short-term interest rates by 25 basis points on Tuesday was fully anticipated by Wall Street. Investors, however, were disappointed by the Fed's grim economic outlook, which said that weakness persists in the US and abroad. Investors fled for conservative stocks, with energy and capital goods leading the gains. ExxonMobil helped bolster the Dow, up 1.7 per cent to $41.06. Chevron and Texaco also tacked on gains, up 2.5 per cent to $92.68 and 2 per cent to $79.63, respectively. General Motors led Dow components, up 3 per cent to $57.42, after the automaker said it expects to top Wall Street's third-quarter revenue targets and meet its sales expectations for the rest of the year. Other Dow leaders included Philip Morris, up 1 per cent to $45.90, and United Technologies, up 1.2 per cent to $72.76. ""There's a lack of [positive] earnings news so the money is going into defensive areas like food and tobacco and coming out of techs and telecoms,"" said David Memmott, trader at Morgan Stanley. Technology stocks were mixed, with software and networking companies drifting lower, while semiconductors received a boost from positive comments by a semiconductor trade group. Semiconductor Equipment and Materials International said orders for chipmakers rose to $764m in July from $727.5m the previous month. Book orders also improved with companies receiving $67 worth of new orders for every $100 of products shipped for the month. The Philadelphia Semiconductor index rose 2.65 per cent while shares in Intel, the world's biggest chipmaker, tacked on 1.2 per cent to $27.40.

70,1989-11-14,1989-11-15,Financial Times,World Stock Markets (America): Decline accelerates after car data,"Wall Street THE EQUITY market struggled to remain steady throughout yesterday's session, but finally buckled under the weight of weak economic data, a late downturn in the bond market and general apathy, writes Janet Bush in New York. The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed 16.18 points lower at 2,610.25 on sluggish volume of 143m shares. The index had closed 0.82 points higher on Monday at 2,626.43. Selling was encouraged in the afternoon, as the futures market reacted to early November car sales, which were the weakest for more than two years. For most of this year, the equity market has reacted positively to soft economic data, because of the hope of lower interest rates, but weak statistics are now regarded negatively. A substantial number of people in the market are worried about recession. The Dow rallied only briefly after the morning's economic reports. Industrial production fell 0.7 per cent in October, a much larger fall than expected. However, much of the drop was due to the Boeing strike and production disruptions after the California earthquake, particularly in the computer industry. The US Federal Reserve said production would have been little changed, had it not been for these special factors. Retail sales fell 1 per cent last month, in line with expectations based on already published weak statistics for car sales in October. Excluding cars, retail sales rose 0.2 per cent. The Federal Open Market Committee, which sets the Fed's target for Fed Funds, met yesterday and the central bank's open market operations were watched carefully. The Fed had been expected to drain reserves from the banking system, with Fed Funds trading some way below 8 1/2 per cent - believed to be the Fed's new target since its easing move last week. However, the Fed refrained from operating in the market when Fed Funds were trading at 8 3/8 per cent, suggesting to some a measure of tolerance for this level. It is difficult to tell exactly where the Fed wants Funds to trade on the basis of one day's market operation, however, and some felt the lack of operation was purely technical. This talk had little impact on equities, although late softness in long-dated Treasuries, after a weaker-than-expected 30-year auction, did undermine prices late in the afternoon. Among featured stocks was Microsoft, which dropped Dollars 1 5/8 to Dollars 86 1/2 , reversing some of its Dollars 3 5/8 gain in over-the-counter trading on Monday. That advance had been on rumours of an agreement with IBM on a joint venture. Once this agreement had been announced late on Monday, traders started taking profits. IBM was unchanged at Dollars 98. Philip Morris fell Dollars 1 3/8 to Dollars 40 7/8 on expectations that Senator Ted Kennedy would introduce a Bill in Congress today which would impose stricter labelling requirements for cigarettes and take other measures to limit smoking. J C Penney added Dollars 1/8 to Dollars 66 7/8 after reporting third-quarter earnings of Dollars 1.65 a share - better than analysts had expected. Longview Fibre rose Dollars 2 1/8 to Dollars 68 1/2 after the company said that it had raised its quarterly dividend by 20 per cent and planned a five-for-one stock split.

71,1999-06-30,1999-07-01,Financial Times,THE AMERICAS - Greenspan shifts bias to neutral - FEDERAL RESERVE INTEREST RATE RISE.,"For the second straight meeting of the Federal Reserve's policy-making open market committee, it was not what the central bankers chose to do immediately with interest rates but what they hinted they might do in the future that had most impact on financial markets. Yesterday's quarter point increase in the committee's target for the Fed funds rate had been so widely flagged in advance of the meeting that only a financial hermit can have been surprised by it. However, the Fed's decision to change, and to announce the change, in its inelegantly named ""inter-meeting policy directive"" - the bias that indicates which way policy-makers are leaning for future policy - was a welcome shock, at least for stock and bond holders. Having adopted a ""tightening bias"" at the May meeting - the first clear signal that a rate rise was coming - the committee members, led by Alan Greenspan, the chairman, yesterday shifted the bias back to neutral. This reflected, in their words, that the balance of risks to the economy was now even. Money markets have been discounting for the last few weeks not just yesterday's rate rise but at least one, and possibly two more later this year. The expectation was that, aware that markets were anticipating those further tightenings, the Fed would maintain its policy bias in favour of raising rates. However, yesterday's gear-shift casts more than just a little doubt now on whether, in fact, Mr Greenspan and the Fed will go much further in the coming months. ""It's one and he's done!"" as Richard Yamarone, senior economist at Argus Research, a consultancy in New York, put it. Some keen observers of the Fed cautioned against over-confidence, in the veiled world of central bank semiotics, that this was indeed the Fed's intentions. When the Fed raised interest rates in 1994-5, and again in 1997, on each occasion when it went into the relevant meeting with a tightening bias, it shifted the bias back to neutral after the rate rise Yet that did not stop the committee from voting to raise rates again at the subsequent meeting. The explanation for that approach, according to Fed insiders, was that, a reversion to neutrality was self-prescribing. Since they can, in principle, choose to raise interest rates by as much as they like, the committee members must, by definition, feel they had put policy on an even keel when they changed rates. To raise rates and maintain a tightening bias might indicate the Fed was not convinced it had raised rates by enough - an odd position to be in. However, the difference with yesterday's change is that it was announced immediately. Last December, in a genuflection towards greater glasnost at the Fed, the FOMC members decided that they would, in future, sometimes announce a bias change immediately, rather than wait for the publication of the meeting's minutes, six weeks or more hence. And it is this ""sometimes"" that is so important in understanding yesterday's announcement. According to the minutes of that meeting last year, the FOMC decided it would announce changes ""on those occasions when it wanted to communicate to the public a major shift in its views about the balance of risks or the likely direction of future policy"". Such announcements would not be made after every change in the symmetry of the directive but only when it seemed important for the public to be aware of an important shift in the members' views."" It could hardly be clearer. Yesterday's decision to publicise the change in bias must have been made with that paragraph at the forefront of members' minds. If the change in directive had merely been a piece of semantic, internal housecleaning, it could hardly have been deemed important enough to be announced. Of course, notwithstanding all this Kremlinology, the shift in the bias does not guarantee the Fed will not raise rates at its next meeting. If the economic data in the next seven weeks shows any renewed signs of inflation, the Fed will almost certainly tighten policy, whatever its predisposition. However, yesterday's surprise move, greeted euphorically by financial markets, and with good reason, almost certainly indicates the Fed is much less predisposed to raise rates than almost anyone had suspected.

72,1999-06-30,1999-07-01,Financial Times,Fed raises interest rates to 5%.,"The Federal Reserve yesterday raised US short-term interest rates for the first time in more than two years in an effort to take some heat out of the pace of economic growth - but hinted it was in no hurry to put rates up again soon. The central bank's policy-making open market committee lifted the target for its key short-term lending instrument - the fed funds rate - by a quarter of a percentage point to 5 per cent, the first increase since March 1997. The increase had been widely signalled by Fed officials, most notably Alan Greenspan, the chairman, and was no surprise to financial markets. But policymakers sweetened the pill with an announcement that they were shifting their policy bias - their view on the likely next move in rates - back to neutral from a bias towards tightening which was adopted at the May committee meeting. Stock and bond prices rose sharply on the news. The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed up 155.45 points, or 1.4 per cent, at 10,970, reversing a loss of 50 points before the Fed announcement. The benchmark 30-year US Treasury bond jumped more than a point, and the yield slid to 5.97 per cent, against Tuesday's closing yield of 6.07 per cent. In a statement, the central bank indicated the rate increase had been driven mainly by a return to normality in domestic and international financial markets after the global crisis of the last year, which prompted the central bank to cut rates by 0.75 percentage points in two months. But the decision to accompany yesterday's rate increase with a reversion to a neutral bias hinted that the Fed saw no pressing reason to go further than the one increase and raise rates again in the immediate future. ""Owing to the uncertain resolution of the balance of conflicting forces in the economy going forward, the FOMC has chosen to adopt a directive that includes no predilection about near-term policy action,"" the statement said. It added that the Fed ""in the current dynamic environment must be especially alert to the emergence, or potential emergence, of inflationary forces that could undermine economic growth."" ""The Fed is saying it still has a very slight bias towards raising rates. But basically, this was a big surprise and a buy signal for the markets,"" said Jim O'Sullivan, economist at J.P. Morgan, the investment bank, in New York. The US economy has grown at an annual rate of 4 per cent or more for the last three years. Some Fed officials, including Mr Greenspan, believe the rapid growth has been in part the result of a radical improvement in the long-term potential of the US economy, but they do not believe such a rate of growth can be sustained without a resurgence of inflation. Most analysts had expected the Fed to signal its readiness to raise rates again. Yesterday's decision to drop that stance does not mean the central bank will not raise rates again, but suggests policymakers may be confident the economy will slow of its own accord.

73,1999-06-30,1999-07-01,Financial Times,LEADER - US interest rates.,"The US Federal Reserve's decision to raise interest rates by a quarter of a percentage point comes as no surprise. It will do little to slow domestic demand. Yet it marks a shift in Fed policy, and a significant change in the international economy. At the height of the international crisis last autumn, as US financial markets seized up, the Fed cut interest rates in three steps by a total of 0.75 percentage points. The Fed's injection of liquidity, together with the strength of US consumer demand, helped the financial storm to blow itself out. Since then the US has continued to grow at above a 4 per cent annual rate, and the euro-zone now shows encouraging signs. Moreover, there has even been some - perhaps temporary - good news from Japan. And developing Asia is recovering too. With the world on the mend, the Fed is now turning its attention back to domestic matters. It is doing so carefully. Having prepared the ground by signalling a bias towards tightening in May, the Federal Open Market Committee has followed up with a cautious quarter point increase. Inflation remains subdued. But Alan Greenspan, Fed chairman, has made it clear that pre-emptive action is needed to stop growing imbalances in the economy from sparking off inflation. The OECD forecasts US growth of 3.6 per cent this year. But domestic demand has been growing at a 7 per cent rate, much faster than domestic supply. Weakness in the international economy - and the US's growing current account deficit - have so far kept domestic inflation under control. But a weaker dollar, as the world recovers, would renew inflationary pressures. Moreover, with unemployment at 4.2 per cent, a thirty year low, the drying up of the labour pool risks re-igniting inflation. One quarter-point increase will do little to slow domestic demand growth. For now, the Fed is relying on the bond market to do that. Long term interest rates - which dipped below 5 per cent last autumn - are back above 6 per cent, tightening credit conditions throughout the economy. The Fed has judged that shifting back a little from its emergency footing is enough for now. It reinforced this point by announcing a ""neutral bias"" in monetary policy in the near future. If this approach was influenced by concerns over upsetting an equity market where valuations look stretched, this was a mistake. It is not the central bank's role to target asset prices. Rather, its job is to head off inflation and sustain the US economy's remarkable expansion. The Fed has left itself more work to do. Copyright Financial Times Limited 1999. All Rights Reserved.

74,1999-06-30,1999-07-01,Financial Times,CURRENCIES &MONEY - Fed funds rate rise leaves dollar cold.,"The US dollar initially weakened on the foreign currency markets after the Federal Reserve nudged interest rates 25 basis points higher yesterday, but tempered the increase by returning to a neutral bias. The Fed said while US labour markets were tight, productivity gains had contained inflation. Despite the return to a neutral bias, the committee said it would remain alert to inflationary pressures. A rally in US bonds and stocks immediately after the decision failed to translate into dollar strength and the US currency was weaker against the euro and the yen in New York trading. The Fed's decision divided analysts over its longer-term impact. ""By encouraging a rally in bond markets and avoiding alarm in the equity markets, this move should be good for the dollar,"" said Paul Chertkow, head of global currency research at Tokyo-Mitsubishi. But Robert Lynch, currency analyst at Paribas in New York, said most of the good news was now priced into the dollar. The Fed's decision overshadowed signs of recovery in one of Europe's most sickly economies, with Italian gross domestic product data beating expectations. But the euro failed to take heart, closing the London session down at $1.031 against the dollar. Analysts said the accumulation of positive economic data could prevent the euro declining to parity with the dollar. ""From German GDP to the latest Insee survey, there are signs that things are turning around,"" said Avinash Persaud, global head of research at State Street. * The yen once again strayed perilously close to the intervention danger zone yesterday, lifted by rising Japanese bond yields. Reports in the Japanese press that new bond issuance would be necessary to fund support for bank depositors provided an initial boost for JGB yields. Comments from Masaru Hayami, Bank of Japan governor, that the zero interest rate policy could not last forever, gave added momentum to the move, taking yields to their highest level in three months. The yen rose in sympathy, pushing the dollar back below Y121 and the euro under Y125. Paul Chertkow, head of global currency research at Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi, said rises in JGB yields could further push the yen upwards. He added the market may also have been emboldened by a belief that the BoJ would not intervene until after the FOMC meet, but said official resolve to prevent a rising yen damaging Japanese stocks should keep the dollar above Y120. * Although yesterday's widely expected Fed decision took US interest rates above those in Canada and Australia, only sterling has so far been singled out for punishment. Though still uncomfortably strong against the euro, the pound has recently slipped below its two-year trading range against the dollar in expectation that rates would cross over. Meanwhile the Australian and Canadian dollars, whose official rates were at 4.75 per cent at the time of the Fed decision, have remained relatively resilient. Analysts said this disparity was partly due to the near-unanimous decision by the Bank of England's monetary policy committee in favour of the latest rate cut. With UK inflation undershooting its target last month and sterling strong, most believe it will be some time before the MPC follows the Fed. By contrast, said Mark Cliffe, chief economist at ING Barings, Canada is more likely to be carried along by further US rises. ""Though not expected to follow through immediately on rates, the latest GDP figures show the economy in robust form,"" he said. Analysts said stronger commodity prices had also enabled the Australian and Canadian dollars to withstand interest rate pressure. But others were more mystified that sterling alone had suffered. ""Interest rate futures markets have been pricing in a cross over in UK and US interest rates since the start of the year,"" said Michael Metcalfe, currency analyst at NatWest GFM. ""Given that UK rates have clearly troughed and the economy continues to gather momentum, the move in sterling is hard to justify."" * In late afternoon in New York, the dollar was trading at Y121.21 to the yen and at $1.0346 to the euro.

75,1999-06-30,1999-07-01,Financial Times,STOCK MARKETS LONDON STOCK EXCHANGE - Footsie closes off best ahead of interest rate news.,"A promising start to yester-day's London trading soon gave way to another dose of uncertainty as investors preferred to sit out the final session of the second quarter. At the finish of a rather tense, but generally thinly traded session, the FTSE 100 index closed 11.4 ahead at 6,318.5. During the previous two sessions the index gave up 128.3 or 2 per cent as London became increasingly uneasy over the prospect of a rise in US rates. There were no such fireworks in the FTSE 250, 6.8 firmer at 5,858.2, or the FTSE SmallCap, 0.6 off at 2,650.6. Dealers said it was no surprise that the institutions refused to trade ahead of the decision by the US Federal Reserve's open market committee on whether to raise interest rates. Before the announcement last night, observers said a 25 basis points increase in US rates had already been priced into Wall Street. There was no further support for London as Wall Street opened yesterday, however, with the recent upsurge by the Dow Jones Industrial Average halted by growing unease ahead of the FOMC result. Overnight, the US market had delivered another stunning performance, the Dow registering its second consecutive three-figure gain, following up Monday's 103-point rise with a 160-point upsurge, for a two-day gain of 263 or 2.5 per cent. And that performance saw the FTSE 100 make rapid early progress and record a 64.5 gain before running out of steam and slipping all the way back into negative ter-ritory just before midday. There was more switching activity being carried out by the big tracker funds to accommodate Vodafone AirTouch's increased weighting in the FTSE 100, which involved the institutions adjusting weightings across the rest of the index via a series of programme trades. Turnover in Vodafone AirTouch was 51m shares - around 4.5 per cent of the overall market total which reached a hefty 1.16bn. It was also inflated by renewed heavy trading in Asda, where Dresdner Kleinwort Benson, acting for Wal-Mart, continued to mop up Asda shares. Turnover in Asda was 75m shares, or 6.5 per cent of the total. The resumption of the tennis at Wimbledon, after Tuesday's washout, and the involvement of the two leading UK players, provided a substantial diversion. The big winner in the FTSE 100 was Bass, whose shares were top of the FTSE 100 table on the view that the Bass/Punch Taverns offer for Allied Domecq's pubs business might still emerge victorious despite Whitbread's statement that it is planning to up its bid. Mining stocks in the FTSE 100, Anglo American, Billiton and Rio Tinto, also progressed after the surprise news that Phelps Dodge, the big mining group, is cutting its US copper output, hard on the heels of a similar move by BHP last week. There was plenty of bid action in the minnows to keep the speculators happy; bid news was behind the spectacular gains in Euclidian, the Lloyds insurance group, which attracted a management buy-out and Hicking Pentecost, where Coats Viyella trumped the existing US offer.

Stocks had traded cautiously early in the session, on the second day of the Federal Reserve's open market committee meeting. With expectations of a Fed tightening already priced into the psychology of many US investors, the 25 basis point rise in the Fed funds rate to 5 per cent came as no surprise. However, a concern remains that the Fed will need to take more drastic action in the near future. Declining shares only slightly outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a margin of 14 to 13. The Dow Jones Industrial Average gave some ground early in the session after Tuesday's broad rally that sent the blue-chip index 160 points higher. But shortly after news of the rate rise came,the Dow was trading 101.63 higher at 10,916.98 and the broader Standard &Poor's 500 index was 9.15 ahead at 1,360.60. Earlier, high-tech shares had traded lower, with the Nasdaq composite down 5.46 to 2,636.65. There was more life in the small company sector where the Russell 2000 index was up 1.17 to 455.25.

79,2005-11-01,2005-11-02,Financial Times,Yields rise on inflation concerns GOVERNMENT BONDS.,"Government bond prices fell and yields rose round the world yesterday as the US Federal Reserve lifted rates for the 12th consecutive time and markets digested positive economic news and concerns about inflation. US Treasuries initially staged a modest rally after the Federal Open Market Committee confirmed a widely expected interest rate increase, but ended lower. The quarter-point hike took the Fed funds rate to 4 per cent, and the committee's statement left the door open for further increases at a ""measured"" pace. ""They are likely to raise rates at both the December and January meetings, given their positive outlook for growth and concern about inflation,"" said James Knightley, economist at ING Financial Markets. Earlier, the Institute for Supply Management's manufacturing index for October was reported at 59.1, at the high end of expectations. The data also showed signs of inflation. ""For markets, the biggest story is the large increase in prices paid in the last three months, from 48.5 in July to a stunning 84 in the latest month,"" said Alan Ruskin, research director at the 4Cast consultancy. Yields on 10-year Treasuries were up 1.6 basis points at 4.575 per cent late yesterday, still below recent seven-month highs that broke through 4.59 per cent. Two-year yields rose by 3.3bp to 4.419 per cent. Eurozone government bond yields also rose as the Purchasing Managers' Index of European manufacturing activity showed modest gains in October. The report increased the chances the European Central Bank might raise interest rates. ""The ongoing improvement in the manufacturing sector in the eurozone will only help to encourage the hawks on the ECB,"" said analysts at ING.

US Treasury yields rose after the Federal Open Market Committee raised interest rates by 25 basis points to 4 per cent. The 12th consecutive quarter-point rise in the Fed funds rate was widely expected. The Fed indicated that it would continue to raise interest rates at a ""measured"" pace, leaving the door open for further rate rises. ""They are likely to raise rates at both the December and January meetings given their positive outlook for growth and concern about inflation,"" said James Knightley, economist at ING Financial Markets.

81,2005-11-01,2005-11-02,Financial Times,Fed highlights inflation fears as rates rise.,"The Federal Reserve yesterday pushed its target interest rate up to 4 per cent, highlighted concerns about inflation and said it expected to continue tightening monetary policy. The policymaking Federal Open Market Committee repeated its judgment that, following the increase, monetary policy still remained accommodative and said it expected to continue raising rates at a ""measured"" pace. It was the twelfth consecutive quarter point rate increase, stretching back to June of last year. Financial market reaction was limited after a decision that was widely expected, with a slight drop in bond prices and rises in stocks and the dollar. The Fed said that high energy prices and hurricane-related disruptions had temporarily depressed output and employment. ""Monetary policy accommodation, coupled with robust underlying growth in productivity, is providing ongoing support to economic activity that will likely be augmented by planned rebuilding in the hurricane-affected areas,"" the FOMC statement said. It again highlighted inflation risks, saying the ""cumulative rise in energy and other costs have the potential to add to inflation pressures"" while adding that core inflation and longer-term inflation expectations remained contained. The stress on cumulative energy price increases adds to the impression that a chief concern is a potential pass-through to core inflation after a sustained climb in the oil price. The impact on core inflation has been limited to date. But the 2 per cent rise in the Fed's preferred measure of core inflation in the two months to September is already at the top of the 1-2 per cent ""comfort range"" popularised by former Fed governor Ben Bernanke. Mr Bernanke has been nominated to replace Alan Greenspan as Fed chairman. There will be two more meetings of the FOMC, in December and January, before Mr Greenspan is scheduled to step down. The Fed's vote to raise interest rates and signal its intention of continuing to raise rates came in a unanimous vote. While some Fed policymakers think the notion of removing policy accommodation is stale, the current outlook retains majority support among the committee. At 4 per cent, the federal funds rate is no longer obviously a long way below the so-called ""neutral"" level where monetary policy neither restricts nor stimulates the economy. The Fed has maintained the same language as it has raised its target rate by 300 basis points from 1 per cent. Adding to recent data backing the Fed's view that the expansion remains strong the Institute for Supply Management said its index of manufacturing activity remained upbeat. Respondents said that production, new orders and employment rose. But the prices paid index rose from 84 from 78 in September as energy costs jumped. Separately, the Commerce Department said that construction spending rose 0.5 per cent in September to a new record level of an annualised Dollars 1,120bn, led by increased residential spending. "
82,2005-11-01,2005-11-02,Financial Times (FT.Com),FT.com site : Eurozone bond yields hit 15-month high.,"Short-dated eurozone government bonds fell on Wednesday, pushing yields to a 15-month high amid rising expectations for the first interest rate hike in more than two years. The European Central Bank is expected to leave interest rates unchanged at 2 per cent for the 29th consecutive month today, but rising expectations that the first rate hike will come before the end of the year or early in 2006 have pushed yields higher. The yield on the two-year Schatz yield rose 4bp to 2.462 per cent, its highest level since late July last year. The 10-year bund yield rose 5.4bp to 3.462 per cent, the highest level since late April this year. A report showing German unemployment falling in October for the forth month in five supported the view that the ECB's neutral stance on interest rates was about to come to an end. Investors will pay close attention to ECB chairman Jean-Claude Trichet's comments at today's press conference for any hints about the bank's view on inflation. US Treasury bonds were mixed, after yields tested seven-month highs and then retreated. Selling continued early on in the wake of Tuesday's quarter-point rate hike by the Federal Open Market Committee, helped by stronger economic news and weak government bond prices in Europe. But the move reversed after the Treasury said it would sell $44bn of debt in its quarterly auctions next week. Officials said the department would sell $18bn of three-year notes on Tuesday, $13bn of five-year notes on Wednesday, and $13bn of 10-year paper on Thursday. The Treasury also said it would sell 30-year bonds on February 9 next year for the first time since October 2001. Traders were also cautious ahead of Thursday's Congressional testimony by Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve, and Friday's key monthly employment report. Yields on 10-year notes tested March highs of about 4.63 per cent before falling back to 4.577 per cent late Friday morning, up 0.8 basis points on the day. The 30-year bond yield was at 4.764 per cent, 0.3bp higher, while the two-year yield was 0.4bp lower at 4.411 per cent. The yield on the benchmark Japanese government ten-year bond slipped 1bp on Wednesday to 1.565 per cent, as dip buyers returned to the market after two days of bond price falls. Longer-dated bonds continued their recent volatility. The 30-year yield fell 4.5bp to a four-month low of 2.340 per cent. "
83,2003-10-28,2003-10-29,Financial Times,Words and deeds THE LEX COLUMN.,"The Federal Reserve had no reason to change interest rates and saw no reason to change its statement significantly. Its view on the balance of risks to growth and inflation/ disinflation remains a fair reflection of the fundamentals. But, as encouraging data continue to accumulate, the policy stance will only become harder to explain. Questions about the recovery's sustainability next year have not gone away. As the Fed noted in the one tweak in its statement, the labour market appears to be stabilising. But employment and wage growth will be required to sustain household spending as the impact of tax cuts and mortgage refinancing fades. Meanwhile, there are positive signs of business confidence - including the flurry of mergers and acquisitions activity - but we await hard evidence of strong business demand. Part of the problem is the lack of business pricing power. The core consumer price index fell to a multi-year low in September. With unemployment above 6 per cent and capacity utilisation below 75 per cent, there is plenty of slack. The Fed's repeated judgment that the risk of disinflation will be the predominant concern for the foreseeable future and that policy accommodation can be maintained for a considerable period is reasonable. Yet the market is pricing in more than 100 basis points of tightening next year. Defining a range for inflation that the FOMC considers consistent with price stability remains the common sense option that Greenspan &Co resist. That would allow market participants to focus on data rather than rhetoric. As it is, the rhetoric suggests there is value at the short end of the curve but actions speak louder than words.

84,2003-10-28,2003-10-29,Financial Times,Fed keeps rates steady and holds line on inflation.,"The US Federal Reserve left interest rates on hold at 1 per cent yesterday and signalled that the strong growth over the summer had not caused it to shift its signals about future rate movements. The decision to keep rates on hold was almost universally expected. But most attention focused on the statement that the Fed's open market committee released with the decision, which was almost unchanged from previous meetings, defying speculation that the Fed might begin to soften its commitment to holding rates at a low level. The statement maintained the stance taken by the committee in previous meetings that the potential damage from too-low inflation was its predominant concern and that the risks surrounding inflation continued to be on the downside. It also retained the wording used at the previous two meetings that ""policy accommodation can be maintained for a considerable period"", suggesting that the Fed wanted to see more evidence of sustained growth and inflationary pressure before it started signalling future rises in interest rates. The one change in the statement was a tentative acknowledgement of the stronger performance seen from the US jobs market over the past month, following the increase in payroll jobs in September and subsequent falls in new claims for jobless benefits. While the Fed's previous statement in September said that the labour market had been weakening, yesterday's said it ""appears to be stabilising"". Long-term interest rates, which had been drifting up after the release of encouraging economic data in the run-up to yesterday's meeting, reversed after the announcement. The dollar slid as the prospect of lower rates on US assets hurt the currency. Earlier, the dollar had set a fresh three-year low against the yen in Asian trading. Data released before the meeting suggested that the prospects for capital spending and consumption were both good. Durable goods orders rose 0.8 per cent in September, below many economists' forecasts. But orders data for August, which had shown a 1.1 per cent drop, were revised to show a drop of just 0.1 per cent, suggesting there was more underlying strength in investment than previously thought. The durable goods orders raised hopes that business investment, for so long the missing element of the recovery, was at last showing sustained strength. Non-defence capital goods, which are often seen as a proxy for business investment, rose 3.9 per cent last month. A regular survey of consumer sentiment by the Conference Board showed an unexpectedly strong improvement, with the report's headline index rising to 81.1 in October from a revised 77 the previous month. Markets, Page 28 Wall Street gains, Page 30 For continuing reaction to the FOMC decision, see www.ft.com/markets Europe outlook brightens Europe's fragile recovery showed signs of picking up speed yesterday with a key German business confidence indicator improving for the sixth month running in October, writes Tony Major in Frankfurt.The Ifo economic institute said its German business climate index had jumped to its highest level since February 2001, driven partly by a brighter assessment of current economic conditions. The rise coincided with improvements in business sentiment in Belgium and the Netherlands, although in Italy confidence slipped for the second month in a row. The findings were hailed by Otmar Issing, European Central Bank chief economist, as pointers to stronger growth in the second half of the year. US Edition 1. "

87,2005-06-30,2005-07-01,Financial Times,Fed more confident as it increases rates again - QUARTER-POINT RISE.,"The Federal Reserve gave a more confident pronouncement on the growth outlook and again highlighted inflation concerns yesterday, raising interest rates another quarter-point to 3 1/4 per cent and signalling more to come. The policymaking Federal open market committee's closely watched language was unchanged as the committee agreed its ninth consecutive rate increase since it started raising rates the federal funds rate a year ago. In its accompanying statement, the Fed said that following its action, monetary policy remained ""accommodative"" and that the committee expected to continue to raise rates at a ""measured"" pace - commonly taken to mean quarter-point increments. The central bank strongly suggested it would raise rates again at its August meeting, and gave no hint that it was considering a pause in its tightening campaign soon after that. ""Although energy prices have risen further, the expansion remains firm and labour market conditions continue to improve gradually,"" the FOMC said. This was a slightly stronger statement on the growth outlook than at its May meeting, when the committee noted that spending growth had slowed somewhat. ""Pressures on inflation have stayed elevated, but longer-term inflation expectations remain well contained,"" the committee said, maintaining its focus on inflation risks while implicitly acknowledging some better recent inflation data. In May, the statement had referred to inflation pressures that had picked up in recent months. ""The message was consistent with what we have heard from Fed speakers - that there are at least a few more rate increases to go,"" said Peter Hooper, chief US economist at Deutsche Bank. ""They did not want to encourage the view that they are almost done."" The stock, bond and currency markets offered only muted reactions to the statement. Futures markets anticipate a 3.75 per cent Fed funds rate at year-end. The low level of market-determined long-term interest rates, and the booming housing market, have added to the Fed's resolve to continue raising the federal funds rate. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note is below 4 per cent, compared with 4.7 per cent a year ago. Data published by the Commerce Department yesterday, before the Federal Reserve's announcement, showed US consumer spending was a little weaker than expected in May. Spending was flat on the previous month - compared with Wall Street forecasts of 0.1 per cent rise - while income growth also slowed. The core personal consumption expenditures index - the Fed's preferred inflation measure, which excludes volatile food and energy items - rose 0.2 per cent in May. In the 12 months to May, the core PCE index has risen 1.6 per cent, in line with the FOMC members' consensus forecast from earlier in the year: that core inflation would remain in a range of 1 1/2-1 3/4 per cent this year and next. Policymakers, who updated their forecasts at their two-day meeting, have said recently they expect growth to continue at the economy's trend rate, regardless of some recent weaker indicators, and in spite of the high oil price. While they will react to changes in the outlook, they are not overly concerned with volatility in the monthly data. "
88,2005-06-30,2005-07-01,Financial Times (FT.Com),FT.com site : Dollar hits 13-month highs vs sterling and euro.,"The dollar spiked to new highs on Friday as buoyant data on the US manufacturing sector added to expectations of more rate rises to come from the Federal Reserve. The greenback surged 1.1 per cent to a 13-month high of $1.1958 against the euro, breaking through a stubbornly defended technical barrier at $1.20, after trading flat for most of the week. The dollar also jumped 0.8 per cent to an 11-month high of Y111.64 against the yen - a week-on-week gain of 2.2 per cent - 1.1 per cent to a 13-month high of $1.7705 against sterling - a weekly rise of 2.9 per cent - and 1.4 per cent to C$1.2416 against the Canadian dollar. The dollar's spike was prompted by strong US data, with the Institute of Supply Management's manufacturing index rising to 53.8 in June, well above the breakeven 50 level, when the market had been braced for a repeat of May's 51.4 reading. Michigan's consumer sentiment index also trumped expectations. ""This shows that the weakest link in the economy is showing signs of improvement now,"" said Michael Woolfolk, senior currency strategist at Bank of New York. However, Mr Woolfolk was among those arguing that the underyling rationale for the dollar's renewed rally was Thursday's comments from the Federal open market committee. As widely expected, the FOMC raised rates to 3.25 per cent, its ninth straight quarter-point hike. But in its accompanying statement the committee said monetary policy remained ""accommodative"" and that it expected to continue to raise rates at a ""measured"" pace. It added that ""expansion remains firm and labour market conditions continue to improve gradually,"" despite higher energy prices. The statement wrongfooted those who had been expecting signs of an imminent pause in tightening, with hawks such as Mr Woolfolk now arguing that US rates could rise to 4.25 per cent by the year-end. This contrasts sharply with a deteriorating yield environment elsewhere, particularly in the UK where speculation over a possible August rate cut intensified in the wake of this week's weak retail sales and economic growth data. With sterling-bears now anticipating two UK rate cuts by December, US rates could soon be higher than those in the UK for the first time since January 2001 - a daunting prospect for a currency that has largely owed its strength to a high underlying yield. ""Rate sentiment has turned around and may the Lord help sterling if rates cross over and are higher in the US. It would be goodnight London then,"" said David Bloom, currency analyst at HSBC, who saw scope for the pound to fall to the low $1.60s. Against this backdrop, sterling fell 1.9 per cent over the week to GBP0.6751 against the euro, hitting a one-month low of GBP0.6798 yesterday, 0.7 per cent to Y197.67 against the yen and 1.3 per cent to SFr2.2940 versus the Swiss franc. This led Tony Norfield, global head of forex strategy at ABN Amro, to argue that most of the bad news for sterling was now priced in. Mr Norfield also drew solace from solid UK manufacturing data released yesterday which, he argued, indicated that sterling's slide from a high of $1.945 in December was already helping to ease the pressure on the UK's beleaguered manufacturers. High-yielding currencies in general performed poorly, with rising US rates leading to further unwinding of dollar-funded carry trades. The Australian dollar fell 2.4 per cent to $0.7516 against the greenback while the New Zealand dollar lost 3.1 per cent at $0.6834. Despite yesterday's slide against the dollar, the euro enjoyed a robust week, firming 1.2 per cent to Y133.53 against the yen, amid signs that the anti-euro sentiment unleashed by the failure of the EU's constitutional treaty was now abating. Yen weakness was prompted by the sharpest fall in Japan's trade surplus for four years - a trend likely to be exacerbated by rising oil prices - as well as claims that the yen was now supplanting the dollar as the funding currency of choice for carry trades. "
89,2005-06-30,2005-07-01,Financial Times (FT.Com),FT.com site : Sterling hits new lows on widening yield gap.,"Sterling slumped to a near nine-month low against the US dollar in European morning trade on Friday after the Federal Reserve indicated it would continue hiking interest rates at a ""measured"" pace. This contrasts sharply with a deteriorating yield environment in the UK, where speculation over a possible August rate cut has intensified in the wake of weak retail sales and economic growth data this week. As widely expected, the Fed raised rates to 3.25 per cent overnight, its ninth straight quarter-point hike. In its accompanying statement, the Federal open market committee said monetary policy remained ""accommodative"" and that it expected to continue to raise rates at a ""measured"" pace. The FOMC added that ""expansion remains firm and labour market conditions continue to improve gradually,"" despite higher energy prices. The statement wrongfooted those who had been expecting signs of an imminent pause in tightening, helping to send the dollar higher. ""The Fed has adopted a slightly more hawkish stance than in the previous policy statement. Clearly, the statement does not support a sooner than expected pause in rate hikes,"" said Michael Woolfolk, senior currency strategist at Bank of New York. This allowed the dollar to spike as high as $1.2026 to the euro, close to its recent highs, before falling back to $1.2092. The euro's recovery was aided by signs of hope from the struggling eurozone manufacturing sector. The sector's purchasing managers' index came in at 49.9 for June, just a whisker below breakeven, compared to 48.7 in May, with France and Italy leading the way. The greenback also rose to a fresh nine-month low of Y111.23 against the yen, again before falling back to Y110.87. However sterling bore the brunt of the fallout, tumbling 1.8c to $1.7726 against the dollar, before a modest recovery to $1.7816, 0.3p to GBP0.6783 against the euro, a one-month low, and Y0.75 to Y197.56 against the yen. The pound was little helped by a rise in the UK's manufacturing sector PMI, with the index recovering to 49.6 in June from a downwardly revised 47 in May. The sector thus remained in contraction for a third month. ""A rare piece of better than expected news on the manufacturing sector, with orders growing for the first time in three months as foreign demand improved. Nevertheless, the manufacturing sector is clearly still struggling and the case for an interest rate cut in August is now very strong,"" said Howard Archer, economist at Global Insight. ""Indeed, a move by the Bank of England as soon as July is looking increasingly possible given this week's data on GDP, retail sales and consumer confidence."" "
90,2009-01-28,2009-01-29,Financial Times,Fed puts faith in targeted credit action,"Policy statement The Federal Reserve has grown more concerned about the outlook for the economy and the risk of deflation - and it is inclined to fight those dangers by expanding targeted credit operations rather than purchasing Treasury securities. However, Treasury purchases remain under active consideration and could be implemented quickly in -certain circumstances. Those were the key messages from yesterday's statement by the Federal Open Market Committee, which kept interest rates on hold at virtually zero. The Fed said that since its December policy meeting the economy ""has weakened -further"". In addition to a pull-back in spending by US consumers and businesses, ""global demand appears to be slowing significantly"". While the Fed expected a gradual recovery to begin ""later this year"", the risks of that not happening were ""significant"". The downgrade to the outlook implicitly extends the period for which the Fed would expect to keep interest rates near zero. Moreover, policymakers added two new references that acknowledged the risk of deflation and its close cousin: uncomfortably low inflation. ""The committee sees some risk that inflation could persist for a time below rates that best foster economic growth and price stability in the longer term."" With interest rates at virtually zero, the strategic choice for the Fed is whether to combat risks by expanding targeted credit operations that aim to revitalise specific markets for credit or else by buying long-term US Treasuries. Both options could bring down private borrowing costs - the first directly, by reducing risk premiums in dysfunctional markets, the second indirectly, by lowering benchmark risk-free rates. Fed officials have differing views on the relative merits of those approaches and that debate is likely to have dominated the meeting. In the end, the FOMC appears to have taken the view that targeted credit operations offer the most bang for the buck, though that assessment could change. The Fed said it would ""assess whether expansions or modifications to lending facilities would serve to further support credit markets"". That looks like code for beefing up the term asset-backed securities loan facility (Talf), which provides low-cost finance for investors willing to buy consumer loans bundled up as securities, and potentially using this model to support commercial mortgage-backed securities and municipal bonds as well. The US central bank also held out the possibility of extending its purchases of mortgage-backed securities issued by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, running at the rate of $300bn (€228bn, £211bn) a quarter, to keep mortgage rates low. The Fed said it was ""prepared"" to buy Treasuries ""if evolving circumstances indicate that such transactions would be particularly effective in improving conditions in private credit markets"". Some analysts saw that as hinting it would intervene if Treasury yields moved dramatically higher and pushed up private loan rates. The decision to emphasise targeted credit operations rather than Treasury purchases split the committee, with Jeffrey Lacker, the president of the Richmond Fed, voting against. The statement said he ""preferred to expand the monetary base at this time by purchasing US Treasury securities rather than through targeted credit programmes"". The Fed announced no new programmes. That is not surprising, since lending decisions are formally made by the Washington-based Fed board rather than the full FOMC. In these circumstances, the FOMC sets the overall strategic direction for the Fed but may not provide the occasion for new announcements."
91,2009-01-28,2009-01-29,Financial Times (FT.Com),View of the Day: Divisions at the Fed?,"Is the Federal Reserve calling the Treasury market's bluff - or is the central bank's open market committee seeing divisions between its members? Marc Ostwald, fixed income strategist at Monument Securities, believes there is an element of brinkmanship in the FOMC's latest policy statement, in which it said it was prepared to buy Treasury bonds if it would help improve financial market conditions. ""One could conclude that they hoped that their commitment to buy Treasuries if necessary might drive down Treasury yields in so far as it is effectively a back-stop bid,"" Mr Ostwald says. But he also suggests the statement hints at divisions on the committee about the merits of buying Treasuries. ""Some on the committee may still need to be persuaded, while others may be worried about the ongoing lack of any obvious exit strategy - and, by extension, that current measures are digging an ever bigger hole from which the Fed will find it harder to extract itself from."" Mr Ostwald says the Fed will also be monitoring the progress of the rollover of the commercial paper funding facility, which will arguably offer the clearest signals on whether there has been any genuine easing in credit conditions. ""If the vast majority of the CPFF is rolled over with the Fed rather than in the open/interbank market, then this would signal that credit market strains have not really eased materially."""
92,1997-11-12,1997-11-13,Financial Times,MARKET REPORT - FTSE 100.,"Nervousness after falls in Asian markets overnight, coupled with tension ahead of decisions from the FOMC meeting in the US, led to a bearish tinge to trading the FTSE 100 December future yesterday. In pre-trading December was indicating a level of about 4,780 but in the event it opened below this, at 4,757. This was down 65 on the previous close and 17 points below cash, with fair value estimated at a premium of about 31 points. But the bears were still not happy with this and December was knocked down to touch the low of the day, 4,700 at 10.35am. But this psychologically important support level was not breached despite the strong downward trend and December rallied slightly, only to test this area again at 1.30pm when it reached 4,705 as nervousness on the direction of the US market came to the fore. But in the event, Wall Street was not in such poor shape and December found a spring in its step in afternoon trading, and it outperformed the cash market. The contract managed to get its head above water and settlement was at 4,751, a slight premium to fair value. This less bearish stance continued into after-hours trading as December moved on about 14 points. Volume at 14,400 lots was more than double the 6,500 seen on Tuesday, while in Footsie options the 20,000 was 3,000 up. Puts at 21,400 outnumbered calls at 11,500 as investors continued to seek downside protection, a sentiment highlighted recently by SocGen research. Copyright Financial Times Limited 1997.

Other networking stocks fell as the industry leader, Cisco Systems, lost $1 1/4 to $79 3/8. US Treasury bonds were higher due to turmoil in Asian equity markets and while US stocks plunged, but then changed direction as Wall Street recovered from morning lows. By early afternoon, the 30-year Treasury bond had fallen 1/16 at 99 5/8, sending the yield up to 6.148%.

95,1997-11-12,1997-11-13,Financial Times,Treasuries firmer as Fed holds rates.,"Frayed nerves ahead of yesterday's meeting of the US Federal Reserve's Open Market Committee sent bond markets into a tail-spin in late European trade after US Treasuries opened weaker. Though the Fed was thought unlikely to raise interest rates - for reasons including stock market volatility - some analysts said a rise would be timely because of domestic US factors. ""Everything says they should go for it,"" said Kevin Adams, bond strategist at Barclays Capital Group in London. ""The lack of a rise would suggest the Fed was behind, or about to get behind, the curve."" Putting off any rise would require a higher increase in interest rates next time, he added. In the event the FOMC left rates unchanged and, having moved lower in early trading, US TREASURIES began to firm on the news. Soon after the announcement the 30-year Treasury had risen 3/16 to 99 7/8, yielding 6.130%. Among shorter-term issues the 10-year note rose 1/8 to 101 11/16, yielding 5.885% while the two-year note gained 1/32 to 99 27/32, yielding 5.692%. The Federal Funds rate was 5 9/16%. Trading was active on the market's first day back after the Veteran's Day holiday and turmoil in Asian markets had affected prices earlier in the day. ""Bond prices were up overnight as overseas equity markets declined, but that ...reversed as US equities came back from earlier lows,"" said David Ging, market strategist at Donaldson, Lufkin &Jenrette. ""The main talk is about Japanese repatriation,"" said Tom O'Connell, senior government trader at First Chicago Capital Markets. The belief is that money is being moved out of US Treasury securities to be invested in Japan in order to raise capital, and putting downward pressure on bond prices. UK GILTS took a hammering in late trading, with the December future dropping nearly a full point from its overnight close. Analysts said the fall was prompted by stop-loss selling and by one big trade. The gilt contract settled at 116 21/32, down, in heavy volume of nearly 130,000 contracts, while the yield spread over bunds widened to 124 basis points. Earlier the market had reacted well to another fall in unemployment and in earnings growth - the future at one point touched 118 1/16. However, the Bank of England's warning that inflation had not been tamed implied more interest rate rises on the horizon and gilts began to fall. Nevertheless, was no heavy cash selling, despite evidence of a switch from longer-dated securities into the five-year range. ""It was a general nervousness, a marking down of prices across the board,"" Mr Adams said. GERMAN BUNDS also retreated in late trading, dragging down other European markets. The December bund future settled in London at 102.20, a drop of 0.36, in good volume, with most activity in the five-year range because of a Bobl auction, said Heinz Gunasekera, bund specialist at UBS. The market had moved ahead earlier but was unsettled by both the FOMC meeting and a potential clash between the government and the Bundesbank over interest rate swaps. The German parliament yesterday gave the government the green light to use interest rate swaps to cut the cost of servicing the federal debt. But Johann Wilhelm Gaddum, Bundesbank vice-president, warned the move would increase reliance on short-term financing and create more volatility in interest rate movements. However, parliament limited the amount of debt that can be swapped to DM 95bn, half what the finance ministry wanted. The move will allow the fixed-rate debt to be swapped for floating-rate debt, saving up to DM 1bn on interest payments. ITALIAN BTPs weakened but outperformed bunds as volumes picked up from previous sessions, with the December future settling 0.27 lower at 111.26. The 10-year spread over bunds narrowed to 61 basis points, with the market waiting for domestic data due tomorrow that is expected to show no disruption to the country's generally good economic outlook. SPANISH BONOS also outperformed bunds, with the 10-year spread falling to 41 points as the December future settled 0.25 lower at 103.00.

96,1997-11-12,1997-11-13,Financial Times,MARKET REPORT - FTSE 100.,"Nervousness after falls in Asian markets overnight, coupled with tension ahead of decisions from the FOMC meeting in the US, led to a bearish tinge to trading the FTSE 100 December future yesterday. In pre-trading December was indicating a level of about 4,780 but in the event it opened below this, at 4,757. This was down 65 on the previous close and 17 points below cash, with fair value estimated at a premium of about 31 points. But the bears were still not happy with this and December was knocked down to touch the low of the day, 4,700 at 10.35am. But this psychologically important support level was not breached despite the strong downward trend and December rallied slightly, only to test this area again at 1.30pm when it reached 4,705 as nervousness on the direction of the US market came to the fore. But in the event, Wall Street was not in such poor shape and December found a spring in its step in afternoon trading, and it outperformed the cash market. The contract managed to get its head above water and settlement was at 4,751, a slight premium to fair value. This less bearish stance continued into after-hours trading as December moved on about 14 points. Volume at 14,400 lots was more than double the 6,500 seen on Tuesday, while in Footsie options the 20,000 was 3,000 up. Puts at 21,400 outnumbered calls at 11,500 as investors continued to seek downside protection, a sentiment highlighted recently by SocGen research. Copyright Financial Times Limited 1997.

100,2008-06-25,2008-06-26,Financial Times,Volatile trading after Fed leaves rates at 2%,"GLOBAL OVERVIEW Other central banks tighten policies Investors heartened by falling oil price There was volatile trading in US Treasury bonds, equities and the dollar yesterday after the Federal Reserve expressed concern about inflation and kept investors guessing about rate rises later this year. As expected the Fed kept its overnight rate steady at 2 per cent, and brought to an end a series of rate cuts that started last September. Richard Fisher, president of the Dallas Fed dissented and sought a rate increase. The Fed's policy statement policy makers read in part: ""Although downside risks to growth remain, they appear to have diminished somewhat, and the upside risks to inflation and inflation expectations have increased."" Stephen Stanley, chief economist at RBS Greenwich Capital said: ""The Federal Open Market Committee chose to talk about how conditions have changed but not about their leanings. What the committee was unwilling to say for a second straight meeting is which set of risks predominates."" The Fed, also noted that ""labour markets have softened further and financial markets remain under considerable stress."" Given falling house prices and higher energy costs, investors believe the Fed faces a difficult job balancing its twin objectives of sustaining economic growth and containing inflation. William Strazzullo, market strategist at Bell Curve Trading, said: ""In the end it comes down to growth for the Fed, rather than inflation. I find it hard to believe the Fed will tighten when the unemployment rate is rising."" Other central bankers were also in the spotlight yesterday as Jean-Claude Trichet, the president of the European Central Bank, clarified his recent remarks about a rate hike when the ECB meets on July 3. ""I said we could decide to move our rates by a small amount in our next meeting in order to secure the solid anchoring of inflation expectations,"" Mr Trichet said. Norway's central bank raised its key interest rate by 25 basis points to 5.75 per cent in response to higher inflation and confounded the view of some economists who had expected no change. That came after India tightened policy on Tuesday to counter inflation, running above 11 per cent. US government bond prices weakened in a knee-jerk fashion after traders heard from the Fed and then rebounded sharply. The yield on the two-year note topped out at 3 per cent and then plunged down to 2.81 per cent as traders trimmed the chances of a rate hike in August. The market is pricing in a funds rate just above 2.50 per cent by the end of the year. The yield on the 10-year note was steady around 4.11 per cent after a brief spike to 4.18 per cent in post-Fed trade. Bond yields in the UK fell, led by a 8bp drop in the two-year gilt to 5.21 per cent. UK retail sales were negative in June according to the Confederation of British Industry. European bond yields rose after Mr Trichet's remarks. European and US equity markets rallied as oil prices slumped earlier yesterday. The FTSE Eurofirst 300 index closed up 1.1 per cent, while in London the FTSE 100 rallied 0.6 per cent. The S&P 500 index closed up 0.6 per cent in New York, and pared a 1.6 per cent gain after the Fed news. US corporate credit spreads moved wider. Asian equity markets were mixed, with export companies lower after weak US data on Tuesday. Japan's Nikkei 225 index fell 0.1 per cent, while in an abbreviated session, Hong Kong rose 0.8 per cent. Taiwan fell 0.2 per cent and Korea rallied 0.4 per cent. Shanghai rose 3.6 per cent and closed higher for the second day in a row. India's Sensex closed 0.8 per cent higher after rebounding from an early slide of 1.9 per cent. Pakistan's Karachi Stock Exchange 100 index rose a further 2.5 per cent, extending Tuesday's 8.6 per cent gain. In currency trading , action and words from central banks dictated moves. The dollar slipped after the Fed meeting as the euro was boosted by the ECB's tougher talk on rates. Norway's krone gained against both the euro and dollar and India's rupee hit a three-week high versus the dollar. Trading was also volatile in crude oil prices . US oil inventories rose for the first time in six weeks. At one stage, oil fell more than $5 a barrel, before it pared some of its losses to settle at $134.55."
101,1995-12-19,1995-12-20,Financial Times,GOVERNMENT BONDS - US TREASURIES RALLY SHARPLY AS FED CUTS RATE.,"US Treasury bonds rallied sharply yesterday after the Federal Reserve announced that it had cut the target short-term interest rate by 25 basis points, to 5 1/2%. Short term notes soared on news of the rate cut, while longer term bonds were not able to regain all the ground lost in Monday's sell-off. Late in the session, the benchmark 30-year Treasury was 1 1/4 higher at 110 11/32 to yield 6.110%, still below its levels of late Friday. At the short end of the market, however, two-year notes added 1/4 to 100 3/32, yielding 5.305%, well below the 5.356% they were yielding on Friday. Bonds began rising in the early afternoon before the Fed announcement, amid growing optimism that the Fed would move and that President Bill Clinton and Congress were making progress toward passage of a balanced budget agreement. The yield curve that maps the spread between two-year and 30-year bonds steepened by more than 4 basis points from its level of late Monday, as the short end of the market rallied. Initial reaction to the Fed's move was muted as some investors used the initial rise to take profits, according to Mr John Spinello, a government bonds strategist at Merrill Lynch. Bonds had seen a sharp sell-off on Monday as growing acrimony over the budget worried many investors that the Fed would not cut rates this month. Investors were still looking to Washington for indications of progress on a budget package. Mr Clinton and Congressional leaders began a negotiating session yesterday afternoon. European government bond markets were generally softer yesterday as dealers awaited news from the FOMC meeting in the US. There was no sign that the Fed funds rate would be lowered. Trading remained thin across the board as markets wound down for the long holiday break over Christmas and the new year. UK government bonds saw their spread over Germany widen slightly to 157 basis points from just under 150 basis points on Monday as several support levels were breached, causing technical selling in the futures market. Analysts said profit-taking was inevitable after the market's strong performance over past weeks. On Liffe, the March contract of the long gilt future fell 9/16 to 109 13/16 in modest volume of just over 50,000 lots. Some data scheduled for today are unlikely to provide the market with fresh direction. The market is expecting non-EU trade figures for November, which should show a deficit of #800m, provisional M4 data for November, expected to show a rise of 0.8% on the month and 8.7% on the year, and November net new commitments by building societies, forecast at #3.1bn. German government bonds recouped some of Monday's losses but still ended the day lower. On Liffe, the March bund future traded between a low of 98.14 and a high of 98.75 before settling down 0.19 points at 98.60 in volume of 141,000 contracts. (c) The Financial Times Limited 1995. "
102,1995-12-19,1995-12-20,Financial Times,MARKETS - SYDNEY LEADS GENERAL RETREAT BUT SEOUL RALLIES 2.7% - ASIA PACIFIC.,"Tokyo Monday's heavy fall on Wall Street unnerved investors, and the Nikkei 225 average declined for the third consecutive day on technical selling and profit-taking of high-technology stocks, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. The index lost 170.59 at 19,140.49 after moving between 19,077.12 and 19,242.03. Worries over US shares prompted a fall in futures prices, triggering arbitrage unwinding. The delay over the solution for jusen, or housing loan companies, also eroded investor confidence. Volume was 370m shares, against 340.7m. Overseas investors sold high-technology shares, while investment trusts also unloaded holdings. However, domestic institutions were seen bargain hunting at lower levels, preventing a large sell-off. The Topix index of all first section stocks fell 11.54 to 1,520.12, while the Nikkei 300 shed 2.01 to 285.79. Declines outnumbered advances by 820 to 246, with 155 issues remaining unchanged. In London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index gained 5.02 at 1,320.38. High-technology issues were heavily sold: Hitachi dropped Y 22 to Y 968 and Toshiba Y 6 to Y 761. NEC declined Y 20 to Y 1,200 on rising fears of a slowdown of personal computer sales in the US, as well as a fall in semiconductor prices. Selling by foreigners also prompted profit-taking by domestic investors, who had actively bought the sector earlier in the year. Banks were mixed as negotiations over the jusen solution continued. Industrial Bank of Japan dipped Y 20 to Y 3,100, but Bank of Tokyo gained Y 10 at Y 1,750. Analysts do not expect shares to rise on an eventual solution, since the use of public funds in dealing with the housing loan companies' bad loans are already factored into share prices. Brokers, which had been bought on the rise in trading volume on the Tokyo stock market, were lower. Nomura Securities retreated Y 30 to Y 7,430 and Yamaichi Securities lost Y 20 to Y 700. In Osaka, the OSE average fell 170.43 to 20,588.80 in volume of 133.2m shares. Nintendo, the video game maker, gave up Y 170 to Y 7,770 and Rohm, the semiconductor maker, shed Y 260 to Y 5,530. Roundup The overnight drop on Wall Street was a major influence in the movement of the region's equity markets yesterday. But Seoul followed its own agenda. SYDNEY fell sharply as investors unwound positions ahead of the expiry of December futures and caution ahead of the US FOMC meeting. The All Ordinaries index was off 24.9 at 2,182.80 after an intra-day low of 2,172.10. Turnover came to 220.64m shares worth A$801.2m. Leading the active stocks was BHP, down 20 cents at A$18.76, while CRA dipped 19 cents to A$21.32 and News Corp 10 cents to A$7.51. The banking sector index slid 66.80 or 2% to 3,220.70, with Advance Bank ending 11 cents cheaper at A$10.25, ANZ off 8 cents to A$6.22, Westpac 6 cents lower at A$5.60 and Commonwealth down 3 cents to A$10.68. Tubemakers rose 45 cents to A$4.05 following BHP's offer for the shares in the company it does not already own. SEOUL brought an end to its seven-day streak of steep declines to finish on a high note, after a strong technical rebound and buying interest sparked by Dacom's auction. The composite stock index added 23.61 or 2.7% at 890.79 in volume of 20.9m shares. LG Semicon, an unlisted affiliate of the LG Group, bought 1.3m shares of Dacom from Korea Long-Term Credit Bank at Won280,100 per share. This sent LG shares up strongly. LG Electronics climbed Won1,500 to Won26,600 and LG climbed Won600 to Won11,300, both up the day's limit. Dacom closed limit down, falling Won7,500 to Won120,500. Korea Long-Term rose Won500 to Won23,300. HONG KONG finished 1% lower, but analysts suggested that the day's fall had purged the market of inflated expectations of a US rate cut following the FOMC meeting. The Hang Seng index was down 100.72 at 9,705.86 after climbing off a morning low of 9,647.74. Turnover improved but was still thin at HKDollars 2.9bn. HSBC topped the losers, ending HKDollars 1.50 weaker at HKDollars 113.50, though off the day's worst of HKDollars 112. WELLINGTON weakened but recovered quite strongly from the session's low. The NZSE-40 index lost a net 15.68 at 2,097.08 after falling to 2,080.07. Fletcher Challenge was the hardest hit, falling 7 cents to NZ$3.52 but recovering from its trough of NZ$3.44. Telecom shed 5 cents to NZ$6.45. TAIPEI was in retreat but brokers said overall sentiment remained optimistic after recent buying from brokerages and institutions. The weighted index finished a net 30.75 down at 5,082.17 following an intra-session low of 5,048.85. Turnover amounted to TDollars 50bn. Electronics led the falls, following a plunge in Wall Street's high-technology issues, but brokers said the sector was also encountering a correction after its previous rises. Paper and cement shares were the only gainers. SINGAPORE was weak, awaiting the outcome of the FOMC meeting, and the Straits Times Industrial index closed 13.20 down at 2,187.34. HeShe Holding was again the most active stock, in volume of 12.5m shares, following news that a large investor, First Capital, was getting out of the loss-making company. HeShe shares ended unchanged at 49 cents. KUALA LUMPUR was lower, with overseas funds unable to find compelling reasons to buy in the market, and analysts noted that the run-up in second line and second board issues seen in recent days also appeared to have run out of steam. The composite index finished 6.51 down at 977.49. (c) The Financial Times Limited 1995. "
103,1996-01-31,1996-02-01,Financial Times,FED RATES CUT LEAVES DOW AT NEW RECORD - AMERICA.,"Wall Street US stocks continued their record breaking run yesterday as the widely expected interest rate cut came. But the Dow Jones Industrial Average, which rose nearly 110 points over the first two days of the week, failed to hold above the 5,400 level, closing at 5,395.30, up 14.09, writes Maggie Urry in New York. Share prices had been muted ahead of the decision from the Federal Open Market Committee, announced in the early afternoon, dropping nervously minutes before the news. Once the move had been made, though, equities rose again, the Dow reaching a peak of 5,408.67 before slipping back. The broader indices also rose, the Standard &Poor's 500 adding 5.87 at 636.02 and the American Stock Exchange composite gaining 3.14 at 554.10. The Nasdaq composite put on 8.49 at 1,059.79. Trading on the NYSE was active, volume reaching 475m shares. The rate cut had been widely expected and the reaction was muted. There was some concern that the Fed alluded to 'moderating economic expansion' as well as subdued inflation in making the cut. Cyclical stocks, which do badly when in a slowing economy, had been weak ahead of the rate reduction but fared better afterwards. Within the Dow's 30 shares, Caterpillar recouped a $1 1/4 fall to end unchanged at $64 3/8, Goodyear Tire and Rubber regained $1 of a $1 1/8 fall to close $1/8 off at $47 7/8, and International Paper ended down $5/8 at $40 7/8 after a low of $40 3/8. Earnings reports gave the market some impetus. Ford Motor beat expectations with fourth-quarter earnings per share of 49 cents, compared with forecasts of 21 cents. The stock rose at first, slipped and then recovered to end unchanged at $29 5/8. General Motors, at $52 5/8, retraced $1 of its $1 1/4 rise scored on Tuesday when it reported strong fourth-quarter earnings. Philip Morris, the tobacco and food group, pleased the market with fourth-quarter earnings per share slightly above forecast. However, after an initial rise, it lost $2 to $93 as analysts wondered what 1996 would bring. Kimberly-Clark, the paper maker which recently acquired rival Scott, took the opposite course. After reporting earnings below forecasts, the shares fell $3 1/2 to $76. However, they recovered sharply as analysts looked behind the headline figures, showing a gain on the day of $1 1/8 at $80 5/8. Also disappointing was Bethlehem Steel, which as well as producing fourth-quarter earnings below forecasts was cautious for the first quarter of the current year, saying price increases would not take effect until the second quarter. The shares softened $1/8 to $15 1/8. Corning shares were active on hopes that the diversified manufacturer might raise $1bn by selling its faltering laboratory services division. The stock rose $3/4 to $31 1/4. Topping the actives list were Hanson ADRs, following the Anglo-American group's decision to break itself into four new companies. The ADRs lost $1/4 at $15 1/2. Canada Toronto, unable to maintain its torrid pace of late, ended lower on profit-taking in the heavily weighted golds and financial services sectors. The TSE 300 composite index relinquished 19.44 at 4,968.43, while falls outscored rises by 446 to 435. Volume was 101.2m shares valued at C$1.30bn. (c) The Financial Times Limited 1996. "
104,1996-01-31,1996-02-01,Financial Times,MARKETS REPORT - FEDERAL RESERVE LOWERS KEY US INTEREST RATES.,"The dollar rose on the foreign exchanges yesterday after the US Federal Reserve cut its key interest rates by 1/4 percentage point. The Federal Reserve lowered its Federal Funds rate to 5.25% and its discount rate to 5.0%. The move was followed by the Bank of Canada, which reduced its key interest rates by a quarter-point. The prospect of fresh interest rate cuts had absorbed the attention of the foreign exchange markets throughout most of yesterday's European session, adding a note of uncertainty into trading. With the FOMC announcement coming after the close of European trading, the dollar consequently moved in a limited range for most of the European session. Meanwhile in Europe, the Bundesbank's decision to reduce the German repo rate - by 15 basis points to 3.4% - prompted speculation about further European interest rate cuts. Although the German currency was at first slightly dented by the move, it later recovered as the expectation grew that France and other European countries could follow suit. The Bundesbank's decision to reduce its repo rate did not take the markets by surprise: with growth in Germany having weakened markedly in recent months, most traders had already anticipated a small cut. However, the scale of the cut was slightly larger than the 10 basis points that most dealers had expected. It also fuelled speculation that the Bundesbank might follow the repo rate cut with a reduction in its discount or Lombard rate at its council meeting today. However, most dealers said they thought this was unlikely. They said the Bundesbank would probably wait in order to assess the impact of its last rate cut on M3, its measure of the money supply. But the German move was nevertheless thought likely to trigger further, slight easing elsewhere in Europe. Belgium, which ties its monetary policy closely to Germany, followed immediately: its central rate was reduced to 3.40% from 3.55% and its end-of-day rate to 4.65% from 4.80. The Netherlands is also widely expected to ease policy slightly today, when it sets its special advances pact. Meanwhile, the Bank of France, which also meets today, is expected to cut its own intervention rate by 20 basis points from its current level of 4.2%. Most European currencies were initially buoyed by the German repo rate cut before the D-Mark recovered later in the session. The Italian lira rose sharply to end near to its recent highs, while the French franc closed modestly up against the D-Mark. 'This environment where the Bundesbank is easing rates promotes more rapid growth across Europe and improves countries' chances of meeting the Maastricht criteria for monetary union,' said Mr Lawrence Hatheway, senior currency strategist at UBS in London. The lira found further support from the growing expectation that a new government would be formed soon. It was also supported by comments by Mr Jean-Claude Trichet, governor of the Bank of France, who said the Italian currency had the potential to appreciate against other European currencies. Against the D-Mark, the lira closed higher at L1,071, from L1,074, and the French franc at FFr 3.433, from FFr 3.436. Traders said speculation of a small rate cut in France was likely to weaken the French franc in coming days. Trading in the dollar was subdued during most of the London session ahead of the FOMC meeting. Dealers said the markets had discounted a 25 basis-point reduction in US rates at the meeting. The Canadian dollar rallied strongly, buoyed partly by rumours of a large buy order in London and on speculation that Canadian rates would remain unchanged even if US rates were cut. In London the dollar ended at DM 1.4879, from DM 1.4900. It closed at Y 106.915 against the yen, from Y 107.2. It finished in New York at DM 1.4887 and Y 107.02. The pound finished slightly stronger against the D-Mark at DM 2.2482, from DM 2.2410. It was also ahead against the dollar, at $1.5110 from $1.5040. (c) The Financial Times Limited 1996. "
105,1996-01-31,1996-02-01,Financial Times,GOVERNMENT BONDS - ENTHUSIASM FOR US RATE CUT SHORT-LIVED.,"US Treasury bonds jumped yesterday as the Federal Open Market Committee announced an interest rate cut at the end of its two-day meeting. However, the enthusiasm for the cut, announced in the early afternoon, was short-lived and bond prices fell back to end the day with modest gains. The dollar was little changed on the rate cut. The Fed reduced its target rate by a quarter of one percentage point to 5 1/4%, and the discount rate by the same amount to 5%. It cited moderating economic expansion and subdued inflation for its decision. Late in the day the benchmark 30-year Treasury was 1/8 higher at 111 5/8 to yield 6.023%, while at the short end of the maturity spectrum the two-year note was up 1/8 at 100 1/8, yielding 4.917%. Bonds have been firm lately in anticipation of a cut, which came only six weeks after the previous reduction in December. It is the third easing of monetary policy by the Fed after the tightening begun in early 1994. While many economists welcomed the reduction in interest rates, Mr Ken Bercuson, chief economist at Swiss Bank Corporation in New York, said: 'I think it is a mistake they will live to regret.' He expected inflation to rise to around 4% and said the Fed might have to raise rates again later in the year. The market was also weighed down by news that next week's Treasury auctions will be the biggest on record, raising $44.5bn of which $13.2bn will be new cash. The sale will comprise $18.5bn of three-year notes, $14bn of 10-year notes and $12bn of 30-year bonds. Before the auction can go ahead the Treasury must put in place measures to avoid breaching the $4,900bn debt ceiling. In Germany, meanwhile, bonds closed lower despite a 15 basis point cut in the German repo rate to 3.4%. Traders attributed the fall to profit-taking, said to be by hedge funds, and technical trading. Mr David Brown, chief European economist at Bear Stearns International, said the markets had been 'whip-sawed between interest rate expectations on both sides of the Atlantic'. Investors were waiting for the outcome of the Bundesbank council meeting today. Mr Brown said: 'With the Bundesbank accelerating its pace of repo easing, from 8, to 10, to 15 basis points off rates, we reckon the chances of a discount rate cut tomorrow have improved from 55:45 in favour to 65:35 in favour.' Mr Karl Haeling of Deutsche Morgan Grenfell in Frankfurt said the size of the cut had led to a reassessment of German rates by some investors. He said: 'Rightly or wrongly, people are perceiving that the end of the interest rate fantasy is nearly on us. Some are saying that interest rate cuts are so widely anticipated that they can only provide disappointment when they come.' The yield on benchmark two-year paper increased 1 basis point and that on 10-year paper by 2 points, with the spread between the two maturities settling at 224 points. On Liffe the March 10-year bund future closed at 100.27, down 0.21. At the London close, the yield spread of 10-year bunds over Treasuries was up from 17 to 22 basis points. French government bonds were lifted by poor unemployment data and the March Notionnel future on Matif closed up 0.10 at 122.88. Hopes of an imminent cut in the intervention rate buoyed the short end of the curve, and yields on two-year paper fell 6 basis points while yields on the 10-year area rose 2 points with the spread between the two maturities at 193. Ms Phyllis Reed, European bond strategist at BZW, said more steepening could lead the French yield curve to steepen to German levels, where the two to 10-year spread is around 220 points. The spread over bunds tightened 2 basis points to 47 points. Italian bonds followed bunds, and the March bond future on Liffe closed up 0.45 at 112.40 but surged in late afternoon when a resolution of the political crisis was believed to be nearer. The spread over 10-year bunds narrowed 8 basis points to 432. UK government bonds were dragged down by a disappointing gilt auction. Although the auction cover was 1.96 times and the tail was 2 basis points, the lowest accepted price was 5/32 below the pre-auction market level at 105, where it yielded 6.76%. A trader said: 'People don't necessarily want the stock but they are happy to take it on at these levels.' Mr Andrew Roberts, analyst at UBS, said the result was a disappointment because 'the gilt market offers more value than any other European market just now'. On Liffe the March long gilt future closed at 110 7/16, down 7/16. The 10-year yield spread over Germany moved from 169 to 173 basis points. On two-year paper yields rose 3 points and on 10-year paper by 5 points, with the spread between the maturities at 124 basis points. The yield spread of 10-year Swedish government bonds over bunds narrowed by 6 basis points to 242 points on hopes of further repo rate cuts from the Riksbank. Ms Wike Groenenberg, an economist at Salomon Brothers, said 20 or 25 basis points could come off the repo rate within two weeks. (c) The Financial Times Limited 1996. "
106,1996-01-31,1996-02-01,Financial Times,MARKETS - JANUARY ENDS WITH NEW FRANKFURT PEAK - EUROPE.,"Another aggressive repo rate cut, 15 basis points, saw FRANKFURT set an emphatic new high on the session. It closed official business with the Dax at 2,470.14, wobbled in the afternoon as the dollar, bonds and the Dow moved against it, and ended Ibis trading with a 6.91 gain at 2,463.00. Turnover rose from DM 11.1bn to DM 13.4bn; Daimler, Deutsche Bank and Siemens traded in DM 4.4bn between them. Mr Eckhard Frahm at Merck Finck in Dusseldorf calculated that the official close left the Dax up 9.6% on the month, compared with a 7% gain for the whole of 1995. The market, said Mr Frahm, was being driven by the dollar and corporate restructuring prospects, as well as by liquidity and the interest rate environment. DAX 30 earnings per share were expected to rise by 30% this year, and by 13% in 1997, and dollar-related stocks dominated the best Dax performers in January, led by Continental, Bayer and BMW, up 21.5, 17.6 and 15.1% respectively. Lufthansa rose another DM 5.80 yesterday to DM 223.80; the flag airline told a German business magazine on Sunday that it could treble its earnings by the year 2,000. SAP prefs dropped DM 9.70 or 4.3% to DM 217.50 after a 44% rise in 1995 earnings, and confident predictions for 1996. PARIS, down at one point, rose for the sixth consecutive session on late foreign buying, the CAC-40 index ending 17.90 higher at 2,021.03, with turnover inflated to FFr 7.23bn by expiry-related arbitrage. Stocks which got a poor early reception improved. Bouygues, after its news of heavy provisions against the 1995 accounts, fell to FFr 492.50 before closing a net FFr 15 down at FFr 517; L'Oreal, relatively flat in its initial reaction to higher turnover and profits for 1995, ended FFr 19 ahead at FFr 1,448. Meanwhile, Rhone-Poulenc, the chemicals and pharmaceuticals group, outdistanced most blue chips with a gain of FFr 4 at FFr 119, on higher earnings and plans to sell FFr 10bn of assets to reduce debt. MILAN built up its hopes for an imminent solution to the government crisis. The Comit index rose 6.17 to 619.94, while the real-time Mibtel index was 82 higher at 9,923. Stet forged ahead L224 to L4,971 after newspaper reports that the group's assets might be sold in tranches, although many analysts were sceptical about the practicalities of such an operation. Fiat was weak after its recent spurt, awaiting Mr Gianni Agnelli's last annual letter to shareholders as chairman, which came after the market closed. The shares fell L65 to L5,334. Mr Nicholas Potter at Credito Italiano International described the 1995 results as 'acceptable but nothing special', adding that the company was capable of significantly more. ZURICH continued higher, supported by a steady dollar, but activity was thin as many investors awaited the outcome of the FOMC meeting. The SMI index rose 11.9 to 3,248.7. Bank Baer, which released 1995 figures, picked up SwFr 30 to SwFr 1,260. Registered shares in Elco Looser, the heating equipment manufacturer, which closed at SwFr 491 on Tuesday, were suspended throughout yesterday's session ahead of the SwFr 535 a share bid from Preussag, the German engineering group. MADRID featured a near 3% gain in Repsol, up Pta125 at Pta4,360, on signs that the latest privatisation offer was being well absorbed. The general index rose 27.40 to 3,734.49. BRUSSELS liked a 15 basis-point cut in the Belgian National Bank's central rate, and the Bel-20 index put on 14.56 at 1,690.23. Forestries, with sector indices up 2.7 and 2.3% respectively, lifted HELSINKI, where the Hex index rose 12.50 to 1,752.41, and STOCKHOLM, where the Affarsvarlden General index closed 16.1 better at 1,765.1. However, the Swedes also enjoyed a 1.6% lift in the drugs sector, where Astra rose SKr5 to SKr282, and Pharmacia &Upjohn also by SKr5, to SKr282.50, after overnight sector gains in the US. ISTANBUL leapt 6.9% as Turkey and Greece withdrew from a disputed rocky outcrop in the Aegean Sea after a tense stand-off on Tuesday. The IMKB-100 index gained 3,210 at 49,489.5. Analysts noted, however, that the market remained sensitive to domestic politics over efforts to form a coalition government after the inconclusive December elections. ATHENS also reacted to the de-escalation of tension, with a 1.6% rise. The general index moved up 15.08 to 989.45. WARSAW picked up 2.4%, taking the month's advance to 30% and the market to a 52-week high. The Wig index rose 241.6 to 10,413.1 on hopes that the year's second interest rate cut could come as soon as February. Animex, the food processor, jumped 2.70 zlotys to 29.80 on news that it would receive a 19m-zloty refund after paying too much tax in 1990. BUDAPEST was higher for the 13th successive session and the Bux index climbed 65.26 to 2,068.06. Bearer shares in Agrimpex, the agricultural trading company, soared Ft1,500 to Ft13,000 as the group established a subsidiary intended to centralise its trading activity.

107,2004-09-21,2004-09-22,Financial Times,Retailers in spotlight as Footsie rallies LONDON.,"The resumption of BP's share buyback programme supported yesterday's rally in the FTSE 100, which closed above 4,600 for the first time since July 2002. London's benchmark index was up 0.6 per cent at 4,608.4, while the mid-cap FTSE 250 fell less than 0.1 per cent to 6,276.5. Trading volume was 3bn ahead of the Federal Open Market Committee's decision on US interest rates. Otherwise it was a tale of three retailers - Tesco, Marks and Spencer and J Sainsbury. M&S was down 1.2 per cent at 341 1/2p after a weak trading statement revealed like-for-like sales in the past 10 weeks to Sept 18 had fallen 6.3 per cent. The retailer also unveiled its share buyback plan, with the range set between 332p and 380p, lower than expected and below the 400p Philip Green might have offered earlier in the summer. By contrast Tesco, the UK's biggest supermarket chain, added 3.5 per cent to 285p, near its highest level in four years after yet another trading statement topped analysts' expectations. Some were forecasting that Tesco would become the first UK retailer to top the Pounds 2bn profit mark. The bullishness of the statement once again threw the troubles at rival J Sainsbury into sharp relief, the latter falling 0.8 per cent to 272 1/2p. Philip Dorgan, an analyst at Panmure Gordon, did not hold back in his assessment of either M&S or Sainsbury. On M&S he said: ""There is no magic wand and we expect to see a stream of downgrades for 2005/06. M&S's problems are structural and will defeat this management team as they have others."" On Sainsbury he was even more damning as he chopped the rating from ""hold"" to ""sell"" and slashed his 2005 forecasts to one half of consensus. Mr Dorgan said: ""The legacy of previous management is far worse than we imagined and Justin King (the new chief executive) has been given a hospital pass. We expect the business review on October 19 to result in very serious downgrades to both earnings and dividends."" BP, the oil major, rose 1.8 per cent to 538p as it recommenced its share buyback programme after a four-week hiatus. The company bought back 10m shares at prices between 520 1/2p and 531p per share. Expectations that rival Shell would announce an increase for its buyback programme sent its shares up 2.3 per cent to 432 1/4p. Technical traders have said the 4,600 level represents a significant breakthrough on the FTSE 100 chart and a close above the 4,610 level could see the index rise by more than a 100 points. This could happen quickly if talk of Vodafone doubling its dividend proves correct. The shares rose 0.8 per cent to 130 1/4p. Royal Bank of Scotland added 1 per cent to Pounds 15.80 after Dresdner Kleinwort Wasserstein said further deals involving the issue of new shares are unlikely during the integration of Charter One in the US. The broker concluded that RBS shares should respond positively to the cash generated by that. A downgrade from Credit Suisse First Boston sent LogicaCMG 4 per cent lower to 184p. "
108,2004-09-21,2004-09-22,Financial Times,Fed adds a quarter point and signals more to come.,"The US Federal Reserve yesterday raised its target primary interest rate a quarter point to 1.75 per cent and signalled it expects to continue raising rates at a ""measured"" pace. The policymaking Federal Open Market Committee left its accompanying statement largely unchanged from August, saying that output growth ""appears to have regained some traction"" after ""moderating earlier in the year partly in response to the rise in energy prices"". The statement, which echoed recent testimony by Alan Greenspan, Fed chairman, also noted that inflation and inflation expectations had declined recently, in spite of the high oil price. Yesterday's move was widely expected, and reaction was muted. ""Growth has recovered, much as they expected, and inflation has fallen, much as they expected,"" said Peter Hooper, chief US economist at Deutsche Bank. ""They have not changed the statement and they gave no indication that a pause is needed any time soon."" The Fed has taken care to communicate its message to the market and lay out the expected course of increases to return rates to a more neutral level at a ""pace that is likely to be measured"", widely seen as meaning quarter-point moves. The federal funds rate is seen as too low to be consistent with stable inflation over time. But officials stress that rate moves will be determined by economic data. Futures markets are pricing in a further increase when the Fed meets in November but are betting it will leave rates on hold when it meets close to Christmas before raising them again in February. The market is pricing in about a 3 per cent rate by the end of next year, the lower end of the range for neutral rates commonly seen as 3-5 per cent. Recent economic data have supported the Fed's case that the economy is bouncing back after a soft patch at the end of the second quarter, though the August retail sales data were mixed. The high oil price is seen as a risk, but the Fed has no evidence so far that the oil price has knocked expansion fundamentally off course. Recent weaker job data are also a concern, but the Fed remains confident the labour market has turned the corner and income growth will be strong enough to support growing consumer spending. Yesterday's statement noted ""labour market conditions have improved modestly"" since August.

The committee repeated that it expected to continue to raise the federal funds rate to a more neutral level ""at a pace that is likely to be measured"". Yesterday's move was widely expected and market reaction was muted. Futures markets are pricing in a further rate increase when the Fed meets in November but are betting the central bank will leave rates on hold when it meets just before Christmas - when trading is likely to be thin - before raising them in February. The FOMC statement echoed recent testimony by Alan Greenspan, Fed chairman, who gave cautiously optimistic testimony before Congress this month. Recent economic data have supported the Fed's case that the economy is bouncing back after a soft patch at the end of the second quarter, though the August retail sales data were mixed. The high oil price is seen as a risk but the Fed has seen no evidence so far that the oil price has knocked the expansion fundamentally off course. Recent weaker job data are also a concern, but the central bank remains confident that the labour market has turned the corner this year and that income growth will grow strongly enough to support growing consumer spending. The Fed, in its statement yesterday, noted that ""labour market conditions have improved modestly"" since its August meeting. The decline in inflation and inflation expectations in recent months, in spite of the high oil price, makes it easier for the central bank to pay close attention to the risks that the high oil price poses for growth. The Fed has taken great care to communicate its message to the market this year and lay out the expected course of increases to return rates to a more neutral level at a ""measured pace"", widely interpreted to mean quarter-point moves. The federal funds rate is seen as too low to be consistent with stable inflation over time. But officials have stressed that the timing of rate moves will be determined by the incoming economic data. Since June, before the Fed started raising rates, the yield on the 10-year Treasury note has fallen from almost 4.9 per cent to below 4.1. This is seen at the Fed as reflecting the improved outlook for inflation, after fears that the Fed had fallen ""behind the curve"" and would Shave to take aggressive action. "

111,2004-09-21,2004-09-22,Financial Times (FT.Com),FT.com site : Market Overview: Disappointing corporate news weighs.,"Global equity markets took a turn for the worse on Wednesday as disappointing corporate news and stubbornly high oil prices outweighed the cautiously optimistic view of the US economy delivered by the Federal Reserve when it raised its target interest rate by a quarter-point to 1.75 per cent on Tuesday. By midday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down more than 100 points, or 1.1 per cent, while the technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite index was 1.4 per cent lower. Morgan Stanley, the US investment bank, saw its shares fall sharply after its third-quarter earnings fell short of expectations, while network equipment maker Cisco Systems was dented by a downgrade from Deutsche Bank. European stocks showed a little more resilience than their US counterparts but the FTSE Eurotop 300 index still ended with a loss of 0.6 per cent at 996.72. Oil prices rose sharply after the latest US crude inventories data showed that the disruption caused by Hurricane Ivan had eroded fuel supplies. Nymex October futures were above $48 a barrel at midday, within striking distance of the all-time high of $49.40 hit last month. The markets may have got what they wanted from the Fed on Tuesday but there was still uncertainty about the timing of the next tightening. ""Currently, the futures market is expecting rates to end the year at 2 per cent and surveys suggest that this is the level that economists generally expect as well,"" said James Knightley, economist at ING Financial Markets. ""However, in our view there is a good chance that they will raise rates by 25 basis points at both the November and December FOMC meetings to leave the Fed funds target rate at 2.25 per cent by year-end."" The dollar rallied as investors brushed aside comments by the Fed that inflationary pressures had eased, which had prompted some speculation that the central bank would try to hold back from further rate increases. But Treasury bond prices remained supported by the inflation comments, with the yield on ten-year paper hovering around 4 per cent, a five-month low. Gold gave back all of Tuesday's gains as the dollar staged its recovery. "
112,2004-09-21,2004-09-22,Financial Times (FT.Com),FT.com site : Dollar dips as Fed eases inflation concerns.,"The dollar hung around a four-week low against the euro in European morning trade on Wednesday in the aftermath of Tuesday's rate rise by the US Federal Reserve. The Fed, as expected, hiked rate for the third time this cycle, by 25 basis points to 1.75 per cent. However all eyes were on the accompanying statement, and many market participants seized on the suggestion that ""despite the rise in energy prices, inflation and inflation expectations have eased in recent months."" Some took this as a signal that the Fed might not, as most analysts previously predicted, deliver further rate hikes in both November and December. ""These comments reinforced the belief that the Federal Open Market Committee will withdraw policy accommodation only one more time this year, raising the federal funds rate an additional 0.25 point following either the November or the December meeting,"" said Paul Chertkow, head of global currency research at Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi, although Mr Chertkow himself does not subscribe to this view. Mr Chertkow added that: ""The characterisation of economic activity appeared less upbeat than the previous characterisation."" In August the FOMC had said that the US economy ""appears poised to resume a stronger pace of expansion"". On Tuesday that was replaced with ""output growth appears to gave regained some traction"". ""Although the dollar had been sold off earlier on position-squaring prior to the meeting, the market seemingly interpreted the Fed's statement as a signal that the Fed may skip a hike in its return, or potentially back away from hiking rather than accelerating the pace of hikes,"" added Robert Lynch, currency analyst at BNP Paribas. Thus, after 1.5c against the euro on Tuesday, the dollar remained in the doldrums at $1.2272. The greenback also remained weak at SFr1.2605 to the Swiss franc and C$1.2851 versus the Canadian dollar after hitting an eight-month low of $1.2827. The greenback did manage to firm to $1.7907 against sterling, however, with the pound undermined by the release of the minutes of the Bank of England monetary policy committee's meeting earlier this month. As expected, the MPC voted 9-0 to leave rates on hold, but the picture it painted of the UK economy was seen as a touch pessimistic. The committee said the pace of growth in the third quarter ""might be a little slower than had been envisaged"" and that recent labour market data had been ""surprisingly weak"". In addition, there was an ""increasing weight of evidence"" that the housing market was cooling. ""These minutes demonstrate a growing sense of comfort that earlier rate hikes are already doing enough to head off any inflationary bubble,"" said Daragh Maher, senior FX strategist at Calyon. ""Further signs of easing in the housing markets should also head off any hawkish fightback in October."" ""The minutes also mentioned a rising risk of an abrupt correction in the UK housing market, which do little to calm sterling sentiment,"" added Paul Mackel, currency strategist at ABN Amro. Sterling drifted lower to GBP0.6851 against the euro, SFr2.2576 versus the Swiss franc and A$2.5355 against the Australian dollar, a one-month low. "
113,2001-05-15,2001-05-16,Financial Times (FT.Com),Growth gamble.,"As the debate continues over the prospects for the US recovery, the Fed is taking no chances. Its statement on Tuesday called the half point cut in interest rates a response to continuing weakness of the economy at home and abroad and diminishing inflationary pressures. Its tone suggested that further cuts might be on the way. The Federal Open Market Committee's judgment on Tuesday was a difficult one. While Wall Street has been looking for the bottom of the downturn, the news from Main Street has been unremittingly negative. Profits in the first quarter of the year plunged, partly because of rising energy costs, but mostly because of waning demand. This week's industrial production figures added to the gloom. Worst hit have been the technology sector and business equipment manufacturers, victims of the slowdown in investment. But the pain is becoming widespread. Few industries are immune to flagging US demand. The speed of the industrial slowdown is beyond doubt. The problem for the Fed was to judge how worrying this really is. It is still possible that the US is experiencing a one-off adjustment to a period of exceptionally strong performance. In high-technology industries, for instance, output has been falling at a rate of around 1 percentage point per month since the start of the year, but in April it was still up nearly 20 per cent on an annual basis. It is also at least possible that changes in US business practice are having a telescoping effect. If so, this would help to explain the severity of the slowdown. For instance, while the past few months have shown the depressing effects of the inventory cycle, changing inventory management techniques have probably speeded up the adjustment. Likewise, the rapid decline in payroll employment may indicate that US firms are more willing to shed costs at an early stage, rather than hang on to staff for as long as possible. The other major factor which the Fed had to take into account was the relative strength in the household sector. Consumer confidence is no longer declining, and according to one measure may even be rising. April's retail sales figures were good. Wage growth is strong. These conditions might have made the Fed wary of seeming to take a chance with inflation by shoring up America's debt-ridden consumers - and, for that matter, the financial markets. But with Tuesday's decision, Alan Greenspan showed that despite the risks, his instincts still lie with supporting growth. Nonetheless, given the uncertainties, he would be well advised to pause before a further cut. "
114,1994-05-17,1994-05-18,Financial Times,LONDON STOCK EXCHANGE - COMPANY STATEMENTS ENCOURAGE A FIRM MARKET - MARKET REPORT.,"London stock markets closed firmly yesterday, taking their lead from the US Treasuries, but without news from the meeting of the Federal Reserve's Open Market Committee (FOMC). UK traders were hoping that before London opens today the Fed will have delivered the keenly desired 1/2 percentage point increase in its key interest rates, hopes fulfilled by the Fed's rates move last night. 'Anything less than a half-point rise will not please the market,' was the consensus view at last night's London close of trading. After a slow start, UK shares moved ahead and the FT-SE 100 Index closed 7.9 better at 3,123.5. Although trading volume was higher than on the previous day, traders stressed that it was a cautious session. Stocks were easier for much of the day but the Footsie once again bounced convincingly when it slipped towards the 3,100 area; the day's low was 3,106.8. A survey of the distributive trades by the Confederation of British Industry was favourably received. Although the awareness that the FOMC meeting would not even start until late in the London trading day inhibited activity in UK stocks, there were plenty of company trading statements to keep dealers on the alert. The FT-SE Mid 250 Index, which has shown itself both independent of and somewhat weaker than the FT-SE 100 in recent sessions, finished just 0.3 up at 3,707.2. Seaq volume of 638.5m shares compared with 671.7m on Monday when retail business was worth #1.43bn. Favourable trading comments from a handful of blue chip companies aided sentiment. Allied-Lyons and Hanson said the year had begun satisfactorily and BOC, seen as an industrial market leader, traded heavily after a very positive interim statement. The stock market remained hopeful that determined action by the Fed would at last settle nerves in the bond market and, by stabilising bond yields, enable the equity market to respond to improvement in corporate dividends and earnings. While the markets will remain on tenterhooks until there is news from the FOMC meeting, London today faces important data on the domestic economy. UK analysts expect these to confirm that domestic inflation has remained subdued, and thus ward off fears that UK base rates will be forced higher later this year. Building and construction issues rose after the latest official statistics showed new orders were 10% up from the 1993 first quarter. But there were further signs that investors are turning away from the engineering and vehicles sec-tors, believed by some analysts to have outrun the economic recovery. Progress was somewhat patchy elsewhere in the market, with the food and brewery stocks showing a mixed picture as investors waited for the March retail sales statistics. Pharmaceuticals stocks continued to move nervously as attention focused on SmithKline Beecham and investors pondered the likely effect of the expiry this week of US patents on Tagamet, SmithKline's high selling anti-ulcer drug. London outperformed other leading European stock markets yesterday and UK traders sounded relatively confident that the Footsie can at last climb away from 3,100, if only the bond markets can establish themselves in a new trading range. Strategists were encouraged by the increase in trading volume as the market rallied yesterday afternoon. (c) The Financial Times Limited 1994. "
115,1994-05-17,1994-05-18,Financial Times,GOVERNMENT BONDS - TREASURIES JUMP AFTER FED RAISES INTEREST RATES.,"After a morning of quiet anticipation, US Treasury bonds prices jumped yesterday afternoon on news that the Federal Reserve would lift short-term interest rates by 50 basis points. Late in the session, the benchmark 30-year government bond was 1 25/32 higher at 87 9/16, with the yield slipping about 20 basis points to 7.276%. At the short end, the two-year note was up 5/32 at 99 1/4, to yield 5.894%. In early activity, investors were unwilling to make any fresh commitments as most were convinced the Fed would raise rates again after a meeting of the policy-making Federal Open Market Committee in Washington. Although there was a general consensus that a policy move was imminent, there was disagreement among traders over how aggressively the central bank would act. Most believed the discount rate - which the Fed charges on loans to commercial banks - was due for an increase of 50 basis points. In its previous three moves this year, the central bank had left the discount rate unchanged. However, traders were divided on whether the Fed would lift its target for the Federal funds rate - charged by banks on overnight loans to one another - by 50 or 25 basis points. In each of the previous tightenings, the Fed chose the more timid of the two figures. In the event, it decided on a more aggressive approach, lifting both the discount rate and Fed funds target by 50 basis points, to 3.50% and 4.25% respectively. The market's response was immediate. The moves helped the long end of the yield curve by easing any lingering concern over inflationary pressures. Shorter-term securities benefited as well, because the bold strike appeared to dispel the uncertainty engendered by the Fed's earlier gradualism. The decisiveness of yesterday's move suggested it was the last in the current series. This view was reinforced by the central bank in its announcement of the policy change. 'These actions, combined with the three previous adjustments initiated earlier this year by the FOMC, substantially remove the degree of monetary accommodation which prevailed throughout 1993,' it said. Mr Alan Greenspan, the Fed's chairman, had said his goal was to shift the bank's policy until it had a 'neutral' impact on the economy. European trading was also overshadowed by the FOMC meeting, leaving most markets to drift sideways in moderate turnover. After tracking German bonds in the morning, French bonds spurted ahead in the afternoon. Some traders said this was caused by late short-covering in the futures pits in expectation of bond-positive news from the Fed. Moreover, investors were switching from Germany into France, said Mr Brian Hilliard, senior international economist at Societe Generale Strauss Turnbull in London. The June notional French bond future rose 0.34 points to close at 121.10. The June Bund future was down 0.16 points in after-hours trading at 95.67. In Germany, the focus today will be on the Bundesbank's latest allocation of securities repurchase agreements. German money market traders surveyed by MMS International expect the minimum rate to fall by 12 basis points to 5.23%. Trade in the UK government bond market was again quiet ahead of the results of the FOMC meeting and today's UK economic data. The market firmed in afternoon trading, largely on the back of strength in US Treasuries, The June long gilt futures contract was up 5/16 at 105 11/32 in after-hours trading. The Bank of England announcement that its May 25 gilt auction would be of #2bn of 7.0% 1997 stock, convertible into 9.0% 2012 stock, for the first time on August 6, drew little reaction 'This is a very uncertain issue,' said Mr Don Smith of Midland Global Markets. 'There is no other stock like it in the market, which makes pricing it very difficult.' But analysts said there would be sufficient demand. Today's release of UK average earnings and RPI data coincides with the publication of the minutes of the March meeting between the chancellor and the governor of the Bank of England. 'The avalanche of information could cause quite a choppy time in the markets, especially if there is a pick-up in earnings and inflation, and if there are signs of a disagreement between the chancellor and the governor,' said Mr Smith. The Italian bond market is awaiting today's vote of confidence in the Senate on prime minister Silvio Berlusconi's government. Although his coalition is short of a majority in the Senate, most observers expect him to scrape through. Meanwhile, technical distortions at the long end of the Italian yield curve have created buying opportunities, said Mr Jouni Kokko of S. G. Warburg. (c) The Financial Times Limited 1994. "
116,1994-05-17,1994-05-18,Financial Times,WORLD STOCK MARKETS (ASIA PACIFIC) - HESITANT TOKYO MILDLY EASIER.,"Tokyo Investors remained inactive ahead of the US Federal Reserve Board's Open Market Committee meeting, and the Nikkei 225 average declined on index linked selling by arbitrageurs, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. The index was finally 54.91 easier at 20,133.53 after a day's low of 20,067.41 and high of 20,174.93. A fall in futures prices on the overnight Chicago market prompted a bout of arbitrage selling earlier in the session. Small-lot buying by overseas investors later eroded some of the losses. Volume remained low, totalling 251m shares against 285m. The Topix index of all first section stocks dipped 2.58 to 1,636.43 and the Nikkei 300 lost 0.54 at 299.13. Declines led rises by 614 to 369, with 188 issues unchanged. In London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index was 1.19 firmer at 1,335.88. Market participants said many investors were still wary of any surprises from the spate of company earnings announcements and were reluctant to commit funds in spite of the yen's easing against the dollar. Meanwhile, technical indicators were also worrying some dealers. 'The three short term moving averages nearly converging, the lack of volatility and the very low volumes seem to be precursors of a sharp move up or down,' said Mr Yutaka Nakai, analyst at Daiwa Securities. High-technology stocks were higher on buying by foreign investors. Hitachi, the day's most active issue, rose Y 5 to Y 1,000 and Toshiba put on Y 3 at Y 798. Large-capital steels were also firmer, with Kawasaki Steel up Y 2 to Y 385. Some banks were lower on arbitrage selling. Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank slipped Y 10 to Y 1,950. Profit-taking depressed real estate and pharmaceuticals shares, previously bought as laggards. Mitsubishi Estate receded Y 20 to Y 1,220 and Takeda Chemical Y 30 to Y 1,230. The rise in gold and copper prices buoyed mining shares. Dowa Mining advanced Y 12 to Y 585 and Sumitomo Metal Mining added Y 13 at Y 925. The low volume encouraged individual investors' trading in speculative stocks. Ga-jo-en Kanko forged ahead Y 27 to Y 184 and Wakachiku Construction gained Y 9 at Y 669. Brother Industries, however, relinquished Y 13 to Y 706 on profit-taking. In Osaka, the OSE average shed 57.55 to 22,366.93 in volume of 20.4m shares. Aoyama Trading, the men's suits retailer, fell Y 120 to Y 4,180. Roundup Regional markets continued mixed, awaiting the outcome of yesterday's FOMC meeting. HONG KONG closed sharply lower as the brief detention of a prominent Beijing dissident raised worries about the renewal of China's Most Favoured Nation trade status with the US in a market already cautious about US interest rates. The Hang Seng index dropped 208.71, or 2.3%, to 9,044.70. Turnover came to HKDollars 4.88bn, against a revised HKDollars 4.10bn on Monday. The market was also speculating about a possible early agreement with China on financing Hong Kong's new airport, but news that the Sino-British Airport Committee will meet on Friday to discuss the issue emerged after the market close. Among blue chips, HSBC slid HKDollars 2.50 to HKDollars 83.50, China Light HKDollars 1 to HKDollars 40.75, Swire Pacific 'A' HKDollars 2 to HKDollars 55.50 and Hutchison HKDollars 1 to HKDollars 30.

Financials led the falls, with China Development down TDollars 3.5 to TDollars 129.5 and Cathay Life losing TDollars 6 to TDollars 257. SINGAPORE was steady with selective buying seen among blue chips. The Straits Times Industrial index finished 14.08 higher at 2,304.49. Shipyard stocks were firmer amid talk that a foreign brokerage was issuing covered warrants on a basket of shipyard companies. KUALA LUMPUR was easier after a moderate session, a spate of selling near the close having pushed the index down from an early high.

SEOUL turned higher in a technical rebound after its three-day consolidation, and the composite index improved 5.21 to 946.87 ahead of today's market holiday. MANILA rose strongly, helped by an overnight gain on Wall Street for PLDT, together with buying of San Miguel and Manila Electric. The composite index moved forward 34.20 to 2,936.43. Turnover was 950.4m pesos. PLDT put on 50 pesos at 1,955 pesos, San Miguel 'B' increased 5 pesos to 235 and Manila Electric added 5 pesos at 330. BOMBAY's 30-share index registered a 41.59 decline at 3,802.50 after index-weighted shares fell, but the broader market was steady after a dull session. Hopes remained high, however, that forward trading will be allowed to resume after a meeting of the Securities and Exchange Board of India on Friday. The old badla, or carry forward system, was banned in mid-March on the grounds that it led to excessive speculation.

117,1994-05-17,1994-05-18,Financial Times,WORLD STOCK MARKETS (EUROPE) - LUFTHANSA SHOWS FURTHER WEAKNESS IN GERMANY.,"The markets were generally lacklustre awaiting the outcome of yesterday's FOMC meeting. FRANKFURT moved into retreat as Monday's record levels failed to inspire a follow on of momentum. The Dax index eased back 11.40 to 2,259.71 during the official session. Turnover was DM 7.4bn. Sentiment was upset by news that Schneider debt was higher than anticipated, with estimates of between DM 3.5bn to DM 4bn. This report affected the banks who are exposed to the property group with Deutsche Bank, for example, slipping DM 10 to DM 781.50. Lufthansa continued to weaken on a further round of selling following disappointment over its results on Monday, the shares down a further DM 11.30 to DM 190.20, bringing accumulated losses since the start of the week to 8%. In contrast, Volkswagen rose DM 3.20 to DM 528.70 on news that it was extending working hours at some plants. Nikko Europe issued a buy recommendation earlier in the week, noting that the restructuring programmes should begin to bear fruit in the near term. Furthermore, said Nikko, 'Seat should report a considerable reduction in last year's loss of DM 1.8bn, with a return to profit in 1995 the target'. PARIS took a long look at Eurotunnel which held a shareholders meeting yesterday to approve its rights issue plans. The group lost FFr 1.30 to FFr 35.10 but off a session low of FFr 34.70 as the CAC-40 index rose 7.47 to 2,195.17. Turnover was a moderate FFr 3.7bn. Oil stocks were active as Merrill Lynch added Elf Aquitaine and OMV to its stock selection list and deleted Total and Repsol. Of the French groups Elf was FFr 2.70 stronger at FFr 429.70 while Total shed FFr 4.90 to FFr 342.10. Lyonnaise des Eaux-Dumez, down FFr 12 at FFr 598, denied that it was planning to raise fresh capital, while Club Med slipped FFr 1.90 to FFr 446.10 as it forecast a better first half result. MILAN began the new account in resilient mood, the Comit index rising 11.89 or 1.5% to 801.62, as worries subsided about the outcome of today's parliamentary confidence vote. Blue chips led the advance. Generali rose L1,567 or 3.3% to L48,470, Fiat advanced L149 to L7,188 and Olivetti was L128 or 4.5% higher at L3,003. Ciga, the hotels group advanced L76 or 6.8% to L1,188 in heavy volume of 36m shares amid speculation about stock building as its rights issue sold out. Ferruzzi put on L149 or 7.1% to L2,233 as the company launched its L1,340bn rights issue. Cir rose L134 or 4.7% to L2,994 as its L1,060bn rights issue began, although technical problems blocked business in the rights throughout the session. ZURICH continued on the upward track as domestic buying, and an absence of foreign selling, took the SMI index 18.1 higher to 2,727.1. Roche certificates added SwFr 155 to SwFr 6,705 as presentations to analysts yesterday and on Monday were well received and details of the Syntex takeover appeared to be positive. The certificates have picked up 9% since their low on May 9, following 1993 figures and the Syntex acquisition. However, analysts noted that yesterday's demand came from Swiss banks, buying for their own account, and that sentiment remained fragile. Nestle, another recent weak performer, rose SwFr 20 to SwFr 1,135, on the perception that recent falls had been overdone. Brown Boveri rose SwFr 13 to SwFr 1,275 ahead of today's first quarter figures, with some analysts forecasting a rise of up to 75% in profit. STOCKHOLM maintained a strong run with Astra featuring ahead of first quarter results that came out after the close of business. The Affarsvarlden general index added 7.70 to 1,552.50. Turnover was SKr2.6bn. Astra reported a 15% rise in first quarter pretax profits - the B shares ended the day up SKr1 at SKr161. Volvo, which releases its first quarter figures today, picked up SKr13 in the B shares to SKr758. AMSTERDAM struggled to find some incentive to move and, with the exception of a Fl 2.30 loss in KLM to Fl 53.20, due in partly to profit-taking following good gains last week, the AEX index finished the session just 0.81 ahead at 413.81. MADRID overcame some early profit-taking with late demand taking the general index up 0.71 to finish at the day's high of 334.91 in heavy turnover of Pta36.59bn. Banks, however, remained under pressure with Banesto Pta25 easier at Pta1,120. Argentaria lost Pta100 to Pta6,000 and Santander was marked Pta80 lower at Pta6,350. Agroman, the construction company, was the day's leader, rising Pta75 to Pta825. ISTANBUL rose 3.55% on a technical rebound following a reduction in interest rates. The composite index put on 549.02 to 16,032.68. On Monday the index lost 1%. ATHENS ended slightly lower in light trading as investors remained worried about the prospect of devaluation. The general share index lost 7.95 at 944.94. Turnover was Dkr2.7bn. Written and edited by Michael Morgan and John Pitt (c) The Financial Times Limited 1994. "
118,2002-03-19,2002-03-20,Financial Times,THE AMERICAS - Roll call of voting fuels Fed drive to openness.,"Yesterday's statement by the Federal Reserve announcing its decision to keep interest rates unchanged while adopting a more neutral stance on future action was pretty typical as far as these statements go, except for a strange new addition: a roll call listing who voted for and against the decision. It might have marked a small step toward greater transparency, a move by Alan Greenspan to amass more power as Fed chairman, neither or both. The Fed usually waits until the second day after the subsequent FOMC meeting before releasing the vote tally from its latest meeting. But in a break with tradition the Fed immediately announced yesterday how all 10 members of its policy-making Federal Open Market Committee voted, instead of waiting until May 9, two days after the next scheduled meeting. The measure is seen as the latest in a succession in recent years to improve the transparency of central bank decision-making. Economists were generally pleased. ""The Fed has become more transparent since the early 1990s - they didn't used to make public pronouncements, they used to release FOMC minutes much later and they never released full transcripts, and now we get them with a five-year delay - so this represents another move in that direction,"" said Joseph Lavorgna, senior economist with Deutsche Banc Alex. Brown. An internal analysis published last year by the Fed does suggest the central bank has become more open during Mr Greenspan's tenure - or at least easier to decipher. It cites statistical evidence showing financial markets had become much better at anticipating policy changes from 1994-2000 compared with 1989-1994. But Alan Greenspan, the Fed chairman, has said the central bank faces trade-offs in becoming ever-more transparent. In a speech last October to central bankers and economists in St. Louis, the Fed chairman sought to address occasional criticism that the Fed is too secretive. That secrecy is said to exacerbate financial market volatility and inefficiency and put the central bank's inflation-fighting credibility at unnecessary long-term risk. Mr Greenspan said that duty to become more transparent, and thus more accountable, sometimes conflicted with the Fed's other responsibility: to make good decisions. He said deliberations would be less free-flowing and fruitful if members knew remarks would immediately be made public. Mr Greenspan's past hesitation helped spawn some conspiracy theories about the release of the roll call yesterday. One former senior Fed official, who asked not to be named, called it a power grab by Mr Greenspan intended to stifle dissent from members wishing to avoid media scrutiny. ""The announcement effectively gives more power to the chairman because you don't want to look like a dissenter,"" said one observer.

119,2002-03-19,2002-03-20,Financial Times,THE AMERICAS - US rates unchanged as risks diminish FEDERAL RESERVE ECONOMY EXPANDING.,"The Federal Reserve left interest rates unchanged yesterday but said for the first time in more than a year it no longer saw US economic risks as skewed towards further weakness. The US central bank's policymaking open market committee left its key overnight interest rate - the target for the federal funds rate - unchanged at 1.75 per cent. But for the first time since November 2000, the FOMC shifted its ""tilt"" of monetary policy - the assessment of the balance of risks between inflation and recession. It said policymakers now believed the risks were evenly balanced. The committee said: ""The information that has become available since the last meeting indicates that the economy, bolstered by a marked swing in inventory investment, is expanding at a significant pace. Nonetheless, the degree of the strengthening in final demand over coming quarters, an essential element in sustained economic expansion, is still uncertain."" Financial market attention immediately shifted to the question of when the Fed will start raising interest rates. Recent statistics suggest the economy is in the early stages of what looks increasingly like a robust recovery from the most fleeting of recessions last year. Futures markets expect the Fed funds rate to rise by at least 100 basis points in the course of this year, with the first increase coming perhaps as soon as the Fed's next meeting in May. Consumer spending rose in January and in the same month businesses ended the rundown in inventories that was a key factor in the downturn. In February, the economy recorded the first increase in industrial production in nearly two years and the first rise in employment since last summer. But the Fed faces a tricky task of steering monetary policy back to normality after it cut interest rates throughout last year more aggressively than at any time in the last 20 years. If a firm recovery is indeed under way, short-term interest rates will need to rise from the current emergency levels. Most economists estimate that a neutral level for the federal funds rate - meaning one that is neither stimulative nor restrictive - is around 3 to 4 per cent at current rates of inflation. Alan Greenspan, the Fed chairman, and his colleagues have expressed concern about the likely tempo of the recovery. Few economists inside or outside the Fed believe growth in the current quarter, which could turn out as high as 5 per cent at an annualised rate, will be sustained through the rest of the year. * The US trade gap widened in January at the fastest pace in nearly three years as the US rapidly emerged from recession with a renewed appetite for imports, Peronet Despeignes adds. The Commerce Department said yesterday the monthly trade deficit grew by 15.4 per cent in January - the biggest increase since February 1999 - to $28.5bn ( #20bn). Exports dipped slightly, but imports jumped at the second fastest pace since the economic slowdown began in March 2000. The apparent resumption of the import binge is good news for a number of countries, particularly in Asia, which are heavily reliant on exports to the US, but it has revived concerns about the threat the deficit poses to the US economy and trade relations.

120,2002-03-19,2002-03-20,Financial Times,CAPITAL MARKETS - Treasuries rise as Fed sits tight.,"US Treasuries were mostly higher yesterday after the Federal Reserve's Open Market Committee left the funds rate unchanged at 1.75 per cent but said that future risks ""are balanced"" The bond market had been expecting the Fed to change its balance of risks assessment to neutral, given positive data in recent weeks suggesting a rebounding economy. Previously the Fed had said risks were titled towards weakness. The Fed said that the economy is expanding ""at a significant pace"" although it warned that the degree of strengthening in final demand ""is still uncertain."" Treasuries fell early yesterday but after the FOMC meeting the 10-year note was up 1/32 to 96 3/4 with a yield of 5.296 per cent and the 30-year bond had risen 3/16 to 95 1/16 to yield 5.718 per cent. The two-year note was unchanged at 98 29/32 with a yield of 3.585 per cent. Eurozone government bond prices were flat as investors showed little reaction to another rise in the ZEW index, a measure of German economic sentiment, which improved for the fifth consecutive month in February. Instead, bond investors were waiting for the outcome of yesterday's FOMC meeting to provide further confirmation of the strength of the US economic recovery. The two-year German schatz yield was down half a basis point to 4.249 per cent, while the yield on the 10-year German bund yield was also slightly lower at 5.199 per cent. The 10-year German bund futures price was up 0.05 to 105.22. Nervous trading ahead of the FOMC meeting sent UK gilts down, with the 10-year note yielding 5.252 per cent, just short of one basis point higher than Monday. Japanese government bonds were little changed as traders were reluctant to send the yield down too low ahead of today's 10-year cash JGB auction. The Ministry of Finance will auction Y1,800bn worth of 10-year JGBs today and investors are looking for a 1.5 per cent coupon, dealers said. Bonds may be supported by fresh money after the new financial year begins on April 1. Gains may be capped, however, because of this year's increased bond issuance and a lingering concern that Moody's could downgrade Japan's sovereign debt. The key June 10-year JGB futures contract slipped 0.05 to 137.64; the benchmark No 237 10-year cash JGB edged up 0.043 to 100.524, pushing the yield down 0.20 to 1.44. "
121,2002-03-19,2002-03-20,Financial Times (FT.Com),Fed keeps rates level as economic risks lessen.,"The Federal Reserve left interest rates unchanged on Tuesday but signalled there was a growing possibility that rates would rise later in the year. The central bank's open market committee left its key overnight interest rate, the target for the federal funds rate, unchanged at 1.75 per cent. But for the first time since November 2000, the FOMC shifted its assessment of the balance of risks between inflation and recession, saying they were now evenly balanced - a hint that the Fed is moving closer to raising rates. After its meeting the FOMC said: ""Information ... indicates that the economy ... is expanding at a significant pace. Nonetheless, the degree of the strengthening ... an essential element in sustained economic expansion, is still uncertain."" The decision had been anticipated and US stocks were little changed. Market attention shifted to the question of when the Fed will start raising rates. Recent statistics suggest the economy is in the early stages of what looks increasingly like a robust recovery from the most fleeting of recessions last year. Futures markets expect the Fed funds rate to rise by at least 100 basis points this year. Consumer spending rose in January and in February the economy had its first increase in industrial production in nearly two years and the first rise in employment since last summer. But the Fed faces a tricky task steering monetary policy back to normality after it cut interest rates throughout last year, more aggressively than at any time in the last 20 years. If a firm recovery is under way, short-term interest rates will need to rise from the present emergency levels. Most economists estimate that a neutral level for the federal funds rate - one that is neither stimulative nor restrictive - is close to 4 per cent at current rates of inflation. In announcing its decision on Tuesday the Fed for the first time also published how each FOMC member voted. Previously, Fed-watchers had to wait for publication of the minutes, six to eight weeks after the meeting, to find out who supported or opposed the move. Tuesday's statement said all 10 members of the committee supported the decision to leave rates unchanged. "
122,1998-05-19,1998-05-20,Financial Times,Fed hopes lift Dax to record.,"Early strength on Wall Street and a growing conviction that the Fed's open market committee would leave US interest rates unchanged sent FRANKFURT into record territory. The Xetra Dax index peaked at an intra-day 5,446.03 before edging back in late electronic trade to close 97.34 or 1.8% higher at a record 5,441.00. Financials regained ground lost on Monday as concerns eased about political unrest in Indonesia. Deutsche Bank put on DM 4 to DM 157.30, Dresdner Bank 95pfg to DM 101.90 and Allianz DM 20.60 to DM 585.50. RWE was an outperformer, rising DM 5.10 to DM 94.80 as the market continued to take a upbeat view on its nine-month results. Viag rose DM 32.10 to DM 966.10 in response to slightly better than expected 1997 and first-quarter results. BMW stood out among the motor stocks with a rise of DM 86.60 to DM 2,028. PARIS climbed to within a whisker of 4,000 on the CAC 40 index before closing 35.53 higher at 3,980.84 in some of the best volume of the year with 27.3m shares changing hands. Lagarde`re rose FFr 8 to FFr 242.10 following positive statements at the annual meeting, and France Telecom, the day's top performer, gained FFr 15.50 or 4.9% to FFr 335 in turnover of FFr 785m. Banks put aside Monday's worries about Asian exposure and a possible rise for US interest rates. BNP gained FFr 9 to FFr 508 and SocieteGene rale FFr 52 to FFr 1,218. Danone added FFr 19 to FFr 1,525 on optimism from the annual meet ing. News of a property disposal lifted Axa-UAP FFr 17 to FFr 699. Oil tracked softer oil prices with Elf Aquitaine dipping FFr 14 to FFr 850 and Total, where sentiment was not helped by news of plans for a temporary closure of Dutch refining capacity, shed FFr 21 to FFr 748. ZURICH recovered after Monday's 2% fall but activity was subdued as investors awaited news of US interest rates. The SMI index climbed 111.8 or 1.5% to 7,483.2. The pharmaceutical heavyweights, which saw selling on Monday, were among the biggest gainers. Roche certificates recouped SwFr 200 to SwFr 14,990 and Novartis SwFr 53 at SwFr 2,444. Financials were higher in spite of lingering concerns about the outlook for US interest rates. UBS climbed SwFr 41 to SwFr 2,546 and its merger partner, SBC, gained SwFr 8 to SwFr 548. SMH bearers were marked SwFr 42 higher to SwFr 1,247 after Merrill Lynch issued a strong buy recommendation on the stock and set a price target of SwFr 1,500. AMSTERDAM pushed higher as concerns about US interest rates were put on hold and a number of strong corporate stories supported sentiment. The AEX index ended 25.83 better at 1,177.40. KLM surged Fl 3.30 to Fl 79.80 ahead of what are widely expected to be soar-away results today. Ahold jumped Fl 3.70 or 5.7% to Fl 68.50 after a major expansion of US interests. The group is bidding $3bn for Giant Food, and Ahold yesterday combined the takeover news with an upbeat trading statement. ASM Lithography rose Fl 2.70 to Fl 84 and rival techs group Baan gained Fl 2.40 to Fl 92.70. Steel giant Hoogovens was a dull feature, slipping Fl 2.30 to Fl 903.50. MILAN rebounded almost 3%, boosted by the gains on Wall Street as the FOMC meeting got underway. The real-time Mibtel index climbed 677 to 23,830. Telecom Italia and ENI were boosted by the US-European Union accord to head off sanctions on trade with Cuba, Iran and Libya. Telecom Italia, which operates in Cuba, jumped L477 to L13,250 while ENI was L335 higher at L12,230. Alitalia jumped L1,276 to L7,750 on the second day of its capital-raising exercise as investors continued buying a stock widely seen as having significant turnaround potential. The banks were stronger. Banca di Roma rose L96 to L3,670, calling a halt to its slide over the previous two sessions, which followed disappointment that no merger with BCI was planned. BCI was L328 higher at L10,005. Generali jumped L2,091 to L54,900 as Morgan Stanley recommended the stock and set a price target of L65,000 based on the strength of the company in the domestic market and the insurer's prospects in Europe. MADRID was supported by another active session for Endesa, where retail demand stayed strong ahead of next month's formal pricing of the $8bn international privatisation offer. Shares in the utility rose Pta 110 to Pta 3,660 after it was learned that retail investors had already bid more than 1.5 times their allocation of 70% of the total issue. At the close, the general index was 12.72 higher at 868.43. MOSCOW regained its footing after the sharp falls of the past week and the RTS index ended 8.97 higher at 236.58. The rebound came after the central bank stepped in to impose sharp rises in the key refinancing and Lombard rates, which calmed government securities and eased fears in the stock market.

123,1998-05-19,1998-05-20,Financial Times,Gilts take centre stage as Fed holds rates.,"UK gilts stole the show in European bond markets yesterday, see-sawing in reaction to UK inflation figures as other markets held their fire pending a decision from the Federal Reserve on US interest rates. Investors were seen holding back until this morning before taking positions, although the consensus - rightly, as it proved - was for no change in US rates. Analysts said markets were looking further ahead to the release tomorrow of the Federal open market committee's March minutes for indications of any shift in underlying sentiment. Markets ended higher across the board but were locked in tight ranges, having apparently shrugged off the latest political developments in Indonesia. US TREASURY bond prices remained largely unchanged in quiet trading yesterday morning in New York, as traders marked time ahead of the Fed committee meeting. The benchmark 30-year bond was 1/32 higher, at 102 25/32, in early afternoon trading in New York, putting the yield at 5.924%. Two-year notes were unchanged at 100 1/16, leaving the yield at 5.589%. Bond prices held on to their gains of the day before, which followed the rising dollar. The long bond yield remains about 10 basis points below its level of late last month, reflecting receding fears that a US rate rise might be imminent and a partial return of its status as a safe haven. UK GILTS initially took fright at higher than expected retail price index data, falling sharply after it appeared these spelled a resurgence of inflation and concern over a possible interest rate rise. The statistics office said headline inflation hit a six-year high of 4%, up from 3.5% in March. In addition, the April retail price index came in above forecasts at 3%, against a forecast of between 2.8% and 2.9%. That, coupled with last week's average earnings data which showed a bigger rise than had been expected, helped stoke fears that the Bank of England's year-end inflation target of 2.5% may be unrealistic. The short end of the yield curve saw some flattening as short-dated bonds were hit, with economists predicting more of the same if tomorrow's retail sales figures are perceived as strong. However, gilts recovered after concluding the headline figure was boosted by Budget items and that there were still no convincing reasons to alter current views on interest rates. ""For once I think the markets are listening to the economists rather than the headlines. It's clear the acceleration in the headline index is a one-off,"" said Julian Jessop, European economist at Nikko. Nevertheless, there are still lingering fears that the headline figure may encourage wage deals that are inflationary. Yesterday, retailer Marks &Spencer fuelled such concerns by announcing a a 5.25% staff pay rise. ""It (today's official data) doesn't change our view that interest rates are more likely to remain at 7.25% for the rest of the year than to rise, but the risks are still on the upside,"" said Steven Andrew, gilt strategist at Merrill Lynch. ""The problem is that the higher number may feed through to inflationary pressures at a later stage. The ball we should be watching is the labour market."" The June gilt future settled 11 basis points higher at 107.78 with 76,000 contracts traded. Figures showing that the government had been able to repay #3.4bn in debt - largely thanks to robust tax revenues - was seen pushing gilt prices higher, as it would reduce the need for further auctions and point to the prospect of scarce supply. The spread over German bunds narrowed to 104 from the previous day's 105 basis points. BUNDS ended higher, hardly reacting to comments by Ernest Welteke, a Bundesbank council member, warning a small interest rate rise could not be ruled out, though it was too early to speculate when to make any adjustment. The IFO business climate data were slightly weaker than expected but analysts said the market had already priced this into their expectations, as weak production data had told a similar story last week. The June bund future settled 13 basis points higher at 106.95 after nudging technical resistance at 106.98. Copyright Financial Times Limited 1998. All Rights Reserved.

124,2005-05-03,2005-05-04,Financial Times,Fed's error highlights policy role of inflation.,"Few 150-word statements are read as widely and as closely as the one accompanying the Federal Reserve's interest rate decisions. The fact that the Fed yesterday chose to own up to an error - and face criticism from traders - demonstrated the importance of making a judgment on inflation expectations in setting monetary policy. The seven words the Fed omitted just after 2.15pm, and reinserted just before 4pm, amounted to the same judgment given in each of its previous four meetings: ""Longer-term inflation expectations remain well contained."" Well behaved inflation expectations, together with still robust productivity growth, have allowed the central bank to proceed in ""measured"" quarter point increments as it has raised its target federal funds rate from 1 per cent last June to 3 per cent yesterday. ""If inflation expectations rise, then that's how you get inflation embedded in wage demands and the pricing system,"" said Joshua Feinman, chief economist at Deutsche Asset Management. ""This is the kind of pernicious inflation they want to avoid."" Having to resort to more aggressive rate increases would have disturbed financial markets considerably more than yesterday's error. The Fed looks at various measures of inflation expectations, including the spread between the yield on the 10-year Treasury note and the yield on Treasury inflation-protected securities. Alan Greenspan, Fed chairman, favours a measure based on disaggregating long-term interest rates, using information from futures markets, to see what inflation expectations look like in each of the next 10 years. Such measures remained reassuring, economists said yesterday. However, the Fed also pays close attention to surveys of consumer expectations. The Michigan survey, released last week, indicated just the kind of increase in long-term expectations that the Fed does not want to see. Yesterday's mistake was embarrassing for a central bank that has placed such emphasis on its communication with markets as a means of driving policy. The Fed said human error was to blame. A spokesman declined to comment on whether the confusion followed a discussion among members of the Federal Open Market Committee as to whether the assurance was still warranted. But the other change on the inflation language did - purposefully - indicate increased concern about inflation pressure. The FOMC dropped its judgment that higher headline inflation was not feeding into higher core inflation. Fed policymakers have been relatively relaxed about the high headline inflation rate, driven by the oil price. But there is growing concern over possible effects on business pricing decisions as well as consumer expectations. Ian Shepherdson, at High Frequency Economics, said the net effect of the corrected statement was to make the Fed's message a bit less stark. But, he added in a note to clients, the clear signal remained that: rates were still too low; inflation pressures were building; and the slowdown was nothing like severe enough to induce a pause in the rate increases. The solid pace of spending growth might have slowed a bit, the statement said, but this was in large part the result of high energy prices. At most this suggested the Fed sees the recent lull as another soft-patch, similar to the short-lived slowdown last summer. Hardening the language on inflation offset the Fed's acknowledgement of recent weaker economic data. Since the FOMC does not meet again until the end of June, it has plenty of time to watch the data. Mickey Levy, chief economist at Bank of America, said in prescient fashion after the first version of yesterday's statement was issued: ""I would not emphasise the tweaking of the language as much as the fact that, after eight rate increases, the Fed acknowledged that policy remains accommodative and said it will continue to raise rates at a measured pace.""

125,2005-05-03,2005-05-04,Financial Times,Fed correction adds to volatility GOVERNMENT BONDS.,"The Federal Open Market Committee raised short-term interest rates yesterday for the eighth successive time, by 0.25 per cent to 3 per cent. But the Fed put markets on a roller-coaster ride as it corrected the wording of its statement at about 4pm in New York. Prices of 10-year Treasury bonds fell initially, but then rose after the FOMC added words that suggested a benign view on longer-term inflation to its statement. The 10-year Treasuries were yielding 4.16 per cent in late afternoon trading, down from 4.19 per cent. The text of the FOMC's statement once again suggested interest rate hikes might continue at a ""measured"" pace. Overall, the wording leaves the Fed with flexibility to act ""the way they see fit"" in the light of future economic signals, said John Roberts, managing director at Barclays Capital. Stronger-than-expected data on factory orders prompted selling of bonds before the FOMC announcement but did little to clarify conflicting signals about the economic outlook emerging from the world's largest economy in recent weeks. Activity was muted in the eurozone and UK government bond markets ahead of the Fed decision. But yields on eurozone government bonds hit new historic lows as market expectations for a rate hike this year dimmed. The yield on the 10-year Bund reached 3.373 per cent before rising to 3.376 per cent, down 2.2bp on the day. The two-year Schatz was 2.2bp lower at 2.213 per cent. Though the European Central Bank was widely expected to keep rates steady at 2 per cent when it makes its announcement today, the steady stream of gloomy economic news has stirred murmurings in the market of a possible cut in interest rates later this year. ""The absence of a turnround in the labour market in Germany, and in the eurozone more generally, will therefore be an added reason for the ECB to keep rates on hold this year,"" said Julien Seetharamdoo, economist at Capital Economics. Concerns on growth also came to the fore in the UK, where retailers reported the worst sales volume for over 10 years in April, while data showed that the manufacturing sector had contracted for the first time in almost two years. As a result, prices of gilts rose and yields on the 10-year bond fell 2.9bp to 4.508 per cent, while the two-year gilt yield also lost 2.9bp to 4.483 per cent. Markets in Japan were closed for public holidays. "
126,2005-05-03,2005-05-04,Financial Times,Factory orders data spur selling GOVERNMENT BONDS.,"Trading in the US Treasury market was light and prices stayed within a narrow range yesterday as traders awaited the interest rate decision from the US Federal Open Market Committee. Stronger-than-expected data on factory orders prompted some selling of bonds but did little to clarify conflicting signals about the economic outlook emerging from the world's largest economy in recent weeks. So while it was widely expected that the Federal Reserve would raise short-term interest rates by 0.25 per cent to 3 per cent - to make it the eighth successive increase - investors were poised to react to any change in the outlook on inflation and economic growth, or in the Fed's ""measured"" approach to interest rate rises in the accompanying statement. Ahead of the Fed announcement, yields on 10-year Treasuries were unchanged at 4.198 per cent during New York's mid-afternoon trading. The yield on the two-year note was yielding 3.637 per cent. Activity was also muted in the eurozone and UK government bond markets ahead of the Fed decision. But yields on eurozone government bonds hit new historic lows as market expectations for a rate hike this year dimmed. The yield on the 10-year Bund reached 3.373 per cent before rising slightly to 3.376 per cent, down 2.2bp on the day. The two-year Schatz was also 2.2bp lower at 2.213 per cent. Though the European Central Bank was widely expected to keep rates steady at 2 per cent when it makes its announcement today, the steady stream of gloomy economic news has stirred murmurings in the market of a possible cut in interest rates later this year. ""The absence of a turnround in the labour market in Germany, and in the eurozone more generally, will therefore be an added reason for the ECB to keep rates on hold this year,"" said Julien Seetharamdoo, economist at Capital Economics. Concerns about growth also came to the fore in the UK, where retailers reported the worst sales volume for over 10 years in April, while data showed that the manufacturing sector had contracted for the first time in almost two years. As a result, prices of gilts rose and yields on the 10-year bond fell 2.9bp to 4.508 per cent, while the two-year gilt yield also lost 2.9bp to 4.483 per cent.

127,2005-05-03,2005-05-04,Financial Times,Fed raises rates another quarter point FOMC MEETING.,"The US Federal Reserve signalled no change in its strategy yesterday, as it raised its target federal funds rate another quarter point to 3 per cent and said it would continue raising rates at a ""measured"" pace. The Federal Open Market Committee acknowledged recent weaker economic data, in its accompanying statement, but also hardened its language on inflation pressures. Fed policymakers had indicated in the run-up to the meeting that inflation remained the committee's primary concern. The Fed repeated in the statement that monetary policy remained ""accommodative"" and that it expected to continue removing this accommodation ""at a pace that is likely to be measured"". Rather than attempting to influence market expectations, the committee can be seen as leaving itself with flexibility to respond to the incoming data, while signalling that it will press ahead with rate increases. The federal funds rate, at 3 per cent, is still seen as too low to be consistent with price stability over time. The FOMC does not meet again until the end of June, a two-day meeting at which members will update their individual economic forecasts ahead of Fed chairman Alan Greenspan's twice-yearly testimony before Congress. Financial markets were little changed following yesterday's announcement. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note has declined significantly since March, and stock markets have been weak as investors have reacted to the recent weaker signs on consumer and business spending. The Fed said ""recent data suggest that the solid pace of spending growth has slowed somewhat, partly in response to the earlier increases in energy prices"". It added that the labour market continued to improve gradually. But it signalled its concern about inflation, repeating that ""pressures on inflation have picked up in recent months"". The Fed also removed its judgment, given at its March meeting, that the rise in energy prices ""has not notably fed through to core consumer prices"". It also deleted from its statement the judgment that it saw inflation expectations as remaining ""well-contained"", an assurance it has given at its last four meetings. Fed policymakers have been relatively relaxed about the high headline inflation rate, driven by the oil price, but the concern is that there will start to be second-round effects on business pricing decisions and consumer inflation expectations. Mickey Levy, chief economist at Bank of America, said: ""I would not emphasise the tweaking of the language as much as the fact that, after eight rate increases the Fed acknowledged that policy remains accommodative and said it will continue to raise rates at a measured pace."" The minutes of past meetings suggest that though some policymakers are not comfortable with maintaining the forward-looking guidance, the bulk of committee members do not think it reduces their flexibility to raise rates more aggressively than quarter-point increases, or pause the tightening campaign. "
128,2005-05-03,2005-05-04,Financial Times (FT.Com),FT.com site : Fed policy watchers find language less helpful.,"Since the Federal Reserve started to provide explicit forward-looking guidance in late 2003 it has repeatedly increased its flexibility to respond to events. Some economists think maximum flexibility has been achieved and the forward-looking language is no longer providing much guidance. Paul McCulley, Fed-watcher at Pimco, the giant bond fund, said: ""The statement has been tortured to the point where it is not particularly illuminating now."" When it raised rates to 3 per cent this week, the Federal Open Market Committee maintained that monetary policy remained ""accommodative"" or too low to be consistent with price stability over time. It also said that it expected to continue with a ""measured"" pace of tightening, generally seen as indicating quarter-point increases, but which most Fed policymakers see as consistent with more aggressive rate increases or with no change at the next meeting. It acknowledged the recent slower economic data, while linking this to earlier increases in energy prices, and also increased inflation risks, acknowledging implicitly that energy prices were now feeding into increased core inflationary pressures. Balanced growth and inflation risks are predicated on its assumption of appropriate monetary action. ""Their statement is loaded with contingencies now. The market is getting much more uncertain about where the Fed is going in the next few months,"" said Ethan Harris, chief US economist at Lehman Brothers. Before the recent spate of weaker economic data, futures markets were pricing in a 4 per cent federal funds rate at the end of the year, implying continuing quarter-point increases and just one pause, probably in thin trading before Christmas. The market is now pricing in close to 3.75 per cent at year end and hardly higher during 2006. However, Lehman's ""Fediscope"" model which provides the probability of different outcomes based on futures market pricing and risk spreads points to a 40 per cent chance of a 3.5 per cent federal funds rate after the September meeting, a 26 per cent chance of 3.75 per cent and a 22 per cent chance of 3.25 per cent. That is probably just how the Fed wants it, given the uncertainty in the economic outlook. If over the two months before its next meeting the data show that the slowdown in growth is more than a soft patch, or that inflation risks demand decisive action, the Fed can act accordingly. For now, the market is playing a useful stabilising role. ""Given the recent softness in the data, committee members are probably thankful that the market is not pricing in too much tightening and that broad financial conditions are accommodative. Six weeks ago they were more concerned that their interest rate increases were getting more traction,"" said Brian Sack, at Macroeconomic Advisers, the consultancy. Macroeconomic Advisers, along with many professional forecasters, expects a more aggressive Fed, with stronger growth later in the year leading to a federal funds rate climbing to 4.5 per cent next year. A number of Fed-watchers suggest that the June meeting, before chairman Alan Greenspan's twice-yearly testimony before Congress, will be when the committee chooses to make significant changes to its statement. Mr McCulley, who thinks the Fed has almost finished raising rates, said he expected the Fed to take the same approach as in May 1994, when the statement declared it had ""substantially removed"" its policy accommodation. ""What I think we are coming up to, most likely at the end of June, is that they declare that they have substantially removed accommodation,"" he said, at the same time as they dropped the measured pace language. ""Then Mr Greenspan can take a bow at his final Humphrey Hawkins testimony in July."" "
129,2005-05-03,2005-05-04,Financial Times (FT.Com),FT.com site : Market Overview: Stocks buoyed by GM and Fed.,"World stock markets moved higher on Wednesday in the wake of a widely-expected rise in US interest rates, with Wall Street further boosted by some positive news on General Motors. But the dollar weakened across the board as the Federal Reserve's accompanying statement prompted speculation that it could take an earlier than expected pause in tightening policy. The US central bank lifted its main lending rate by 25 basis points to 3 per cent - the eighth quarter point rise since last June. It said that long-term inflation remained contained but acknowledged that spending had slowed in the face of high energy prices. That left economists debating how much further rates would rise. ""Despite both recent inflation and activity data giving the Fed a nasty surprise, the FOMC statement showed little change,"" said Tim Drayson at ABN Amro. ""The Fed believes growth will remain robust. We think the growth and inflation trade-off is deteriorating. Either way, the Fed must continue tightening."" But Stephen Roach, chief economist at Morgan Stanley, argued that rates might be at their peak. ""If the US economy were truly healthy, the Fed should target the federal funds rate in the 5 to 5.5 per cent zone,"" he said. ""However, with America's cyclical impetus now fading, post-bubble fault lines could deepen - making it all but impossible for the Fed to normalize real interest rates. This week could mark the Fed's last rate hike of this cycle."" By midday in New York, the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the S&P 500 index were both up 0.7 per cent. Dow component General Motors raced ahead after billionaire investor Kirk Kerkorian said he would buy a significant stake in the ailing company. In Europe, the FTSE Eurofirst 300 index rose 0.6 per cent to 1,075.03. The European Central Bank's decision to leave its key interest rate unchanged at 2 per cent came as no surprise to investors. Jean-Claude Trichet, the ECB president, ruled out any cut in rates in spite of flagging economic growth in the eurozone, helping to push European government bond yields off historic lows. Tokyo remained shut for the Golden Week holiday, although Hong Kong climbed to an eight-week high as local banks left their prime rates unchanged despite the Fed's move. The dollar fell to a six-week low against the yen as the Fed's statement disappointed those who had expected more hawkish comments and the Japanese currency continued to find support from speculation about a possible revaluation of the Chinese renminbi. The US currency also eased back from Tuesday's two-week high against the euro, although it trimmed its decline following some shock news from the bond market. The US Treasury said it was considering bringing back the 30-year note, three-and-a-half years since ceasing issuance, sending long-dated bonds tumbling. The prospect of new supply sent the yield on 30-year paper soaring, while 10-year yields also climbed. Oil prices initially moved lower after weekly data showed that US crude inventories had reached their highest levels for nearly six years. But by midday, Nymex WTI for June delivery had recovered and was hovering around the key $50 a barrel level. Gold moved higher as the dollar weakened but proved unable to break out of its recent ranges. "

131,2005-05-03,2005-05-04,Financial Times (FT.Com),FT.com site : Bunds fall after ECB says rates are 'appropriate'.,"Eurozone government bond prices fell and yields climbed as the possibility of a rate cut by the European Central Bank was all but ruled out on Wednesday. Jean-Claude Trichet, president of the European Central Bank, told reporters at a news conference that interest rates were at exceptionally low levels but that they were appropriate and a rate cut was still not an option. The news conference followed the expected announcement earlier in the day that the ECB will keep rates steady at 2 per cent. They have been at 2 per cent since June, 2003. Amid growing gloom about economic growth in the region and expectations of a rate hike in the near future growing ever dimmer, some had priced in the small possibility of a rate cut later this year or next year. The European debt market has rallied over the past week, with yields reaching new historic lows. Mr Trichet said: ""Regarding the current situation and the short-term outlook for economic activity, recent data and survey indicators are, on balance, on the downside. At the same time, when looking beyond the short term, conditions remain in place for stronger real GDP growth."" The yield on the 10-year benchmark Bund was 2.3 basis points higher at 3.397 per cent, but not far from the new lows of 3.362 per cent, hit earlier in the day. The two-year Schatz was yielding 2.250 per cent, up 1.4bp, but it earlier touched 2.195 per cent, its lowest level in over a year. By contrast to the eurozone, the US Federal Reserve on Tuesday raised its main rate by 0.25 per cent, as expected, to 3 percent and signaled more measured increases. But the Fed gave markets a roller-coaster ride as it corrected the wording of its statement after the original announcement. Prices of government bonds fell initially, but then rose after the FOMC added a benign view on longer-term inflation to its statement. In the UK, gilts traded within a narrow range as investors took profits on recent strong gains. But losses were limited with the strong performance of debt in the eurozone helping to prop up prices. The yield on the 10-year gilt was up 1.6bp at 4.523 per cent and the yield on the two-year gilt was up 0.1bp at 4.499 per cent. Financial markets in Tokyo were closed for Japan's Golden Week public holidays. "
132,2005-05-03,2005-05-04,Financial Times (FT.Com),FT.com site : Dollar slides on dovish Fed statement.,"The dollar was weaker in European morning trade on Wednesday as the market viewed the statement that accompanied Tuesday's Federal Reserve rate hike as broadly dovish. The dollar had risen in the immediate aftermath of the rate decision as the Federal Open Market Committee omitted the line that ""longer-term inflation expectations remain well contained"" that had appeared in previous statements. However the Fed later rushed out a correction including the above statement, helping send the dollar markedly lower. ""After the initial, almost complete statement, the dollar looked fairly buoyant as the text seemed to support the widespread outlook for regular rate increases. However, the addition of the final piece of text put the whole thing into a different light,"" said Chris Gothard, currencies strategist at Brown Brothers Harriman. ""The delayed release of a phrase saying inflation is 'well contained' rather altered the effect of the statement accompanying last night's widely expected quarter point increase to 3 per cent in the Fed funds rate. The dollar has been under pressure all night as a result."" The broader statement was also perceived as broadly dovish, particularly the claim that ""recent data suggest that the solid pace of spending growth has slowed somewhat, partly in response to the earlier increases in energy prices,"" although labour market conditions ""apparently continue to improve gradually"". Neil Mellor, currency strategist at Bank of New York, concluded that: ""The fact is that the Fed's recognition of the negative impact on demand from spiralling energy costs arguably implies genuine doubts as to the plausibility of bestowing further financial pain upon private sector America."" With this mood prevalent, the dollar fell to $1.2942 against the dollar, 0.8c worse than before the statement, Y0.5 to Y104.56 against the yen, 1.2c to $1.9007 against sterling and 0.6c to C$1.2485 against the Canadian dollar. Elsewhere trading was range-bound. The euro held at Y135.33 against the yen with the eurozone services purchasing managers' index beating consensus expectations of 52.6, despite slipping to 52.8 in April from 53 in March. The Australian dollar firmed to $0.7768 against its US namesake as the Reserve Bank held rates unchanged as expected. "
133,2005-05-03,2005-05-04,Financial Times (FT.Com),FT.com site : Fed keeps course with quarter point rise in rates.,"The Federal Reserve on Tuesday signalled no change in strategy, as it lifted US interest rates another quarter point to 3 per cent and said it would continue raising rates at a ""measured"" pace. While it acknowledged recent weaker economic data that had led to suggestions that the economy was entering a soft patch, the policymaking Federal Open Market Committee hardened its language on inflation pressures. The Fed's statement said monetary policy remained ""accommodative"" and that it expected to continue removing this accommodation ""at a pace that is likely to be measured"". Rather than attempting to influence market expectations, the committee can be seen as leaving itself with flexibility to respond to new data, while signalling that it expects to press ahead with rate increases. Fed policymakers had indicated in the run-up to the meeting that inflation remained the committee's primary concern. The federal funds rate, at 3 per cent, is still seen as too low to be consistent with price stability over time. The tabular content relating to this article is not available to view. Apologies in advance for the inconvenience caused. The Fed said: ""Recent data suggest that the solid pace of spending growth has slowed somewhat, partly in response to the earlier increases in energy prices."" The Fed signalled increased concern on inflation. As well as repeating that ""pressures on inflation have picked up in recent months"", it removed the assurance from its March statement that the rise in energy prices ""has not notably fed through to core consumer prices"". The central bank mistakenly signalled even greater inflation concern, when it dropped the clause ""long-term interest rates remain well contained"" from the statement it released just after 2.15pm in Washington. The tabular content relating to this article is not available to view. Apologies in advance for the inconvenience caused. "
134,2003-06-25,2003-06-26,Financial Times,Drawn and quartered - THE LEX COLUMN.,"By opting for a quarter-point cut in the federal funds rate, rather than the half-point favoured by one of its members, the Federal Open Market Committee has left room for a further reduction. It has also postponed the day when it must embrace the high-risk strategy of unconventional action. We must now wait and see if the second-half recovery which the Fed is hoping for - and which the stock market has priced in - materialises. Consumer spending has kept the economy afloat, but a more robust recovery requires businesses to start spending. May's durable goods orders - with core non-defence capital goods orders excluding aircraft dropping by 0.5 per cent following April's 2.6 per cent decline - was the latest piece of evidence confirming that the post-war snapback is long in coming. Corporate America continues to focus on balance sheet repair. The saving grace is that, encouraged by a still-buoyant housing market, underwritten by the Fed's efforts, and with tax cuts to come, the repair of US household balance sheets has been postponed. Yesterday's statement repeated the soothing, two-pronged approach adopted in May: the upside and downside risks to growth are roughly balanced, but the risk of an unwelcome substantial fall in inflation exceeds that of a pickup in inflation. This is a difficult balancing act. If the economic recovery does not materialise, equity markets will fall; but if it does, the bond market's recent weakness could quickly turn into a fierce reversal. London Edition 1. "
135,2006-05-10,2006-05-11,Financial Times (FT.Com),FT.com site : Dollar gains after China let off hook.,"The under-fire US dollar staged a modest recovery in European morning trade on Thursday after the US Treasury stepped back from the brink of formally branding China a currency cheat. The Treasury was happy to use aggressive language to describe Beijing's currency policy in its semi-annual foreign exchange report, saying it was ""extremely dissatisfied"" with the pace of reform and that it will continue to ""actively and frankly press China to quicken the pace of renminbi flexibility"". However the Treasury stopped short of formally naming China as a ""currency manipulator"", a move that many in the market believe would have applied more pressure on Beijing to allow the renminbi to appreciate, potentially causing the dollar to weaken against the full range of Asian, and even European, currencies. With this eventuality unforthcoming and the Federal Open Market Committee, which raised rates by 25 basis points to 5 per cent on Wednesday, signalling that ""some further tightening may yet be needed to address inflation risks"", the dollar was able to enjoy a modest reprieve, firming to $1.2713 against the euro, from a fresh 12-month low of $1.2831 it hit prior to the release of the Treasury's report. The greenback also recovered to SFr 1.2271against the Swiss franc, from a one-year low of SFr1.2128, Y111.24 against the yen, from Wednesday's eight-month nadir of Y110.11 and C$1.1056 against the Canadian dollar, having hit a 28-year low of C$1.0980 on Wednesday. ""The failure of the FOMC to indicate more clearly the possibility of a pause at the next meeting on 29 June and the failure of the US Treasury department to cite China as a currency manipulator has helped stabilise dollar sentiment,"" said Derek Halpenny, senior currency economist at Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ. However, Mr Halpenny was among those arguing that the dollar's respite may be short-lived, with the forces pressuring it lower, such as a declining yield advantage and mounting worries over the US external deficit, likely to reassert themselves. ""The point is that nothing significant has changed,"" he said. ""It seems premature at this point to expect a sustained dollar rally against any of the major currencies."" Others pointed out that despite the broadly hawkish Fed statement, the futures market was still only pricing in a 40 per cent probability of a June rate hike. Elsewhere sterling was strong, holding steady at $1.8674 to the dollar and firming 0.45p to GBP0.6809 against the euro, 2 centimes to SFr2.2910 against the Swiss franc and Y1.75 to Y207.74 against the yen, as both UK industrial and manufacturing output rose 0.7 per cent month-on-month in March, outstripping forecasts for rises of 0.2 per cent in both cases. The 0.8 per cent quarter-on-quarter rise in industrial production was the strongest since 1999, helping support forecasts that the next move in UK interest rates will be upward. Kuwait revalued the dinar by 1 per cent to KD0.2891 to the dollar, its first rise for 16 months. The move is likely to put pressure on other major oil exporters such as Saudi Arabia to follow suit. "
136,2002-09-24,2002-09-25,Financial Times,LONDON STOCK EXCHANGE - Equities depressed by further selling.,"It was another miserable session for investors in London stocks yesterday. Perceptions of a deteriorating global economy, increasing fears of a US-led strike against Iraq and worries about the grim outlook for corporate profitability dragged the main UK indices lower again, writes Steve Thompson, UK Stock Market Editor. Although closing off its lowest levels of the day, the FTSE 100 still closed down 1.8 per cent, at 3,671.1, its lowest level for more than six years. The worst performer among the main indices was the FTSE 250 which lost 106.5 - or 2.4 per cent - to 4,304.8, while the FTSE SmallCap lost 32.6 - or 1.8 per cent - to 1,813.4. The Techmark 100 plunged another 11.18, or 1.7 per cent, to a record low of 635.65. The pain in the market place looked set to continue, according to harassed traders. ""What makes it all the more depressing is that there doesn't seem to be any light at the end of the tunnel. If anything, matters are likely to get even worse,"" said one marketmaker. He said the prospect of a war in Iraq had increased significantly after the UK government provided evidence yesterday of Iraq's capacity to launch attacks with chemical and other weapons. Adding to the widespread pain being felt across the stock market was another confidence-sapping slide by Wall Street. The Dow Jones followed up Monday evening's 113 points retreat - having been down almost 200 points at one stage - with a further slide at the opening yesterday. The Dow lost a further 132 points before edging off its worst as London closed for the day, as the outcome of the latest meeting of the US Federal Reserve's open market committee meeting loomed up. Traders expected the FOMC to leave US interest rates on hold again. The US consumer confidence index for September was no worse than the market had been expecting and was said to have helped in slowing Wall Street's slide. The latter has been hit hard in recent sessions by an ever-growing list of profit warnings and disappointing results and news from leading US companies, the most recent of which came from Novellus Systems. The financial sectors of the market continued to take the worst pain, with the banks once again being sold aggressively on the view that a worsening global economy will bring with it corporate casualties and increasing bad debts. Insurance stocks, meanwhile, were hit again by fears that the almost relentless slide in equity markets will leave the insurance groups at the mercy of regulators and trigger forced selling. Confirmation of the rumoured £200m rights issue from British Insurance reminded the market of the need for more fundraising in the sector. Royal &Sun Alliance is expected to tap its shareholders for about £1bn in the very near future. Turnover in equities was 2.7bn shares. Bargain hunters descend Bargain hunters moved in to mop up shares in the UK's life insurers on Tuesday, after sector stocks had sunk to multi-year lows amid fresh fears that plunging equity markets will herald forced selling and more rights issues. But the mood lifted in late trade and Mikir Shah of Fox-Pitt, Kelton said: ""Investors have realised that these companies aren't insolvent, they are continuing to write new business and that valuations look attractive"". As aresult Prudential closed 6 higher at 339p, having sunk to its lowest level since April 1995 earlier in the day. Aviva firmed 4 to 345p, rebounding from levels last seen in January 1989. But composite insurer Royal &Sun Alliance still dipped 1 1/2 to 94p, its lowest since September 1984. Despite the mild fightback, the UK life insurance sector has fallen 53 per cent since January 1. Earlier there had been market speculation that insurers may be forced to sell equities if the FTSE 100 falls to 3,500. ""It is no accident that people are starting to think that 3,500 is going to be magic figure,"" said Chris Rathbone of Williams de Broe. The resilience test set by the Financial Services Authority may force insurers' hands. The FSA relaxed the test in June. Rather than having to be able to remain solvent even if equity markets fall 25 per cent from their current level, insurers now merely have to be able to cope with a 25 per cent fall from the three-month moving average. This gave insurers a temporary respite, but with the three-month moving average on the FTSE 100 now 4,211, compared to 5,066 when the FSA made its ruling on June 28, that respite is over. ""The relaxation gives some leeway in the short-term, but doesn't help in the long-term,"" said Richard Schreuder of Barclays Private Clients. Elsewhere banks suffered again, amid concerns over a rising tide of bad debts if the faltering global economic recovery brings more companies to their knees. Sentiment was further weakened by Lehman Brothers of the US chalking up third-quarter net earnings of just 70 cents a share, compared to consensus expectations of 85 cents. Major fallers included Barclays, off 11 1/4 at 355p, HBOS, down 17 at 624 1/2p, and Royal Bank of Scotland, which slipped 37 to £11.95. Perennial contrarian stock Man Group firmed 47 at £10.18, on expectations that its hedge funds will continue to sell well in the current environment. Asset managers Amvescap and Schroders attracted bargain-hunters after recent steep falls. Amvescap added 3 at 305p and Schroders firmed 19 at 453p. In the telecoms sector, incumbent operator BT fell 9 3/4 to 162 1/2p following a downgrade by Credit Suisse First Boston. The bank said that the weak economic environment and the consequent curtailing of corporate spending mean BT will struggle to meet its internal growth forecasts. CSFB slapped an ""underperform"" rating on the stock and cut its revenue forecasts for 2004, 2005 and 2006 by 3 per cent, 6 per cent and 9 per cent respectively. Fair value is now 160p a share, CSFB concluded. By Steve Johnson and Adam Plowright US Edition 1. "

138,2002-09-24,2002-09-25,Financial Times (FT.Com),Greenspan praises London's success story.,"Alan Greenspan, chairman of the US Federal Reserve, has hailed the success of London in staying ""at the top of the world's financial pyramid"" despite the creation of the euro. Speaking at the opening of the new UK Treasury building, Mr Greenspan said London had continued to thrive as a financial centre despite loss of empire, the revolution in telecommunications and the emergence of the European single currency. ""London has stayed on top in the provision of financial services despite the emergence of the euro, which some expected would divert a significant share of foreign exchange trading to a single centre on the continent,"" he said. ""Although financial sector activity in Frankfurt has increased substantially in the past few years, largely reflecting the growing importance of the euro, trading volumes there are still well below those of London and New York."" He cited as evidence of London's strength its world-leading positions in over-the-counter derivatives and foreign exchange trading. London conducts twice as much business as New York even though the dollar is by far the most heavily-traded currency. The resilience of Britain's financial services industry to staying outside the euro has been widely recognised, but eurosceptics were heartened to hear the points made by such an eminent authority. Gordon Brown, chancellor of the exchequer (finance minister), was unstinting in his praise for Mr Greenspan and the Fed, stressing the influence of the US model in shaping his plans to make the Bank of England independent. ""You have been a great force for the advancement of the world economy and a great friend of the United Kingdom,"" said Mr Brown. ""The world owes you a debt of gratitude for your stewardship of the world's greatest economy."" George Eustice of the anti-euro group, which will campaign for a ""No"" vote on any referendum on Britain joining the single currency, said London was thriving because of its favourable tax and regulatory framework. Locking into the euro would threaten some of those advantages. But Robert Guy, chair of the City in Europe ""Yes"" campaign and a director of NM Rothschild, said joining the euro would strengthen London's position as Europ e's pre-eminent financial centre and protect against threats such as the loss of exchange-traded derivatives business to Frankfurt. ""Current success is no excuse for lack of concern for the future,"" he said. The visit comes at a time of pronounced uncertainty for Mr Greenspan, the Federal Reserve and the US economy. The Fed decided on Tuesday to keep short-term interest rates unchanged for the sixth time this year, declaring credit conditions sufficiently stimulative to help the troubled economy along. But for the first time in a year, there was publicly declared internal dissent with its decision, highlighting growing disagreement within the Fed over the economy's prospects. Two members of the Fed's policy-making Open Market Committee - Bob McTeer, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas, and Edward Gramlich, a member of the Fed's board of governors - argued for a rate cut and publicly registered their disagreement. It was the first instance since May 1998 in which two FOMC members dissented. xref The Maestro, Page 11 Observer, Page 12. "
139,2000-05-16,2000-05-17,Financial Times,Fed raises rates by half-point to damp US growth.,"The US Federal Reserve yesterday signalled a new urgency in its attempts to damp the blazing American economy, raising short-term interest rates by half a percentage point to their highest level since the US emerged from recession in 1991. The Fed's policy-making open market committee lifted its key interest rate, the target for the fed funds rate at which it lends to the banking system, to 6.5 per cent. The central bank also raised its largely symbolic discount rate by half a point to 6 per cent. The move marked the abandonment of the gradualist approach to monetary policy that has been the Fed's hallmark for the past five years. It was the first time since early 1995 that interest rates have moved by other than a quarter of a percentage point. Explaining its decision, the FOMC repeated its now familiar concern that the rapid pace of demand growth was outstripping supply, and hinted that there might be more rate rises to come. ""Against the background of its long-term goals of price stability and sustainable economic growth and of the information already available, the Committee believes the risks are weighted mainly toward conditions that may generate heightened inflation pressures in the foreseeable future."" Financial markets had anticipated the more aggressive tightening after a string of reports indicated the US economy was continuing to grow at breakneck speed and that long-subdued inflationary pressure may be on the rise. Bond and stock prices slipped a little after the announcement, but the Dow Jones Industrial Average still closed 126.79 points higher at 10,934.57. Attention now shifts to the next Fed meeting at the end of June and to whether there will be any evidence to prevent another rate rise. The Fed has lifted short-term rates by 1.75 percentage points in the past year in an attempt to slow growth. In the last six months of last year, the economy grew at an annual rate of more than 6 per cent. That barely slowed in the first three months of 2000 to 5.4 per cent. In recent months there have been signs of inflationary pressures - notably a 4.3 per cent increase in employment costs in the year to March, and a 0.4 per cent leap in consumer prices excluding food and energy costs in March, one of the largest increases in the past five years. Some analysts think Alan Greenspan, the Fed chairman, and his colleagues will wait a while to see if their actions have been sufficient to slow growth. The lags associated with monetary policy changes mean clear evidence of a deceleration may not emerge until the second half of the year. In the past week some reports have suggested the inflation risk is less than previously thought. Yesterday, the Labor Department reported that seasonally adjusted consumer prices were unchanged in April. Excluding food and energy, prices rose by just 0.2 per cent. But the tone of yesterday's announcement suggests the Fed thinks it may need to do more. Editorial Comment, Page 22 Lex, Page 24 Bonds, Page 38 Currencies, Page 39.

140,2000-05-16,2000-05-17,Financial Times,INTERNATIONAL CAPITAL MARKETS - Floating rate deals take centre stage.,"Primary activity in the international bond market was light yesterday, as issuers and investors waited for the verdict on interest rates from the FOMC meeting. Bank issuers favouring floating rate deals were propelled to the fore. Portuguese state savings bank Caixa Geral de Depositos launched a five-year FRN deal worth $750m, and is expected to use the proceeds to refinance its acquisition of insurer Mundial Confianca. Euro-denominated issuance was confined to two floating-rate deals, from Germany's DG Hypothekenbank and Comptoir des Entrepreneurs of France. Proctor &Gamble priced a two-tranche Y65bn deal yesterday, launched on Monday, and its success illustrated the relative health of the yen market. A Y50bn 10-year tranche carries a 2 per cent coupon, and was priced at the tight end of the initial range to yield 30 basis points over JGBs. A Y15bn five-year tranche, an increase of a Y40bn deal from November last year, was priced to yield 26 basis points over JGBs. ""Compared to the dollar and the euro markets, the yen market still has pretty good conditions,"" said Denis Kelleher, a syndicate member at Tokyo-Mitsubishi International. ""There is plenty of demand for paper in Japan, but domestic issuance is low because companies are in the middle of the reporting season,"" he added. ""It is a good time to bring foreign issuers into the yen market, and will continue to be so into next week."" Argentina is poised to take advantage of the low cost of borrowing in the Japanese market, and has announced plans to launch several samurai issues. Officials in the Argentine ministry of finance have said that the sovereign will try to develop a larger retail and institutional investor base in Japan. Merrill Lynch and Nomura have been appointed joint lead managers for a yen issue, possibly later this month. While European corporate issues are scarce because of interest rate worries and volatile credit spreads, the number of companies preparing deals is mounting. The roadshow circuit is as busy as ever, but borrowers are waiting for signs of more benign market conditions before deciding to launch. Bankers predict a very busy period during June and July, as issuers try to get deals out of the way before the summer vacation season. Iberdrola, the Spanish utility, Rhodia, the French speciality chemicals company, and French property company Unibail are a few of the corporate borrowers putting the finishing touches to bond deals. The European high yield market is also very active, although the efforts of bankers and borrowers has yet to push through into a high volume of deals. UK bingo operator Gala Group is carrying out a roadshow across Europe, hoping to launch a #100m 10-year issue next week with lead manager CSFB. Gala is raising funds to partly refinance its leveraged buy-out by CSFB Private Equity. Weigh-tronix, a Dutch company that makes industrial and household scales, is marketing a Euros 135m 10-year issue with Lehman Brothers as lead manager. The funds will finance part of the company's acquisition of Avery Berkel from Marconi. Copyright Financial Times Limited 2000. All Rights Reserved. "
141,1991-12-17,1991-12-18,Financial Times,"US Still In Recession, Bush Admits.","The economy is still in recession, the White House said yesterday, abandoning previous claims that the recovery had merely stalled. Its statement came after a poll showed that Mr George Bush's popularity has dropped to the lowest level of his presidency and heightened expectations of a half point cut in the Federal Reserve's discount rate, currently 4.5 per cent. Mr Bush's rating has slipped to 47 per cent, according to an ABC News-Washington Post poll. The official admission about the recession reflects the view among Mr Bush's advisers, including Mr Samuel Skinner, the new White House chief of staff, that the president's popularity has been damaged by a failure to acknowledge the weakness of the economy and difficulties facing Americans. Yesterday Mr Marlin Fitzwater, White House press secretary, said: 'The people of this country know that the economy is in trouble. It doesn't make any sense to try to play games.' Mr Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve, is believed to share this view and to doubt whether further cuts in interest rates alone would revive the economy. He is scheduled to testify to Congress on the economy today. The unrelenting bad news in the polls is increasing Republican pressure on the Fed to lower interest rates, and is raising the stakes ahead of Mr Bush's State of the Union address to Congress next month, when he is expected to unveil an economic growth package. The Federal Open Market Committee, the Fed's policy-making arm, met yesterday to discuss a possible discount rate cut. The administration's economic advisers are sticking to their prediction that the economy should turn round by next spring, but official gloom has begun to colour all presidential actions and statements. Mr Bush's sensitivity to criticism that he has been too preoccupied with foreign affairs prompted him to let Mr James Baker, US secretary of state, deliver a policy address on the Soviet Union last week.

142,1991-12-17,1991-12-18,Financial Times,US still in recession says White House,"THE US economy is still in recession, the White House said yesterday, abandoning previous claims that the recovery had merely stalled. Its statement came after a poll showed that Mr George Bush's popularity has dropped to the lowest level of his presidency and heightened expectations of a half point cut in the Federal Reserve's discount rate, currently 4.5 per cent. Mr Bush's rating has slipped to 47 per cent, according to an ABC News-Washington Post poll. This adds weight to other surveys showing a steep drop in public confidence in his handling of the economy and in the prospects for a rebound. The official admission about the recession reflects the view among Mr Bush's advisers, including Mr Samuel Skinner, the new White House chief of staff, that the president's popularity has been damaged by a failure to acknowledge the weakness of the economy and difficulties facing Americans. Yesterday Mr Marlin Fitzwater, White House press secretary, said: 'The people of this country know that the economy is in trouble. It doesn't make any sense to try to play games.' Mr Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve, is believed to share this view and to doubt whether further cuts in interest rates alone would revive the economy. He is scheduled to testify to Congress on the economy today. The unrelenting bad news in the polls is increasing Republican pressure on the Fed to lower interest rates, and is raising the stakes ahead of Mr Bush's State of the Union address to Congress next month, when he is expected to unveil an economic growth package. The Federal Open Market Committee, the Fed's policy-making arm, met yesterday to discuss a possible discount rate cut. A cut would prompt a further reduction in bank prime lending rates, now 7.5 per cent. The administration had argued that a short, mild recession had bottomed out in the spring and that the economy had subsequently 'stalled'. But recent statistics have pointed to renewed contraction. Industrial output fell 0.4 per cent last month, a much sharper decline than expected. Employment fell by almost 250,000. The administration's economic advisers are sticking to their prediction that the economy should turn round by nextspring, but official gloom has begun to colour all presidential actions and statements. Mr Bush's sensitivity to criticism that he has been too preoccupied with foreign affairs prompted him to let Mr James Baker, US secretary of state, deliver a policy address on the Soviet Union last week. Mr Bush has also invited the chief executives of Detroit's big three car manufacturers - General Motors, Chrysler and Ford - to accompany him on his trip to Asia starting at the end of the year.

143,1999-11-16,1999-11-17,Financial Times,WORLD NEWS - THE AMERICAS - Fed seeks to enforce the speed limit - US RAISES INTEREST RATES.,"The Federal Reserve's decision to raise interest rates yesterday underlined the difficulty the central bank faces in operating monetary policy in the highly unusual conditions that characterise the US economy in the late 1990s. The traditional rules that governed the economy for much of the past 25 years seem to have broken down, complicating the Fed's task of setting a properly pre-emptive policy to guard against the risks of inflation. The problem is that, as Fed officials, led by Alan Greenspan, the chairman, have repeatedly acknowledged, the old ""speed limit"", the maximum growth rate consistent with stable inflation, seems to have been raised in the past few years. Significant productivity improvements stemming from substantial investments in information technology have raised the productivity of US workers in the past four years. Underlining the importance of these changes, Larry Summers, Treasury secretary, said the Clinton administration shared the Fed's goals of maintaining healthy growth with low inflation. ""Supported by sound economic policies, including budget discipline, the economy continues to grow, with strong investment and higher productivity, creating good jobs and improved living standards for all Americans."" But while almost everyone now agrees that the old sustainable growth rate of 2.5 per cent per year no longer obtains, few have a very good idea of what the new speed limit might be. The US economy will grow by about 4 per cent this year - and, if one thing seems to be clear, it is that the Fed thinks this pace is too fast. In the statement accompanying the quarter-point increase in both the Fed funds target rate and the discount rate, the Federal Open Market Committee said the action was taken to reduce that pace. ""Despite tentative evidence of a slowing in certain interest-sensitive sectors of the economy and of accelerating productivity, the expansion of activity continues in excess of the economy's growth potential."" That, together with Fed economic forecasts published earlier this year, suggests the central bank's policymakers believe the new sustainable growth rate is somewhere between 3 and 4 per cent. But that provides a wide margin of potential error. If growth cannot in fact be sustained above 3 per cent, inflation will take off. If, by any chance, it can be sustained at 4 per cent, then the Fed may be pressing too hard on the monetary brake. The real difficulty arises from the fact that, even at the current 4 per cent rate, there are no signs of inflationary pressure. Though most Fed economists and officials believe this is probably the result of some benign short-term factors temporarily restraining inflation, no-one can be sure. And, as Mr Greenspan himself acknowledged in a speech last month, it is possible that the improvements in productivity in the past few years may be substantially better even than economists currently think. He raised the possibility that productivity growth could be rising so rapidly that the economy's sustainable growth rate might be even higher than 4 per cent. Few but the most wild-eyed optimists believe the current rate of growth is in fact sustainable. Most are prepared to bet that the Fed's general hunch that the new sustainable rate of between 3 and 4 per cent per year is broadly right. Further, most economists accept that the central bank's three rate increases of a combined 0.75 percentage points should slow the economy by the desired amount in the coming months. That explains why financial markets reacted so positively to the Fed's move yesterday. But the usual statistical fog is especially murky when the economy is undergoing significant change. And until that fog starts to clear, it remains unclear what the Fed will need to do to keep the economy on track. OECD urges higher rates, Page 18. Copyright Financial Times Limited 1999.

144,1999-11-16,1999-11-17,Financial Times,WORLD STOCK MARKETS - Profit-taking takes toll on Tokyo.,"Profit-taking was the dominant factor in TOKYO yesterday where investors eager to cash in on the market's recent rise took the Nikkei average lower for the fourth day running, writes Michiyo Nakamoto. Selling activity focused on information and telecommunications issues, which have risen strongly in recent trading. However, the overall correction was moderate, suggesting to analysts that the market will soon return to support these sectors. The benchmark Nikkei average declined 42.95 to 18,155.14 after moving between 18,090.92 and 18,289.41. The Topix index of all listed shares declined 8.77 to 1,580.39. The Nikkei-300 fell 0.42 to 304.30. In spite of the overall decline in the indices, gaining issues outnumbered decliners 657 to 583. Volume was lower at 642.99m against 685.92m. The US Federal open market committee meeting, which was scheduled for later in the day, prompted caution as investors were divided over whether the FOMC would raise rates. The positive view was that Wall Street could welcome an interest rate rise in the US, triggering further rises in Tokyo as well. In the meantime, investors chose to take profits. Telecoms issues were roundly sold with DDI leading the pack. DDI, which unveiled disappointing results on Monday, was the largest loser in percentage terms. Its shares fell 13 per cent to Y1.27m. KDD also lost more than 12 per cent to Y11,800, while the NTT group of companies fell for the first time in days. NTT declined Y40,000 to Y1.84m, NTT DoCoMo Y160,000 to Y2.92m and NTT Data Y120,000 to Y2.41m. High-tech exporters fared better. Sony rose Y40 to Y18,800 after climbing to a record 19,100 earlier. Toshiba rose Y11 to Y670 and NEC gained Y5 to Y2,390. SEOUL rose sharply after rumours of an upgrade of the country's credit rating by Moody's sparked late buying. The Korea Composite Stock Price Index rose 32.99 to 1,007.72, with interest focusing on blue chips and telecom shares. The Moody's delegation visited South Korea earlier this month to review the country's banking sector and sovereign risk. BANGKOK pared early losses to close with the SET index down 3.55 at 423.15 after a low for the session of 416.74. Bank shares ended firmer with the sector index up 0.3 per cent, but there were a number of exceptions to this trend. Bangkok Bank lost Bt1.00 at Bt56 on renewed concerns about a possible share issue. Sansiri, the property group, added Bt0.25 at Bt12.50 after reporting a return to profit. KUALA LUMPUR ceded ground, pulled lower by foreign selling of blue-chip stocks. The Kuala Lumpur Composite index was down 8.95 to 720.34. Volume was a thin 99.7m, with traders reluctant to take fresh positions ahead of November's general election. Concern that US interest rates might be raised after the close of trading also put downward pressure on larger company stocks. Gaming stocks, which had been riding high in previous sessions, were among the biggest losers. Berjaya Sports Toto fell 50 cents to MDollars 7.35. Magnum also lost ground, falling 6 cents to MDollars 2.81. HONG KONG was higher as investors sought out laggards and stocks likeliest to gain from Chinese membership of the World Trade Organisation. The Hang Seng index finished 127.24 higher at 14,689.46, a second consecutive two-year high. Turnover was an impressive HKDollars 17.4bn. Hutchison Whampoa was in demand, helped by recent telecom deals and its WTO-linked potential because of its Hong Kong and China port assets. The company was also seen as a strong contender to be the first non-Chinese telecom entity to gain entry to China. The shares put on HKDollars 2.75 to a high for the year of HKDollars 91.50. Recently underperforming property stocks were also sought. Sun Hung Kai Properties rose HKDollars 2.25 or 3.2 per cent at HKDollars 72, extending its rise since the end of October to 14.7 per cent. SHANGHAI and SHENZHEN edged lower as a brief wave of euphoria over the Sino-US agreement on China's bid to join the WTO quickly gave way to caution. Shanghai's hard-currency B shares eased 0.080 to 41.123 while their Shenzhen counterparts lost 0.70 to 85.89 as investors dumped motor and telecommunications issues.

Mannesmann stayed firm, adding Euros 4.67 at Euros 207.65 in spite of legal moves by the group to block a planned takeover attempt by Vodafone AirTouch of the UK. The shares have risen almost 36 per cent in seven sessions. There was initial disappointment at Bayer's third-quarter results statement, but the stock ended firmer following assurances about trading next year plus news of a $2.45bn US acquisition. Bayer ended Euros 1.19 higher at Euros 40.84 after touching a low of Euros 39.16 in early trading. BASF gained Euros 1.99 at Euros 43.60.

The CAC-40 index closed up 12.88 to 5,191.01, a rise of just 0.25 per cent. It also failed to top Monday's intraday record of 5,199.11. Analysts said traders were cautious ahead of the FOMC decision. France Telecom fell after ABN Amro lowered its 1999 earnings per share forecast, citing disappointment over non-core businesses. France Telecom, considered a possible bidder for Orange in the event of a takeover of Mannesmann by Vodafone AirTouch, was also weakened by the steep fall in Vodafone shares. France Telecom shares closed down Euros 1.90 to Euros 100.90. Overall, however, gainers led losers 20 to 16. Energy and transport group Alstom fell Euros 1.20 or 4.4 per cent to Euros 25.90.

Telecoms network group Versatel jumped Euros 1.90 or 10 per cent at Euros 21. ZURICH was on hold, with traders split on the likely outcome of the FOMC meeting and the SMI index ended with a rise of just 3.4 at 7,419.2. Life sciences group Novartis continued to give ground after the recent run-up on merger speculation. The company said that an e-mail to at least one Swiss bank, purporting to announce that the group was bidding for Monsanto, was a hoax. Roche certificates, again benefiting from switching within the sector, put on SFr80 to SFr18,710. Food and beverages group Nestle, hit in the wake of Unilever's weak performance figures, put on SFr22 to SFr2,900. Some switching was reported out of the Anglo-Dutch food and detergents group. MADRID pushed to its highest closing level of the year. The all-share general index ended up 5.33 at 937.19. Banco Santander Hispano Central, the biggest bank, was up 16 cents to Euros 11.10. Telcoms group Telefonica recovered from early losses. Disappointment over nine-month profits, which fell slightly below analysts' expectations, sent the shares lower but they rebounded to end 5 cents up to Euros 17.85. MILAN saw a subdued performance by internet and utility stocks, but solid gains elsewhere in Europe and on Wall St helped lift the broad market. The Mibtel index finished 82 higher at 23,935. Banco di Napoli saw volatile trade after a hint from the Sanpaulo chief executive that he would prefer to gain control of the Naples bank through a partial spin-off from Ina, rather than launching a takeover bid. Napoli finished 3.2 per cent higher at Euros 1.28 while Sanpaulo lost 1.6 per cent at Euros 12.28. Olivetti jumped 2.1 per cent to Euros 4.10 as Dresdner Kleinwort Benson resumed coverage of the stock with a buy recommendation. But trade remained cautious ahead of the unveiling of the financial terms of the Telecom Italia restructuring plan. STOCKHOLM forged to another life-time high, powered by a late rally in telecoms giant Ericsson. The general share index rose 47.55 to 4,485.95. Ericsson traded up SKr5.50 at SKr384. Celsius rose SKr36 to SKr172.50 after an agreed bid by rival Swedish defence group Saab. Written and edited by Jeffrey Brown, Christopher Swann and Peter Hall. Copyright Financial Times Limited 1999.

146,1999-11-16,1999-11-17,Financial Times,WORLD STOCK MARKETS - Dow jumps sharply after rate decision.,"Wall Street built on an early rally and jumped higher as the Federal Reserve raised US interest rates 25 basis points to 5.5 per cent, writes Lesia Rudakewych in New York. In early afternoon, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 107.05 at 10,867.80, while the Standard &Poor's 500 index was 18.59 higher at 1,412.98. Nasdaq rose 56.02 to 3,275.56. Bond prices dropped on the news, with the benchmark 30-year treasury bond yield rising to 6.040 per cent. Even ahead of the decision, energy, financial and technology stocks saw solid gains, with internet shares charging ahead. On the New York Stock Exchange, Citigroup was the most heavily traded share, up $1 1/16 at $56 1/4. Bank One rose $3/16 to $38 7/8, with First Union up $5/8 at $42 5/16.

147,1999-11-16,1999-11-17,Financial Times,INTERNATIONAL CAPITAL MARKETS - Issuers wait for Fed outcome.,"The primary market almost ground to a halt yesterday as potential issuers awaited the outcome of the US Federal Open Market Committee meeting. General sentiment was firm, however, with swap spreads little changed and underlying government bond prices remaining strong. In one of few significant deals, International Business Machines launched a $300m five-year bond via Japan's Daiwa Securities. The offer was targeted at Japanese retail investors and aimed at capturing a flood of cash from redemptions falling due in November and December. Many corporate borrowers have chosen to fulfil most of their funding requirements earlier in the year due to the potential impact of the millennium bug on prices in December. According to Lehman Brothers, there will be unusually large volumes of redemptions in sterling-denominated bonds - about #3.6bn of eurobonds will be redeemed in December alone, compared with an average monthly total of about #1.5bn. Coupled with the increasing scarcity of gilt supply, as the UK government keeps a cap on issuance amid a budget surplus, corporate sterling-denominated paper should become increasingly popular towards the end of the year.

148,1999-11-16,1999-11-17,Financial Times,INTERNATIONAL CAPITAL MARKETS - Treasuries fall on rate rise.,"US Treasuries fell yesterday after the Federal Reserve raised its Federal Fund rate 25 basis points and returned its bias to neutral. In midday trade on Wall Street, the benchmark 30-year Treasury was down 1/8 to 101 3/16, pushing its yield up to 6.038 per cent. Similarly, the 10-year note fell 5/32 to yield 5.943 per cent, while the two-year note lost 1/8 to yield 5.839 per cent. No further adjustments are expected until the Open Market Committee February meeting at the earliest. However, analysts warned that the central bank would remain vigilant about the US economy's continued growth. ""The Fed's going to focus on growth,"" said Jeffrey Palma, economist at Warburg Dillon Read. ""If the economy continues to charge ahead, they're going to be willing to knock it down."" The market had closely debated Fed policy since the FOMC left rates unchanged but adopted a tightening bias at its October 5 meeting. The US economy has continued to grow robustly since then, leaving unemployment at its lowest levels in nearly 30 years. However, tight labour markets have yet to generate much inflation. While Gross Domestic Product increased at a 4.8 per cent annual pace in the third quarter, for example, recent data show hourly wages have barely budged. The 25 basis point increase effectively reverses the three incremental rate cuts the Fed enacted last year to limit the drag on the US economy from the financial crises in Asia and Russia. Most had expected Treasuries to turn in a modest rally on the increase, viewing it as a pre-emptive strike. ""If they don't tighten now they will have to tighten early next year,"" said William Quan, senior economist at Aubrey G. Lanston before the decision, citing the tightness of the labour market and falling Treasury yields. The FOMC next meets in December, although no action is expected then because of concerns about the millennium changeover. European government bond prices were higher but the moves were exaggerated by the thin trading volumes. The German bund future close 0.62 higher at 108.20. Market observers said the activity was extremely subdued as most large investors waited for the decision from the FOMC. The European bond markets were also supported by the Germany's council of economic advisers cutting its forecast for German economic growth from 2 per cent to 1.4 per cent for 1999. In the UK, gilts were also higher, despite signs of higher inflation. The underlying rate of inflation which excludes mortgage interest payments rose by 2.2 per cent in the twelve months to the end of October, compared to 2.1 per cent in the previous month. Observers said this could spark new fears of the Bank of England raising interest rates, but would not alter the generally benign inflation outlook, highlighted yesterday by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. The 10-year gilts future rose 0.5 to 111.04. In late trading the gilt future rose further to 111.30. Copyright Financial Times Limited 1999. All Rights Reserved. "

151,2006-03-28,2006-03-29,Financial Times,Treasury yields up after rates rise GOVERNMENT BONDS.,"US Treasury yields jumped yesterday afternoon after the Federal Reserve raised borrowing rates to 4.75 per cent as expected and continued to suggest further rate hikes ""may be needed"". The Federal Open Market Committee, meeting under Ben Bernanke's chairmanship for the first time, raised rates for a fifteenth consecutive time by 0.25 per cent. Although it changed the wording of its economic assessment, the FOMC left policy-related passages of the statement unchanged, leaving the door open for further rate hikes. ""In sticking to the January text, the statement makes clear that the Fed's inclination is to raise rates again,"" said Rob Carnell of ING Financial Markets. Half an hour after the Fed's statement, yields on two-year notes were 5.2 basis points higher at 4.795 per cent, while 10-year yields were up 6.7bp at 4.776 per cent. Longer-dated yields had started rising earlier, thanks to a surprise jump in the Conference Board's consumer confidence index and a surge in German business confidence. That news also propelled eurozone government bond yields to multi-year highs yesterday. The headline business climate indicator of the closely-watched Ifo survey rose to a 15-year high of 105.4, fuelling fears of more aggressive interest rate increases in the eurozone. The sell-off sent the yield on the two-year Schatz 8.1 basis points higher to 3.256 per cent in late trading after earlier hitting its highest level since November 2002. The yield on the 10-year Bund rose 8.4bp to 3.728 per cent, close to a one-year high. Lucy Hartiss, international economist at Capital Economics, said: ""We see rates reaching 3.5 per cent by year-end, with the next move coming in May."" The market is pricing in a rate of 3.25 per cent by year's end with a moderate risk of 3.5 per cent, analysts said. Gilts took a hit from the bearish sentiment. The yield on the two-year gilt added 2.6bp to 4.449 per cent and the 10-year gilt yield rose 3.2bp to 4.370 per cent. Long-dated gilt prices also fell as the UK Debt Management Office announced hefty supply of long-dated issuance for the next quarter, including more of both 50-year conventional and inflation-linked gilts and the introduction of a new 40-year gilt. The 50-year gilt yield rose 4.2bp to 3.919 per cent. The yield on the 10-year Japanese government bond rose 1.5bp to 1.700 per cent. "
152,2006-03-28,2006-03-29,Financial Times,"US keeps rate rises going with 15th move - Figures show optimism in UK, Italy and Germany.","US interest rates yesterday moved above those in the UK for the first time in five years as the Federal Reserve reacted to rising inflation and the strength of the US economy with its 15th consecutive quarter-point increase to4.75 per cent. The US move came as Mervyn King, Bank of England governor, told a parliamentary committee that he expected ""a rapidly expanding world economy"" to help support consumer demand and that robust public spending growth would sustain UK economic growth at its long-term average of about 2.75 per cent. His remarks reinforced expectations that the Bank of England's main interest rate would remain on hold at 4.5 per cent. Mr King said that consumer price inflation would rise above its2 per cent target in the short-term because of steep gas price increases but that the overall economic picture was ""benign"". Mr King's optimism on the world economy coincided with figures showing German business exuberance at a 15-year high, Italian business confidence at a five-year high and US consumer confidence at its highest level in four years. German business confidence has been boosted by the country's success in export markets, while eurozone credit figures also point to robust economic growth, boosting the case for an early increase in European Central Bank interest rates from 2.5 per cent, perhaps in May. Sterling weakened against the euro on the strong data, and as Mr King's comments were interpreted as a sign that the Bank of England was in no hurry to change interest rates. In the US, the first meeting of the policymaking Federal Open Market Committee chaired by Ben Bernanke indicated that the current cycle of interest rate increases was nearing a close, while repeating that some further policy firming may be needed dependent on the incoming data. In its statement, the FOMC said the economy had rebounded in the first quarter after a weak end to 2005, and that growth ""appears likely to moderate to a more sustainable pace"". Sounding a somewhat more confident note on the inflation outlook, the committee said that high energy prices appeared to have had only a ""modest"" effect on core inflation, at a time when productivity growth had kept labour market inflation in check. It said that inflation expectations remained contained. But the committee also repeated the warning that rising resource utilisation and elevated energy prices could feed into increased inflation pressure. In a repeat of the language used in its January meeting, it said ""some further policy firming may be needed to keep the risks to the attainment of both sustainable economic growth and price stability roughly in balance"".

153,2006-03-28,2006-03-29,Financial Times (FT.Com),FT.com site : Eurozone bond yields hit new highs.,"Eurozone government bond yields hit new multi-year highs on Wednesday in the trading session that followed the interest rate hike by the US Federal Reserve. The move in the US, coupled with more hawkish sentiment from European Central Bank policymakers, put pressure on bond prices and sent yields higher. Bond prices were already bruised from Tuesday's data showing a jump in business sentiment in both Germany and Italy. Evidence that economic recovery in the eurozone is gaining momentum has raised fears of more aggressive interest rate rises by the ECB. ""After a few weeks of consolidation, government bond markets have capitulated again thanks to a combination of the strong German Ifo [business sentiment] survey and the Fed's fifteenth consecutive rate hike last night,"" said David Brown, chief European economist at Bear Stearns. ""Yields should continue to rise from here,"" he added. In afternoon trading, the yield on the two-year Schatz was up 1.2 basis points to 3.284 per cent and the 10-year Bund yield added 0.1bp to 3.746 per cent. But earlier, the two-year Schatz yield had risen nearly 2bp to 3.289 percent, its highest since mid-October 2002, adding to the 8bp rise on Tuesday. The Federal Open Market Committee in the US, meeting under Ben Bernanke's chairmanship for the first time, raised rates for a fifteenth consecutive time by 0.25 per cent to 4.75 per cent on Tuesday. Although it changed the wording of its economic assessment, the FOMC left policy-related passages of the statement unchanged, leaving the door open for further rate hikes. Gilts fared better after data showed that UK mortgage lending slowed in February while retail sales remained subdued this month. But prices were still lower overall and the two-year gilt yield was up 1bp to 4.459 per cent and the 10-year gilt yield rose 1.5bp to 4.385 per cent. "
154,2006-03-28,2006-03-29,Financial Times (FT.Com),FT.com site : Dollar firm as higher US rates eyed.,"The US dollar held onto Tuesday's gains in European morning trade on Wednesday as the market priced-in the near certainty of US interest rates hitting 5 per cent in May. The dollar had actually been soft for much of Tuesday, but rallied on the release of the Federal Open Market Committee's monetary policy statement. The Fed, as expected raised rates for the 15th straight meeting, to 4.75 per cent. More importantly, the accompanying statement hinted at more to come, with the FOMC stating that the US economy had ""rebounded strongly"" in the current quarter, that possible increases in resource utilisation, in combination with elevated energy and other commodity prices, ""have the potential to add to inflation pressures"" and that some further policy tightening ""may be needed"". The market responded by regarding a May rate hike, always a strong prospect, as a done deal. Yet the statement did little to cement prospects for further rises beyond that. As a result although the dollar rose, it did not break out of recent ranges, trading at $1.2018 against the euro, Y117.82 versus the yen and SFr1.3089 versus the Swiss franc. ""The market now has greater conviction in its view that US interest rates will rise to 5 per cent by the summer; but the custom designed flexibility of the FOMC statement, tempered as it now is with conditionality and subjectivity, precludes any clear market insight beyond the next economic data release,"" said Neil Mellor, currency strategist Bank of New York. Chris Gothard, currencies strategist at Brown Brothers Harriman, added: ""The statement was mildly hawkish. Overall though, the message wasn't strong enough to reinvigorate the dollar enough to break out of any significant ranges."" The dollar did however push to $1.7371 against sterling, from $1.7494 prior to the Fed statement, with the pound also falling 0.35c to GBP0.6918 against the euro and Y0.8 to Y204.70 against the yen on Wednesday. Sterling lost ground as UK mortgage approvals fell in February for the first time since October 2004, the CBI's distributive trades survey came in weak and the UK's current account deficit for the fourth quarter of 2005 was revised upwards. Tom Vosa, head of market economics at National Australia Bank, was gloomy on sterling's prospects, adding: ""The pound looks vulnerable today after the increase in US official interest rates overnight took US rates above those in the UK for the first time since January 2001."" Elsewhere the Hungarian forint continued its slide, falling Ft1.5 to a 14-month low of Ft267.23 to the euro, with Claire Dissaux at Calyon warning that Hungary's twin current account and budget deficits will continue to weigh on the currency. ""Short-term interest rates of 6 per cent are nowhere near high enough to justify holding Hungarian forint assets for anything but the short-term,"" she concluded. "
155,2006-03-28,2006-03-29,Financial Times (FT.Com),FT.com site : Bourses expected to start lower on US rate outlook.,"Europe's bourses are seen starting lower on Wednesday after US interest rates were raised by another quarter point to 4.75 per cent with no indication the monetary tightening will end soon. Spread betters in London are calling the FTSE 100 , CAC 40 , and DAX indices between 3 and 20 points lower, according to Reuters. CMC Markets were a bit more optimistic forecasting the FTSE to start down 4, weakened by ex-dividends, at 5,932, the DAX up 2 at 5,893 and the CAC up 1 at 5,151. ""A hawkish note was sounded by Ben Bernanke at last night's FOMC meeting with US interest rates rising as expected by 25 basis points, accompanied by the suggestion that further rate hikes will be seen to keep inflationary pressures in check. This pushed stocks lower on Wall Street ahead of the close and is likely to weigh on European indices in early trade although an upturn in economic data as we approach the month-end should ensure that there's no shortage of momentum over the next couple of days,"" Matt Buckland of CMC Markets said. "
156,2009-09-23,2009-09-24,Financial Times,Dollar and equities volatile after Fed meeting,"global overview US interest rates are left on hold Oil prices tumble by nearly 4% US stocks and the dollar were volatile yesterday after the Federal Reserve's latest policy meeting, with a big drop in oil prices hitting equity market sentiment. The dollar, briefly dropped to its lowest level on a trade-weighted index after the FOMC meeting, only to claw back those losses as oil prices tumbled nearly 4 per cent and sank equities. The US central bank left interest rates on hold and pledged to keep them at record lows for an ""extended period"". The Fed also said that it would slow the pace of its purchases of mortgage-backed securities, ending the $1,500bn programme three months later than scheduled. It added that the economy was recovering after a ""severe downturn"", although it warned that household spending, while apparently stabilising, remained constrained by, among other factors, continuing job losses and sluggish income growth. Late in New York, the S&P 500 closed 1 per cent lower, after rising 0.8 per cent in the wake of the FOMC statement. Meanwhile, the yield on the 10-year Treasury was 4 basis points lower at 3.41 per cent. Yields had earlier risen after a disappointing auction of five-year paper. Central bank exit strategies were in focus elsewhere after the release of the minutes from the Bank of England's meeting this month . The Bank of England's monetary policy committee noted the recent improvements in economic and financial data as it voted unanimously to keep the asset purchase programme at £175bn in September. However, the door was left open for further easing, with the minutes also saying that for ""those members who had preferred a larger stimulus at the August meeting, a larger asset purchase programme could still be justified"". Richard McGuire, fixed income strategist at RBC Capital Markets, said the minutes had validated the view that an increase in the quantitative easing limit was still possible. ""With two [MPC] members [Mervyn King, governor, and David Miles] continuing to see a case for more aggressive action, a further 'upping of the QE ante' come November remains a clear possibility,"" he said. Mr McGuire added: ""Notable by its absence, meanwhile, was any discussion on a possible reduction of the deposit rate. One might surmise that such action will remain on the back burner until the Bank is satisfied it has done as much as is necessary in terms of pumping liquidity into the system."" On the currency markets , news of the unanimous vote pushed sterling higher against both the euro and the dollar. The Norwegian krone enjoyed even bigger gains after Norges Bank left its main interest rate unchanged at a record low of 1.25 per cent. ""A rate hike in October looks very likely,"" said Arne Lohmann Rasmussen, chief analyst at Danske Bank. The euro rose to a fresh one-year peak of $1.4844, only to slip below $1.48 late in New York. European government bonds were mixed. The 10-year Bund yield rose 1bp to 3.38 per cent after an issue of five-year German debt attracted reasonable demand. UK Gilts rose after the release of the Bank minutes, with the two-year yield down 2bp at 0.85 per cent. European equities edged higher, with the pan-European FTSE Eurofirst 300 rising 0.2 per cent. The mood in Asia was subdued as Japanese markets were closed for a third day. Hong Kong fell 0.5 per cent while Shanghai fell to three-week closing low. In commodities , the oil price fell below $69 a barrel after US data showed an unexpectedly large rise in domestic crude and refined product inventories last week. Nymex November WTI was down $2.79 at $68.97. Copper also fell on news of rising inventories and faltering demand from China. The Baltic Dry index, a gauge of shipping costs for commodities, fell for a ninth session. Analysts said the slide partly reflected an increase in shipping capacity, but also signalled that demand for commodities was starting to wane. Gold edged lower to $1,012 an ounce as the dollar stabilised."
157,2009-09-23,2009-09-24,Financial Times,Fed eyes money market fund link to beat inflation,"The Federal Reserve is looking to team up with the moneymarket mutual fund industry as part of its strategy to ensure that its unconventional policies to stimulate the economy do not produce a bout of post-crisis inflation. The central bank envisages eventually draining liquidity from the financial system by engaging in trades called ""reverse repos"" with the deep-pocketed money-market funds. In these, the Fed would pledge mortgage-backed securities and Treasuries acquired during the crisis as collateral for short-term loans from the funds. The discussions about the strategy form part of a Fed effort to ensure it will be in a position to raise interest rates when it decides the moment is right - even though most officials believe it is still many months away from having to do so. The US central bank yesterday said it would complete its planned $1,450bn purchases of securities and debt issued by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac at a reduced pace, allowing it to stretch out the buying to March 2010. In its policy statement, issued after a two-day meeting, the Federal Open Market Committee indicated it is slowly retiring some of the tools used to fight the crisis. The Fed said it would ""continue to employ a wide range of tools to promote recovery"" rather than ""all available tools"" in past months. However, the central bank reiterated it expects to keep interest rates near zero for an ""extended period"". The Fed said activity has ""picked up"" and noted signs of a rebound in activity in the housing market. But policymakers still appeared very unsure about the prospects for household spending - which they said ""seems to be stabilising, but remains constrained"". Nonetheless, the Fed signalled it does not expect a double-dip recession, looking instead to a ""strengthening of economic growth"". Most policymakers presently ancitipate that the first rate hike will not come before the second half of 2010. However, the Fed wants to establish the mechanisms for doing this well in advance, which is why it is exploring the idea of transactions with money funds now. In the course of the crisis, the Fed created roughly $800bn of additional bank reserves to finance asset purchases and loans. This total is likely to rise in the coming months as the central bank completes its asset purchases and the Treasury unwinds financing it provided to the Fed. Fed officials think they could raise interest rates even with this excess supply of reserves by offering to pay banks to deposit their surplus funds with it rather than lend them out. However, they also want to use reverse repos in tandem to soak up some of the excess reserves - policymakers call this a ""belt and braces approach"". The obvious counterparties for reverse repo deals are the Wall Street primary dealers. However, the Fed thinks they would only have balance sheet capacity to refinance about $100bn of assets. Hence the interest in dealing with money funds as well. The sector has $2,500bn in assets, which means it could plausibly refinance as much as $500bn in Fed assets. Officials think there would be appetite on the part of the funds, which are under pressure from regulators and investors to stick to low-risk liquid investments."
158,2009-09-23,2009-09-24,Financial Times (FT.Com),The Fed,"""Stop, children, what's that sound, everybody look what's going down"". The Kinks knew what was what back in 1966, and Ben Bernanke knows what is going down now. On Wednesday, the Federal Open Market Committee left the target interest rate near zero and told investors to expect it to remain low for some time yet. What is the Fed so worried about? What's going down are broader measures of money supply. Notes and coins, as well as deposit, savings and money market accounts, or M2, has been falling since the end of June, for example. That fall hardly seems possible given that the so-called monetary base (currency in circulation plus bank reserves) has more than doubled in the last year, almost entirely due to the Fed's emergency lending programmes. Bank reserves have exploded from $50bn to almost $850bn in 12 months. But the frightening reality is that bank lending is now contracting faster than the Fed is buying assets from the non-bank private sector, as part of its efforts to lower yields and revive failed markets. No matter how much the Fed seems to do, banks are not extending loans. US consumer credit, for example, fell at an annualised 10 per cent in July. Total debt outstanding is where it was a year ago. Some wonder about the wisdom of attempting to mend the wreckage of a debt-bubble with yet more debt. Even so, the economic consequences of shrivelling broad money do not bear thinking about - the long-term growth rate of M2, for example, is normally about 10 per cent per year. So forget about inflation. Goldman Sachs notes that inflation has the highest correlation to broader measures of money supply. Best ask for that pay rise now."
159,1998-08-18,1998-08-19,Financial Times,Fed committee leaves interest rates unchanged.,"The US Federal Reserve left interest rates unchanged yesterday after the regular private meeting of its main policy-setting committee as consumer price inflation figures for July showed price rises continuing subdued. The Federal Open Market Committee's decision was widely anticipated. The Fed has not changed interest rates since March last year, when the benchmark overnight loan rate to banks was raised a quarter point to 5.5%. The consumer price index rose 0.2% in July, after adjustment for seasonal variations, following a 0.1% rise in June. The rate in the year to July was unchanged on the previous month at 1.7%. The core rate, minus the volatile food and energy components, also rose 0.2% in July against 0.1% in the prior month. Breaking down the figures, vehicle prices rose 0.4%, reflecting in part a shortage arising out of the General Motors strike, while a 3.2% rise in airline fares contributed to a 0.3% increase in transportation prices. On the other hand, clothing prices dropped by 0.3%. Figures released yesterday also showed an unexpected drop in the US trade deficit in June. The US registered a $14.2bn trade deficit in goods and services in June, compared with $15.5bn in May. This was largely the result of a surprise 2% fall in imports which more than offset a 0.5% decline in exports. However, the deficit for the second quarter was a record $44bn, reflecting in part the consequence of Asia's financial crisis. Ed Yardeni, an economist with Deutsche Bank Securities in New York, said US exports were now falling at their fastest pace since the current measurements began in 1986. William Daley, commerce secretary, said the figures showed US exports in the first half of the year had edged up by only 1%, but they had grown ""a remarkable"" 7% once Asia was excluded. Economists doubted the June improvement in the deficit would be more than temporary. Tim O'Neill, chief economist for Harris Bank, said exports would remain under downward pressure because of the strong dollar and the weak Asian economies, while the decline in imports could partly reflect problems east Asian economies are facing in securing trade financing. ""With exports expected to remain weak and imports resuming their upward trend, the US trade balance should deteriorate in coming months, tempering the strength in the economy. This negative impact on GDP growth, alongside past appreciation of the US dollar and weak commodity prices, has contributed to inflation staying low despite a tight labour market,"" he said. Canadian trade surplus rises A sharp drop in car part imports, a result of the General Motors strike, led to a 16% increase in Canada's merchandise trade surplus in June, Scott Morrison reports from Toronto. Canada yesterday said its trade balance in June stood at C$1.5bn ($1bn), up C$213m from May. It was the second consecutive monthly increase in the balance. June imports dropped 0.8% from May to C$24.5bn as the GM strike led to plant closures in Canada. Exports inched up 0.1% to C$26bn. A 7.4% plunge in car product exports negated a strong performance in exports of industrial goods, as well as machinery and equipment. Despite the small gain in exports in June, the trend was flat for the second quarter after a slight decline during the first three months. Statistics Canada said there had been no growth in Canadian exports since the start of the year. Copyright Financial Times Limited 1998. All Rights Reserved. Not Available for Re-dissemination. "

161,1998-08-18,1998-08-19,Financial Times,INTERNATIONAL CAPITAL MARKETS - Signs seen of switch from gilts to shares.,"Prices were weaker yesterday as some of the worry over Russia's financial and political crisis dissipated and US Treasuries opened lower. Inflation data released in the UK and US were within expectations, ensuring no significant price moves in markets already thin due to the holiday period. In the UK, dealers spotted signs of asset switching into equities from gilts but globally there was still solid support for bonds. US TREASURIES ended lower but off their worst losses of the day as US equities rallied and the Federal Open Market Committee decided to leave interest rates unchanged. By late afternoon the benchmark 30-year bond was down 3/16 to 99 5/32, yielding 5.558%. Among shorter-term issues the 10-year note was down 5/32 to 101 19/32, yielding 5.411% and the two-year note was 1/32 lower at 100 1/16, yielding 5.339%. ""A lot of the flight to quality seems to have been removed from the market but it's a day-to-day thing,"" said Terrence Pigott, head of government bond trading at Daiwa Securities America. Data releases showed the US trade deficit to have narrowed to $14.2bn in June from $15.5bn in May and consumer prices to have risen 0.2% in July. GERMAN BUNDS ended lower but dealers say they are expecting prices to continue recent rises, with a yield on the benchmark bund of 4.25% feasible in the short term. Yesterday, it stood at 4.42%. However, Julian Jessop, chief European economist at Nikko said that target would only be reached if the Bundesbank maintained its current interest rate stance. ""You can only be confident holding bunds as long as a rate rise is off the agenda. But today's Bundesbank report left open the possibility of a pre-Christmas rate rise,"" he said. The bank yesterday released its August monthly report on the economy. The September 10-year bund future settled 0.03 points lower at 111.10 in volume of 449,000 contracts traded in Frankfurt. The UK GILTS market was unimpressed by inflation data, which traders said reinforced the view that interest rates had peaked. Gilt futures ended lower after trading in narrow ranges. September 10-year futures settled down 0.07 points at 110.19 in trading volume of 52,000 contracts. The underlying rate of UK inflation fell to 2.6% in July, which is above the Bank of England's year-end target of 2.5%. Neil Parker, Treasury economist at Royal Bank of Scotland, said gilts had sold off because some investors had been over-optimistic that the inflation target would be met. July retail sales data are due today. The spread between the benchmark contracts in the gilt and bund markets narrowed by one basis point to 124 points. Copyright Financial Times Limited 1998.

The Fed cut the 1.75 per cent Federal funds rate by 50 basis points, surprising the market which had only expected a 25bp cut. Rates have remained unchanged at 1.75 per cent since December 2001. The Fed said that ""greater uncertainty"" has been inhibiting spending, production and employment but that inflation pressures remain contained. Traders had earlier sold US Treasuries ahead of an influx of new supply. Some $18bn of 10-year notes was auctioned yesterday afternoon. There are also fears that the supply of Treasury securities next year will be greater than expected as a result of the Republicans' success in Tuesday's election. The Republicans now control Congress and are anticipated to pursue tax cuts and fiscal spending programs. This could increase the deficit, thereby requiring the government to issue more debt. The new Congress takes over on January 3. After the FOMC's decision, the 10-year note was up 9/32 to 102 11/16 to yield 4.037 per cent while the 30-year bond had gained 1/16 to 104 7/16 with a yield of 5.076 per cent. The two-year note was 1/8 higher to 100 to yield 1.755 per cent. Eurozone government bond prices were little changed yesterday and the volumes were thin as most investors were waiting for the European Central Bank's decision on interest rates which is due today. The yield on the two-year Schatz bond was flat at 3.17 per cent. The yield on the 10-year German bund was also little changed at 4.61 per cent. The 10-year German bund future rose 0.08 to 110.41. Japanese government bonds retreated yesterday as investors locked into profits ahead of a five-year bond auction. The benchmark 10-year cash JGB tumbled following a six-day rally which had pushed yields to a four-year low of 0.955 per cent earlier in the week. The market also remained under pressure as investors stayed on sidelines ahead of an auction of Y1,900bn worth of five-year bonds offered by the Ministry of Finance on Thursday. The new issue is expected to have a coupon set at 0.3 per cent, a level likely to generate appetite from the market, according to analysts. Bond prices had surged following the government's release of a key economic package last week which did not include explicit extra fiscal spending to support the ailing economy. Traders said the market was likely to stay well supported in coming weeks. The key December 10-year JGB futures contract fell 0.18 to 141.97, while the benchmark 243rd 10-year cash JGB fell 0.181 to 101.122, pushing up the yield by 0.020 to 0.975 per cent. London Edition 1.

Earnings warnings for several stocks were offset in part by upgrades for the likes of Intel and Cisco, which provided a boost for the technology sector.  Airline stocks were also higher after JPMorgan upgraded six airlines and said valuations were low given the outlook for consolidation in 2008.  KB Home After the Federal Open Market Committee statement was released, stocks rallied further and reached new highs for the day.  All 10 leading sectors in the S&P 500 index were in positive territory.  ""A Fed that describes the economy and inflation in friendlier terms than before is generally treated bullishly in the markets, particularly the stock market,"" saidTony Crescenzi, strategistat Miller Tabak &Co.  At mid-afternoon, the S&P was up 0.5 per cent at 1,513.47 points. While oil prices had risen above Dollars 70 a barrel yesterday, their highest level in 10 months, the energy sector was lagging behind broad market gains.  At mid-afternoon, theNasdaq Composite was leading the broad benchmarks with a rise of 0.7 per centto 2,623.40. Brokerage upgrades for Intel, up 1.5 per cent at Dollars 24.14, and Cisco Systems, up 3.4 per cent at Dollars 28.19, boosted technology stocks.  Also helping the sector was a 2.3 per cent rise to Dollars 28.59 in Dell. Amazon rose 2.2 per cent at Dollars 69.64, taking its gain for the year to 76.5 per cent.  RBC Capital Markets raised its price target for the online retailer from Dollars 45 to Dollars 75.  The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 0.4 per centto 13,478.94.  Leading the blue chips was General Motors, up2.5 per cent to Dollars 38.36 with shares reaching their highest level in two years.

165,2007-06-28,2007-06-29,Financial Times,Fed holds steady and keeps focus on inflation.,"Oil prices rose to their highest in 10 months yesterday while global stocks were mainly firmer and bonds came under pressure as the Federal Reserve signalled a continued focus on inflation.  In the currency markets, the yen went into reverse after three days of gains as a rally in global equity markets eased investor concerns over risky assets and triggered renewed appetite for carry trades.  Investors were largely on the sidelines early yesterday as they awaited the Federal Open Market Committee meeting's decision.  As expected, the FOMC left the overnight interest rate of 5.25 per cent unchanged, marking a full year of steady Fed policy.  Economists had expected the FOMC to remain vigilant about inflation risk, a stance that would keep the chances of a rate cut later this year below 50 per cent.  The FOMC delivered on that forecast when policy makers said: ""A sustained moderation in inflation pressures has yet to be convincingly demonstrated.""  TJ Marta, fixed income strategist at RBS Capital Markets, said: ""The Fed noted the improvement in core inflation, but remained unconvinced that inflation pressures would moderate on a sustained basis.""  As concerns over how troubles in the US mortgage market would ultimately play out across structured credit markets lingered, investors were reminded yesterday that inflation potentially remained an issue.  Money supply in Germany rose more than expected yesterday, while revised first quarter growth in the US was accompanied by an upward revision in core inflation measures.  In commodities, US crude oil futures moved above Dollars 70 a barrel for the first time since the start of September amid supply concerns. High energy prices raise the risk that consumer spending could slow down over the summer, and could also feed into higher core inflation later this year.  Although US first quarter growth in gross domestic product was revised up to0.7 per from a previously reported 0.6 per cent, the main talking point was the price index for personal consumption. The core PCE, excluding food and energy, rose an annualised 2.4 per cent, above a previous estimate of a 2.2 per cent gain for the quarter.  The rise increases the likelihood that the May core PCE reading for the past year, due today, will remain above the Fed's preferred ceiling of 2 per cent.  Economists at Bear Stearns said the revision could entail a significant reduction in ""the chances that May's core PCE inflation rate slips to 1.9 per cent"".  At mid-afternoon, stocks on Wall Street had rallied further. The S&P 500 index was up 0.5 per cent, while the Nasdaq Composite was 0.7 per cent higher amid upgrades for bellwether stocks such as Amazon and Cisco. European stocks were broadly higher before Wall Street opened and largely held those gains. In London the FTSE 100 index closed up 0.7 per cent at 6,571.30 points. The Eurofirst 300 index ended the day 1.03 per cent higher at 1,595.82.  In Asia, stocks mainly rallied, with Hong Kong rising 1.1 per cent to 21,938.22, just shy of its recent record close.  Singapore was up 0.9 per cent, while Japan's Nikkei 225 gained 0.4 per cent. The volatile Shanghai Composite fell 4 per cent.  Global bond yields were generally higher yesterday, with the yield on the 10-year Japanese government bond up 5 basis points at 1.91per cent.  The yield on the German 10-year Bund was up 2bp at 4.56 per cent. The yield on the 10-year US Treasury bond was 2bp higher at 5.10 per cent, and the market weakened after the FOMC statement was released. The policy-sensitive two-year note fell sharply in price, with its yield rising 6bp to 4.94 per cent. While traders said the US bond market stayed in a range, the risk of renewed haven buying could no be ruled out.  ""We remain worried that credit perceptions may race ahead of reality and force a longer term pendulum swing away from risk-seeking and toward risk conservatism,"" said William O'Donnell, strategist at UBS. In the currency markets, the dollar was little changed. The yen was more volatile. Against the high-yielding New Zealand dollar, a favourite target of carry trade investors, the yen tumbled 1.5 per cent to Y94.50.  "

The two main talking points were the risks of wider financial stress from exposure to US subprime mortgages and worries that a recent decline in US core inflation pressures may prove fleeting. Against this backdrop, risk appetite as measured by the yen carry trade, equity market volatility, government bonds and credit spreads fluctuated over the course of the week. These barometers continued to reflect investor angst on Friday.  Although problems at two Bear Stearns hedge funds that own collateralised debt obligations (CDOs) based on subprime mortgage debt appear contained, investors fretted that this could reflect an impending credit crunch. CDOs are pools of debt assets which are sliced into tranches or parts and then sold onto investors.

In terms of inflation risk, policy makers said core inflation was no longer ""somewhat elevated"" but warned they were still looking for a ""a sustained moderation"".  That view of core inflation was confirmed when the May personal consumption expenditure index, excluding food and energy, rose an annualised 1.9 per cent on Friday. The Fed is assumed to prefer core PCE in a range of between 1 and 2 per cent, but economists were wary of declaring victory over inflation.  Drew Matus, economist at Lehman Brothers, said the FOMC statement suggests ""that the Fed is looking at inflation through more than one lens."" Despite the good news on the core PCE data on Friday, Mr Matus said: ""The Fed will continue to keep one eye on possible inflation channels.""

The CDX index of US investment-grade credit derivatives was at 40.75 basis point on Friday, out from 40 basis at the close of business last week.  In Europe, the FTSE Eurofirst 300 edged 0.4 per cent higher after five volatile sessions to 1,605.33, dominated by the banking sector, as investors became cautious over the potential exposure of European investment banks to the subprime debacle.

168,2007-06-28,2007-06-29,Financial Times (FT.Com),FT.com site : Cure US inflation falls below 2%.,"Core inflation fell below 2 per cent for the first time in three years after a modest increase in prices last month, according to new government figures.  A key index of consumer prices, excluding volatile food and energy, climbed only 0.1 per cent in May, which brought the rate for 12 months to 1.9 per cent. High petrol prices drove the headline rate up 0.5 per cent.  The slowdown in core inflation will be welcomed by the Federal Reserve, which on Thursday left interest rates unchanged and kept a resolute focus on risks of future inflation.  In its statement at its June policy meeting, which kept rates at 5.25 per cent, the Fed dropped its description of core inflation as ""somewhat elevated"" and acknowledged that ""readings on core inflation have improved modestly in recent months"".  But it warned that ""a sustained moderation in inflation pressures has yet to be convincingly demonstrated.""  Gary Bigg, economist at Bank of America, said of the Federal open market committee: ""The FOMC should be quite pleased with recent inflation developments.""  Ethan Harris, chief economist at Lehman Brothers, said the economy was ""evolving as the Fed expected"" with inflation easing and growth projections also being reined in.  The report from the commerce department on Friday also showed consumer spending and income lower than expected in May.  Personal income increased 0.4 per cent. Consumption spending increased 0.5 per cent for the second consecutive month.  ""The slender gain in income will restrain consumption spending,"" said Gary Bigg, economist at Bank of America. ""Income and spending gains were weaker than expected, suggesting that spending for the quarter will be soft.""  Economists said higher fuel prices explained much of the spending increase.  Nigel Gault, US economist at Global Insight, said: ""Although consumer spending rose by what looks like a robust 0.5 per cent in May, more than half of the increase in spending went into gasoline tanks as consumers were hit by higher gasoline prices.""  ""Spending should improve in the second half of the year, with gasoline prices easing back, but not back to the runaway first-quarter pace, as the downturn in the housing market will weigh on consumers,"" he said.

Both the Dow and the S&P reached record closes early in June, and sentiment has been dented on a number of fronts.  ""Through June equity investor worries have ranged from inflation angst to an unwinding of expectations that the Fed will ease in 2007 to outright fear that the LBO [leveraged buyout] spigot will dry up, among many others,"" said Tobias Levkovich, chief US equity strategist at Citigroup. ""But it all began with a spike in the 10-year bond yield, which continues to be symbolic of investor fears if not a cause of them.""

Nasdaq Composite led the broad benchmarks during the day and closed 0.1 per cent higher at 2,608.37.  The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed 0.4 per cent lower at 13,422.28.  "
171,1999-08-24,1999-08-25,Financial Times,LEADER - The Fed edges back to normal.,"The US Federal Reserve's decision to increase interest rates by one quarter of a percentage point, to 5.25 per cent, means that it has now taken back two-thirds of last autumn's emergency 0.75 point cuts. The move was widely expected. The markets are already looking ahead to October's meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee, wondering if it will finish clawing back the cuts then. As the Fed statement stressed, the monetary policy stance adopted after Russia's default, is no longer ""consistent with sustained non-inflationary economic expansion"". Although there are clear risks that the economy could over-heat, consumer price inflation - at 2.1 per cent in July - is hardly threatening. More worrying has been the recent jump in the Employment Cost Index, the broadest measure of wages and benefits. This increased by 1.1 per cent in the three months to June, the biggest increase for eight years. However, the ECI's rise by 0.4 per cent in the first quarter was the smallest on record. The tightness of the US labour market has been a concern for policymakers for some time. Strong productivity growth at the start of the year was a comfort, but this ground to a halt in the second quarter. Again, this should not have been too much of a surprise. Part of the reason for strong productivity growth at the start of the year is that companies expected a sharp slowdown. (This, remember, was why the Fed cut rates). Thus, they held down wages. When the economy roared ahead, at a 6 per cent annualised rate in the last three months of 1998, and at 4.3 per cent at the start of the year, there was a productivity spurt. The slowdown to a more moderate pace, of 2.3 per cent on an annualised basis in the second quarter, is exactly what the Fed wanted. If the economy slows of its own accord, and due to the sharp rise in long-term interest rates, it means that the Fed will not have to raise rates as much to bring this about. But the record trade deficit, as the economy continues to suck in imports, suggest that domestic demand still needs to cool down. International forces that helped keep a lid on US inflation are wearing off. Many commodity prices are rising. The Japanese and European economies, though still fragile, are recovering. The strong dollar has had a significant disinflationary effect, but this will recede and reverse as prospects improve elsewhere - and as the US current account deficit becomes more difficult to finance. The risks of inflation, the Fed says, have been markedly diminished by the two recent rate rises. But it is likely to find it has more work to do at its October meeting.

172,1999-08-24,1999-08-25,Financial Times,INTERNATIONAL - SA bank governor proposes inflation targeting policy.,"Tito Mboweni's appointment in July last year as South Africa's first black central bank governor took place against the backdrop of a plunging currency and massive interest rate increases as the country fell victim to emerging market upheaval. Yesterday, by contrast, Mr Mboweni's maiden policy address caused hardly a ripple in the domestic markets. Bond traders said his comments were ""pretty much as expected"", adding that they were more worried about the outcome of the US Federal Open Market Committee meeting later in the day. The new governor emphasised the central bank's continuing independence and made clear that he saw inflation as his most important concern. ""In the pursuit of the primary objective of price stability it is essential, as stated in the constitution, that the Reserve Bank performs its functions independently and without fear, favour or prejudice,"" he said. Mr Mboweni, a former ANC politician and a development economist by training, allayed fears that he might bow to populist pressures by saying that a monetary policy that maintained financial stability would make ""the best contribution to improving economic growth, employment and living standards"". He acknowledged that the eclectic monetary approach used by his predecessor, Chris Stals, had been ""useful"" for containing inflation, but said that it had, at times, created uncertainty about the bank's intermediate objectives. Formal inflation targeting would be more transparent, he said, and ought to ""allay some of these uncertainties"". Inflation targeting would be more effective if the government's policies were properly co-ordinated. He proposed a policy target agreement to be signed by himself and Trevor Manuel, the minister of finance. A Monetary Policy Committee, similar to that of the Bank of England, is also to be established, consisting of the governor and deputy governors as voting members and senior officials as non-voting members. Given that inflation targeting was ""a complicated monetary framework requiring careful preparation"", Mr Mboweni said the functions of the central bank's economics department were being revised and reorganised and that the unit would become a research department ""concentrating on monetary issues and co-ordinating research in the Bank"". Mr Mboweni did not announce a date for implementing the policy, or the level at which the target was likely to be set. In July, consumer inflation dipped below the 5 per cent level for the first time since 1970. * Thousands of civil servants belonging to all 12 of South Africa's public sector unions took to the streets in protest yesterday after a breakdown in wage negotiations with the government. The state angered workers this month by putting into effect an average pay increase of 6.3 per cent. The unions want 7.3 per cent. Copyright Financial Times Limited 1999. All Rights Reserved.

173,1999-08-24,1999-08-25,Financial Times,INTERNATIONAL CAPITAL MARKETS - Slight rally after Fed raises rates.,"US government bond markets rallied slightly after the Federal Reserve raised two key interest rates, while maintaining a neutral bias on future interest rate policy. As expected, the Federal Reserve Open Market Committee raised the key Fed Funds rate by 25 basis points from 5 per cent to 5.25 per cent. However, it also raised the less frequently used discount rate by 25 basis points and maintained its neutral policy stance, signalling it was not necessarily leaning towards raising rates again. The FOMC said its actions should ""markedly diminish"" the risk of inflation appearing in the economy. Bond markets rallied on the news, then fell back slightly in late trading, with the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond up to 102 11/16, sending the yield down to 5.932 per cent. The 5-year note rose 13/32 to 101 9/32, to yield 5.700, while the 2-year note gained 1/8 to yield 5.584. Elsewhere, euro-zone economic data received little attention ahead of the Fed decision, with markets widely anticipating the quarter-point rise in US rates. UK gilts lacked direction amid seasonally light trading and ended very slightly lower, with the long end of the yield curve gently outperforming the short end. The September contract in the gilt future settled 0.08 lower at 110.51 while the long gilt due in June 2028 yielded 4.70 per cent, down 3 basis points. Weaker-than-expected UK trade data had little impact. Concentrating on what was happening in the US, the gilt market largely ignored figures from the Office for National Statistics that showed the UK trade deficit with the rest of the world ballooning to #2.5bn in June. Debt markets also largely ignored higher-than-expected German producer price data which showed July producer prices rising by 0.3 per cent month-on-month and falling by 1.0 per cent year-on-year. Forecasts were for a 0.2 per cent monthly rise and a fall of 1.1 per cent year-on-year. Ten-year bund futures hardly moved at all - settling at 108.80, down 0.03 on the day. There was significantly more action in Japan. An already lethargic Japanese government bond market was battered by sluggish bidding for a Y1,400bn auction of 10-year, 1.9 per cent coupon bonds. The Finance Ministry announced that the lowest price for the issue was 99.70 with a yield of 1.935 per cent, while the average price was 99.85 to yield 1.917 per cent. Trading, however, pushed the new bond briefly to 2 per cent on the secondary market - the highest level the 10-year bond yield has been since February 16, when it stood at 2.02 per cent. The auction highlighted reluctance among private investors to buy more bonds because of continuing fears that the government will flood the market with new bonds later in the year to finance a second supplementary budget. The poor results of the auction spurred hedge-selling of both cash JGBs and JGB futures, and market sentiment darkened ahead of an auction of two-year bonds planned tomorrow and six-year and 30-year bond auctions planned for next week. The price of the March futures contract for 10-year bonds lost 0.43 to 128.18, sending the yield up to 0.042 points to 2.482 per cent. Plan for Rs25bn auction depresses Indian prices Indian bond prices settled sharply lower yesterday, following an announcement from the government of a Rs25bn bond auction, writes Sathnam Sanghera. The Reserve Bank of India said it would be reissuing 10-year, 11.99 per cent bonds on Friday, August 27. Existing 11.99 per cent 2009 bonds fell to a low of Rs102.45 on the news and eventually recovered to 102.50 - much weaker than the morning's price level of Rs102.58. ""The market became more volatile after the bond auction announcement,"" said one dealer at a broking house. Bids on the 12.40 per cent 2013 bond dropped to Rs103.55/57 as sentiment darkened, compared with the central bank sale price of Rs103.62. There has been a bearish mood in the market since Monday, when the Reserve Bank said that it would pay for oil imports from its reserves. This led to fears of a rupee outflow from the system. The RBI also altered its sale list on Monday. The securities on the list included the 11.0 per cent 2002 bond, the 12.40 per cent 2013 bond and two 364-day treasury bills maturing on February 25 and March 24 in the year 2000.

174,1999-08-24,1999-08-25,Financial Times,WORLD STOCK MARKETS - Dow falters after Fed rate decision.,"US shares weakened in the minutes after the Federal open market committee announced it had raised two key short-term interest rates, writes John Labate in New York. The rate rise was widely anticipated by investors in the week leading up to the meeting, as stocks continued to move higher. The Dow Jones Industrial Average reached a record close on Monday, but in the minutes after the Fed announcement the blue-chip index was down 60.47 to 11,239.29, with more than 90 minutes left on the trading day. The broader Standard &Poor's 500 index was 1.80 lower at 1,358.42 while declining shares out-numbered advancing ones on the NYSE. Stronger internet and semiconductor shares gave a boost to the Nasdaq composite, which added 27.23 at 2,746.80. The yield on the 30-year Treasury bond remained just below 6 per cent, with a 15/32 gain in price to 102 7/16. In the Dow, Procter &Gamble shares were up $1 3/8 to $99 5/8 after the consumer products producer was raised by PaineWebber to an ""attractive"" rating from ""neutral"". Aluminium producer Alcoa fell back $2 7/8 or 4 per cent to $63 3/8. Shares in workstation producer SGI tumbled 12 per cent to $10 7/8 one day after the departure of the company's chief executive. Media company Time Warner, down 7 per cent to $61 1/2, was the most actively-traded stock on the midday NYSE after Merrill Lynch cut its earnings estimate for 1999. Chip stocks were strong performers overall, sending the Philadelphia stock exchange's semiconductor index up 1.6 per cent to 524. Micron Technologies surged 6 per cent to $67 9/16. Online telephony company Net2Phone jumped more than $9 7/8 to $57 after the company announced a deal with Compaq Computer. Internet company At Home had another strong session, up more than 4 per cent to $41 5/8, one day after a 6 per cent gain. Gap fell $11/16 to $41 1/16 after Deutsche Banc Alex Brown lowered its rating on the retailer to ""market perform"" from ""buy"". Leading retailer and Dow member stock Wal-Mart was down $1/4 to $47 1/2. TORONTO swung modestly lower in early trading as investors slogged out the final few hours of uncertainty ahead of the Federal Reserve's decision on US interest rates. Banks, one of the more interest rate-sensitive sectors, were a firm market, but resource stocks ran into widespread selling. At the noon count, the 300 composite index was off 10.76 at 7,164.20. Royal Bank of Canada added 45 cents at C$67.25 and Canadian Imperial improved 25 cents at C$34.25, although trading volumes were said to be light. The main excitements on the upside centred on airline stocks following a move to merge Air Canada and Canadian Airlines in a C$5.7bn deal. Air Canada added 15 cents at C$8.65 and Canadian Airlines 16 cents to C$8.65. Onex Corp, the conglomerate that is a leading light behind the deal, rose 75 cents to C$27.00.

175,1999-08-24,1999-08-25,Financial Times,WORLD STOCK MARKETS - Last-minute jitters ahead of US rate move.,"Stock markets moved sideways as investors awaited developments at the Federal Reserve amid expectations that only a modest rise in US interest rates would emerge, writes Vincent Boland. While there was speculation in some quarters that recent US economic data showing a continued slowdown in inflation was enough to put any rate rise on hold, the general feeling was that the Fed would act by lifting the rate by a quarter of a percentage point. The dollar held steady in early European foreign exchange trading but was hit by nerves as the FOMC meeting - a rate announcement was expected at 2.15pm Washington time - got closer. The currency slipped to an intra-day low of $1/ Y111.6 and $1.05/EUR1 in New York trading. Asian markets had set the tone overnight, posting modest falls. Tokyo stocks were hit by a bout of profit-taking in the banking sector after big recent gains. European markets remained largely flat as Wall Street opened slightly weaker and traders said there was no real trend ahead of the Fed announcement. Unlike in the US, there is little prospect of a rate rise in Europe until perhaps the second half of next year, according to the latest European market overview from the strategy team at Salomon Smith Barney. The bank says the euro zone economy is set for a benign period of accelerating growth, low inflation and shrinking fiscal deficits. The pick-up in growth - Salomon has raised its forecast for European gross domestic product growth for 2000 to 2.8 per cent - should help stabilise the euro against the dollar in the near term. Meanwhile, the expected rises in European interest rates next year and the likelihood that the US economy will be slowing by then ""probably will lift the euro close to its long-term average of $1.17/EUR1 during 2000"", the bank says. Inflation should also stay below the European Central Bank's target ceiling of 2 per cent throughout next year despite the better economic growth outlook. Copyright Financial Times Limited 1999.

176,1999-08-24,1999-08-25,Financial Times,INTERNATIONAL CAPITAL MARKETS - Pfandbriefe issue to test market.,"The depth of the euro-denominated market is to be tested by more than EUR10bn worth of Pfandbriefe bonds coming to the market in the next few days. Rheinhyp, a German mortgage and public sector lender, joined the line of Pfandbrief issuers yesterday. It is looking to raise EUR2bn-EUR3bn in the maturity of 5-8 years. This follows the announcement by DePfa, one of the largest mortgage lenders in Germany, to raise EUR3bn-EUR5bn. Algemeine Hypothekenbank (AHB) is set to launch a EUR5bn 10-year Pfandbrief today following the Federal Reserve Open Market Committee meeting. Borrowers, who normally would have spread their issue over a few months, are trying to cram their issues in September. This is because they fear concerns over the millennium bug may cause a liquidity crunch in the market in the last quarter of the year. Since the launch of the euro the Pfandbrief market became the largest and most liquid non-government bond market in the euro-zone. However, many observers doubt whether the market is deep enough to absorb so many issues, particularly as euro-zone governments are also continuing to borrow. Germany, for example, will today auction EUR5bn in 5-year bonds. However, a banker at Commerzbank said jumbo Pfandbriefe have the advantage over corporate issues of being more liquid - something that investors are particularly sensitive to at present. The market yesterday was calm, ahead of the FOMC meeting. SNCF, the French railway operator, added EUR250m to its 10-year bond, bringing it up to EUR1bn in total. The bond was priced to yield 36 basis points over the 10-year French OAT, 6 basis points wider than its original issue in June. Copyright Financial Times Limited 1999. All Rights Reserved.

177,1992-10-06,1992-10-07,Financial Times,An open commitment - A call for more transparency in British monetary management.,"An open commitment - Gordon Pepper and Anthony Harris call for more transparency in British monetary management. The crisis of confidence which has undermined sterling in the past few days is mainly due to uncertainty about government policy. Yet in countries where monetary policy is not under political control, political difficulties do not normally turn into financial crises. This has led to proposals that the Bank of England should be made independent. We doubt whether this would, of itself, solve the British problem, which is not due only to political interference. The monetary regime has changed frequently and radically over many years, with little success. Monetary targets have regularly been missed. Decisions are made in secret, and are seldom explained, so market doubts go unanswered. Monetary targets will now take the place of exchange rate discipline; but the same forces which have driven Britain out of the ERM will make monetary control more difficult. International flows distort the monetary aggregates in ways which are not yet fully understood, and floating exchange rates have proved very hard to stabilise. The government further proposes that targets should include not only the exchange rate, but also broad and narrow measures of money, and housing and other asset prices. These indicators look well chosen, and would have alerted the authorities to many recent problems. But though the approach is described as new, it is essentially the traditional British system, and revives an old problem. It is impossible to keep multiple targets always in the sights of a single weapon, the interest rate regime. Something on the list will always look out of line; and sometimes objectives will be incompatible, as they are now. Policy cannot both support the exchange rate, and reduce real interest rates so as to relieve debtors and restore the growth of credit and money. Policy must be a compromise. Market acceptance will, therefore, depend on restoring confidence in official judgment. That is the aim of our proposal: to enable the markets to monitor the reasoning behind policy decisions, and to strengthen the policy process by bringing in well-regarded outsiders. Proposal: the UK should set up an Open Market Committee (OMC), similar to the FOMC of the US Federal Reserve. This would have full executive responsibility for monetary policy. At the moment the chancellor is nominally responsible, but the Bank and Number 10 Downing Street make their own inputs. When any policy fails, the buck passes rapidly round this triangle; this may be intended to protect reputations, but further undermines confidence. An OMC could not disown its decisions in this way; Publication: honest differences of opinion will always arise in matters of policy. The market is likely to have more confidence in decisions - even those which prove mistaken - if it knows what facts and interpretations were involved in reaching them. The minutes of the OMC should, therefore, be published after a minimum delay, as are those of the FOMC (six weeks in arrears). They should report the sometimes dissenting views expressed in reaching a decision, and should also include the committee's assessment of each of the indicators for policy, with full explanation if any is judged misleading at the time. We believe that disclosure on these lines would increase market confidence, partly by reducing uncertainty; Outside directors: British monetary policy is managed by a committee of Bank and Treasury officials. It usually maintains an outside appearance of unanimity and confidence. This has never been fully convincing; at a time when policy has gone off the rails, and leaks tell of furious internal arguments (as after every British crisis), the pretence simply undermines confidence further. Compared with this, the federal structure of the US and German central banks has important advantages. The heads of the Fed districts and the Landesbanks have their own power base, their own local information, and they often hold strongly independent views which are widely known. This assures markets that policy decisions are fully informed and largely politician-proof. It would be hard to imitate such a structure in the UK; but some of the same advantages could be secured by including outside directors or advisers in the OMC. These 'non-executive directors' should not be officials either of the Bank or of the Treasury. As 'insiders', they could not be active in the City during their time on the OMC. They would have a threefold role: to ensure that policy-making is fully informed about private-sector views and problems; to ensure that the OMC minutes convey meaningful information about policy decisions; and to act as potential whistle-blowers if they strongly disagree with the OMC consensus. They should be encouraged to propound and debate policy i n public, as do the directors of the Fed and the Bundesbank; Execution: the OMC would steer policy, and answer for it; but day-to-day execution would remain in the hands of the Bank. We believe this structure would improve the operations of an independent Bank of England. It would be even more important if the Bank is not made formally independent.

178,1992-10-06,1992-10-07,Financial Times,Government Bonds - Sterling's rally encourages short and medium gilts.,"A rally in sterling lifted prices in the short and medium-dated gilts, though the long end of the market remained in the doldrums. Dealers said yesterday's improvement was partly a technical correction after the market was oversold on Monday. Trading conditions proved volatile yesterday, with the long gilt future opening up 11/32 at 95.16, before falling back to close at 94.30. But the shorter end of the market performed well, recording gains of as much as 3/8 point. 'Sterling holds the key at the moment,' said Mr Phillip Tyson, an economist at UBS Phillips and Drew. The improvement in sterling revived hopes that a further reduction in interest rates would be possible sooner rather than later. The short sterling contract on the London International Financial Futures Exchange gained 6 basis points to close at 91.75. However, dealers expected trading conditions to remain volatile at least until firm details of the government's economic policy emerge following sterling's withdrawal from the exchange rate mechanism. The market will listen keenly to the Chancellor of the Exchequer's speech tomorrow for hints of the form the new economic policy will take. High-yielding European bond markets continued their meteoric fall yesterday. Italian government bonds shed 1 1/2 points, as the lira dived yesterday morning, but recovered some ground later in the day. Spanish bonds fared poorly, recording losses of 1 3/8 points. Non-resident selling pressure pushed prices down further, as fears of a peseta devaluation and worries about the lifting of capital controls depressed sentiment further. Dealers said liquidity in the Spanish bond market was particularly poor. GERMAN bund prices were forced to surrender some of the gains that they made on Monday, ending 1/4 point lower. Dealers said the market had got ahead of itself, but sentiment remained positive. The new 10-year 7 1/4% bund issue met firm demand, dealers said. The results are due to be announced today. Although the rush of buying seen on Monday appeared to have dried up, German bunds are expected to retain their safe haven status, since economic fundamentals remain favourable. The German bund future on Liffe closed at 91.38, down from Monday's close of 91.70. DUTCH bonds fell back after their opening rise, following a steep fall in German bund futures. Dealers said bond prices had gone too high and fell back as stock market turbulence faded. An increased supply from tap issue had also brought prices down, dealers said. BELGIUM will issue a new state loan aimed at private investors between November 12 and November 18, the Belgian Finance Ministry said, Reuter reports from Brussels. The maturity, coupon and issue price will be set later. The previous state loan in June raised BFr 58.5bn and one in February brought in BFr 66bn. FRENCH bond prices fell a further half point yesterday, as benefits from the fall in stock prices on Monday evaporated. Dealers said the concerns of currency weakness continued to preoccupy the market. The OAT future on the Matif ended 0.58 point down at 108.56. JAPANESE bonds again performed inversely to the stock market, gaining ground during early stock market weakness, then falling back when equity prices rallied later in the day. The JGB future on Liffe ended unchanged at 106.87, in thin trade. LONGER-DATED US Treasury prices fell sharply yesterday on disappointment that the Federal Reserve's monthly federal open market committee (FOMC), which met during the day, did not ease monetary policy to help the ailing economy. In late trading, the benchmark 30-year government bond was down 13/16 at 98, yielding 7.411%. The two-year note was also lower, down 1/8 at 100 17/32 to carry a yield of 3.735%. In the absence of economic news, the market's attention was focused on yesterday's FOMC meeting. Speculation has mounted in recent days that the FOMC would sanction another cut in interest rates (possibly a 25 basis-point reduction in the federal funds rate and a 50 basis-point reduction in the discount rate) to lift the apparently stalled economic recovery. A policy ease has been partly discounted by the market, and the lack of a move from the Fed yesterday meant that some of those gains had to be given back. The Financial Times.

179,1992-10-06,1992-10-07,Financial Times,World Stock Markets (America) - Dow supported by hopes of a rate cut.,"Wall Street US markets settled down with share prices holding their ground amid mounting speculation about a possible interest rate cut, writes Patrick Harverson in New York. At the close the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 0.81 at 3,178.19, the index having spent all but the first few minutes of the day only a few points either side of Monday's close. The more broadly based Standard and Poor's 500 was also virtually unchanged at the finish, down 0.41 at 407.16, while the Amex composite added 1.09 at 367.71 and the Nasdaq composite firmed 5.34 to 570.55. Turnover on the New York SE was 197m shares, and rises outpaced declines by 1033 to 727. Although the concerns about the economy and corporate earnings that were behind Monday's volatility were still dogging the market, investors switched their attention yesterday to the Federal Reserve's open market committee (FOMC), and prospects for a cut in interest rates. There was no sign from the committee of any policy shift yesterday, but many analysts were predicting that the FOMC would agree to a 25 basis-point cut in the federal funds rate, or a 50 basis point cut in the more important discount rate, or both. Normally, such predictions would have stimulated anticipatory buying, but in light of the market's unstable mood, investors were holding off until they had proof that rates were being cut. Among individual stocks, Citicorp dropped $3/4 to $14 3/4 in turnover of 3.3m shares after the bank announced that its third quarter profits would come in between eight cents and 13 cents a share, well below analysts' expectations. The stock's fall also represented investor concern about the sudden departure of the banking group's president, Mr Richard Braddock, who resigned on Monday night. Advanced Micro was one of the day's best performers, advancing $1 1/8 to $12 7/8 in turnover of 2.9m shares after the company unveiled third quarter net income of 51 cents a share, up sharply from the 16 cents a share of a year ago. Advanced Micro also said that it expected profits to grow even faster in the fourth quarter. Tyco Toys dropped $2 1/2 to $13 3/8 in heavy trading after an analyst at the broking house Salomon Brothers, downgraded the stock from a 'buy' to a 'hold' and cut his 1992 and 1993 earnings estimates, citing weak retail sales, an unfavourable sales mix and rising advertising costs. On the Nasdaq market, some of the leading stocks which tumbled on Monday bounced back, including Microsoft, up $3/4 at $82 1/2 and Amgen $1 1/4 higher at $60 3/4. Optrotech dropped $1 1/2 to $12 1/4 after the Federal Trade Commission asked the company to delay its merger with Orbot Systems because of concerns about the effect of the link-up on competition. CANADA Toronto stocks broke a week-long down fallending with marginal gains after a day of cautious trade, dealers said. After losing more than 150 points last week, the TSE 300 closed up 1.96 points at 3,229.49, after swinging within a 21-point range in the morning. Volume was 25.5m and transactions were valued at C$371m. The Financial Times. (c) The Financial Times Limited 1992. "

BELGIUM will issue a new state loan aimed at private investors between November 12 and November 18, the Belgian Finance Ministry said, Reuter reports from Brussels. The maturity, coupon and issue price will be set later. The previous state loan in June raised BFr58.5bn and one in February brought in BFr66bn. FRENCH bond prices fell a further half point yesterday, as benefits from the fall in stock prices on Monday evaporated. Dealers said the concerns of currency weakness continued to preoccupy the market. The OAT future on the Matif ended 0.58 point down at 108.56. JAPANESE bonds again performed inversely to the stock market, gaining ground during early stock market weakness, then falling back when equity prices rallied later in the day. The JGB future on Liffe ended unchanged at 106.87, in thin trade. LONGER-DATED US Treasury prices fell sharply yesterday on disappointment that the Federal Reserve's monthly federal open market committee (FOMC), which met during the day, did not ease monetary policy to help the ailing economy. In late trading, the benchmark 30-year government bond was down 13/16 at 98, yielding 7.411 per cent. The two-year note was also lower, down 1/8 at 100 17/32 to carry a yield of 3.735 per cent. In the absence of economic news, the market's attention was focused on yesterday's FOMC meeting. Speculation has mounted in recent days that the FOMC would sanction another cut in interest rates (possibly a 25 basis-point reduction in the federal funds rate and a 50 basis-point reduction in the discount rate) to lift the apparently stalled economic recovery. A policy ease has been partly discounted by the market, and the lack of a move from the Fed yesterday meant that some of those gains had to be given back. "
181,1992-10-06,1992-10-07,Financial Times,World Stock Markets (America): Dow supported by hopes of a rate cut,"Wall Street US MARKETS settled down with share prices holding their ground amid mounting speculation about a possible interest rate cut, writes Patrick Harverson in New York. At the close the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 0.81 at 3,178.19, the index having spent all but the first few minutes of the day only a few points either side of Monday's close. The more broadly based Standard &Poor's 500 was also virtually unchanged at the finish, down 0.41 at 407.16, while the Amex composite added 1.09 at 367.71 and the Nasdaq composite firmed 5.34 to 570.55. Turnover on the New York SE was 197m shares, and rises outpaced declines by 1033 to 727. Although the concerns about the economy and corporate earnings that were behind Monday's volatility were still dogging the market, investors switched their attention yesterday to the Federal Reserve's open market committee (FOMC), and prospects for a cut in interest rates. There was no sign from the committee of any policy shift yesterday, but many analysts were predicting that the FOMC would agree to a 25 basis-point cut in the federal funds rate, or a 50 basis point cut in the more important discount rate, or both. Normally, such predictions would have stimulated anticipatory buying, but in light of the market's unstable mood, investors were holding off until they had proof that rates were being cut. Among individual stocks, Citicorp dropped Dollars 3/4 to Dollars 14 3/4 in turnover of 3.3m shares after the bank announced that its third quarter profits would come in between eight cents and 13 cents a share, well below analysts' expectations. The stock's fall also represented investor concern about the sudden departure of the banking group's president, Mr Richard Braddock, who resigned on Monday night. Advanced Micro was one of the day's best performers, advancing Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 12 7/8 in turnover of 2.9m shares after the company unveiled third quarter net income of 51 cents a share, up sharply from the 16 cents a share of a year ago. Advanced Micro also said that it expected profits to grow even faster in the fourth quarter. Tyco Toys dropped Dollars 2 1/2 to Dollars 13 3/8 in heavy trading after an analyst at the broking house Salomon Brothers, downgraded the stock from a 'buy' to a 'hold' and cut his 1992 and 1993 earnings estimates, citing weak retail sales, an unfavourable sales mix and rising advertising costs. On the Nasdaq market, some of the leading stocks which tumbled on Monday bounced back, including Microsoft, up Dollars 3/4 at Dollars 82 1/2 and Amgen Dollars 1 1/4 higher at Dollars 60 3/4 . Optrotech dropped Dollars 1 1/2 to Dollars 12 1/4 after the Federal Trade Commission asked the company to delay its merger with Orbot Systems because of concerns about the effect of the link-up on competition. Canada TORONTO stocks broke a week-long down fallending with marginal gains after a day of cautious trade, dealers said. After losing more than 150 points last week, the TSE 300 closed up 1.96 points at 3,229.49, after swinging within a 21-point range in the morning. Volume was 25.5m and transactions were valued at CDollars 371 m. "
182,1992-10-06,1992-10-07,Financial Times,An open commitment: A call for more transparency in British monetary management,"The crisis of confidence which has undermined sterling in the past few days is mainly due to uncertainty about government policy. Yet in countries where monetary policy is not under political control, political difficulties do not normally turn into financial crises. This has led to proposals that the Bank of England should be made independent. We doubt whether this would, of itself, solve the British problem, which is not due only to political interference. The monetary regime has changed frequently and radically over many years, with little success. Monetary targets have regularly been missed. Decisions are made in secret, and are seldom explained, so market doubts go unanswered. Monetary targets will now take the place of exchange rate discipline; but the same forces which have driven Britain out of the ERM will make monetary control more difficult. International flows distort the monetary aggregates in ways which are not yet fully understood, and floating exchange rates have proved very hard to stabilise. The government further proposes that targets should include not only the exchange rate, but also broad and narrow measures of money, and housing and other asset prices. These indicators look well chosen, and would have alerted the authorities to many recent problems. But though the approach is described as new, it is essentially the traditional British system, and revives an old problem. It is impossible to keep multiple targets always in the sights of a single weapon, the interest rate regime. Something on the list will always look out of line; and sometimes objectives will be incompatible, as they are now. Policy cannot both support the exchange rate, and reduce real interest rates so as to relieve debtors and restore the growth of credit and money. Policy must be a compromise. Market acceptance will, therefore, depend on restoring confidence in official judgment. That is the aim of our proposal: to enable the markets to monitor the reasoning behind policy decisions, and to strengthen the policy process by bringing in well-regarded outsiders. Proposal: the UK should set up an Open Market Committee (OMC), similar to the FOMC of the US Federal Reserve. This would have full executive responsibility for monetary policy. At the moment the chancellor is nominally responsible, but the Bank and Number 10 Downing Street make their own inputs. When any policy fails, the buck passes rapidly round this triangle; this may be intended to protect reputations, but further undermines confidence. An OMC could not disown its decisions in this way; Publication: honest differences of opinion will always arise in matters of policy. The market is likely to have more confidence in decisions - even those which prove mistaken - if it knows what facts and interpretations were involved in reaching them. The minutes of the OMC should, therefore, be published after a minimum delay, as are those of the FOMC (six weeks in arrears). They should report the sometimes dissenting views expressed in reaching a decision, and should also include the committee's assessment of each of the indicators for policy, with full explanation if any is judged misleading at the time. We believe that disclosure on these lines would increase market confidence, partly by reducing uncertainty; Outside directors: British monetary policy is managed by a committee of Bank and Treasury officials. It usually maintains an outside appearance of unanimity and confidence. This has never been fully convincing; at a time when policy has gone off the rails, and leaks tell of furious internal arguments (as after every British crisis), the pretence simply undermines confidence further. Compared with this, the federal structure of the US and German central banks has important advantages. The heads of the Fed districts and the Landesbanks have their own power base, their own local information, and they often hold strongly independent views which are widely known. This assures markets that policy decisions are fully informed and largely politician-proof. It would be hard to imitate such a structure in the UK; but some of the same advantages could be secured by including outside directors or advisers in the OMC. These 'non-executive directors' should not be officials either of the Bank or of the Treasury. As 'insiders', they could not be active in the City during their time on the OMC. They would have a threefold role: to ensure that policy-making is fully informed about private-sector views and problems; to ensure that the OMC minutes convey meaningful information about policy decisions; and to act as potential whistle-blowers if they strongly disagree with the OMC consensus. They should be encouraged to propound and debate policy in public, as do the directors of the Fed and the Bundesbank; Execution: the OMC would steer policy, and answer for it; but day-to-day execution would remain in the hands of the Bank. We believe this structure would improve the operations of an independent Bank of England. It would be even more important if the Bank is not made formally independent.

183,1994-11-15,1994-11-16,Financial Times,"LONDON STOCK EXCHANGE - BUY PROGRAMME DRIVES FOOTSIE THROUGH 3,100 - MARKET REPORT.","It was virtually all good news yesterday for a London stock market celebrating a series of specialist deals, including a #500m share buy-back by one of the leading FT-SE 100 stocks, a huge buy programme, a highly successful bought deal and a series of excellent company news items. Added to that heady cocktail was another strong performance by Wall Street, which gained ground shortly after the opening yesterday ahead of the outcome of the crucial Federal Open Market Committee meeting in Washington. Wall Street shrugged aside another batch of economic data from the US indicating strong growth in the economy. At the close of trading, and with no news from the FOMC meeting available to the market, the FT-SE 100 Index fulfilled recent market optimism, sweeping confidently through the 3,100 barrier and closing a net 40.1 higher at 3,135.4. Second-line stocks shared in the buoyant mood of the market, the FT-SE Mid 250 ending 22.6 stronger at 3,560.7. And there was a general air of optimism around City trading desks, with dealers adopting the view that, within reason, the UK market would take whatever was thrown at it by the Federal Reserve. 'If we get 50 basis points, the market will say it is already in the prices; if we get 75 or even 100 points, the bond market will love it and we will hang on to their coat tails,' was the view of one top trader in London, although he cautioned that the market would definitely not appreciate an absence of movement by the Federal Reserve. The rate rise of 3/4 percentage point was subsequently announced. The overall bullish view was reinforced by a surge of activity in derivatives markets, where turnover was said to have been the heaviest since mid-September. Turnover expanded rapidly throughout the session to reach 961.4m shares, the highest seen for many weeks, with non-Footsie stocks accounting for an unusually low 39% of the total. Dealers picked up the scent of a big market operation before the opening and prices across the board were marked better at the outset, when the FT-SE 100 was around 10 points ahead. News that Boots had sent its broker SG Warburg into the market to buy in around 10% of its shares drove Boots sharply higher until the buy-back operation was satisfied. Boots' move came 24 hours after it sold its pharmaceuticals division to BASF, the German chemicals company. At the same time, AMP Australia, the life assurance group, sold its 3.2% holding in Hammerson to Smith New Court, the UK securities house, who quickly placed the stock in the market, taking a 3p a share turn in the process. While these deals were being unwound, Goldman Sachs, the US investment bank, moved in to execute a #160m-plus buy programme, spanning the FT-SE 100 and 250 indices. These three big operations accounted for more than 270m shares, or 28% of turnover in the market yesterday. At its best, just before the close, the FT-SE 100 was more than 42 points up, with dealers reporting only light profit-taking towards the close. Company trading reports provided numerous features, including De La Rue, the banknote printing group, whose shares sprinted to an all-time high after excellent results, while PowerGen fulfilled even the most optimistic dividend forecasts. General Accident was the one real disappointment in the market as the steep fall in the insurance group's net asset value, and middle of the range third-quarter profits, left the market unimpressed. The best performance among the FT-SE 100 stocks came from Standard Chartered, viewed by many chartists as in the initial stages of a big upside break; dealers noted heavy turnover in Standard shares.

184,1994-11-15,1994-11-16,Financial Times,GOVERNMENT BONDS - SHORT-LIVED RALLY IN US TREASURIES AFTER RATE RISE.,"US Treasury prices were extremely volatile yesterday afternoon as the market struggled to interpret the implications of the Federal Reserve's announcement that it would increase the target for its Federal funds rate. Late in the session the benchmark 30-year government bond was up 7/32 at 93 23/32, yielding 8.047%. At the short end of the market the two-year note fell 1/8 to 99 19/32, to yield 7.081%. The long-bond yield fell below 8% immediately after the announcement that the Fed's open market committee had voted to boost the target rate by 75 basis points to 5 1/2%. Most analysts had expected an increase of at least 50 points and believed the markets had already accounted for a 50-point increase. The news that the Fed had increased the target rate by more than expected was taken as a sign that it was willing to continue a tough stance against inflation. But the rally was short-lived. Mr John Lipsky, chief economist at Salomon Brothers, the securities house, said the initial rally was more surprising than its later return to near pre-announcement level. 'A move of this magnitude had certainly been contemplated by most market players,' he said. 'There is ample justification for the market to be somewhat better than pre-announcement levels because the Fed has shown more anti-inflation resolve than previously,' Mr Lipsky said. 'There is little justification for any significant rally at this time because, until economic growth shows clear signs of deceleration, the bond market remains vulnerable to disappointing inflation figures,' he added. The Fed cited the highest capacity utilisation figures since February 1980 as its main reason for the increase. Earlier, it had announced that the economy was using 84.8% of its capital stock for the production of goods, and a 0.7% increase in industrial production. Economists had anticipated a 0.6% increase in industrial production and capacity utilisation of about 84.8%, but the actual figures were considered generally in line with expectations. Bond prices dipped early in the morning following the announcement that retail spending for October had grown by 1.1% - analysts had expected an increase of about 0.6% - but bounced back later in light trading as traders awaited an announcement on interest rate policy. European government bond markets drifted higher yesterday as investors waited for the result of the Federal Reserve meeting in the US. Mr Simon Maggs of IBJ in London said: 'Trading has been very thin ahead of the FOMC meeting, but European markets will be moving on the back of that meeting tomorrow.' Most markets followed German government bonds upwards, although Italy registered a fall as investors took stock of the difficulties the government is having in enacting budgetary reforms. German bunds broke through an important resistance point at 90.50 and the December bund futures contract ended at 90.69, up 0.41 on the day, in light trading. Mr Karl Haeling at Deutsche Bank in Frankfurt said: 'Breaking through that point makes it very tempting to get bearish.' However, he pointed out that if there were a rally in bunds, investors were likely to shift into US Treasuries. UK government bonds followed bunds up in thin trading and the December long gilt future closed around 102 1/8, up 13/32. The yield spread over bunds was 135 basis points. A #250m tranche of 8 3/4% Treasury stock due 2017 was exhausted in afternoon trading. The bonds were supplied at 102.28, the Bank of England said. The tranche was one of four tap stocks announced on November 4. Two others, a #250m tranche of 8 1/2% stock due 2005 and #100m of 2 1/2% index-linked stock due 2000 have already been exhausted. Another #100m tranche of 2 1/2% gilts due 2024 has not been sold out. While the sale of the tranche suggested demand for gilts, some analysts believed the bonds had been bought by market-makers and would continue to hang over the market until sold on to investors. A raft of UK data is due out this morning, encompassing figures on government borrowing, inflation, employment and wages, as well as the minutes of the September 26 monetary policy meeting between Mr Kenneth Clarke, chancellor of the exchequer, and Mr Eddie George, governor of the Bank of England. The yield on the 10-year Italian bond rose by 4 basis points to 11.91%. Mr Adrian James at NatWest said this was due to worries over budgetary change. 'Clearly the populace is unhappy about the pension reform,' he said. The yield on the benchmark 11-year Swedish bond fell to 10.84% from 10.88%. Mr Simon Maggs at IBJ said the markets 'believe the honeymoon is over for Swedish bonds'. (c) The Financial Times Limited 1994. "
185,1994-11-15,1994-11-16,Financial Times,FED RAISES US SHORT-TERM RATES BY 3/4 OF A POINT.,"The US Federal Reserve surprised the financial markets yesterday with an increase of three-quarters of a percentage point in short-term interest rates intended to keep inflation under control. The increase is the largest adjustment the Fed has made under the chairmanship of Mr Alan Greenspan, who has preferred more gradual changes in monetary policy, and responds to what the Fed called 'evidence of persistent strength in economic activity and high and rising levels of resource utilisation'. The size of the increase unsettled Wall Street, which had expected the Fed to raise short-term rates by only half a percentage point. Share and bond prices immediately jumped sharply as the markets applauded the central bank's resolve to fight inflation. But they later retreated as investors worried that the Fed's comments about its concern at the strength of the economy suggested it might raise rates again soon. By the close in New York, the Dow Jones Industrial Average - which fluctuated wildly all afternoon - was down 3.37 at 3,826.36. The bond market held its modest gains, which pushed the yield on the long bond down slightly to 8.047%. Currency markets, however, reacted unequivocally to the Fed's move, with the dollar rising a pfennig to DM 1.555 and half a yen to Y 98.7. The dollar opened in Tokyo at Y 98.61 and DM 1.5565. 'The Federal Reserve views these actions as necessary to keep inflation contained, and thereby foster sustainable economic growth,' the Fed said after its federal open markets committee, which sets interest rate policy, met yesterday. The move is the sixth interest rate increase this year, and takes the federal funds rate, which banks pay when they borrow from each other's reserves held at the Fed, to 5.5% from 3.0% at the beginning of the year. The discount rate, which banks pay for direct borrowings from the Fed, also started the year at 3% but has risen only to 4.75%. Many commercial banks immediately followed suit, lifting their prime rates by three-quarters of a percentage point to 8.5%. Financial market traders and economists have been beseeching the Fed to act decisively to slow economic activity. But the Fed has not moved rates by more than half a percentage point in either direction since 1981. When the FOMC last met in September, it decided to leave rates unchanged, in spite of the growing conviction of Wall Street economists that another move would be needed. Economic data available at the time of the September meeting showed that US gross domestic product had grown at a 3.8% annualised pace in the second quarter, the unemployment rate had stabilised at 6.1% and the National Association of Purchasing Managers' index showed a slowdown in manufacturing activity. Since then, second-quarter growth has been revised up to 4.1%, with the third quarter still humming along at a 3.4% rate; unemployment has dipped to 5.8% and the NAPM index has risen sharply for the past two months. Industrial production figures yesterday added to the picture of 'persistent strength in economic activity and high and rising levels of resource utilisation'. (c) The Financial Times Limited 1994. "
186,1994-11-15,1994-11-16,Financial Times,WORLD STOCK MARKETS - SECOND SECTION OUTPERFORMS AS NIKKEI INDEX RECOVERS.,"Tokyo Bargain hunting and arbitrage buying supported share prices and the Nikkei 225 average gained ground in low volume, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. The index closed 130.23 up at 19,391.68 after fluctuating in a narrow range between 19,432.59 and 19,314.76. Brokerage dealers and domestic institutions purchased shares, but foreign investors turned net sellers. Sentiment stayed subdued, with many investors remaining cautious ahead of the US Federal Open Market Committee meeting, and volume eased from 229m shares to 219m. The Topix index of all first section stocks firmed 10.82 to 1,528.64 and the Nikkei 300 moved forward 2.10 to 280.80, while rises outnumbered falls by 738 to 219, with 205 issues unchanged. But in London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index eased 1.06 to 1,259.44. Traders said speculative investors, discouraged by the low volatility in the first section, explored the second section and the over-the-counter market. A branch manager at Nikko Securities said he would recommend that clients focus on small-capitalisation stocks on the second section and in the OTC market backed by strong earnings growth. The second section index climbed 35.25 or 1.7% to 2,147.11. Privatisation issues, which had been battered by recent profit-taking, staged a rally. Reports that the government had abandoned the plan to list West Japan Railways in the current fiscal year cheered market participants. Japan Tobacco recouped Y 30,000 at Y 991,000 on buying by corporate investors, breaking out after six straight sessions of decline. Nippon Telegraph and Telephone gained Y 12,000 at Y 876,000. Brokers, which have been hurt by the recent drop in the stock market, advanced. Nomura Securities rose Y 60 to Y 1,930 and Nikko Securities Y 30 to Y 1,030. Steels and shipbuilders were actively traded but finished mixed. Nippon Steel, the most active issue of the day, moved up Y 3 to Y 385 and Mitsubishi Heavy Industries added Y 9 at Y 749. NKK dipped Y 4 to Y 276. High-technology stocks were firm. NEC improved Y 20 to Y 1,180 and Hitachi Y 4 to Y 974. Sony rose Y 30 to Y 5,780, but Matsushita Electric Industrial receded Y 10 to Y 1,530 in spite of strong consolidated earnings growth. In Osaka, the OSE average put on 143.89 at 21,437.47 in volume of 58m shares. Aoyama Trading, the men's suits maker, rose Y 120 to Y 2,420. Roundup Senior markets, in particular, were inspired by Wall Street's overnight gains and prospects following an expected rise in US interest rates. Jakarta, hosting the APEC summit, was closed for the second day in succession before reopening today. HONG KONG rose 2%, the Hang Seng index climbing 186.74 to 9,565.66 and turn-over more than doubling to HKDollars 3.91bn from Monday's four-month low of HKDollars 1.78bn. However, the view remained that the US situation offered trading, rather than investment, potential. Concerns over US inflation data and rates trends over the longer term were expected to linger after the US credit tightening move widely expected yesterday. Recently weak banks and property shares attracted the most attention, with HSBC, the most active stock, appreciating HKDollars 1.75 to HKDollars 91.25, Sun Hung Kai Properties HKDollars 1 to HKDollars 58.25 and Henderson Land HKDollars 1.50 to HKDollars 49.90. KUALA LUMPUR reported strong retail and institutional buying as the KLSE index rose 25.43 or 2.4% to 1,069.74, its largest single-day gain in more than three months. Volume swelled to 299m shares, its highest in four weeks, from Monday's 132m. Brokers said the market had factored in a 50 basis-point increase in US interest rates, but that a larger rise could put some pressure on the market. Meanwhile, Baring Securities market strategist Mr Alan Butler-Henderson said in his Tiger Talk monthly that the Malaysian market would have the 'best bounce' after any US interest rate increase. BANGKOK surged as the market finally discounted expectations of a rise in US interest rates, and the SET index closed 19.01 better at 1,496.85 in heavy turnover of Bt8.69bn. Buying interest emerged initially in the finance sector, and spilled over to some property issues. SINGAPORE ended off intraday highs, the Straits Times Industrial index finally standing 14.24 up at 2,341.18. Foreign held bank shares were firm, Overseas Union Bank foreign gaining 25 cents at S$8.75, United Overseas Bank foreign 20 cents at S$16.30 and Overseas Chinese Bank foreign 50 cents at S$15.80. WELLINGTON was led down by forestry stocks Fletcher Challenge and Carter Holt Harvey as the NZSE-40 index retreated 11.98 to 2,042.63. Fletcher finished 14 cents off at NZ$4.12 after some forecasters downgraded their expectations, and Carter slipped 6 cents to NZ$3.78 in sympathy. Workers at Fletcher Challenge Canada's three British Columbia pulp and paper mills voted on Monday in favour of strike action over working conditions, which would not have helped the stock's tone, said brokers. SYDNEY's All Ordinaries index rallied 15.0 to 1,941.4, with brokers noting bargain hunting in resource stocks following the heavy selling in this sector in the previous few days. Among the day's best performers, BHP moved ahead 20 cents to A$19.10, CRA 18 cents to A$17.84 and MIM 6 cents to A$2.54. In the media section, News Corp was down 4 cents at A$5.34 after losing an early gain, but Fairfax advanced 12 cents to A$2.72. KARACHI sagged at the close as market sentiment remained depressed by fears of ethnic violence in Karachi, political uncertainty and shortage of funds. The KSE 100-share index fell 18.67 or 0.9% to 2,178.91. SHANGHAI's A share index declined sharply after Beijing denied reports that it planned to allow pension funds to be invested in the domestic market. The index dropped 29.8 or 3.9% to a day's low of 724.55. (c) The Financial Times Limited 1994. "
187,1994-11-15,1994-11-16,Financial Times,WORLD STOCK MARKETS - S AFRICA ENDS MILDLY FIRMER.,"Shares in Johannesburg registered mild gains, with trading seen to improve late in the day after a lethargic morning session. Brokers remarked that turnover had been slow before rising towards the close, although individual share price movements had been restricted by the Federal Reserve's FOMC meeting. One of the features was a rise in the price of bullion, which lifted the golds index a modest 4 points to 2,168, a gain matched by the overall index, which closed at 5,865 after trading in a narrow 10-point range throughout the session. Industrials showed the best performance, advancing 14 to 6,808. Among the most heavily traded stocks yesterday, De Beers recovered from a softer start to finish unchanged at R99.75 and Anglos was 50 cents better at R243.50. Elsewhere, Gencor put on 5 cents at R15.20, Minorco relinquished 50 cents to R107.50 and Richemont softened 25 cents to R38.50.

188,1994-11-15,1994-11-16,Financial Times,INTERNATIONAL BONDS - ITALY ANNOUNCES TERMS OF Y 450BN EUROYEN OFFERING.,"The Republic of Italy's long-awaited euroyen offering will consist of three tranches, of Y 125bn of three-year, Y 200bn of 10-year and Y 125bn of 20-year bonds, the Italian Treasury said last night. The three-year tranche is likely to carry a coupon of 3 7/8%, the 10-year tranche a coupon of 5.0% and the 20-year tranche a coupon of 5.5%, market sources said. The deal, due to be launched early this morning, will be lead-managed by Daiwa, with Nomura as joint book-runner on the three and 20-year tranches. The three-year tranche is targeted mainly at Japanese retail investors, while the 20-year tranche hopes to find demand among Japanese institutional investors, Daiwa said. Daiwa hopes that the 10-year tranche will excite some interest among Asian investors outside Japan and among European investors. The offering, the third time Italy has tapped the yen market this year, is likely to complete its foreign borrowing programme for 1994. The Hellenic Republic is also rumoured to be close to launching its global dollar offering, which is expected to focus on the five-year area. Joint-lead manager Salomon Brothers was last night unable to comment on the size and terms of the offering. With market attention occupied by the outcome of the US Federal open market committee meeting and by a series of new US economic statistics, there was little new issuance in the eurobond market yesterday. In the Dutch guider sector, Asfinag, the sovereign Austrian financing authority, launched a Fl 300m offering of eight-year bonds, priced to yield 20 basis points over Dutch government bonds. About Fl 150m of the offering was bought by Dutch institutions, lead manager ABN Amro said, with Belgian retail investors also showing some interest. The proceeds were swapped into floating-rate Austrian schillings. In the dollar sector, Sampo Corporation launched a $50m offering of seven-year bonds offering a coupon of 2.75% and callable after five years. Japan's Electric Power Development Company is rumoured to be poised to tap the dollar sector with a $300m offering of five-year bonds, IBJ is said to have the mandate to lead the deal. In the Luxembourg francs sector, the Republic of Portugal launched a LFr2bn offering of bonds due January 2005, lead-managed by Kredietbank. (c) The Financial Times Limited 1994. "
189,1996-12-17,1996-12-18,Financial Times,LONDON STOCK EXCHANGE.,"It was a cautious session in the equity derivatives ahead of the FOMC meeting in the US, though rollover activity boosted turnover in the futures, writes Joel Kibazo. In futures, the overnight retreat on Wall Street set the tone for the opening of trading in the December contract on the FTSE 100 contract. It started trading at 3,975, some 14 points below its previous close. Following a period of sideways trading, buyers of the contract were seen at the lower levels. This gathered momentum, as UK PSBR data was in line with market expectations, and by late morning, December was trading at 3,996, the peak of the day. Fears of a poor opening in New York, along with some nervousness ahead of the Federal Reserve meeting, saw December surrender some of its earlier gains. The publication of US housing data and the initial fall in US bonds caused a further decline, although an improvement on Wall Street saw the contract close off the day's lows. December finished at 3,972, an 8 point discount to the cash market. Volume in the December contract was 22,860 lots, while volume in March was 12,833. Turnover in traded options was 37,917 contracts, of which 12,934 was in the Footsie option and 13,559 in the European-style contract. Railtrack was the busiest stock option with a total of 1,113 lots. Copyright Financial Times Limited 1996. All Rights Reserved. Not Available for Re-dissemination. "
190,1996-12-17,1996-12-18,Financial Times,TAKEOVER TALK LIFTS FRANKFURT FROM TROUGH.,"A revival of takeover talk at Commerzbank lifted FRANKFURT comfortably off its worst levels of the day. Number three in the German banking league, Commerzbank pushed ahead against the trend as speculation ranged from the possibility of an outright bid for the bank or a strategic acquisition by Commerzbank itself. It was an old story but it brushed up fresh enough to lift the shares by 34 pfg to DM 38.44. Some dealers said that a single big buy order explained the rise. Otherwise traders spent the session tracking Wall Street and positioning themselves ahead of Friday's options and futures expiry for Dax contracts Deutsche Bank closed off DM 1.22 at DM 71.19 and Dresdner Bank ended down 33 pfg at DM 48.83. Volkswagen lost DM 3.70 to DM 608.30. Thyssen shed DM 3 to DM 270. Rumours of management changes left SAP DM 6.90 lower at DM 202.50. At the close, the Dax index was 32.66 lower at an Ibis-indicated 2,808.50. PARIS had a volatile session, recovering strongly from early losses on the news of official rate cuts but finally ending with the CAC 40 index off 28.87 or 1.3% at 2,193.70. Dealers said that turnover was dull with investors uncertain about direction and many holding off the market as the Bank of France spelt out its monetary policy targets. The interest rate moves met with a mixed reaction, as Axa hardened slightly but most financials lost ground. Axa added FFr 2.60 to FFr 304.8. Bancaire came off FFr 13 to FFr 565 and Suez shed FFr 3.50 to FFr 211. Paribas ended down FFr 5.10 at FFr 339. LVMH dipped FFr 25 to FFr 1,243 in spite of a Japanese decision to reduce whisky sales taxes. Dealers said that worries about the group's DFS purchase held sentiment in check. Among second liners, Groupe Andre, the shoe retailer, added FFr 1.60 to FFr 398.6 after announcing a financial restructuring plan. Usinor-Sacilor, something of a high flyer lately on the back of CAC 40 inclusion hopes, came off FFr 1.30 to FFr 76. AMSTERDAM took its cue from a dull bond market and moved lower in subdued volume. The AEX index unwound most of Monday's gains, ending off 3.18 at 612.94. Fortis Amev, the previous day's best performer, turned tail with a decline of Fl 1.20 or more than 2% to DFl 56.80. ABN-Amro dipped Fl 1.60 to Fl 106.3. Forecasts of an oil price drop to $16 a barrel next year from Royal Dutch sent the shares down by 10 cents to Fl 288.40. News of fare hikes at both the airline and its cargo offshoot depressed KLM by 10 cents to Fl 47.10. Philips came off 10 cents to Fl 68. KNP BT was the day's sharpest decline, tumbling Fl 1.70 or 4.6% to Fl 35.30. ZURICH put Ciba and Sandoz in the spotlight as the companies called a news conference about their planned merger to become Novartis. However, the pair turned back from their best levels after they confirmed that the US Federal Trade Commission had conditionally approved the merger. The two companiesinsisted that the conditions left their innovative potential intact.<Ciba finished SwFr 2 weaker at SwFr 1,625, off a high of SwFr 1,649, while Sandoz turned back from SwFr 1,540 to finish SwFr 4 weaker at SwFr 1,525. The new Novartis shares are to begin trading on December 23. The broad market edged lower, with many investors sidelined ahead of the FOMC meeting. The SMI index lost 19.8 to 3,850.4. Baloise fell SwFr 115 to SwFr 2,760 when trading resumed after a suspension due to the insurer's announcement that it planned a share split and a capital payout, rather than a dividend, on 1996 results. Swissair added to Monday's SwFr 38 jump, with another rise of SwFr 14, taking the shares to SwFr 1,069 on expectations that tomorrow's press conference would bring news of a plan to separate some of the company's profitable catering operations from its airline operations. STOCKHOLM featured a 3.6% fall in Scania, the truck maker, after its announcement, late on Monday, that its production in the first quarter of 1997 would be cut. The shares lost SKr6 to SKr162. Scania said that it would cut production by about 15% in Europe to balance delivery delays caused by the French truckers' strike in November. The company added that the dispute hit sales and earnings which could have an adverse impact on results in the current quarter. The Affaersvaerlden general index was down 25.4 at 2,290.0. Stadshypotek eased SKr1.5 to SKr186.5 after the board decided to recommend to shareholders the acceptance of Svenska Handelsbanken's bid. Handelsbanken was SKr5 down at SKr190. ISTANBUL rebounded 3.7%, wiping out Monday's 2.4% fall which followed Standard &Poor's downgrading of the country's long-term foreign currency rating. The IMBK-100 index picked up 3,239.00 to close at a day's high of 90,395.96 on selective buying fuelled by a limited cash influx. One analyst said that the recovery came as investors realised that the S&P action did not affect other instruments and that Monday's early 5.5% plunge had been an overreaction. OSLO fell 1.4%, unnerved by the overnight fall on Wall Street and yesterday's US economic data. The total index finished 13.17 down at 920.03. Analysts noted, however, that the market was likely to see a cash inflow in coming weeks under regulations which give investors tax breaks if they invest in the stock market around new year. BRUSSELS ended lower with a big fall for the Bekaert wire rope group unsettling sentiment. Bekaert lost BFr 3,075 to BFr 19,825 following a profits warning. The BFX index closed 111.16 lower at 1,849.03. Written and edited by Michael Morgan and Jeffrey Brown Copyright Financial Times Limited 1996. All Rights Reserved. Not Available for Re-dissemination.

191,1996-12-17,1996-12-18,Financial Times,FURTHER SELLING LEAVES SEOUL NEAR 45 MONTH LOW.,"Further nervous selling took SEOUL down for a fifth consecutive session and left the composite index 10.57 weaker at 663.35, at its lowest level for almost 45 months. Analysts who warned that the index could fall as low as 620 points before a floor was found, said that the uncertain economic outlook, high interest rates and a floundering currency had made the stock market an unattractive proposition for many investors, especially foreigners. They added that investors were particularly uninspired by the government's recent market boosting measures. Some buying emerged in late trading for banks and securities shares on the view that they had been oversold. Commercial Bank of Korea rose Won180 to Won5,180 and Kookmin Bank gained Won200 to Won11,300. Daewoo Securities rose Won300 to Won11,000. TOKYO finished flat after early losses were mostly offset by fresh buying and short-covering in recently hard hit sectors such as construction and banking, agencies report. The Nikkei 225 average finished 8.58 lower at 20,413.46, after a high of 20,500.90 and a low of 20,230.88. Its March futures fell 10 to 20,410. Conversely, the broader Topix index rose 3.44 to 1,515.42, prompting the view that most weak sectors had now bottomed out. The Nikkei 300 average gained 0.78 to 287.42. Volume on the first section of the TSE was a moderate 341m shares, compared with 266m shares on Monday. Declining issues outnumbered advancers 628 to 430, while 200 issues were unchanged. In London, the ISE/Nikkei 50 index fell 2.00 to 1444.97. Losing sectors were led by insurance, rubber, miscellaneous manufacturing, land transport and gas. Gainers were led by railway/bus, banks, oil, construction and warehousing. Shares in Japan's non-life insurers lost out for a second consecutive day. The biggest loser was Tokio Marine, down Y 50 at 1,070, while Mitsui Marine fell Y 26 to Y 608 and Yasuda Fire lost Y 23 at Y 620. Renewed foreign demand supported the banks. Daiwa Bank jumped Y 25 to Y 637 while Sumitomo Bank and Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank each rose Y 50 to Y 1,840 Y 50 and Y 1,770 respectively. In the new, second section of the over-the-counter market, ATL Systems made a solid debut. The shares, with a subscription price of Y 280,000, climbed to a high of Y 473,000 before turning back to close at Y 424,000. In Osaka, the OSE average rose 18.21 to 20,692,57. SHENZHEN's Aand B shares, targeted respectively at domestic and foreign investors, continued to plunge, closing near their limit-down levels of 10% in further response to Beijing's crackdown on the stock markets. The A index plummeted 41.69 to 375.51 and the B index dived 12.79 to 121.64. SHANGHAI's A shares were also under pressure, losing 100.964 or 9.6% to 946.716, but the B index found some relief after its recent falls, losing 1.431 or 2.4% at 58.498. HONG KONG was weak with yesterday's US Federal Open Market Committee providing an excuse to take profits. The Hang Seng index fell 122.11 to 12,815.37 after bouncing off a low of 12,747.91. Turnover declined but remained healthy at HK$5.7bn, down from Monday's HK$6.5bn. Properties came in for selling in the morning, but utilities were the worst performersover the day. Hongkong Telecom slipped 30 cents to HK$12.90 and China Light lost 50 cents to HK$33.50, while Hongkong Electric added 5 cents to HK$25.75. TAIPEI ended lower after late selling in thin volume. The weighted index gave up early to close off 35.85 at 6,855.57. First International Computer stayed on the upside, adding T$1 or 1.94% to T$52.5 after raising its profit target for this year by around 30%. MANILA finished lower with the main index slipping 22.37 to 3,093.21. Bargain hunting created two bright spots. Centennial City, hit lately by the Manila Bay reclamation controversy, bounced 50 centavos or 18% to 3.10 pesos. Philipino Telephone gained 1.25 pesos or almost 5% to 24 pesos. BANGKOK eased lower as investors put a negative interpretation on the latest economic plan. The SET index slipped 5.53 to 867.23 on weak volume. SYDNEY moved lower in line with the overnight decline on Wall Street. The All Ordinaries index came off 20.5 to 2,315.8. Media stocks provided the main focus on the news that Hollinger is to sell its 25% holding in Fairfax to Brierley Investments. Fairfax dipped 1 cent to A$2.77. SINGAPORE featured a 2.8% drop in Fraser &Neave in further response to its warning that it expected its property earnings to fall by half in the current year. The shares lost 40 cents to S$14.10, at which level, analysts said, F&N should find some support. The broad market was easier with the Straits Times Industrial index losing 6.74 at 2,176.52. Strong demand was, however, seen for Singapore Land which rose 35 cents to S$8.20. Jurong Cement was another gainer, rising 5 cents to S$6.25 on old takeover rumours.

192,1996-12-17,1996-12-18,Financial Times,DOLLAR DIPS ON STRONG US HOUSING STARTS DATA.,"The dollar lost nearly a pfennig against the D-Mark yesterday, after robust US housing starts data caused a sell-off in US bonds and persuaded traders that the Federal Reserve might raise interest rates soon to slow the American economy. The D-Mark closed 0.9 pfennigs higher against the dollar in London yesterday at DM 1.545. The German currency was also buoyed by Mr Otmar Issing, Bundesbank chief economist, who told the Financial Times that the stability pact for European monetary union must be implemented strictly. That would stop Emu member states from running loose fiscal policies, and would thus help make the future single European currency a hard one. Mr Kit Juckes, currency strategist at NatWest Markets in London, said Mr Issing's comments showed the Bundesbank was more hawkish than the German government in seeking strict conditions for Emu. Sterling rose against both the dollar and the D-Mark, buoyed by continued belief that the UK would raise interest rates soon but that at the same time inflation was under control. Japanese investors continued buying the pound. It rose 1.1 cents against the dollar to $1.673 and 0.3 pfennigs against the D-Mark to DM 2.585. However these changes came amid thin trading as the quiet fortnight on the currency markets continued. Mr Mark Geddes, analyst at 4Cast, said: ""We're into pre-Christmas trading at the moment."" Traders were also awaiting the outcome of the US Federal Open Markets Committee meeting after the London close. The FOMC left interest rates unchanged. Both France and Sweden cut key rates. The Bank of France cut its intervention rate by 5 basis points to 3.15% and its 5-to-10 day lending rate by 15 basis points to 4.60%. But the French franc barely softened against the D-Mark, and rose against the dollar. The Riksbank, Sweden's central bank, reduced its repo rate for the 25th time this year, by 25 basis points to 4.1%. The market had expected the move, and the krona fell only slightly against the D-Mark, from SKr4.396 to SKr4.414. The Riksbank also said Sweden's inflation outlook had improved since its September report. The bank now expects inflation rates of 1.5% in 1997 and two per cent in 1998. * French and German policymakers yesterday again pointed in different directions regarding the level of the dollar. The Bundesbank's monthly report said the D-Mark had now almost wholly corrected its excessive strength of last year, so that its level was in line with economic fundamentals. The report also suggested interest rates would not move for a while. The message seemed to be that the Bundesbank rejected French demands for a rate cut aimed at boosting the dollar. France thinks a fall in the franc would stimulate its economy. But it can only make very minor cuts to its own rates - as it did yesterday - unless the Bundesbank eases too. Otherwise the franc would cease tracking the D-Mark, and the Emu process could collapse. But although the Bundesbank yesterday seemed to exclude the option of a weaker D-Mark and French franc, Mr Jean Trichet, governor of the Bank of France, simultaneously called for exactly that. ""It is possible that the market has a tendency to underestimate the underlying fundamentals of the dollar,"" he said, suggesting that the US currency was undervalued. He said the Group of Seven industrialised nations should discuss the issue. But France would not appear to have the Bundesbank's backing. * There was more support yesterday for the view that most Japanese officials want the dollar weaker than Y 114 to the yen. That support came after Mr Kabun Muto, director general of Japan's management and co-ordination agency, said to general surprise that the yen should be ""slightly cheaper"" than its present level to help Japanese industry. His comment sent the dollar above Y 114. But other unnamed Japanese officials later said Mr Muto had been speaking on a personal basis, and the dollar lost Y 0.3 on the day to close at Y 113.7.

193,1996-12-17,1996-12-18,Financial Times,SIGNS OF HOUSING STRENGTH HIT TREASURIES.,"Signs of stronger growth in the US housing sector pushed down bond prices in New York and dampened sentiment in most other markets, as the Federal Reserve left interest rates unchanged. In Europe, prices drifted lower in thin trading with many bigger traders such as hedge funds and bank proprietary desks reported to be on the sidelines. The US housing figures led to a fall in prices in early trading with the yield on the benchmark 30-year bond rising to its highest level since November 4. At mid-afternoon in New York, the long bond was off 13/32 at 97 29/32 to yield 6.657%, while at the short end of the maturity spectrum the two-year note fell 1/16 to 99 19/32 yielding 5.830%. The March 30-year bond fell by 7/16 to 112 5/16. Treasuries started the morning with modest losses and then slipped further after the Commerce Department said that construction was begun on 1.5m homes in November, a 9.2% increase that made up for nearly all of the decline in housing starts seen in September and October. Economists had expected the figure to have held steady at about 1.39m homes. The Fed announced that it had concluded its Open Market Committee meeting without changing interest rates. Few on Wall Street had expected any change in monetary policy, but economists are divided about whether the Fed might raise interest rates in the early part of next year. FOMC members did not issue any statement. Mr John Spinello, a government securities strategist at Merrill Lynch said there was no increase in activity after the Fed's announcement. He attributed much of yesterday's declines to a desire among portfolio managers to lock in gains, especially given the market's strength in November. ""There is some skittishness about lower [bond] prices eating into the returns of managers,"" he said. Concerns about new supply set to hit the market today and tomorrow, when the Treasury is to auction two-year and five-year notes, may also have contributed to yesterday's slide. In Europe, The Italian market started well with early buying in the cash market by domestic institutions. At Liffe, the London futures market, the March BTP contract reached a high in mid-morning of 129.13. Analysts said that investors had been encouraged by the fact that the government had overcome some parliamentary opposition to its 1997 budget plans. Further votes on the package are due to take place this week. Even so, following the decline in the US, prices drifted lower later in the day with the BTP contract settling at 128.29, down more than half a point. In the cash market the 10-year yield spread over Germany, which had narrowed to a low of 165 basis points by mid-morning, later widened back out to close 5 basis points wider at 172 basis points. The Spanish market followed a similar pattern with the March 10-year futures contract settling at 110.91, down 0.70, and the yield spread over Germany widening by 5 basis points to 117. Among the ""peripheral"" markets, however, Sweden bucked the trend, with the local market buoyed by a further cut in the repo rate by the Riksbank. Sweden's 10-year yield spread over Germany fell by 8 basis points to 94. Denmark also outperformed, with its 10-year spread narrowing from 84 to 81 basis points. France and Germany both lost about a third of a point. The markets found little encouragement from the Bank of France's decision to reduce its intervention rate by 5 basis points to 3.15% and also its five to 10-day repo rate, which usually set the ceiling for market rates, by 15 basis points to 4.60%. ""The markets were putting a negative spin on everything,"" said Mr Julian Jessop, chief European economist at Nikko Europe. The poor performance of the US market also dragged down UK government bonds, with the March long gilt contract falling by 3/8, to 108 11/16. Japanese government bonds were also knocked back by the fall in the US, with the yield on the benchmark 10-year JGB No 182 rising in London trading by about one basis point to 2.41%. Earlier in the day in Tokyo, the yield on the JGB had fallen by 3 basis points, with bonds benefiting from a fall in the local equity market. Mr Alex Cooper, manager at Tullett &Tokyo, said traders were watching Japanese yields particularly closely following the fall of yields to historic low levels earlier this month. ""A downtrend in the JGB market could be a catalyst for a nasty sell-off in international bond markets,"" argues Mr Cooper. Copyright Financial Times Limited 1996. All Rights Reserved.

196,1996-12-17,1996-12-18,Financial Times,SIGNS OF HOUSING STRENGTH HIT TREASURIES.,"Signs of stronger growth in the US housing sector pushed down bond prices in New York and dampened sentiment in most other markets, as the Federal Reserve left interest rates unchanged. In Europe, prices drifted lower in thin trading with many bigger traders such as hedge funds and bank proprietary desks reported to be on the sidelines. The US housing figures led to a fall in prices in early trading with the yield on the benchmark 30-year bond rising to its highest level since November 4. At mid-afternoon in New York, the long bond was off 13/32 at 97 29/32 to yield 6.657%, while at the short end of the maturity spectrum the two-year note fell 1/16 to 99 19/32 yielding 5.830%. The March 30-year bond fell by 7/16 to 112 5/16. Treasuries started the morning with modest losses and then slipped further after the Commerce Department said that construction was begun on 1.5m homes in November, a 9.2% increase that made up for nearly all of the decline in housing starts seen in September and October. Economists had expected the figure to have held steady at about 1.39m homes. The Fed announced that it had concluded its Open Market Committee meeting without changing interest rates. Few on Wall Street had expected any change in monetary policy, but economists are divided about whether the Fed might raise interest rates in the early part of next year. FOMC members did not issue any statement. Mr John Spinello, a government securities strategist at Merrill Lynch said there was no increase in activity after the Fed's announcement. He attributed much of yesterday's declines to a desire among portfolio managers to lock in gains, especially given the market's strength in November. ""There is some skittishness about lower [bond] prices eating into the returns of managers,"" he said. Concerns about new supply set to hit the market today and tomorrow, when the Treasury is to auction two-year and five-year notes, may also have contributed to yesterday's slide. In Europe, The Italian market started well with early buying in the cash market by domestic institutions. At Liffe, the London futures market, the March BTP contract reached a high in mid-morning of 129.13. Analysts said that investors had been encouraged by the fact that the government had overcome some parliamentary opposition to its 1997 budget plans. Further votes on the package are due to take place this week. Even so, following the decline in the US, prices drifted lower later in the day with the BTP contract settling at 128.29, down more than half a point. In the cash market the 10-year yield spread over Germany, which had narrowed to a low of 165 basis points by mid-morning, later widened back out to close 5 basis points wider at 172 basis points. The Spanish market followed a similar pattern with the March 10-year futures contract settling at 110.91, down 0.70, and the yield spread over Germany widening by 5 basis points to 117. Among the ""peripheral"" markets, however, Sweden bucked the trend, with the local market buoyed by a further cut in the repo rate by the Riksbank. Sweden's 10-year yield spread over Germany fell by 8 basis points to 94. Denmark also outperformed, with its 10-year spread narrowing from 84 to 81 basis points. France and Germany both lost about a third of a point. The markets found little encouragement from the Bank of France's decision to reduce its intervention rate by 5 basis points to 3.15% and also its five to 10-day repo rate, which usually set the ceiling for market rates, by 15 basis points to 4.60%. ""The markets were putting a negative spin on everything,"" said Mr Julian Jessop, chief European economist at Nikko Europe. The poor performance of the US market also dragged down UK government bonds, with the March long gilt contract falling by 3/8, to 108 11/16. Japanese government bonds were also knocked back by the fall in the US, with the yield on the benchmark 10-year JGB No 182 rising in London trading by about one basis point to 2.41%. Earlier in the day in Tokyo, the yield on the JGB had fallen by 3 basis points, with bonds benefiting from a fall in the local equity market. Mr Alex Cooper, manager at Tullett &Tokyo, said traders were watching Japanese yields particularly closely following the fall of yields to historic low levels earlier this month.

197,1996-12-17,1996-12-18,Financial Times,LONDON STOCK EXCHANGE.,"It was a cautious session in the equity derivatives ahead of the FOMC meeting in the US, though rollover activity boosted turnover in the futures, writes Joel Kibazo. In futures, the overnight retreat on Wall Street set the tone for the opening of trading in the December contract on the FTSE 100 contract. It started trading at 3,975, some 14 points below its previous close. Following a period of sideways trading, buyers of the contract were seen at the lower levels. This gathered momentum, as UK PSBR data was in line with market expectations, and by late morning, December was trading at 3,996, the peak of the day. Fears of a poor opening in New York, along with some nervousness ahead of the Federal Reserve meeting, saw December surrender some of its earlier gains. The publication of US housing data and the initial fall in US bonds caused a further decline, although an improvement on Wall Street saw the contract close off the day's lows. December finished at 3,972, an 8 point discount to the cash market. Volume in the December contract was 22,860 lots, while volume in March was 12,833. Turnover in traded options was 37,917 contracts, of which 12,934 was in the Footsie option and 13,559 in the European-style contract. Railtrack was the busiest stock option with a total of 1,113 lots. Copyright Financial Times Limited 1996. All Rights Reserved. Not Available for Re-dissemination. "
198,1996-12-17,1996-12-18,Financial Times,TAKEOVER TALK LIFTS FRANKFURT FROM TROUGH.,"A revival of takeover talk at Commerzbank lifted FRANKFURT comfortably off its worst levels of the day. Number three in the German banking league, Commerzbank pushed ahead against the trend as speculation ranged from the possibility of an outright bid for the bank or a strategic acquisition by Commerzbank itself. It was an old story but it brushed up fresh enough to lift the shares by 34 pfg to DM 38.44. Some dealers said that a single big buy order explained the rise. Otherwise traders spent the session tracking Wall Street and positioning themselves ahead of Friday's options and futures expiry for Dax contracts Deutsche Bank closed off DM 1.22 at DM 71.19 and Dresdner Bank ended down 33 pfg at DM 48.83. Volkswagen lost DM 3.70 to DM 608.30. Thyssen shed DM 3 to DM 270. Rumours of management changes left SAP DM 6.90 lower at DM 202.50. At the close, the Dax index was 32.66 lower at an Ibis-indicated 2,808.50. PARIS had a volatile session, recovering strongly from early losses on the news of official rate cuts but finally ending with the CAC 40 index off 28.87 or 1.3% at 2,193.70. Dealers said that turnover was dull with investors uncertain about direction and many holding off the market as the Bank of France spelt out its monetary policy targets. The interest rate moves met with a mixed reaction, as Axa hardened slightly but most financials lost ground. Axa added FFr 2.60 to FFr 304.8. Bancaire came off FFr 13 to FFr 565 and Suez shed FFr 3.50 to FFr 211. Paribas ended down FFr 5.10 at FFr 339. LVMH dipped FFr 25 to FFr 1,243 in spite of a Japanese decision to reduce whisky sales taxes. Dealers said that worries about the group's DFS purchase held sentiment in check. Among second liners, Groupe Andre, the shoe retailer, added FFr 1.60 to FFr 398.6 after announcing a financial restructuring plan. Usinor-Sacilor, something of a high flyer lately on the back of CAC 40 inclusion hopes, came off FFr 1.30 to FFr 76. AMSTERDAM took its cue from a dull bond market and moved lower in subdued volume. The AEX index unwound most of Monday's gains, ending off 3.18 at 612.94. Fortis Amev, the previous day's best performer, turned tail with a decline of Fl 1.20 or more than 2% to DFl 56.80. ABN-Amro dipped Fl 1.60 to Fl 106.3. Forecasts of an oil price drop to $16 a barrel next year from Royal Dutch sent the shares down by 10 cents to Fl 288.40. News of fare hikes at both the airline and its cargo offshoot depressed KLM by 10 cents to Fl 47.10. Philips came off 10 cents to Fl 68. KNP BT was the day's sharpest decline, tumbling Fl 1.70 or 4.6% to Fl 35.30. ZURICH put Ciba and Sandoz in the spotlight as the companies called a news conference about their planned merger to become Novartis. However, the pair turned back from their best levels after they confirmed that the US Federal Trade Commission had conditionally approved the merger. The two companiesinsisted that the conditions left their innovative potential intact. Ciba finished SwFr 2 weaker at SwFr 1,625, off a high of SwFr 1,649, while Sandoz turned back from SwFr 1,540 to finish SwFr 4 weaker at SwFr 1,525. The new Novartis shares are to begin trading on December 23. The broad market edged lower, with many investors sidelined ahead of the FOMC meeting. The SMI index lost 19.8 to 3,850.4. Baloise fell SwFr 115 to SwFr 2,760 when trading resumed after a suspension due to the insurer's announcement that it planned a share split and a capital payout, rather than a dividend, on 1996 results. Swissair added to Monday's SwFr 38 jump, with another rise of SwFr 14, taking the shares to SwFr 1,069 on expectations that tomorrow's press conference would bring news of a plan to separate some of the company's profitable catering operations from its airline operations. STOCKHOLM featured a 3.6% fall in Scania, the truck maker, after its announcement, late on Monday, that its production in the first quarter of 1997 would be cut. The shares lost SKr6 to SKr162. Scania said that it would cut production by about 15% in Europe to balance delivery delays caused by the French truckers' strike in November. The company added that the dispute hit sales and earnings which could have an adverse impact on results in the current quarter. The Affaersvaerlden general index was down 25.4 at 2,290.0. Stadshypotek eased SKr1.5 to SKr186.5 after the board decided to recommend to shareholders the acceptance of Svenska Handelsbanken's bid. Handelsbanken was SKr5 down at SKr190. ISTANBUL rebounded 3.7%, wiping out Monday's 2.4% fall which followed Standard &Poor's downgrading of the country's long-term foreign currency rating. The IMBK-100 index picked up 3,239.00 to close at a day's high of 90,395.96 on selective buying fuelled by a limited cash influx. One analyst said that the recovery came as investors realised that the S&P action did not affect other instruments and that Monday's early 5.5% plunge had been an overreaction. OSLO fell 1.4%, unnerved by the overnight fall on Wall Street and yesterday's US economic data. The total index finished 13.17 down at 920.03. Analysts noted, however, that the market was likely to see a cash inflow in coming weeks under regulations which give investors tax breaks if they invest in the stock market around new year. BRUSSELS ended lower with a big fall for the Bekaert wire rope group unsettling sentiment. Bekaert lost BFr 3,075 to BFr 19,825 following a profits warning. The BFX index closed 111.16 lower at 1,849.03. Written and edited by Michael Morgan and Jeffrey Brown Copyright Financial Times Limited 1996. All Rights Reserved. Not Available for Re-dissemination.

199,1996-12-17,1996-12-18,Financial Times,FURTHER SELLING LEAVES SEOUL NEAR 45 MONTH LOW.,"Further nervous selling took SEOUL down for a fifth consecutive session and left the composite index 10.57 weaker at 663.35, at its lowest level for almost 45 months. Analysts who warned that the index could fall as low as 620 points before a floor was found, said that the uncertain economic outlook, high interest rates and a floundering currency had made the stock market an unattractive proposition for many investors, especially foreigners. They added that investors were particularly uninspired by the government's recent market boosting measures. Some buying emerged in late trading for banks and securities shares on the view that they had been oversold. Commercial Bank of Korea rose Won180 to Won5,180 and Kookmin Bank gained Won200 to Won11,300. Daewoo Securities rose Won300 to Won11,000. TOKYO finished flat after early losses were mostly offset by fresh buying and short-covering in recently hard hit sectors such as construction and banking, agencies report. The Nikkei 225 average finished 8.58 lower at 20,413.46, after a high of 20,500.90 and a low of 20,230.88. Its March futures fell 10 to 20,410. Conversely, the broader Topix index rose 3.44 to 1,515.42, prompting the view that most weak sectors had now bottomed out. The Nikkei 300 average gained 0.78 to 287.42. Volume on the first section of the TSE was a moderate 341m shares, compared with 266m shares on Monday. Declining issues outnumbered advancers 628 to 430, while 200 issues were unchanged. In London, the ISE/Nikkei 50 index fell 2.00 to 1444.97. Losing sectors were led by insurance, rubber, miscellaneous manufacturing, land transport and gas. Gainers were led by railway/bus, banks, oil, construction and warehousing. Shares in Japan's non-life insurers lost out for a second consecutive day. The biggest loser was Tokio Marine, down Y 50 at 1,070, while Mitsui Marine fell Y 26 to Y 608 and Yasuda Fire lost Y 23 at Y 620. Renewed foreign demand supported the banks. Daiwa Bank jumped Y 25 to Y 637 while Sumitomo Bank and Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank each rose Y 50 to Y 1,840 Y 50 and Y 1,770 respectively. In the new, second section of the over-the-counter market, ATL Systems made a solid debut. The shares, with a subscription price of Y 280,000, climbed to a high of Y 473,000 before turning back to close at Y 424,000. In Osaka, the OSE average rose 18.21 to 20,692,57. SHENZHEN's Aand B shares, targeted respectively at domestic and foreign investors, continued to plunge, closing near their limit-down levels of 10% in further response to Beijing's crackdown on the stock markets. The A index plummeted 41.69 to 375.51 and the B index dived 12.79 to 121.64. SHANGHAI's A shares were also under pressure, losing 100.964 or 9.6% to 946.716, but the B index found some relief after its recent falls, losing 1.431 or 2.4% at 58.498. HONG KONG was weak with yesterday's US Federal Open Market Committee providing an excuse to take profits. The Hang Seng index fell 122.11 to 12,815.37 after bouncing off a low of 12,747.91. Turnover declined but remained healthy at HK$5.7bn, down from Monday's HK$6.5bn. Properties came in for selling in the morning, but utilities were the worst performersover the day. Hongkong Telecom slipped 30 cents to HK$12.90 and China Light lost 50 cents to HK$33.50, while Hongkong Electric added 5 cents to HK$25.75. TAIPEI ended lower after late selling in thin volume. The weighted index gave up early to close off 35.85 at 6,855.57. First International Computer stayed on the upside, adding T$1 or 1.94% to T$52.5 after raising its profit target for this year by around 30%. MANILA finished lower with the main index slipping 22.37 to 3,093.21. Bargain hunting created two bright spots. Centennial City, hit lately by the Manila Bay reclamation controversy, bounced 50 centavos or 18% to 3.10 pesos. Philipino Telephone gained 1.25 pesos or almost 5% to 24 pesos. BANGKOK eased lower as investors put a negative interpretation on the latest economic plan. The SET index slipped 5.53 to 867.23 on weak volume. SYDNEY moved lower in line with the overnight decline on Wall Street. The All Ordinaries index came off 20.5 to 2,315.8. Media stocks provided the main focus on the news that Hollinger is to sell its 25% holding in Fairfax to Brierley Investments. Fairfax dipped 1 cent to A$2.77. SINGAPORE featured a 2.8% drop in Fraser &Neave in further response to its warning that it expected its property earnings to fall by half in the current year. The shares lost 40 cents to S$14.10, at which level, analysts said, F&N should find some support. The broad market was easier with the Straits Times Industrial index losing 6.74 at 2,176.52. Strong demand was, however, seen for Singapore Land which rose 35 cents to S$8.20. Jurong Cement was another gainer, rising 5 cents to S$6.25 on old takeover rumours.

200,1996-12-17,1996-12-18,Financial Times,DOLLAR DIPS ON STRONG US HOUSING STARTS DATA.,"The dollar lost nearly a pfennig against the D-Mark yesterday, after robust US housing starts data caused a sell-off in US bonds and persuaded traders that the Federal Reserve might raise interest rates soon to slow the American economy. The D-Mark closed 0.9 pfennigs higher against the dollar in London yesterday at DM 1.545. The German currency was also buoyed by Mr Otmar Issing, Bundesbank chief economist, who told the Financial Times that the stability pact for European monetary union must be implemented strictly. That would stop Emu member states from running loose fiscal policies, and would thus help make the future single European currency a hard one. Mr Kit Juckes, currency strategist at NatWest Markets in London, said Mr Issing's comments showed the Bundesbank was more hawkish than the German government in seeking strict conditions for Emu. Sterling rose against both the dollar and the D-Mark, buoyed by continued belief that the UK would raise interest rates soon but that at the same time inflation was under control. Japanese investors continued buying the pound. It rose 1.1 cents against the dollar to $1.673 and 0.3 pfennigs against the D-Mark to DM 2.585. However these changes came amid thin trading as the quiet fortnight on the currency markets continued. Mr Mark Geddes, analyst at 4Cast, said: ""We're into pre-Christmas trading at the moment."" Traders were also awaiting the outcome of the US Federal Open Markets Committee meeting after the London close. The FOMC left interest rates unchanged. Both France and Sweden cut key rates. The Bank of France cut its intervention rate by 5 basis points to 3.15% and its 5-to-10 day lending rate by 15 basis points to 4.60%. But the French franc barely softened against the D-Mark, and rose against the dollar. The Riksbank, Sweden's central bank, reduced its repo rate for the 25th time this year, by 25 basis points to 4.1%. The market had expected the move, and the krona fell only slightly against the D-Mark, from SKr4.396 to SKr4.414. The Riksbank also said Sweden's inflation outlook had improved since its September report. The bank now expects inflation rates of 1.5% in 1997 and two per cent in 1998. * French and German policymakers yesterday again pointed in different directions regarding the level of the dollar. The Bundesbank's monthly report said the D-Mark had now almost wholly corrected its excessive strength of last year, so that its level was in line with economic fundamentals. The report also suggested interest rates would not move for a while. The message seemed to be that the Bundesbank rejected French demands for a rate cut aimed at boosting the dollar. France thinks a fall in the franc would stimulate its economy. But it can only make very minor cuts to its own rates - as it did yesterday - unless the Bundesbank eases too. Otherwise the franc would cease tracking the D-Mark, and the Emu process could collapse. But although the Bundesbank yesterday seemed to exclude the option of a weaker D-Mark and French franc, Mr Jean Trichet, governor of the Bank of France, simultaneously called for exactly that. ""It is possible that the market has a tendency to underestimate the underlying fundamentals of the dollar,"" he said, suggesting that the US currency was undervalued. He said the Group of Seven industrialised nations should discuss the issue. But France would not appear to have the Bundesbank's backing. * There was more support yesterday for the view that most Japanese officials want the dollar weaker than Y 114 to the yen. That support came after Mr Kabun Muto, director general of Japan's management and co-ordination agency, said to general surprise that the yen should be ""slightly cheaper"" than its present level to help Japanese industry. His comment sent the dollar above Y 114. But other unnamed Japanese officials later said Mr Muto had been speaking on a personal basis, and the dollar lost Y 0.3 on the day to close at Y 113.7.

The Nikkei average index dropped another 620.14 points to close at 14,309.41, its lowest close since March 1986. Dealers said the bond market rallied steadily in response to the stock market's free-fall. 'People are pouring money into the (Japanese) government bond market as they expect to see an easing in interest rates,' said one dealer. Short-term interest rates edged lower, with the rate on three-month certificates of deposit slipping from 3.90% to 3.88% yesterday. The price of the December futures contract for 10-year government bonds traded as high as 106.10, the highest level for the since August 1989. The yield on the benchmark No 129 moved from its opening level of 4.80% to 4.71% before closing at 4.725% in Tokyo. The No 129 continued to rally in London trading, taking its cue from the strong opening in the US treasury bond market. Dealers said yesterday's announcement by Mr Tsutomu Hata, the finance minister, of a package of emergency measures yesterday to restore confidence in the stock market had little impact on the bond market. AN unexpected decline in July housing starts lifted US Treasury prices across the maturity range yesterday, temporarily eclipsing the market's concerns about politically-motivated tax cuts. In late trading the benchmark 30-year government bond was up 3/8 at 98, yielding 7.328%. The two-year note was markedly firmer, up 1/8 at 100 7/16, to yield 3.996%. Prices gained ground after the Commerce department reported that housing starts fell 2.8% last month, and that June's housing starts fell a revised 3.8% (they were originally reported to have declined by 3.2%). Analysts had predicted a modest upturn in housing starts for July, so the figures immediately triggered a spate of buying, especially at the short end of the yield curve. Short-dated securities were also buoyed by speculation about another policy ease. The Federal Reserve's policy-making Open Market Committee began its monthly meeting yesterday, and investors were hoping that continued economic weakness would persuade the FOMC to sanction another interest rate cut. AUSTRALIAN government bonds staged a strong rally following the government's annual budget announcement and promises of further cuts in interest rates. The government forecast a budget deficit for the 1992/93 fiscal year of A$13.39bn, towards the low end of expectations. The statement added that 'further reductions in interest rates will be possible if the decline in inflation and expectations of inflation is sustained,' prompting a surge in the bond market, with shorter-dated issues showing the biggest gains. Mr John Dawkins, the treasurer, forecast that inflation would average 2% in the year ending June 30 1993, from 1.9% last year. The government expects the economy to grow by 3% this year. The three-year bond futures contract, which had traded at around 93.08 before the announcement, climbed to 93.24. In the cash market, the yield on the 10% bond due October 2002 moved to 8.28% after the budget, from 8.37% before the announcement. GERMAN government bonds ended slightly weaker with the market awaiting today's Bundesbank tender allocation and the release of the July money supply figures. The Liffe bund futures contract traded in a fairly narrow range of 87.64-87.78, ending the day at around 87.68. Dealers warned the market would be watching the Bundesbank's tender allocation for signs of any move in interest rates. STERLING'S weakness in the foreign exchange markets depressed the UK government bond market yesterday with gilts ending the day slightly lower. The Liffe futures contract slipped from 97.20 at the opening to 97.17 while the 11 3/4% gilt due 2003/07 drifted from 115 23/32 to 115 21/32. The Bank of England announced details of its next auction which met market expectations - the Bank will auction #2.5bn of the 8 3/4% gilt due 2017 on August 26. The Financial Times.

March touched a low of 6,226 at one stage but the pressure from a strong rise by US equities on Monday and further buying yesterday ahead of the FOMC meeting on rates pushed it to a high of 6,367. The future ended the day close to its peak and more than 60 points above the cash market. At that level it was at a 20-point premium to the estimated fair value. In options, however, volumes remained muted with only 34,000 lots dealt compared with 33,486 on Monday. Activity was evenly spread between calls and puts while only two stocks - Vodafone and BT - traded more than 1,000 lots. Vodafone, which has a January expiry, traded 5,753 with most of the business seen in the January 240p puts and January 260p and 280p calls. "
204,2000-12-19,2000-12-20,Financial Times,FRONT PAGE - FIRST SECTION - Fed hints rate cut may be on the way.,"The US Federal Reserve yesterday left short-term interest rates unchanged but declared itself more worried about the risk of recession than of inflation. Amid mounting fears of recession, the Fed's policy-making open market committee signalled a likely end to an 18-month cycle of interest rate increases by suggesting its next move was more likely to be a reduction. It is the first time in at least two years that the committee has been signalling the ""tilt"" in its assessment of the economy that it has skipped a stage. It has moved from leaning towards tightening to leaning towards easing, passing over a neutral stance. In a possible hint it might make a rate cut decision before the next scheduled meeting late in January, it said it would continue to monitor the economy closely. A Fed statement explaining its decision to keep its target rate for Federal funds unchanged at 6.5 per cent said some inflation risks persisted but were reduced by the more moderate pace of economic activity and moderate expectations of inflation. That marks a significant change from the mid-November statement, when the FOMC said labour shortages and high energy prices harboured the ""possibility of raising inflation expectations"" and hence inflation and added that the economic slowdown had ""not been sufficient to warrant a change"" in its anti-inflation posture. The tightening in credit conditions and the drop in equity prices in the past months now threaten the boom in business investment, a hallmark of the nine-year expansion.

Applied Micro Circuits was off 3.3 per cent to $5.50, while PCM-Sierra followed, down 3.2 per cent to $13.54. The negative sentiment toward the sector would not be deterred, with Applied Materials shares slipping 1.9 per cent to $20.58 despite an upbeat note from Merrill Lynch. By the close, the Dow Jones Industrial Average had slipped 22.74 to 9,448.81, while the broader S&P 500 was down 3.83 to 1,014.80. The Nasdaq fell 9.33 to 1,845.70. While the FOMC meeting is the highlight of the week's economic calendar, manufacturing activity was again under scrutiny at the start of the week. Industrial output rose 0.1 per cent in August - less than the previous month's upwardly revised 0.7 per cent increase - as summer shutdowns and holidays, reflected in the pullback in manufacturing payrolls, hit the sector. Analysts expected a rise of 0.3 per cent. But the September Empire State index of manufacturing in New York beat expectations to move further into the expansion zone as factories reopened after the summer. The New York Federal Reserve district reported a fifth consecutive rise, with the index hitting 18.35, from 9.98 in August. By the close, the losses were spread across the S&P 500, with most sectors posting slides of 1 per cent or less. But the day was not without bright spots. Alphapharma, the generic drug maker, joined the ranks of biotechs to post gains on the back of new drug news. Shares rose 7.4 per cent to $20.23 after the company announced late on Friday that it received US regulatory approval for its version of Neurontin, Pfizer's epilepsy drug. Elsewhere in the sector, Vaxgen continued to benefit from an announcement on Friday that research indicated that its smallpox vaccination may help prevent HIV. Traders said it was also buoyed among retail investors by a perception the company could benefit from US government spending on vaccines to combat terrorist attacks. Shares added 23.9 per cent to $8.05. Golden State Vintners,a small California winery, was another winner, leaping 44.2 per cent to $3 after announcing a reverse share split. Footstar, a maker of athletic shoes, declined by 17 per cent to $8.65 after the company's chairman and chief executive resigned over an accounting discrepancy. The company plans to restate financials from 1997 to 2002, which are expected to reduce earnings in that period. Elsewhere in retail, investors were feeling more comfortable with consumer spending and the sector posted gains of 1.5 per cent, the best performance on the S&P 500. Home Depot, the home improvement chain, added 3.8 per cent to $32.78, while rival Lowe's climbed 2.4 per cent to $52.70 as investors bet on homeowners in the US north-east buying hurricane-proof articles ahead of the expected arrival of Hurricane Isabel, which is currently off the coast.

207,2003-09-15,2003-09-16,Financial Times,Fed expected to leave rates on hold FOMC MEETING.,"The US Federal Reserve's open market committee meets today amid wide expectation among investors that it will leave interest rates on hold at 1 per cent. Futures markets yesterday were pricing in a probability of around 5 per cent that the FOMC would raise rates by a quarter-point, underlining the consensus among investors and economists that they will remain on hold for the next few months. Data released yesterday continued the slightly disappointing tone of figures released last week, showing that the Fed's view that the economy is moving into a sustained period of faster growth remains at risk. Industrial production in the US edged 0.1 per cent higher in August, below economists' expectations of a 0.3 per cent rise. The new figure, however, was offset partially by an upward revision of July's increase, to 0.7 per cent, from the previously announced 0.5 per cent. Most forecasters still think the US economy is gathering steam. The National Association of Business Economists said yesterday a survey of forecasters had raised their expectations for growth, with predictions for 2004 rising to 4 per cent, up from 3.6 per cent in the previous survey in May. In its regular report on its members' expectations, the NABE said consumer spending and business investment would rise more quickly than previously thought. But the panel reduced its expectations for growth in corporate profits. Speaking at the NABE's annual meeting, Greg Mankiw, chairman of the White House Council of Economic Advisors, said: ""Most of the recent news has been better than we expected. The signs of a rebound are now numerous."" But it could be a while before the improvements feed through to increases in interest rates. While most officials in the Fed share Wall Street's confidence that the economic recovery is gaining momentum, they have so far seen little evidence companies are regaining pricing power and that inflation is likely to take off. Accordingly, it would be a shock if the FOMC did anything other than leave rates on hold today. One possibility is that the Fed will tweak further the wording of the statement it will release with its decision, which is likely to attract most of the interest when it announces today's decision. After the disappointing reaction in June - when investors responded to a statement they regarded as ambiguous by ratcheting up long-term rates - the Fed has been at pains to try and fine-tune its language. It has tried to give the clearest possible indication that the risk of falling inflation is its dominant concern, and that rates are likely to be kept low for the foreseeable future until this risk has dissipated. Markets have taken this with some scepticism, continuing to price in substantial rises in rates next year, in the belief that the Fed will find itself compelled to raise borrowing costs relatively soon. As part of the assessment of its communications strategy, the Fed is continuing to review its practice - adopted earlier this year - of giving separate assessments of the balance of risk around inflation and growth. Although that review seems unlikely to reach definitive conclusions soon, some of the thinking within the process may well emerge during its course and be reflected in FOMC statements. In a separate report yesterday, the US current account deficit in the second quarter was nearly unchanged at $138.7bn (Euros 122bn, £86bn), holding near the record set in the first quarter.

209,2003-09-15,2003-09-16,Financial Times,LEX COLUMN - FOMC THE LEX COLUMN.,"It is an overwhelming probability that the Federal open market committee will leave interest rates unchanged when it meets today. The evidence pointing to a third-quarter growth spurt has accumulated since the last meeting. It is no clearer whether this will prove to be sustainable. But, if committee members happen to feel creative, then a definition of what the FOMC sees as price stability would be an invaluable addition to every market participant's tool kit. Though the yield on 10-year bonds is returning to a more sensible level, the market is still pricing in one percentage point of Fed tightening by the end of next year - at odds with the FOMC's on-hold rhetoric. The committee's somewhat schizophrenic policy stance may be part of the problem. The FOMC states that the risks to sustainable growth are balanced, while the remote threat of deflation outweighs any concern about inflation. Third quarter growth will be supported by strong consumer spending, supported by tax cuts and the last legs of the mortgage refinancing cycle. Any disappointment in August's retail sales data stems from the inability of Detroit auto manufacturers to sell cars for a profit. There are some positive signs on the capital spending front. What is missing is a labour market recovery. A jobless recovery is not sustainable, as households will eventually raise precautionary saving, and another period of sub-par growth will put the productivity record to the test. If the remote deflation risk is of greater concern than inflation, this derives from the danger than the current spurt will be followed by a return to sub-par growth. It does not obviously make sense to split the two risks. Further note on San Miguel at www.ft.com/lex London Edition 1. "

211,2009-04-29,2009-04-30,Financial Times,Banks cut back on overseas lending,"Loans down 5.4% in last quarter of 2008 US economy shrinks at annualised 6.1% Banks retreated from foreign lending at the fastest rate since records began 30 years ago in the final quarter of last year, the Bank for International Settlements said yesterday. The BIS report came as the Federal Reserve held policy unchanged at its April meeting, saying the ""economic outlook has improved modestly since the March meeting"". Meanwhile, new figures showed that US business investment collapsed in the first quarter of this year even as consumer spending grew again, with the economy overall contracting at an annualised rate of 6.1 per cent. The German government cut its forecast to predict a 6 per cent fall in GDP this year. The BIS data is the first to paint a comprehensive picture of the scramble to repatriate funds and reduce leverage amid the financial chaos of late 2008. In the space of just three months from October to December banks globally cut their portfolios of foreign loans by $1,800bn or 5.4 per cent after adjusting for exchange rate movements. The pullback represents the reversal of years of financial globalisation, fuelled by a sharp increase in so-called ""home bias"" as bankers tried to reduce risk while maintaining domestic lending to please the national governments that were acting as their guarantors of last resort. Sharp cutbacks in overseas lending have exacerbated the credit crunch by withdrawing a major source of funding, even as domestic lenders have been hit by the crisis. Almost all of the decline in foreign loans came from banks in western Europe, which had substantially expanded their cross-border lending in recent years. US and Japanese banks, which had not expanded their international lending as aggressively in the pre-crisis period, actually increased slightly their holdings of foreign assets in the quarter. The contraction in lending will compound fears that eastern European economies could face a shortage of credit, although the International Monetary Fund has enhanced capacity to fill the gap. The Fed's decision to stay on hold yesterday reflected a slight upgrade to its economic forecast. The central bank said the economy had ""continued to contract, though the pace of contraction appears to be somewhat slower"". In recognition of the stock market rally, the Federal Open Market Committee removed from its statement a reference to the depressing effect of low stock prices on spending, but added that companies were cutting back on staffing, underscoring concern about fast-rising unemployment. For the first time, policymakers referred to the prospect that ""market forces"" would contribute to a gradual recovery, suggesting some greater confidence in the self-repairing capacity of the economy.

212,2009-04-29,2009-04-30,Financial Times,Rising bond yields present fresh challenge for the Fed,"News analysis Markets wait to see if the central bank will keep surprising them, writes Aline van Duyn After rising steadily in recent weeks, yields on US Treasuries have this week finally climbed back above the levels at which they were trading before the Federal Reserve started buying US debt a month ago. The ability of the Fed to balance the record amounts of new debt the US government has to sell - supply pressure that tends to raise interest rates - and its desire to keep interest rates low enough to spur fresh lending and mortgage financing continues to drive the Treasury market. Yields on 10-year US Treasury debt yesterday traded above 3 per cent, compared with a low of 2.54 per cent on March 18, just after the Fed announced it was planning to buy long-term debt. The 30-year US Treasury bond yield hit 3.92 per cent against the 3.8 per cent before quantitative easing was introduced. ""It's all about the market's testing the Fed's resolve to keep yields low,"" said Carl Lantz, interest rate strategist at Credit Suisse. ""The markets are waiting to see whether the Fed will keep surprising them in ways that could push yields lower."" Such surprises could involve bigger direct purchases or buying larger chunks of debt at once, he said. The $300bn Treasuries purchase plan announced at last month's federal open market committee meeting was the first time in decades the Fed had committed to buy long-term US debt. The amount might be increased, especially if pressure on yields continues to rise. The large initial impact of the move has been wiped out, partly because of concerns over the scale of the debt issuance needed to fund massive US fiscal stimulus and bank bail-out programmes. However, given the sharp rally in equity markets since early March - the S&P 500 index is up more than 25 per cent - yields would probably have risen much more without the Fed's intervention. Fed analysts suggested the $300bn purchase would reduce the yield on 10-year Treasuries by 25-35 basis points. Officials think the rate today is much lower than it would have been if they had not started buying. ""For yields to reverse their natural course, not only does the Fed have to step up purchase of long-term Treasuries and agencies but bond traders will have to be convinced that such actions are sufficient in capping bond yields,"" said Ashraf Laidi, chief market strategist at CMC Markets. He said the rise of the 10-year yield above 3 per cent ""signals bond traders' constant challenging of the Fed"". The importance of supply issues was clear in the 30-year yield's moves this week. The yield rose partly in anticipation of increased sales of 30-year bonds. Yesterday, the Fed said it would increase the frequency of its 30-year bond sales to monthly, part of a plan to meet an estimated $1,600bn to $2,700bn of new borrowing needs. Minutes of the meeting of the Treasury borrowing advisory committee showed that members discussed adding new maturities to the Treasury market. ""Several members stated that Treasury may need to consider this alternative but should begin with a second reopening of the 30-year bond and monitor developments in the long end of the curve,"" the minutes said."
213,2001-11-06,2001-11-07,Financial Times (FT.Com),Fed cuts rates to 40-year low.,"The Federal Reserve on Tuesday took another bold step in its aggressive efforts to revive the US economy, cutting short-term interest rates once again by 0.5 percentage points to their lowest level in almost four decades. The central bank's policymaking open market committee slashed its key monetary policy instrument - its target for the federal funds rate - to 2 per cent, and hinted of more to come. The Fed also cut its largely symbolic discount rate by the same amount to 1.5 per cent. ""Heightened uncertainty and concerns about a deterioration in business conditions both here and abroad are damping economic activity,"" the FOMC said on announcing the move. In opting for a half-point cut, the FOMC seemed to brush aside concerns among some economists that it might have been overly aggressive in reducing rates already and should move instead by a more cautious 0.25 percentage point cut. Short-term rates have now fallen from 6.5 per cent a year ago to 2 per cent. Using its standard verbal formula that for the foreseeable future, ""the risks are weighted mainly toward conditions that may generate economic weakness"", the Fed indicated it stood ready to cut rates again, and financial markets immediately began to price in the probability of rates falling below 2 per cent by early next year. Investors cheered the Fed's move as stocks erased earlier losses. The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed up 150.09 to 9,591.12 and the Nasdaq Composite rose 41.44 to 1,835.09. While expressing concern about the deteriorating immediate prospects for the US economy, the Fed reiterated its belief that longer-term prospects remained good, although they might be affected by business responses to the terrorist attacks of September 11. For the first time in a decade, the Fed's monetary policymakers met yesterday amid firm evidence that the US economy was in recession. Inflation-adjusted gross domestic product contracted at an annual rate of 0.4 per cent in the three months to September, and the early figures published so far for employment, consumer confidence and manufacturing in October suggested output plunged lower last month. And on Tuesday, several members of the National Bureau of Economic Research - the body that historically sets official dates for US business cycles - said they were actively discussing the possibility of officially declaring the first US recession in a decade. Tuesday's rate cut takes overnight interest rates below most estimates of annual consumer price inflation, meaning the real cost of short-term borrowing is now negative. Real short term rates have not been below zero for an extended period since the 1970s. Additional reporting by Peronet Despeignes. "
214,2006-08-08,2006-08-09,Financial Times,Treasuries lifted by rate pause GOVERNMENT BONDS.,"US Treasuries rose and yields fell slightly after the Federal Reserve left rates unchanged for the first time in two years. The Federal Open Market Committee voted nine to one to leave the federal funds rate at5.25 per cent. Ahead of the announcement, futures contracts had implied the central bank was expected to leave rates on hold, but many investors still feared the Fed would continue its steady monetary tightening. Treasury markets took the pause in their stride, with investors already looking to the likelihood of a further pause at the next FOMC meeting in September. James Knightley, strategist at ING Financial Markets, said: ""This leaves the September meeting wide open with the market currently split down the middle in terms of whether the Fed raises rates again."" Yields on the two-year notes, which are particularly sensitive to Fed interest rate moves, were down 3.3 basis points to 4.924 per cent shortly after the Fed's announcement, while the yield on benchmark 10-year notes was barely changed at 4.921 per cent. Government bonds in the UK, Europe and Japan all saw tight trading as markets awaited the Fed's decision. UK gilts were still suffering a hangover from last week's surprise interest rate rise from the BoE, which lifted rates to 4.75 per cent. Clues as to why the Bank made such a move should be forthcoming in today's quarterly inflation report. Yields on the two-year gilt rose 2bp to 4.944 per cent. Those on the 10-year gilt, however, were 1bp lower at 4.661 per cent. Eurozone government bonds were very quiet ahead of the Fed decision. The two-year Schatz yield was down 0.3bp at 3.534 per cent while that on the 10-year bund was up 0.6bp at 3.901 per cent. Japanese government bond traders were also anxious not to move prices. The 10-year yield was unchanged at 1.835 per cent. But traders were forced to make a choice when it came to the five-year, given the government's auction of Y2,000bn worth. The market was reluctant to buy, since traders expected the US Federal Reserve to leave interest rates unchanged, suggesting an end to the US rate cycle and hence downward pressure on JGB yields. Demand in the five-year auction was only 2.28 times supply, the poorest since September 2003. As a result, the yield on the five-year rose 2bp to 1.380 per cent. "

With unit labour costs rising at an annualised rate of 4.2 per cent in the second quarter, labour costs are now putting upward pressure on core inflation. The Fed will not put too much weight on a single quarter's figures. But the rise in unit labour costs is not a single-quarter phenomenon. Data revisions now show these costs rising at an average annualised rate of 3.25 per cent over the past four quarters. Members of the Fed's Open Market Committee will want to be sure that this reflects workers gaining at the expense of shareholders, as often happens late in the business cycle, and not the beginnings of a wage-price spiral. Having argued that the recent rise in inflation reflects companies exploiting pricing power to pass on energy costs to consumers, the Fed will be hard pressed to claim that companies will not be able to pass on higher labour costs too, unless the economy slows significantly. This debate may expose differences within the FOMC that cut across the traditional distinction between ""hawks"" and ""doves"". Fed watchers say that Don Kohn, the Fed's vice-chairman, and Janet Yellen, president of the San Francisco Fed, pay particularly close attention to whether employment has pushed beyond its sustainable non-inflationary rate. The debate over labour market trends is only one of several key discussions that remain unresolved even though the Fed is now on pause, and render unwise any glib assumptions as to where rates are heading next. According to the Fed's last set of minutes, for its June policy meeting, many FOMC members believed that ""significant uncertainty accompanied the appropriate setting of policy going forward"". One source of uncertainty is the slowing housing market, which creates downside risks for growth. Yet another is that the Fed may have misdiagnosed the nature of the inflation surprise, which could reflect more general overheating or rising energy costs. If so, the Fed may have to slow growth significantly below potential to let off steam. Many private-sector economists believe growth will slow below trend in the second half, and the Fed's staff economists appear to think so too. But the FOMC does not seem to think growth will be much below par in the second half. Members are not even agreed on whether interest rates at 5.25 per cent are slowing the economy, or still stimulating it. Focus on the change in interest rates since the Fed started tightening, and policy looks tight: a total increase of 4.25 percentage points. Focus on the level, 5.25 per cent, and it still looks relatively slack, at least compared with the peaks of past cycles. The FOMC is also not sure about how much tightening remains in the pipeline from recent rate increases. The time lags are particularly hard to judge because rate rises were largely telegraphed in advance. The upshot is that the future path of interest rates is very hard to predict. Prior to yesterday's move, the current market assumption was that the Fed would raise rates one more time to 5.5 per cent before the end of the year, then cut rates twice to end next year on 5 per cent. That is as reasonable as any other guess. But there is a strong possibility that the Fed could have to raise rates considerably higher, or indeed cut them more aggressively next year. The markets will have to stay focused on the Fed. "
216,2006-08-08,2006-08-09,Financial Times,US inflation concerns spark bond weakness ahead of Fed meeting GLOBAL OVERVIEW.,"Fresh concerns about US inflation sparked a bout of Treasury bond weakness yesterday, but financial markets were largely becalmed as investors waited for news from the US Federal Reserve's policy meeting on interest rates. After making 17 successive quarter-point rises in interest rates, the US central bank's Federal Open Market Committee was widely expected to take a pause on tightening monetary policy. ""Fed watchers are generally anticipating a pause and 'hawkish' language from the Fed,"" said Richard Bernstein, chief investment strategist at Merrill Lynch. David Bloom, global head of foreign exchange research at HSBC, said the US central bank was unlikely to stop emphasising the ""data dependency"" of its policy decisions because inflation had yet to be brought down to the Fed's ""comfort level"" of near and below 2 per cent. By midday in New York, the Dow Jones Industrial Average, the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite were all up about 0.3 per cent. European stocks managed even less progress, with the FTSE Eurofirst 300 index up less than 0.1 per cent. The dollar was barely changed against either the euro or the yen. But Treasury bonds edged back after news that US productivity had slowed in the second quarter but unit wage costs had risen sharply. Lombard Street Research argued that the data made a rise in US rates more likely. ""Labour cost inflation has already reached the point where the Fed can only keep inflation under control and close to its target by means of recession, or at best a hard landing,"" said Charles Dumas, LSR economist. ""Given the new data, the Fed should tighten today (Tuesday) even if the economy is slowing. Substantial slowing is what it needs."" Nouriel Roubini, professor of economics and international business at the Stern School of Business at New York University, said that after the recent flow of dismal economic indicators, he was raising the odds of a recession in the US by the end of the year from 50 per cent to 70 per cent. Mr Roubini cited the worsening housing market, mounting inflationary pressures and ever-increasing oil prices. ""Housing alone is now enough to cause a severe US recession,"" Mr Roubini said. Oil prices finally eased slightly yesterday after Monday's sharp rise, which followed news that BP had been forced to shut down North America's biggest oil field. ICE September Brent was down 15 cents at Dollars 78.15 a barrel in late London trade after hitting a record highof Dollars 78.64 in the previoussession. On Nymex, WTI for September delivery was down 18 cents at Dollars 76.80. Edward Meir at Man Financial said that while the amount of oil put out of circulation by BP's shutdown was relatively small, it reduced the overall cushion available to the market without dipping into stockpiles. But he said the timing of the outage was not bad. ""Crude stocks are at record highs, gasoline stocks are comfortable and gasoline demand should start to wane after Labor Day (September 4),"" he said. Angus McPhail, global oil and natural resources analyst at Alliance Trust, said he felt it was more likely that oil prices would rise than fall. ""If the geopolitical situation does not improve and there's a particularly bad hurricane season in the US, we see oil prices (ICE Brent) spiking to Dollars 85,"" he said. Copper futures fell back below Dollars 8,000 a tonne in spite of a strike at the world's biggest copper mine in Chile. "
217,2006-08-08,2006-08-09,Financial Times (FT.Com),FT.com site : Market Overview: Equities rally loses steam as traders speculate on end to tightening cycle.,"A rally in global equities ran out of steam on Wall Street on Thursday, as investors pondered the outlook for US economic growth in the wake of the Federal Reserve's decision to leave US interest rates unchanged after more than two years of rises. Earlier, world stock markets had logged gains in spite of a rise in oil prices following news of an unexpectedly big drop in US gasoline supplies last week. By the close, the technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite index was almost flat, down 0.57 points at 2,060.28, having been more than 1 per cent ahead for the day at one point. The S&P 500 fell 0.4 per cent, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.9 per cent, principally because of a bad day for the manufacturer Caterpillar. Cyclical stocks and home-builders - both particularly exposed to a US slowdown - bore the brunt of the sell-off. In Europe, the FTSE Eurofirst 300 index rose 0.7 per cent. Asian stocks put in some of the day's best performances. The Nikkei 225 Average in Tokyo climbed 1.2 per cent to a two-month high while Hong Kong leapt 1.8 per cent, nearly reaching a six-year high. The main debate for market watchers was the Federal Open Market Committee's Tuesday decision to leave interest rates at 5.25 per cent. Wall Street ended Tuesday lower on concerns it signalled an economic slowdown. This mood reinforced itself by the close on Thursday, although the market opened in more upbeat mood as investors speculated on whether the pause marked the end of themonetary tightening cycle. Goldman Sachs believed rates had peaked. ""The FOMC members acknowledged the upside risk to inflation due to high capacity utilisation and elevated energy prices and left themselves the option to tighten further if incoming data demands,"" said Fiona Lake, global markets economist. ""However, by outlining a view that inflation pressures will moderate based largely on conditions already in place, the committee has left itself ample room to look past more bad news on inflation."" Robert Lind, analyst at ABN Amro, was more hawkish. ""The [Fed's] statement continues to emphasise the data dependency of policy decisions, and inevitably the uncertainty around the outlook,"" he said. ""I read this as the FOMC maintaining a tightening bias. But the markets are clearly reading the 'pause' as a definitive stop in the tightening process."" What now appears to have become the most pressing concern in the market was voiced by Richard Bernstein, chief investment strategist at Merrill Lynch. ""Regardless of whether the Fed pauses or actually stops, we believe that economic growth is likely to slow during the next 12 months,"" he said, adding that current conditions, with rising inflation, and the Fed on pause, were similar to those of 1987, the year of the ""Black Monday"" crash. Oil prices were volatile after weekly US inventories data showed strong demand for gasoline and distillates. Benchmark US crude futures briefly pushed through the $77 a barrel level before easing back, while ICE September Brent slipped 27 cents to close at $77.28 a barrel. Speculation on US interest rates put the dollar under pressure. It fell as low as Y114.8 before recovering slightly, while the euro briefly nosed above $1.29. The yen touched an all-time low against the euro as investors increasingly took the view that the Bank of Japan would keep interest rates on hold at tomorrow's policy meeting. "
218,2006-08-08,2006-08-09,Financial Times (FT.Com),FT.com site : Stocks rally on speculation US rates have peaked.,"Global equity markets rallied on Wednesday in the wake of the US Federal Reserve's decision to leave US interest rates unchanged after more than two years of rises. The gains came despite a rise in oil prices following news of an unexpectedly big drop in US gasoline supplies last week. The main area of debate for market watchers was the Federal Open Market Committe's decision to leave borrowing costs at 5.25 per cent at Tuesday's monetary policy meeting. Wall Street shares ended Tuesday lower on concerns it signalled a sharper economic slowdown than expected by the market. But a slightly more upbeat mood prevailed on Wednesday as investors speculated on whether the pause marked the end of the monetary tightening cycle. Goldman Sachs took the view that rates had now reached the top of the current tightening cycle. ""The FOMC members acknowledged the upside risk to inflation due to high capacity utilisation and elevated energy prices and left themselves the option to tighten further if incoming data demands,"" said Fiona Lake, global markets economist. ""However, by outlining a view that inflation pressures will moderate based largely on conditions already in place, the committee has left itself ample room to look past more bad news on inflation."" Robert Lind, analyst at ABN Amro, took a slightly more hawkish view.

What has now appears to have become the most pressing concern in the market was voiced by Richard Bernstein, chief investment strategist at Merrill Lynch. ""Regardless of whether the Fed pauses or actually stops, we believe that economic growth is likely to slow during the next 12 months,"" he said. But there was some good news on the US earnings front as Cisco Systems, the network equipment group, reported impressive quarterly earnings. That helped the technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite index gain 1.6 per cent by midday in New York. The S&P 500 was 0.8 per cent higher and the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 0.4 per cent. In Europe, the FTSE Eurofirst 300 index rose 0.7 per cent. Asian stocks put in some of the day's best performances. The Nikkei 225 Average in Tokyo climbed 1.2 per cent to a two-month high while Hong Kong leapt 1.8 per cent to its best level for nearly six years.

219,1990-03-27,1990-03-28,Financial Times,World Stock Markets (America): Dow moves up sharply on programme buying,"AFTER TRADING in a tight range for most of yesterday's session, programme buying pushed leading US stock indices sharply higher in the last hour of business, writes Janet Bush in New York. The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed 29.28 points higher at 2,736.94 following Monday's tiny gain of 3.38 points. With no dramatics overnight on Japanese markets and with the first quarter coming to an end, nobody had expected any large fluctuations and, despite the size of yesterday's rally, it came in thin volume of only 131m shares. The dominance of futures-related arbitrage as stock index futures rose to large premiums over their underlying cash stocks - so prompting selling of the futures and buying of cash stocks - makes it difficult to tell how much actual demand there was. The background to yesterday's session did not look auspicious. On Monday, the Dow had jumped 20 points in reaction to the second largest rally ever in Tokyo only to fall back to close with a very modest gain in the second slowest day of trading since the start of the year. The inability to draw much sustenance from more stable conditions in Japan reflected some concerns about the next round of quarterly earnings results as well as the fact that any end-quarter buying by institutional portfolio managers has probably now been completed. There is a dearth of economic news this week which is also keeping trading volume low. The only economic figures of any note are today's revisions for fourth quarter GNP which are not likely to inspire much interest. The financial markets are much more concerned about the performance of the economy this month, given that the outlook for monetary policy appears to be finely balanced. The Federal Open Market Committee, which sets a target for the Federal Funds rate, started its regular meeting yesterday to review its monetary stance. There appears to be consensus that the Fed will leave monetary policy unchanged until it has seen the economic evidence for March. Trading was dull in the Treasury bond market. In late trading, the Treasury's benchmark long bond was quoted 1/8 point lower for a yield of 8.47 per cent. Among featured stocks yesterday was American Express which dropped Dollars 3/8 to Dollars 26 1/2 . The company said yesterday that it had signed a definitive merger agreement to purchase Shearson Lehman Hutton. JP Industries gained Dollars 7/8 to Dollars 16 7/8 . T&N of Britain identified itself as the bidder for the company, which said that it had agreed in principle to be acquired for Dollars 17.30 a share. Bally Manufacturing added Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 13 3/4 on a US press report that Mr Arthur Goldberg, the investor, had bought about Dollars 13m worth of shares, or 4.5 per cent. Canada TORONTO closed mixed in light trading. The composite index closed up 11.00 at 3,678.46 but declines edged advances 297 to 289. Volume was just 20.2m shares, down from just under 23m. Golds closed up 1.28 per cent after losing more than 6 per cent, as the price of gold rebounded somewhat from Monday's sharp fall. "
220,2000-06-28,2000-06-29,Financial Times,Hint of rise as US Fed holds rates.,"The US Federal Reserve left interest rates unchanged yesterday but suggested further rate rises might be needed to curb inflation. In a statement accompanying the widely expected decision that followed a two-day meeting of the policy-setting Federal Open Market Committee, the Fed pointed to data suggesting economic growth was moderating towards a more sustainable pace. While underlying inflation had risen slightly, it said gains in productivity were continuing to contain price pressures. But it said these signs of slowing growth were ""still tentative and preliminary"". Referring to the continued tightness in the jobs market, the Fed said the committee believed ""the risks continue to be weighted mainly toward conditions that may generate heightened inflation pressures in the foreseeable future"". The Fed has raised rates by 1 3/4 percentage points since it began its current monetary tightening last year to put the benchmark federal funds rate at 6.5 per cent, its highest level in nine years. In May the Fed lifted the funds rate - the interest rate at which prime banks lend to each other overnight in the New York money market - by a half percentage point, the first time it had made a move of that magnitude in more than five years. However, the decision to leave rates unchanged yesterday does pose some risks for the Fed. The FOMC's next regular meeting is not until eight weeks' time. By then, the US presidential election campaign will be well under way and interest rate increases then could see the Fed becoming embroiled in the campaign. Editorial Comment, Page 26 Lex, Page 28 Treasuries recover, Page 42. "
221,2000-06-28,2000-06-29,Financial Times,CURRENCIES &MONEY - Dollar unmoved by Fed rate decision.,"The dollar showed little reaction to the widely expected decision by the US Federal Reserve to leave interest rates unchanged yesterday. The decision follows a series of figures suggesting that the US economy is slowing. Durable goods orders from the US, however, released prior to the rate decision, cast some doubt on the notion of a rapid cooling of the US economy. But there was little reaction in the foreign exchange markets to the news. With activity minimal ahead of the FOMC decision, many analysts were focusing on the potential impact of Deutsche Telekom's bumper bond issue. Since the lion's share of the $15bn has been in US dollars, there has been speculation that some of the proceeds will be swapped back into euros - providing welcome support for the currency. But Ray Attrill, director of research at economic consultancy 4Cast, said the effect was far from certain. ""It is also quite possible that Deutsche Telekom will wish to keep the bulk of the money in dollars to provide for forays into the US market,"" he said. * Economists who charged the European Central Bank with being too aggressive several weeks ago in its 0.5 percentage point rate rise are now being forced to eat a little humble pie. Inflation data out of Europe provided ample retrospective justification for the move and may even warrant further action in the short term, analysts said yesterday. Most alarming was the rise in German import prices, which leaped into double figures. But the 2.7 per cent rise in Italian consumer prices for June also topped analysts' expectations. The figures had only a marginal effect on the euribor strip, the market's best guess of future interest rate movements. However many economists suspect that ECB claims that it had cleared the horizon for some time may have proved premature. ""The several month rate pause that many had expected after the last rise may end up being shorter than anticipated,"" said Ray Attrill, director of research at economic consultancy 4Cast. This could bode well for the euro, analysts said. Interest rates are back in the driving seat in the foreign exchange markets, said Avinash Persaud, global head of research at State Street, the Boston-based investment bank. ""As risk appetites recovered in May, the focus has changed in the foreign exchange markets from looking for safety to looking for value and yield,"" said Mr Persaud. ""Interest rate differentials have increased in importance as a determinant of foreign exchange movements."" He added that the differential between US and European rates now looked likely to narrow still further. * While the market is becoming ever more convinced of the cyclical arguments for a euro revival, yesterday's current account figures from the euro-zone offered a reminder of the structural barriers which remain. The net outflow of direct investment funds from the euro-zone, which hit Euros 149bn in 1999, has been cited as one of the main weights on the euro. For the first three months of the year, this trend appeared to have abated with a series of positive figures. But with the massive inflow arising Vodafone's takeover of Mannesmann now removed from the figures, the euro-zone once again has a direct investment deficit. According to yesterday's figures Euros 6.2bn of direct investment left the zone in April. The basic balance - a measure of the balance of payments which excludes short term flows - still looks negative for the euro, said Tony Norfield, global head of foreign exchange research at ABN Amro in London. ""In the first 4 months of the year the euro-zone ran a basic balance deficit of Euros 17.3bn, which may help explain why the recovery in the euro has not yet fully taken hold,"" he said. "
222,2000-06-28,2000-06-29,Financial Times,STOCK MARKETS LONDON STOCK EXCHANGE - Equities spend anxious day watching the Fed.,"London's equity market remained gripped with anxiety over the course of US interest rates ahead of the FOMC meeting. The Fed's decision to leave rates unchanged came at 7.15pm, long after London closed for the day. ""The market has been spooked by worries over what the statement with the interest rate news will say,"" said one marketmaker. He insisted that there had once again been no really heavy selling pressure in the market, and that the institutions had simply shut up shop until the US decision was out of the way. The end of the second quarter on Friday was another factor inhibiting market operators. Already suffering from the long-standing interest rate jitters, London dipped further in the afternoon as the latest US economic data showed that durable goods orders rose 6 per cent in May, compared with a consensus forecast of 3 per cent. The market's super stocks, which carry enormous impact because of their weightings, were given a rough ride, driving the index sharply lower. Vodafone AirTouch, the UK's biggest stock by market capitalisation, accounted for more than 30 Footsie points. BP Amoco wiped another 13 points off the index, while Shell was similarly depressed as was BT and Cable &Wireless. By the end of the session the FTSE 100 was looking extremely weary, down 61.8 at 6,313.5, after 6,310.8. But the weakness in the heavyweight stocks did not extend across the board. There remained plenty of winners in the top 100 stocks, including many of the recently weak banks, and Freeserve, the internet service provider which was so badly damaged by the withdrawal of T-Online from bid negotiations. Dealers pointed out, however, that Schroder Salomon Smith Barney, which forecast the steep decline in Freeserve shares, had cut its price target again, down to 280p. The rest of the stock market was much better behaved. The FTSE 250 nudged up 5.3 to 6,578.4. The FTSE SmallCap eased 3.5 to 3,364.5 despite the emergence of a couple of bids. The Techmark 100 settled 13.93 off at 3,400.10. James Montier, strategist at Old Mutual Securities, delivered a bullish assessment of London equities. ""The UK stock market has firmly refused to celebrate the increasingly consensual view that UK short-term interest rates will not have to go much higher. Both the interest rate futures market and the bond market have shown no such qualms and have enjoyed substantial rallies. ""Perhaps the UK market has been suffering an earnings headwind. However, this has now turned and analysts are upgrading forecasts. We can find no fundamental cause for the market's current malaise. ""Valuations against bonds appear very supportive of stocks. With earnings momentum now favourable it is time to overweight UK equities."" "
223,2000-06-28,2000-06-29,Financial Times,WORLD STOCK MARKETS - Investors cautious before Fed decision.,"The news from the Fed that it was keeping US interest rates on hold this month took nobody by surprise, writes Michael Morgan. And just as important, neither did the Fed's hint of another rate rise to come later in the year. Many analysts have already pencilled in a 25 basis points rise at the FOMC's next meeting on August 22. ""This is precisely what the markets had been expecting,"" said James Barty at Deutsche Bank. ""The markets will now start looking for a steer from the NAPM and payrolls data which come next week."" Even though the consensus had been for inaction by the Fed yesterday, the very threat of a rise in US rates this month has been casting an increasingly long shadow over European markets in recent sessions. Yesterday was no exception, with most bourses still stymied by investors' reluctance to commit funds ahead of a clear Fed statement. Nonetheless, the chemicals and healthcare sectors had a good day. There was some action in Telefonica, the Spanish telecoms group, as the chairman, Juan Villalonga, his future in doubt because of an insider trading investigation, faced a board meeting. However, the company said after the five-hour gathering that only routine matters had been discussed. Tech stocks had a tough time, with Nokia closing at its lowest since May 30, after failing to impress analysts at a meeting on Tuesday. Wall Street was higher in morning trade helped by Hewlett-Packard, which bounced higher after Lehman Brothers added the company to it list of 10 ""uncommon value"" stocks. Asia charted its own course, edging slightly higher after another day of wary trade, awaiting news on US rates. Tokyo endured a jittery session as attention began to shift to next Tuesday's quarterly tankan survey of business confidence from the Bank of Japan. Fed caution added to the problems facing Taipei, already hit by Taiwan-China tensions, Wall Street's volatility and lending irregularities involving some local financial institutions. "
224,1995-03-28,1995-03-29,Financial Times,GOVERNMENT BONDS - CONSUMER CONFIDENCE DATA HIT TREASURIES.,"Relatively weak demand at an afternoon note auction, a weaker dollar, and data showing consumer confidence increasing rather than waning conspired to send Treasury prices sharply lower yesterday. Late in the session the benchmark 30-year Treasury was down 7/8 at 102 3/4 to yield 7.389%. At the short end of the market, the two-year note was 3/16 lower at 100 9/32, yielding 6.695%. At mid-morning, the market took a strong downward turn after figures released by the Conference Board showed consumers to be much more confident than most economists had expected. The board's general confidence index for March rose to 101 from an upwardly revised figure of 99.4 for February. Economists had forecast a decline to 97%. Bond prices slid even further in the afternoon after poor demand was shown at an afternoon auction of $17.25bn in two-year notes. The ratio of offers tendered to accepted bids came in at 2.45 to one, compared with the much stronger ratio of 2.91 to one in January's auction. In recent days, traders had expressed concern that the market's bullish turn and the drop in yields that accompanied it would decrease demand for new government securities. The Treasury is also to sell $11bn in five-year notes today. There was almost no market reaction to the announcement that the Federal Reserve had adjourned its Open Market Committee meeting without issuing any comment or taking any action as a broad consensus of Wall Street economists had held that the central bank would not alter monetary policy. Government Bonds The weaker dollar also contributed to the falling bond market. By late afternoon, the US currency slipped against the D-Mark and the Japanese yen to DM 1.3871 and Y 88.89, against DM 1.4063 and Y 89.45 late Monday. UK government bonds continued their recent trend of range-trading yesterday, as the Federal Open Market Committee meeting in the US weighed down any progress at the short end of the yield curve and today's gilt auction weighed on the long end. Analysts expect the auction to generate reasonable demand, particularly from domestic investors. The auction will be of #2bn of 8% gilts due 2015. A paper from UBS has pointed out that some investors avoided buying the first tranche in the hope that it would cheapen relative to the curve. These investors will be encouraged to buy today's issue because its weighting in the FT index of gilts with a maturity of more than 15 years will increase as the issue size increases from #2bn to #4bn. The long gilt futures contract on Liffe was around 103 1/8, down 1/8, with resistance seen around 103 1/2. The UK 10-year yield spread over Germany was around 151 basis points in late trading, up from 147 points the day before. German government bonds shifted up slightly yesterday, with little economic news to drive any movement and investors staying firmly on the sidelines until after the Bundesbank council meeting tomorrow. Most analysts expect no reduction in short-term interest rates. The June bund future on Liffe was around 92.04, up 0.01 on the day. Traders say there is a key support level at 91.98, and a strong resistance at 92.25. These two levels are likely to set the range of trading until after Thursday. Italian government bonds ended the day lower, affected by profit-taking from Monday's rise and lack of news on pension reforms. The June BTP future on Liffe was around 93.90 in late trading, down 0.32. The yield spread over bunds was around 623 basis points in late trading, little changed from the 622 points of the day before. (c) The Financial Times Limited 1995. "
225,1995-07-06,1995-07-07,Financial Times,MARKETS REPORT - FEDERAL RESERVE CUTS FUNDS RATE TO 5.75%.,"The dollar yesterday fell slightly after the Federal Reserve's decision to cut the federal funds rate by 25 basis points to 5.75%, writes Philip Gawith. An early assessment of the impact of the Fed's move was that it could help the dollar if, as has been the case recently, it took its lead from the bond market which responded positively. Further out, however, the prognoses is more negative, with some analysts predicting that the removal of interest rate support would cause it to retest historic lows around DM 1.3450. In the immediate aftermath of the Fed's announcement, the dollar was trading around DM 1.3780, down from the London close of DM 1.3816. Against the yen it traded at Y 85.14. It finished in New York at DM 1.3789 and Y 84.955. Foreign exchanges had earlier had a very quiet day, with traders and investors content to take to the sidelines until the outcome of the FOMC meeting was known. Sterling maintained its firmer tone, with the trade weighted index closing at 83.6 from 83.3. Against the D-Mark it finished at DM 2.2087, from DM 2.2019. Against the dollar it closed at $1.5987 from $1.5918. Elsewhere, there were interest rate cuts in France and Denmark. The Bank of France, as expected, cut the 5-10 day lending rate to 7.25% from 7.5%, while in Denmark the discount rate was cut to 5.75% from 6%. Pessimism about the dollar's medium term outlook stems from the fear that the market will see this cut in rates as the first of a sequence. 'If a 6% funds rate could not hold the currency, there is little chance of a 5 3/4% rate doing any better,' said Mr Jeremy Hawkins, chief economist at Bank of America in London. Mr Gerard Lyons, chief economist at DKB International in London endorsed this view, but said the dollar would be more stable against the yen because there were signs that Japanese investors were diversifying from yen assets to D-Mark assets. Certainly, there is broad agreement that developments in Japan remain critical to developments on the dollar. Mr Robin Marshall, chief economist at Chase Manhattan in London, said the key issue was the recapitalisation of the banking system, necessary if financial flows out of the country were to be unblocked. Mr Paul Chertkow, head of global currency research at UBS in London, said there were two conflicting views of the currency implications of developments in Japan. One view was that further weakness in the Nikkei would prompt repatriation of offshore assets by Japanese investors, further strengthening the yen. The other view, held by Mr Chertkow, is that the strong yen is already fully discounted (the forward rate one year out is Y 81.15), with capital market participants preparing to take more money out of Japan. The recent pattern in UK money markets of fairly tight liquidity conditions persisted, with overnight money rising to 7 3/8% as the Bank of England provided only #454m at established rates towards clearing a #850m shortage. It provided #210m late assistance. Mr Philip Shaw, economist at Union plc, said he detected that the Bank had 'once again become awkward in buying bills from the market'. He suggested three possible motives: First, it wanted to ensure that three-month LIBOR did not fall below the 6.75% base rate, as it had done for most of the March-June period. Second, 'it may be paying more attention to one-month LIBOR. This is currently at 6.63% and barring just a few occasions has been continually below base rates since mid-1994. In fact, over the past year the one-month/base rate spread has averaged -22 basis points; typically it is close to zero. Third, with the Bank known to be concerned about currency weakness, keeping overnight rates firm was a disincentive to shorting the pound. The franc was barely changed after rates were cut, finishing at FFr 3.498 per D-Mark from FFr 3.497. Mr Chertkow predicted that the Bank of France might well, in the months ahead, be more aggressive than the Bundesbank in cutting rates. Taking a minority view, he said lower rates would be well received in financial markets as a vote of confidence in French fiscal policy. (c) The Financial Times Limited 1995. "
226,1995-07-06,1995-07-07,Financial Times,GOVERNMENT BONDS - TREASURIES RALLY AFTER CUT IN FED FUNDS RATE.,"US Treasury prices surged yesterday after the Federal Reserve's Open Market Committee cut the Federal funds target rate by 25 basis points to 5.75%. Late in the session the benchmark 30-year Treasury was 1 13/32 higher at 114 9/16 to yield 6.505. At the short end of the maturity spectrum, the two-year note jumped 3/4 at 100 1/8 to yield 5.540. In lowering interest rates the FOMC said that 'inflationary pressures have receded enough to accommodate a modest adjustment in monetary conditions'. This added to the bond rally by suggesting that the members of the Fed were not concerned about inflation, which can erode the value of long-term bonds. Bonds have rallied since early June as a string of weak economic data suggested to many investors that the Fed might lower interest rates this week. Early yesterday, however, bonds slipped in quiet trading amid renewed fears that the Fed might leave rates steady. Both the index of leading economic indicators and the weekly release of data on new claims for unemployment benefits were in line with economists' expectations and therefore failed to move the bond market. Soon after the announcement of the rate cut, traders turned their attention to June unemployment figures set to be released today. The median economic estimate holds that non-farm jobs will have increased by about 125,000 to reverse May's 101,000 decline, but the figure is expected to be an important factor when the Fed meets to consider interest rate policy again next month. Mr Bill Curtin, chief fixed-income strategist at Lehman Brothers, said he thought the report could be stronger than expected and that might spook investors. But, he added, in general the economy is relatively weak which should be good for Treasuries in the longer term. European government bonds fell back yesterday as traders awaited the FOMC decision. German government bonds declined in spite of favourable unemployment data. Reports of comments by Mr Hans Tietmeyer, which suggested that he saw little scope for a cut in German interest rates for the time being, depressed bunds in early trading. Dealers today will be focusing on US non-farm payroll data. French government bonds fell sharply in spite of a move by the Bank of France to lower its five to 10-day lending rate to 7.25%. Fresh supply, following a FFr 21bn auction of OATs, weighed on prices at the long end of the market. Traders said the cut in the lending rate had already been priced into the market. But Mr Huw Roberts, European bond strategist at NatWest Markets, said there could be further cuts soon, probably as early as next week, following comments earlier this week by Mr Jean-Claude Trichet, governor of the Bank of France. Mr Trichet said that the new French budget was stringent enough for the central bank to allow interest rates to 'return progressively to a normal level'. Mr Roberts thinks that there are further gains to be made at the short end of the French market. He said the French yield curve is currently very flat - with the spread in yields between two and 10-year bonds at 109 basis points, compared with 171 in Germany - which means that the curve could steepen in coming days with the short-end outperforming. The September notional futures contract on Matif settled down 0.6 point at 114.04. UK government bonds fell back, although they outperformed most other European markets. They rose in early trading with dealers reporting flows out of bunds into gilts, primarily on the futures exchange. The spread over bunds narrowing to 158 basis points, before gilts fell back in later trade. The spread over bunds settled at around 160 basis points. The long gilt future on Liffe was at 104 7/32 in late trade, up 1/32 on the day. (c) The Financial Times Limited 1995. "
227,1995-07-06,1995-07-07,Financial Times,WORLD STOCK MARKETS (EUROPE) - ELECTRONICS STOCKS LEAD THE WAY AHEAD.,"With many of the Continental markets blighted by the long wait for news of the outcome of the FOMC meeting in the US, the sharp outperformance of high-technology companies provided bright spots in some of the bourses. AMSTERDAM broke through a new barrier but just failed at the finish to set a new all-time high, as the AEX index ended 1.34 firmer at 440.04. It had earlier seen an intraday peak of 440.73. There was no stopping Philips, which steered the market to its high, the shares gaining Fl 2.70 or nearly 4% at Fl 72.30, and just off a high of Fl 72.70. Polygram made 70 cents to Fl 93.90. All the action was not one way, however. There was further bad news for Fokker, which said that it expected the first-half net loss to be higher than that seen over 1994, which was Fl 449m. This would mean that shareholders equity would fall well below half of the issued share capital, the company added. The stock plunged Fl 1.10 or 10% to Fl 9.80. Royal Dutch was hit by the possibility of a US law suit, tumbling Fl 2.10 to Fl 188.30. STOCKHOLM's attention remained focused on Ericsson in an otherwise cautious market which saw the Affarsvarlden index rise 6.3 to another all-time high of 1,681.3. Ericsson added SKr2 at SKr154, extending Wednesday's gain on further optimism about the outlook for the sector and expectations that Ericsson would secure more orders for PCs from the US. HELSINKI continued higher in heavy trade, again led by Nokia, the telecommunications group, which took the Hex index up 40.57 to a new record of 2,079.03. Nokia A hit a record high of NKr275 in intraday trade before closing FM10 ahead at FM272. PARIS was unimpressed by the easing in the five to 10-day rate, which had been widely expected. The CAC-40 index drifted off 18.27 to 1,889.49 in turnover of some FFr 3bn. There was another twist to the Suez story, with rumours that Mr Gerard Worms, the chairman of the conglomerate, might resign at today's board meeting. Such a decision would not be unexpected given the conflict of opinion on the future direction of Suez by Mr Worms and the major shareholders, such as UAP and BNP. Suez retreated FFr 8.70 to FFr 253.80, UAP 30 centimes to FFr 131.40 and BNP FFr 7.80 to FFr 235. Accor, the hotels and restaurants group, declined FFr 17 to FFr 663 as investors considered the sale of its Eurest division to Compass, of the UK. While the sale was generally considered to be positive in the long term and would improve the company's eps, the shares slipped as profits were booked. ZURICH was unable to make progress and the SMI index gave up 10.0 to 2,833.7 in very quiet conditions. Among financials, UBS bearers slipped SwFr 11 to SwFr 1,189, while Zurich Insurance receded SwFr 3.75 to SwFr 281 with UBS said to be a major seller of the stock. Esec, a small machinery maker for the semiconductor industry, which has seen recent sharp advances, relinquished SwFr 60 at SwFr 2,620 in what dealers described as unusually active trade. FRANKFURT rose in moderate floor trading. The DAX index was ahead 15.56 at 2,121.22 after trading in a range of 2,114.31 to 2,122.13. In the Ibis the index lost ground to 2,111.35. Turnover totalled DM 5.8bn. Hoechst dipped DM 2.40 to DM 300.90 on news that it might face a $7bn lawsuit in the US, although it said that it would appeal against a ruling which also involves Royal Dutch. Bayer climbed DM 3.40 to DM 350.20 and BASF was up DM 2.60 at DM 302.30. Foreign interest was believed to have been behind a gain in some of the vehicle and component stocks. Volkswagen made DM 7.20 to DM 412.70, Daimler was up DM 8.30 at DM 643.30, Porsche advanced DM 5 to DM 605, BMW rose DM 7.50 to DM 774.50 and Continental gained DM 4 at DM 204.50. Among retailers, Kaufhof, which reported that first-half earnings were better than the same year-ago period, advanced DM 1.20 to DM 495.20. MILAN saw a slight technical bounce after Wednesday's late sell-off but the parliamentary pensions saga kept foreigners at bay, while domestic investors began turning their minds to thoughts to the summer holidays. The Comit index lost 1.31 ast 621.07, while the real-timne Mibtel index was 25 ahead at 9,902. Investors were buyers of De Benedetti stocks, taking Olivetti L21 higher to L1,635 and Cir L30 up to L1,301. Telecom Italia slipped for the second consecutive day, falling L48 to L4,409. OSLO rose to a third consecutive all-time high, the all-share index gaining 2.45 at 706.80 after an intraday peak of 707.14. Investors concentrated on blue chips, with Kvaerner B shares moving NKr5 higher to NKr279. Norsk Hydro was heavily traded but finished flat at NKr259.

228,1995-07-06,1995-07-07,Financial Times,"WORLD STOCK MARKETS (ASIA PACIFIC) - NIKKEI AVERAGE CLIMBS ABOVE 15,000 LEVEL.","Tokyo The main Nikkei index surged forward in late trading to close above the 15,000 level for the first time since June 26, writes Bethan Hutton in Tokyo. The 225 average ended at the day's high of 15,256.89, up 426.45 or almost 2.9%. More than 300 points of the rise came in the last 20 minutes of trading. The day's low of 14,759.85 came towards the end of the morning session. The broader based Topix index finished nearly 2% or 23.77 ahead at 1,236.79 and the Nikkei 300 index put on 4.36 at 230.40. Volume expanded to an estimated 341m shares from Wednesday's 277.5m. Gains led declines by 891 to 143, with 124 issues unchanged. In London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index was up 0.87 at 1,035.52. But analysts dismissed the possibility that the day's move was the start of a significant turnaround. 'This is not the beginning of a huge rally,' said Mr Neil Rogers, strategist with UBS in Tokyo. 'I do not think any fundamentals have changed to justify a rally.' Ms Kathy Matsui at Goldman Sachs said the quality of stocks driving the rally was poor, being mainly speculative issues. 'There was also a lot of futures covering at the end of the day,' she added. Life insurance companies are still expected to step in at some stage above the 15,000 level to realise profits, but if they believe momentum could carry the index higher, they may wait a little longer before unloading their holdings. NEC, the high-tech group, advanced Y 36 to Y 985 in heavy volume after dealers had time to digest Wednesday's announcement that the group is to buy a stake of almost 20% in US computer manufacturer Packard Bell. Foreign investors were also buying blue chip electronic and semiconductor stocks generally. Fujitsu moved Y 13 higher to Y 883, also in fairly heavy volume, Hitachi put on Y 15 at Y 860, and in Osaka, Kyocera rose Y 160 to Y 7,180. Another focus of buying attention was companies rumoured to be considering share buy-backs, which may be made possible by tax changes later this year. Taisei, the construction concern, jumped Y 28 to Y 538, Citizen Watch gained Y 20 at Y 560 and Toyota Motor firmed Y 10 to Y 1,710. In Osaka, the OSE index ended 264.55 higher at 16,485.18 in volume of 28.9m shares. Roundup The outcome of the US FOMC meeting was eagerly awaited. BANGKOK lost gains on profit-taking and rumours that a controversial member of a coalition party might secure a key post in the new cabinet. The SET index finished 2.89 down at 1,427.57 after hitting a new intraday peak of 1,453.96. Turnover came to Bt20.3bn. Concern mounted over the possible inclusion in the cabinet of a deputy leader of the Chart Thai party, who has been denied a visa to travel to the US because of suspicion that he was involved in narcotics trafficking. The US has said his inclusion in the cabinet could complicate diplomatic relations. SEOUL found inspiration in the market's firm fundamentals and the Composite index ended 9.97 higher at 914.95. Sentiment was boosted by an IMF report which said that South Korea's GDP would rise 9.75% this year and 8.5% in 1996. Brokers said that the bourse was also still benefiting from heavy foreign buying, estimated at some Won600bn after the July 1 expansion of the foreign stock ownership limit. KUALA LUMPUR's banking sector was ahead on bullish expectations about interest rates but the overall market ended mixed in moderate volume. The composite index closed 2.47 off at 1,045.35. North Borneo Timber surged M$1.40 to M$9.55 in the afternoon on takeover rumours. SINGAPORE was firm, but prices ended off the day's highs with foreign institutions still sidelined. Activity was again dominated by speculative shares traded over the counter, and smaller-capitalised stocks. The Straits Times Industrial index gained 5.40 at 2,133.65. HONG KONG reversed sharp early gains and finished lower on renewed caution ahead of the second day of the US's Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting. The Hang Seng index was down 30.40 to 9,376.87, after a day's peak of 9,519.78, in turnover of HKDollars 4.2bn against Wednesday's HKDollars 4.1bn.

229,1996-03-26,1996-03-27,Financial Times,OVERSEAS NEWS - TREASURIES STEADY AFTER FOMC MEETING.,"US Treasury prices were relatively steady at lower levels after the Federal Reserve's Open Market Committee left interest rates unchanged after yesterday's meeting. Few had expected the Fed to lower interest rates after the surprisingly strong figures on February employment were released earlier this month. Treasury prices were lower as the Fed began its meeting at 8am and held at those levels after the FOMC meeting ended. But prices dipped later after Mr Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Fed, told a senate panel that the economy was moving 'at a reasonably good clip'. Mr Greenspan, who was nominated by President Clinton to a third term at the Fed, testified before the Senate Banking Committee as part of the confirmation process. In early afternoon trading, the benchmark 30-year Treasury was 5/16 lower at 92 3/32 to yield 6.604%, and the two-year note was down 1/16 at 98 15/16, yielding 5.696%. Yesterday's losses came despite a new indication that consumer spending is not likely to spur economic growth in the near term. At mid-morning, the Conference Board reported that its index of consumer confidence slipped to 97.7 in March from 98 in February. Most economists had expected the figure to rise modestly to about 99. 'Although consumer attitudes, on balance, are pretty much in neutral territory, the uneasiness about the job market, coupled with concerns about future levels of income, do not suggest consumers are ready to spend more freely,' the Conference Board said. * Italy provided the focus for attention in Europe, with activity sparked by the suspension of the shares of Banco di Napoli and worries about the cost to the government of recapitalising the bank. On Liffe, Mr Alex Cooper, floor manager with Credit Lyonnaise Rouse, said many traders, who last week bought Italian bonds in the wake of consolidation in Europe and the US, moved quickly to reduce their exposures. As a result, volumes on Liffe were buoyant, with 52,510 contracts exchanged. The June future settled at 107.94, down just over a point. In the cash market, the 10-year yield spread over bunds widened to 448 basis points from 427 points on Monday. Mr David Brown, chief European economist at Bear Stearns, said the 'likely size of any recapitalisation is not huge but it has spooked BTPs nevertheless, catching the market on the defensive'. * Other European high-yielders had a mixed day. Spanish bonds closed marginally higher, with the 10-year yield spread over Germany falling from 333 basis points to 331 points. Swedish bonds closed lower, with the 10-year spread over bunds widening to 209 basis points. The Riksbank's cut in the securities repurchase rate from 7.6% to 7.4%, the seventh this year, had been expected. * Fears about the cost of BSE - so-called 'mad cow disease' - continued to overhang UK government bonds, which again underperformed other European markets. Mr Andrew Roberts at UBS said: 'There has been a real change of investor perception. BSE is the overriding factor in the market just now.' Yields on benchmark 10-year bonds rose by 5 basis points, with the yield spread over bunds, which had narrowed to 178 basis points on Monday, widening to 185 points. Yields on benchmark two-year paper closed 7 basis points higher. On Liffe, June long gilts closed at 104 7/8, down 3/8. * German bonds closed largely unchanged, with yields falling marginally on 10-year bunds and most shorter-dated paper. The market slipped in early trading, following indications from the Bundesbank that an immediate cut in short-term rates was not on the cards, but later recovered ground. On Liffe, 10-year June futures settled at 96.44, down 0.01. * French figures for household consumption in February were as expected and OATs largely tracked bunds.

230,1996-03-26,1996-03-27,Financial Times,MARKETS - POLITICAL PRESSURES WEIGH HEAVILY ON EQUITIES - MARKET REPORT.,"By STEVE THOMPSON, UK Stock Market editor. The political fall-out from the mad cow disease controversy continued to cast a shadow over UK equities and was said to have been responsible for another dismal performance by the stock market. With dealers increasingly taking the view that the government will struggle to recover from the political and potential economic impact of the BSE scare, gilts were persistently sold throughout the day and the Footsie future traded at a big discount to the cash market. And some of the market's bears were casting doubts about today's auction of #3bn of five-year gilts. The 10-year gilt closed off the day's low but was still 12 ticks down at the close. The 20-year gilt was 14 ticks easier. The outcome of a difficult trading session in London was that the FT-SE 100 index once again waved goodbye to the 3,700 level. By the close, it was left nursing a 21.0 fall at 3,660.9. There was much less pressure on the second-line stocks, where another outstanding performance by Securicor, a further 11% stronger following Monday's restructuring proposals, helped sustain the FT-SE Mid 250 index, which ended 2.0 off at 4,294.5. Wall Street gave precious little support to London, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average coming in on the weak side and falling sharply in the first 30 minutes of trading before staging a good rally and posting a small gain soon after that. Late in the session there was news that the US Federal Open Market Committee meeting had finished and that US interest rates had been left unchanged. Commenting on the day's events, the head trader at one of the leading UK securities houses said the institutions were worried about the political implications of the BSE scare. 'The feeling is that the government is in real trouble and that things will probably get much worse before they get better,' he said. He added that London was being propped up by Wall Street and that any big setback in New York, together with more bad news on the BSE front, could produce a nasty few days for UK stocks. Last week's burst of programme trading activity had also left the market heavy of certain stocks and caused considerable indigestion, he said. On the plus side, however, the view in the market was that the FT-SE 100 index was being depressed by a large short position in the future which, if unwound, might produce a sharp rebound. It was not all doom and gloom in the market. Glaxo Wellcome shot to the top of the FT-SE 100 leader board, in the wake of a burst of speculative buying triggered by the emergence of rumours that a merger between the company and Pfizer, of the US, could be on the cards. Most traders, although keen to take advantage of the big two-way business unleashed by the rumours, were unconvinced that such a deal was imminent. Turnover at 6pm came out at 822.8m shares, with non-FT-SE 100 stocks providing 61% of the business. Customer activity on Monday was valued at #1.59bn. (c) The Financial Times Limited 1996. "
231,1996-03-26,1996-03-27,Financial Times,MARKETS - CURRENCIES QUIET AS MARKETS WAIT ON FED MEETING - MARKETS REPORT.,"Currency markets had a quiet day yesterday with traders mostly content to stay on the sidelines ahead of the Federal Reserve policy meeting. The dollar closed little changed in London at DM 1.4758, from DM 1.4777, while the Fed was still meeting. Against the yen it closed at Y 106.245 from Y 106.13. The dollar firmed slightly when it emerged that the Fed had left interest rates on hold. The announcement did not come as a surprise. While many observers believe US rates will still fall further, the chance of an early cut was reduced by the freak US payrolls report last month. On the policy front, the Swedish central bank cut the repo rate to 7.4% from 7.6%, the seventh reduction of its central money market tender rate this year. In Europe the D-Mark finished slightly firmer against most currencies. The lira was the main loser, finishing at L1,064 from L1,055. Traders sold the currency after news emerged that shares in the state-controlled Banco di Napoli had been suspended. Sterling was stable, but there remain concerns that the government will pay a heavy political price for its handling of the 'mad-cow' scare. It closed at DM 2.2463, from DM 2.2536. Against the dollar it closed at $1.5222, from $1.5252. * Although the D-Mark had a slightly firmer tone yesterday, many analysts believe the outlook for the German currency is bleak. Mr Chris Turner, currency strategist at BZW in London, said 'quite a bearish story' was developing for the D-Mark. He cited three recent developments: M3 growth, the regional elections and the IFO business confidence survey. With M3 money supply growth running at six per cent year on year, Mr Turner said the necessary condition for currency depreciation - money supply growth outstripping nominal output growth - was now in place. The election result, meanwhile, said Mr Turner, 'gave Chancellor Kohl the green light to press on with EMU.' He said this was likely to be negative for the D-Mark on fears of dilution when it becomes part of a single currency. Also, with the EMU project requiring a tight fiscal policy, this would need to be countered by an environment of low interest rates. The IFO survey revealed a big drop in exporter optimism, to the lowest level since last June. Mr Turner said this was probably a lagged response to the D-Mark's large appreciation against the yen in the second half of 1995. The D-Mark has also been the subject of pessimistic comment from Robert Fleming Securities. Peter Warburton and Paul Brunker note that for 20 years the D-Mark's reputation as a dependable store of wealth 'increased in parallel with the 2.9% per annum average gain in its trade-weighted index.' Progress has been so consistent that 'it is 15 years since the D-Mark index last dropped by as much as 3% below its last year average.' But they believe there are three reasons - falling competitiveness, the role of net foreign purchases of bunds, and the issue of 'flight capital' - why the D-Mark will weaken. As evidence of the cumulative loss of competitiveness over a number of years, they note that the pace of net outflows of direct investment from Germany reached almost DM 40bn last year (roughly 40% of the size of the trade surplus), while West German employment has not recovered from the 1992 recession. Mr Brunker believes Germany is pushing for a single currency because it wants to avoid the sort of revaluation of the D-Mark, common in recent years, which took place regardless of German fundamentals. 'The feeling in Germany is that if the single currency is abolished, or even delayed, the D-Mark will go on a strong run again which the economy cannot afford.' * While the FOMC meeting held little joy for currency markets, some better news came in the form of prepared comments from Mr Alan Greenspan, the Fed chairman, at his confirmation hearings. 'Maintaining the key role of the dollar is important to American growth and standards of living,' he said. Repeating this comment for the second time in two weeks will remind markets that the US authorities are not indifferent to the value of the dollar. (c) The Financial Times Limited 1996. "

233,2003-08-12,2003-08-13,Financial Times (FT.Com),Fed decision leaves bonds mixed.,"Bond market reaction to the US Federal Reserve's latest interest rate announcement was mixed on Wednesday, with yields on short-dated European government bonds down but the long end of the curve up. The Fed, as expected, kept US rates steady at 1 per cent but indicated that it would keep rates low for a lengthy period to boost a recovery in the economy. Appearing to address recent volatility in the Treasury market, the Fed added that the risk of continued low inflation remained. Bond yields shot up following the Fed's meeting in late June because the central bank appeared to play down the threat of deflation it had previously raised. The Fed said that: ""The [Federal Open Market] Committee judges that, on balance, the risk of inflation becoming undesirably low is likely to be the predominant concern for the foreseeable future."" If the Fed wanted to steer market rates low, the statement did not appear to be an immediate success. Short-dated yields, which are more sensitive to interest rate expectations, fell on the prospect that rates would stay low for a protracted period. But long-dated rates, which are important for the huge mortgage market, and thus the wider economy, rose. European markets on Wednesday tracked the initial reaction in the Treasuries. Two-year German Schatz yields fell 1.2 basis point to 2.482 per cent, but 10-year Bund yields added 4.3bp at 4.115 per cent. Meanwhile, yields on all benchmark Treasury bonds were up. On the gilt market, yields on short-dated paper fell following the release of an unexpectedly dovish quarterly inflation report from the Bank of England. ""The overall risks to growth, and to a lesser extent, inflation are on the downside,"" the BoE said. The economy was likely to return to its trend rate of growth over the next couple of years, based on the assumption that interest rates would be maintained at their current level of 3.5 per cent, the Bank said. It added that inflation would drop back over the next year before edging back up above its 2.5 per cent target in about two years' time. Two-year gilt yields were 3bp lower at 3.953 per cent, while 10-year yields added 3bp at 4.449 per cent. "
234,2003-08-12,2003-08-13,Financial Times,Federal Reserve THE LEX COLUMN.,"The Federal Open Market Committee made an effort to improve its communications following recent bond market volatility. As well as reiterating that the risks to growth are balanced and that the risks of inflation/ disinflation are skewed towards the latter, the statement added: ""In these circumstances, the committee believes that policy accommodation can be maintained for a considerable period."" Above-trend growth will not automatically trigger pre-emptive tightening. The FOMC statement is a little more upbeat on growth and a little more downbeat on the labour market than in June. For Kremlinologists, the Fed substituted the risk of ""an unwelcome fall in inflation"" for last time's ""an unwelcome substantial fall in inflation"" - perhaps in an attempt to reassure bond investors after the recent rise in yields. The result of a balanced growth outlook and the preponderance of disinflation over inflation risks is that ""the committee judges that, on balance, the risk of inflation becoming undesirably low is likely to be the predominant concern for the foreseeable future"". What is a reasonable interpretation of the foreseeable future? In July's monetary policy report to Congress the FOMC published forecasts for 2003 and 2004, including inflation falling over the forecast horizon in spite of above-trend growth next year. The futures market has been pricing in an interest rate increase next spring. The Fed has sent a message. However, the reliance on wordplay rather than numbers - in the absence of a numerical range for what the FOMC regards as price stability - means the rules of the guessing game are imprecise. Flexibility comes at a cost. US Edition 2. "
235,2003-08-12,2003-08-13,Financial Times,Equity investors remain on the sidelines GLOBAL OVERVIEW.,"Equity markets in the US and Europe showed little appetite for action yesterday ahead of the outcome of the Federal Open Market Committee's interest rate decision. Confirmation that key rates would remain unchanged at their current 45-year lows was expected although its warning that the risks of an unwelcome fall in inflation exceeded the risks of a pick-up provided a morsel of red meat for the markets to digest. Shortly after the Fed's announcement, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was flat. The tech-rich Nasdaq Composite, which on Monday snapped a six-session losing streak after upbeat investment calls on software companies, put on another 0.4 per cent. Attention will now turn to a raft of economic data due later in the week for clues on the outlook, including retail sales, consumer prices, industrial production and consumer confidence. European markets were higher for a fourth consecutive session but activity was light before the Fed's statement and with many investors away for August holidays. In early evening trade, the FTSE Eurotop 300 index was 0.7 per cent higher at 878.07. The run-up has taken the benchmark of Europe's largest companies to within 1 per cent of its highest level for seven months. Tokyo added to Monday's strong gains, helped by better-than-expected gross domestic product data. Japan's economy expanded 0.6 per cent in real terms in the April-June period for the sixth straight quarterly increase, above the 0.2-0.3 per cent consensus growth forecast for the quarter. Institutional fund managers expect worldwide bond yields to rise although they have not adopted an appreciably more optimistic view of the global economy, according to Merrill Lynch's influential fund managers' survey for August. A growing minority of fund managers viewed the monetary policies of the leading economies to be too stimulative and more managers expected the next move in the Federal Funds rate to be up than down. This view resulted in one of the most widespread underweightings of bonds that the survey has recorded. London Edition 1. "
236,2004-11-10,2004-11-11,Financial Times,Blue-chips hold steady with all eyes on rates WALL STREET.,"US stocks greeted with a yawn the decision yesterday by the Federal Reserve to raise benchmark interest rates by a quarter point. As it became apparent that the Fed's assessment of the economy was similar to the previous time, the indices came down to this week's comfort zone on Wall Street: the flat line. The Dow Jones Industrial Average ended barely changed at 10,385.48, while the broader S&P 500 index was 0.1 per cent lower at 1,162.90. The technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite index edged off 0.4 per cent at 2,034.56, under pressure from a disappointing quarterly earnings report from Cisco Systems. The Fed reiterated its view that even after yesterday's rate increase, ""the stance of monetary policy remains accommodative"". Its policy- making Federal Open Market Committee also reaffirmed its commitment to tightening monetary policy at a ""measured"" pace, barring any changes in the economy that could jeopardise price stability. However, it described inflationary risks as ""well-contained"" in both the long and the short term. While yesterday's rate increase was expected, economists are now debating whether the Fed will repeat it in December, or pause its current cycle of tightening. Rory Robertson, interest rates strategist at Macquarie, said last week's blockbuster job creation data ""have made the need for the pause in December less obvious"". Francois Trahan, chief investment strategist at Bear Stearns, agreed that ""a tighter labour market only increases the likelihood of more Fed tightenings"" and pushed the thesis further, noting that ""future hikes can only compound the problem for stocks in 2005"". Mr Trahan sees the monetary policy outlook as one of several challenges faced by the US equity market. Another is technical resistance for the S&P 500 index at the 1,160 level. The mix of factors causes him to conclude: ""We expect the equity market rally of the past few weeks to go the way of previous ones and run out of steam shortly."" Meanwhile William Livesey, the chief technical analyst at CyberTrader, cautioned that recent intraday trading moves point to the end of a trend for stocks. ""If the market doesn't show some life soon the recent rally may be in trouble,"" he said. Crude oil futures rose after weekly data on petroleum inventories showed a rise in crude oil inventories but a decline in distillate products such as heating oil. The data raised the possibility of another run-up in oil prices amid fears of a shortage of heating oil as winter approaches. In economic news, the US government reported that the US trade deficit narrowed more than expected last month. Shares in Cisco Systems lost 6.6 per cent to Dollars 18.44 after the networking company reported in-line quarterly earnings and its forecasts disappointed some analysts. Shares in Advanced Medical Optics fell 8.6 per cent to Dollars 38.80 after the medical device maker agreed to buy Visx, whose shares soared 34.5 per cent to Dollars 24.36. Both companies specialise in eye care devices such as vision-correction lasers. The fall-out from the global withdrawal of Vioxx by Merck continued, with reports that a similar drug made by Pfizer caused similar negative side-effects. Shares in Pfizer eased 1.9 per cent to Dollars 27.47. However, Merck added 1.5 per cent to Dollars 26.41 and was among the leading gainers on the Dow. Among internet-related stocks, Yahoo was off 1 per cent at Dollars 36.66 while Google edged off 0.5 per cent to Dollars 167.86 amid news that a competing search service from Microsoft will be previewed this week. Microsoft shares were off 0.1 per cent to Dollars 29.73 by the close. Hewlett-Packard shares lost 3.7 per cent to Dollars 18.97 and those of Dell Computer were 1.6 per cent lower at Dollars 36.85 after analysts at UBS lowered their rating for the two stocks to ""neutral"". D.R. Horton shares put on 0.1 per cent to Dollars 31.80 after the housebuilder reported quarterly results that beat expectations as its profits rose 52 per cent. Federated Department Stores shares put on 0.1 per cent to Dollars 53.85 after the owner of the popular Macy's and Bloomingdale's department stores reported quarterly results that exceeded estimates and gave an upbeat view of sales trends.

237,2004-11-10,2004-11-11,Financial Times,Fed lifts rate to 2% and keeps stance.,"* No change in policy which 'remains accommodative' * Italy raises prospect of intervention to stabilise euro The Federal Reserve yesterday raised its target interest rate by a quarter point to 2 per cent, the fourth consecutive increase since June. The policymaking Federal Open Market Committee reiterated that policy stance ""remains accommodative"" and that it expected to raise rates ""at a pace that is likely to be measured"". The Fed's rate increase and the limited changes to its statement were widely expected, and financial markets were little changed. Italy's government last night appeared to raise the prospect of co-ordinated central bank intervention to stabilise the euro, highlighting European nervousness about the impact of its rise against the dollar on the eurozone's fragile recovery. Domenico Siniscalco, economy minister, was quoted by several news agencies as saying ""a co-ordinated intervention is being talked about again, not a unilateral intervention."" Mr Siniscalco later sought to clarify his remarks, telling the Financial Times he had merely been talking about the need to co-ordinate policy on the euro at the level of the Group of Seven industrial nations. He said he meant simply that ""unilateral action makes no sense"" and made clear he had no knowledge of any intervention plans. Rob Nichols, US Treasury spokesman, said: ""I can affirm there has been absolutely no change in US policy in this area. We believe that currency values should be set in open and competitive markets."" In its statement, the Fed said ""output appears to be growing at a moderate pace despite the rise in energy prices, and labour market conditions have improved"". At its last meeting, the committee had indicated that the economy had ""regained some traction"" following the energy price rise and that labour market conditions had improved modestly. Some economists took that as a more positive statement on growth and the labour market. Others noted the Fed's characterisation of output growth as moderate. The Fed in effect left its options open. It provided no hint of an upcoming pause or a change in its strategy, but committee members have made clear that the measured pace language is not a commitment to raise rates at each meeting. ""The most important message is that the committee said that policy remains accommodative,"" said Dean Maki, economist at JPMorgan Chase in New York. There has been widespread speculation that the Fed will leave rates on hold at its December meeting, although following the strong October payroll report released on Friday the futures markets have priced in the probability of another rate in increase at the meeting. Ten regional Federal Reserve Banks requested a quarter-point increase in the discount rate to 3 per cent, but the San Francisco and Dallas Feds did not. This is not necessarily any indication of a dissenting view, although Janet Yellen, president of the San Francisco Fed and non-voting member of the FOMC, stressed the downside risks to the growth outlook in a recent speech. The federal funds rate, at 2 per cent, is still seen as well below the level seen as consistent with price stability over time. The central bank is likely to press ahead with rate increases while there is no sign that tighter monetary policy risks destabilising the economy. Lex, Page 16 "
238,2004-11-10,2004-11-11,Financial Times,Italy raises the prospect of intervention on euro: Comments show eurozone nerves over single currency's strength against dollar.,"Italy's government last night raised the prospect of co-ordinated central bank intervention to stabilise the euro, highlighting European Union nervousness about the impact of its rise against the dollar on the eurozone's economic recovery. Domenico Siniscalco, Italy's economy minister, was quoted by several news agencies as saying: ""A co-ordinated intervention is being talked about again, not a unilateral intervention. That would not help."" There had already been an attempt to stabilise the euro at Dollars 1.20, he was reported as saying. The euro briefly touched a new peak at Dollars 1.3005 during the afternoon in London but eased to Dollars 1.289 in late New York trading. The last broad intervention in currency markets by the world's large central banks was in 2000 when the euro was languishing at Dollars 0.86. Mr Siniscalco later sought to clarify his remarks, saying to the Financial Times he had merely been talking about the need to co-ordinate policy on the euro at the level of the Group of Seven industrial nations. He said he meant simply that ""unilateral action makes no sense"" and made clear he had no knowledge of any intervention plans. But his comments followed the unexpected change in tone earlier this week by Jean-Claude Trichet, president of the European Central Bank, when he drew attention to the suddenness of the rise of the euro. Last night the ECB said it had ""no comment"" on Mr Siniscalco's remarks. But Ken Wattret, economist at BNP Paribas, said the Italian government ""had let the cat out of the bag"" and that it was probable that the ECB had discussed the possibility of intervention. Mr Siniscalco's remarks came as the US Federal Reserve yesterday raised its target interest rate by a quarter point to 2 per cent, the fourth consecutive increase since the Fed's June meeting. The policymaking Federal Open Market Committee left its accompanying statement largely unchanged from September's meeting. It said that following yesterday's rate increase its policy stance ""remains accommodative"" and that the committee expected to be able to raise rates ""at a pace that is likely to be measured"". The Fed's rate increase and the limited changes to its statement were widely expected, and financial markets were little changed. Silvio Berlusconi, Italy's prime minister, has been issuing the most strident warnings recently about the effect of the euro's rise. Italian officials said Rome was in regular ""technical contact"" with the ECB. The eurozone's economic recovery this year has been led by exports but third-quarter gross domestic product figures tomorrow are expected to show a slowdown. Mervyn King, governor of the Bank of England, said the existence of half the world with semi-fixed exchange rates against the dollar and others with floating rates was causing big conceptual problems in the management of the world economy. Presenting the Bank's latest Inflation Report yesterday, he said: ""The difficulty is that any adjustment of the dollar is likely to fall against the currencies which float against the dollar, and the biggest is the euro, and this burden of adjustment should be spread more widely.""

239,1997-02-05,1997-02-06,Financial Times,LIRA SURVIVES REPORT THAT IT WILL MISS EMU START.,"The lira firmed yesterday despite new evidence that Italy might be excluded from the first round of European monetary union. A report in the Financial Times said that European officials were planning to offer Italy a delayed entry in 2000 or 2001, after Emu's planned start in 1999. The lira fell from L984 to L992.5 against the D-Mark when the report broke, but the currency recovered on Bank of Italy buying and the market's gradual perception that a guaranteed if belated entry into Emu could be good news for the lira. The currency closed the day in London L1.7 higher against the D-Mark at L985.1. The peseta and the Portuguese escudo also rose slightly, despite fears that Spain and Portugal might likewise be excluded from the first round of Emu. At one point the Bank of Spain was seen intervening in the market, buying pesetas. The pound soared again, helped by overnight Japanese buying. It broke the key psychologial Y 200 barrier against the yen to close Y 3.6 higher at a 52-month peak of Y 201.3. Japanese purchases of gilts were prompted partly by Mr Robin Cook, the UK Labour Party's foreign affairs spokesman, who had previously suggested that a Labour government might well join the second round of Emu. The yen also suffered on the market's increasing belief that the Group of Seven industrialised nations, which meets in Berlin on Saturday, would not try to weaken the dollar. The pound also rose against the dollar and D-Mark. It gained 1.4 cents against the dollar to $1.632 and 3.4 pfennigs against the D-Mark to DM 2.691. Sterling, which plunged last week, has now recovered 6.7 pfennigs against the German currency since Monday. The D-Mark fell despite the news that Emu might start without some of Europe's traditionally weaker currencies, thus pointing to a stronger future single European currency. The D-Mark was hit by weak German industrial orders for December. The dollar rose further against the D-Mark and the yen, climbing 0.7 pfennigs to DM 1.649 and Y 1.1 to Y 123.3. * Yesterday's events have clarified what currency markets expect of Italy and monetary union. Mr Jim O'Neill, chief currency economist at Goldman Sachs in London, said: ""Everybody already knew Italy was not going to be in the first round of Emu."" Therefore, strong evidence that it would indeed be excluded hardly hit the lira. In other words, the bond and currency markets have not been pricing in that Italy will join Emu in 1999. They have merely been betting that Italy will receive a public guarantee saying it will enter in the second wave. So when the Financial Times reported that that is precisely what would happen, the lira rose to slightly higher than it had stood before. Mr O'Neill said: ""If there is really a deal to guarantee that Italy can go in at any stage, it actually makes the Italian interest rate market very attractive."" In short, the only news that would send the lira tumbling is if no such guarantee of membership were given. * Mr O'Neill also said yesterday that Saturday's G7 meeting was unlikely to stall the dollar's rise. ""There's a growing view from a lot of market insiders that there's not going to be any communique from the G7, and that's a green light to sell the yen."" He said the Japanese currency could drop to Y 220 against the pound. Mr Chris Turner, currency analyst at BZW in London, pointed out that ten years ago this month, at the Louvre meeting in Paris, the G7 had agreed to try to stabilise the falling dollar. That failed: the US currency continued to slip for several months afterwards. This boded ill for any G7 attempt to stabilise the rising dollar now, he said. * The Bank of England yesterday gave no signal as to whether UK interest rates would rise after the morning's monetary policy meeting between Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, and Mr Eddie George, the Bank's governor. Potentially the Bank could raise rates this morning, but the currency markets expect no move. As forecast, the Federal Open Market Committee left US rates unchanged after its two-day meeting ended yesterday. Copyright Financial Times Limited 1997. All Rights Reserved.

240,1997-02-05,1997-02-06,Financial Times,ITALY RALLIES ON STRONG DOMESTIC BUYING.,"Italian bonds recovered some of the ground lost earlier in the week on reports that European Union monetary officials were drawing up plans to guarantee Italy a place in the second wave of Emu, after 2000. Economists were divided on the reasons behind the BTP rally, with some attributing it to market relief after a period of growing uncertainty on Italy's prospects of being a founding member of Emu. Mr Luca Jellinek, bond strategist at Paribas in London, said: ""Italian bonds made good gains on the back of strong domestic buying. 1999 was never a realistic target date for Italy's entrance to Emu, so the reports on its delayed but guaranteed entry could be taken as a positive development."" Mr David Brown, chief economist at Bear Stearns in London, said: ""The market's reaction was a little bit surprising. Italy is not off the hook at all. If Germany fails to give Italy less than resounding support at the summit between Mr Romano Prodi [prime minister of Italy] and Chancellor Helmut Kohl on Friday, then BTPs could take a dive."" Traders said that the resolution of Italy's long-running metal-workers' wages dispute on Tuesday, and the slowing in the annual rate of growth of Italy's consumer price index to 2.6% - the lowest since 1969 - had fuelled expectations of further interest rate cuts by the central bank. The recovery of the lira on the foreign exchange markets, where it had dropped to L990 against the D-Mark in the morning but rose to L985 in the late afternoon, directly tracked the BTP rally. March futures on 10-year BTPs closed 0.83 higher at 130.55 on Liffe, while in the cash market the yield spread of BTPs over German bunds tightened to 155 basis points. Spanish bonos also recovered, in spite of yesterday's report by a government minister that Spain's public debt had risen by 4 percentage points in 1996 to 69.3% of GDP. Spanish 10-year bono futures rose by 0.23 to close at 113.39 in Barcelona. In the cash market, bonos' 10-year yield spread over bunds widened slightly to 109 basis points. Overnight profit-taking by Japanese investors after the appreciation of sterling helped push UK gilts lower after a one-week rally. Traders said Italian investors heavily offloaded gilt futures to realise their recent capital gains and take advantage of cheaper Italian bonds. Liffe's March long gilt future dropped 1/4 to close at 112 1/16. Yield spreads over 10-year bunds widened by six basis points to 174 basis points. German bund futures rose by 0.36 to settle at 102.15 on Liffe yesterday on expectations of a strong rise in January unemployment figures today. US Treasuries were moderately lower in mid-afternoon trading as the Federal Reserve left interest rates unchanged. Bonds bounced briefly off their session lows just after 2pm, as the Fed announced that its Open Market Committee had not changed interest rates, and them began to settle back near their pre-announcement lows. Near 2.30pm, the benchmark 30-year Treasury was 3/8 lower at 96 to yield 6.731% and the two year note was down 1/32 to 99, yielding 5.874%. Few on Wall Street expected the FOMC to change monetary policy, although several economists expect an interest rate increase sometime in the first half of this year. Of more immediate concern to the market was the new supply to be sold next week as part of the Treasury's quarterly refunding operations. The Treasury said it planned to raise about $21.75bn next week through the sale of $17.75bn in three-year notes, $12bn in 10-year notes and $10bn in 30-year bonds.

243,2009-08-12,2009-08-13,Financial Times,Citigroup leads way in strong rebound for financial sector,"wall street US stocks bounced yesterday, recovering most of the previous day's losses as buyers were tempted back into the market following two days of falls. Financial stocks were heavily bought after dragging the market lower on Tuesday. Citigroup , shares in which have been volatile recently, shedding over 6 per cent on Tuesday following a 20 per cent surge over the previous seven sessions, gained 7.9 per cent to $3.98. Wells Fargo advanced 1 per cent to $27.17 and JPMorgan rose 2.4 per cent to $42.21. Bank of New York Mellon was also higher after it announced its plans to buy Insight Investment Management from Lloyds bank. BNY Mellon's shares picked up 2.3 per cent to $28.71. Insurer Allstate was one of the steepest climbers in the financial sector, rising 6.3 per cent to $28.42 after Bank of America-Merrill Lynch recommended buying the shares, saying the company's fundamentals remained strong and that the shares were undervalued following recent falls. Equities saw a turbulent afternoon as investors responded to the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC). The announcement that there would be no increase in quantitative easing and that the Fed saw economic activity ""levelling out"" saw stocks slip, before jumping, and then selling off shortly before the close. ""The language was pretty optimistic, although with a note of caution,"" said Dan Cook, senior market analyst at IG Markets. But Burt White, chief investment officer for LPL Financial, said: ""I think 'levelling out' confused the market a little bit, and it points to a divided Fed."" The benchmark S&P 500 index closed 1.2 per cent higher at 1,005.81 while the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 1.3 per cent to 9,361.61 and the Nasdaq Composite index climbed 1.5 per cent to 1,998.72. ""We may be in for some bouncing around as investors decide whether to trust in the recovery and take the plunge into equities,"" said Bruce McCain, chief investment strategist at Key Private Bank. Homebuilders were especially strong after Toll Brothers , which builds luxury houses, said cancellations fell and orders rose during the previous quarter, although it added that its units were selling for cheaper prices. Toll Brothers ' shares jumped 14.4 per cent to $23.42 and gave a boost to others in the sector. DR Horton gained 2.6 per cent to $13.45, while Lennar rose 4 per cent to $13.52. There was some optimism on consumer activity after department store Macy's kicked off the retailers' earnings season by beating earnings estimates and raising its full-year forecast. The shares were volatile, however, with some concern over the company's warning of a ""very difficult"" trading environment as well as the fact its forecast remains at the lower end of analyst expectations. After a brief fall during the pre-market session, the shares rose 6 per cent to $16.40 during the day. Shares in Sara Lee also bounced around after the company made a narrower loss than expected after one-off charges. There was strength in North American sales, which helped boost the shares before the bell, but they subsequently fell and finished 10 per cent down at $9.72. Meanwhile, Applied Materials , which produces equipment to make microchips, reported a narrower loss than predicted on relatively strong sales. Its shares rose 3.3 per cent to $13.66. The IPO market has shown signs of life in the past few days, culminating yesterday with what is likely to become the biggest US offering this year from Starwood Property Trust . The trust, which will invest in real estate, offered its shares at $20 and held on to that to close the day unchanged. But Emdeon , a healthcare services company, jumped on its first day of trade and the shares, which were priced at $15.50, climbed6.6 per cent to $16.52. Imax , the cinema chain that shows films in 3D, entered the market on Tuesday priced on the Nasdaq at $8.50. Strong buying during the day saw the shares rise to $9.11 and they continued to build on that yesterday, strengthening 1.5 per cent to $9.25."
244,1996-05-21,1996-05-22,Financial Times,WORLD STOCK MARKETS - US EQUITIES STEADY AHEAD OF FOMC - AMERICA - WALL STREET.,"US equities hovered near to Monday's closing levels in midsession trade as investors awaited the conclusion of the Federal Reserve's Open Market Committee meeting, writes Lisa Bransten in New York. At 1pm, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was 8.13 stronger at 5,756.95, the Standard &Poor's 500 was up 2.16 at 675.31 and the American Stock Exchange composite gained 3.16 at 612.52. The technology-rich Nasdaq composite added 3.09 at 1,251.20. NYSE volume was 230m shares. Few on Wall Street expected the Fed to change interest rates at yesterday's FOMC meeting, but economists remained divided about the direction of interest rates through to the end of the year. Therefore, many were hopeful that the Fed would release some indication of its view of the economy at the conclusion of the meeting. Stocks derived little direction from the bond market, which was also relatively flat. Among individual shares, oil companies in the Dow gave up some of the strong gains made on Monday after the conclusion of the United Nations deal to allow Iraq to sell oil to raise money for humanitarian aid. Chevron retreated $1 1/4 to $60 3/4, Exxon shed $1 1/2 to $86 and Texaco receded $1 5/8 to $85 1/4. Wellpoint Health Networks, a California health maintenance organisation (HMO), soared $12 1/2 or 48% to $38 5/8 as the HMO's parent, Blue Cross of California, completed its conversion to a for-profit company. Wellpoint retains use of the Blue Cross name for marketing purposes and Blue Cross donated $3bn to two healthcare foundations in order to repay the citizens of California for tax benefits it received while it was a non-profit company. ValuJet shares climbed $1 5/8 or 14% to $12 7/8, regaining some of the ground lost in the days since one of the airline's DC-9s crashed in the Florida Everglades, in spite of news that one of the company's founders had sold 1.5m shares on Monday. The company said the shares were sold to satisfy margin debt. For a second consecutive day, shares in Iomega jumped amid optimism about a two-for-one stock split that took effect yesterday. Shares in the company, which makes computer disk drives, added $6 or 15% at $47 3/8. Dayton Hudson rose $3 or 3% to $105 after the retailer reported stronger than expected first-quarter earnings of 49 cents a share. The mean estimate from analysts was for closer to 43 cents a share.

245,1996-05-21,1996-05-22,Financial Times,CURRENCIES AND MONEY - VERBAL SUPPORT TAKES DOLLAR TO 16 MONTH HIGH - MARKETS REPORT.,"The dollar yesterday rallied to a 16 month high against the D-Mark following verbal support for a stronger dollar from a senior Bundesbank official. Mr Olaf Sievert, a Bundesbank council member, provided the market with a signal to buy dollars when he told an audience in Leipzig that 'a rise of a few pfennigs in the dollar would be good for the German economy.' This took the dollar to an intra-day high of DM 1.5435 in Europe. It later closed in London at DM 1.5415, from DM 1.5347 on Monday. Against the yen it finished at Y 107.06, from Y 107.115. Earlier the dollar had been under some pressure following sceptical comments about European monetary union, which supported the D-Mark, from Mr Wilhelm Nolling, a former Bundesbank official. Sterling was a beneficiary of the firmer dollar, with the trade-weighted index finishing at 84.8, the highest level in the rally since hitting a historic low of 82.2 on November 20. Against the D-Mark it closed at DM 2.3331, from DM 2.3207. Against the dollar it finished at $1.5136 from $1.5122. Analysts pointed out that the three per cent rally in sterling effectively offset the 75 basis point cut in UK interest rates since last December. In Sweden, the central bank trimmed the repo rate to 6.5% from 6.7%. Activity was generally fairly subdued ahead of the meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee in the US, although there was little expectation of any shift in US interest rates. * The dollar's rally off historic lows last year against the yen and D-Mark has been so dogged that it has at times been possible to lose sight of the overall trend. But as recently as last October, the dollar was trading around DM 1.38, and in late February it was still down at DM 1.45. The dollar's rally looks more impressive when put into context. Mr Nick Parsons, currency strategist at Paribas Capital Markets, notes that for the first time in ten years the dollar has risen against the D-Mark for four quarters in succession. Against the yen, it has risen for three successive quarters, something not achieved since the dollar's great bull run ahead of the Plaza Accord in 1985. Economists at Merrill Lynch, meanwhile, note that from trough to peak, the dollar rallies of 1988-89, 1991 and 1992-93 each climbed by 20-25%. If the current dollar rally matches these gains, it will reach DM 1.65-70. Mr Brian Martin, economist at Barclays in London, said that while the trend towards 'gradual dollar appreciation' was clearly in place, it was in neither Germany or the US's interest to have the dollar appreciate faster. From the US perspective, there was the danger that it could hit export performance. Germany, meanwhile, depended on foreign bond purchases to finance its budget deficit, and hence 'had to be careful not to show that they favour longer term (inflationary) depreciation of the currency.' * While the market remains in favour of a stronger dollar, Mr Richard Koo, senior economist at the Nomura Research Institute in Tokyo, advances a speculative thesis as to why the US government might favour a weaker currency. Mr Koo's premise is that the priority of Mr Robert Rubin, the US treasury secretary, is to achieve the re-election of President Clinton. He speculates that this might best be achieved through a 'stable and weak dollar' which would be advantageous to Wall st - 'a weak dollar would encourage Japanese investment in the USA and low long term interest rates' - and to Main st (by making US exports more competitive). A key part of Mr Koo's argument is that unlike in the Eighties, when Japanese investors 'pursued rising values', they now buy when prices are low. Mr Koo presumes Mr Rubin will have noticed this fact, and hence will favour a weaker dollar. 'US investment will not become particularly popular amongst Japanese investors if the dollar merely breaks through the Y 105 level. A fully fledged interest in US investment will only rise amongst domestic (Japanese) investors once the dollar has broken through (below) Y 100.' 'A level between Y 90-100 is the most suitable in terms of its impact both on structural reform and the economy,' says Mr Koo. (c) The Financial Times Limited 1996. "
246,1992-05-19,1992-05-20,Financial Times,Foreign Exchanges: Dollar drops on housing starts,"THE DOLLAR sank to a new three-month low against the D-Mark on the foreign exchanges yesterday on news of a bigger than expected monthly drop of 17 per cent in US housing starts for April, writes James Blitz. The US unit was trading at a low of DM1.5865 shortly after lunchtime in European markets, as dealers feared that the sharpest monthly fall in housing starts for eight years would force the Federal Reserve to ease interest rates again. When the rate cut failed to materialise at yesterday's Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting, the dollar regained some ground and closed in London 1/2 pfennig down at DM1.5905. Dealers said the dollar had been propped up by heavy bidding just below DM1.59 by two large German institutions and life insurance companies in Tokyo. In New York it ended at DM1.5903/10. However, analysts believe the case for a cut is much stronger following the housing figures, and could come today, when the FOMC meets again. Mr Neil MacKinnon, chief economist of Yamaichi International in London, said: 'The balance of probabilities is for the Fed easing.' He does not believe that the dollar weakness will last but thinks the currency could yet bottom out at DM1.56. The dollar also lost ground yesterday morning to the yen on news that Japanese machine orders for March were up 14.6 per cent from the previous month. The figure brought a strong reaction from the markets, coming one day after news that the Japanese trade surplus in April was 13.4 per cent higher than for the previous month. However, the Fed's decision not to cut rates gave the US currency a temporary respite and it ended a little firmer at Y129.10, and later closed in New York at Y129.12. The D-Mark continued to perform strongly in the wake of Monday's news that a large industrial strike had been avoided. Its best gain was against the French franc as traders took profits following last week's bullish performance by the French currency. The D-Mark finished at FFr3.3634, up about 1/2 franc. Sterling's recent rise against the D-Mark also seems to have petered out as traders give up hope that the pound might cross its central rate against the German currency. The pound closed 1/4 pfennig down at DM2.9250. One London dealer suggested that the pound's decline against the D-Mark may have been due to profit-taking in sterling/dollar trading, after the UK currency reached a high point of Dollars 1.8425 in London yesterday. The Swiss franc made new gains following Switzerland's decision to formally apply for EC membership. The Swiss currency ended about 1/2 centime stronger against the dollar at SFr1.4600. "
247,2002-05-07,2002-05-08,Financial Times,GLOBAL INVESTING - Treasuries rise as Fed hold rates.,"US government bonds rose yesterday after the Federal Reserve kept interest rates unchanged and said the pace of economic expansion remains uncertain. The FOMC meeting, as expected, resulted in no change to the Fed's policy or bias. The recent fall in stocks and a weak April employment report had earlier reinforced expectations that the Fed would keep the funds rate at 1.75 per cent. The Fed said yesterday that the risks remained ""balanced"" between price stability and economic growth. Economists expect the Fed to remain on hold through to June. Yesterday's data on non-farm productivity growth will support the Fed's decision. Although growth was stronger than expected, rising 8.6 per cent in the first quarter, unit labour costs fell - indicating that inflation remains benign. The market absorbed yesterday a quarterly refunding sale of $22bn five-year notes, which will be followed by a fresh $11bn in 10-year notes today. The two-year note gained 1/16 to 100 1/2 after the decision to yield 3.104 per cent, while the 10-year note was 5/32 higher at 98 21/32 with a yield of 5.047 per cent. The 30-year bond was up 1/8 to 97 to yield 5.532 per cent. Eurozone government bond prices were flat in a choppy session as weak figures on the health of the German economy were offset by stronger equity markets. The number of jobless people in the eurozone's largest economy rose an unexpected 6,000 in April. In addition, German industrial orders fell by 0.1 per cent in March, pushing investors back into government bonds after many analysts had predicted a positive number. However, in the afternoon bond prices fell back after US productivity figures helped the equity markets. ""I think stocks will remain in the driver's seat for the next few days,"" said Nathalie Fillet, a government bond strategist at BNP Paribas in London. The two-year German schatz yield rose by half a basis point to 4.094 per cent, while the 10-year German bund yield was little changed at 5.111 per cent. The 10-year German bund futures contract price rose 0.05 to 106.16. In the UK, gilts tracked the US and European markets, with the 10-year gilt yield down slightly at 5.172 per cent. Japanese government bond prices rose, sending the 10-year yield to its lowest since late December on falling share prices and a strengthening yen. The yen rose to a two-month high on concern about the US economy, despite comments by Japanese officials, in which they said they were monitoring the US dollar-yen rate and were prepared to intervene if necessary. JGBs were also supported by a fall in the Japanese stock market. The Nikkei 225 Stock Average fell 2 per cent to 11,316.04. The June futures contract rose 0.17 to 138.90. The benchmark 10-year No 238 cash JGB rose 0.130 to 100.390, pushing the yield down 0.015 to 1.355 per cent, the lowest since December 28. US Edition 1. "
248,2002-05-07,2002-05-08,Financial Times,THE AMERICAS - Fed continues dispensing medicine to a still-sick economy - Committee leaves rates at ...,"THE AMERICAS - Fed continues dispensing medicine to a still-sick economy - Committee leaves rates at 40-year low, although fears on inflation are beginning to rattle nerves, writes Peronet Despeignes. The Federal Reserve said yesterday inflation remained under control and signalled that short-term interest rates would stay at 40-year lows to help an economy still struggling to recuperate from last year's recession and the colossal investment bust of the past two years. What the US central bank did not say was that economic data have been increasingly mixed and financial news dismal, dragging down stock prices to six-month lows. The Nasdaq stock index, barometer of what is left of the ""new economy"", has over the past month sunk to levels not seen since the wake of the September 11 terror attacks. America's economic recovery is, once again, in serious doubt, with inflation brewing as a potential problem over the coming year. The Fed's worst nightmare remains the prospect of a race between inflation and recovery - the possibility it will be forced into a Hobbesian decision to tighten the noose on money and credit to suppress inflation before clear signs emerge of a genuine recovery. That dilemma would leave its chairman Alan Greenspan - widely thought to be on his way towards a triumphant retirement - with an important, final challenge: navigating between the dual threats of renewed economic weakness and inflation. The Fed's policymaking open market committee (FOMC) decided yesterday to leave short-term interest rates at a low of 1.75 per cent, where they have been since November. The general consensus is that monetary policy remains ""accommodative"" - in other words, adrenalin for a still-sick economy. The big question is how long it can remain so before risking an inflation problem. Mr Greenspan recently suggested it would take ""two to four months"" for the Fed to have enough confidence about the economy's direction to make a pre-emptive policy change and, presumably, reverse course. Futures markets have registered expectations the Fed will end its anti-recession campaign and begin returning short-term rates to ""normal"" levels no sooner than September. A surge in inflation risks could wreck this timetable. To the Fed's relief, inflation appears under control despite last year's dramatic monetary easing. According to the consumer price index, the 12-month trailing rate of inflation has slowed sharply in the past year from 3.5 per cent to just above 1 per cent. The implicit GDP deflator and deflator on personal consumption expenditures - considered better measures by Mr Greenspan - suggest inflation has slid below 1 per cent. While some prices - mainly for oil, gasoline and services such as housing, medical care and education - have surged and prices overall have stabilised, inflation appears generally subdued. However, economic indicators are backward-looking. The issue for the Fed is where inflation is heading from here and where markets expect it to go. A key determinant is the nation's productivity miracle. Figures released yesterday suggest it remains intact as companies continue to cut costs and the economy keeps producing more with less. But the persistence of the slump in stock prices and in investment in labour-saving technologies, and the pick-up in government spending, have raised doubts about how long the productivity surge will last. Mr Greenspan said last month he did not expect high figures indefinitely: ""The world just doesn't work that well."" One measure closely watched by the Fed, the difference between yields on Treasury and inflation-indexed Treasury bonds (Tips), has grown to a two-year high. Gold dollar prices have jumped and the dollar itself has slid recently - possible preliminary signs of weakening foreign demand for, and an inflationary oversupply of, US currency. Two prominent economic watchdogs have sent warnings. In its latest quarterly industry survey, the National Association of Business Economics, the largest group of corporate economists, said inflation pressures ""were developing"", evinced by ""widely reported"" price increases in services and raw materials. The Institute for Supply Management said purchasing managers were reporting strong growth in costs, with service-sector executives reporting that their costs ""had increased at the fastest rate in 11 months"". A sign of the emerging confusion and policy tensions was an extraordinarily public confrontation last month between a current and a former member of the FOMC at the April 25 annual economic conference of the Levy Economic Institute. Gary Stern, president of the Minneapolis Federal Reserve, said that amid the unusual uncertainty, Fed policy action ""should be modest and infrequent"" to ""avoid destabilising the economy"". That prompted a stern warning from Laurence Meyer, an economist and former FOMC member, about the danger of being ""reactive"" and complacent on inflation - a possible omen of future divisions that are likely to widen if the ""productivity miracle"" falters and the economy does not recover quickly.

The recent fall in stocks and a weak April employment report had reinforced expectations that the Fed would keep the funds rate at 1.75 per cent.

Although growth was stronger than expected, rising 8.6 per cent in the first quarter, unit labour costs fell - indicating that inflation remains benign. The market focused yesterday on the afternoon's quarterly refunding sale of five-year notes, which will be followed by a fresh $11bn in 10-year notes today. The two-year note was unchanged after the decision at 100 13/32, to yield 3.149 per cent, while the 10-year note was down 3/32 to 98 3/8 with a yield of 5.083 per cent.

250,2002-05-07,2002-05-08,Financial Times,STOCK MARKETS LONDON STOCK EXCHANGE - Heavyweight sectors drag FTSE 100 down again.,"The equitymarket's two-day rally, which was mostly triggered by strong performances from the oil majors and bank stocks, was damaged by London's catch-up after the bank holiday weekend. Monday's trading session in the US saw Wall Street under renewed and heavy downside pressure, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average plunging back through the 10,000 level and the Nasdaq Composite on the slide to its lowest level since October last year. Both were damaged by worries about further casualties in the technology and telecom areas, and concerns about the extent of earnings recovery in the US. And although New York markets staged a rally yesterday afternoon, boosted by strong productivity data, the damage wrought on Monday was too much to repair in one London session. Dealers said the institutions had backed off from the market yesterday, preferring to wait for the outcome of the two interest rate decisions, from the US Federal Reserve's open market committee last night, and the Bank of England's monetary policy committee, expected at midday tomorrow. ""The overwhelming view is that we'll get no change here and no change in the US, but there could well be accompanying comments and the minutes of the last FOMC meeting will come out later this week as well,"" said one trader. At its worst of the day the FTSE 100 dropped below the 5,100 level, hitting a low of 5,082.7, down 120.4, before stabilising and staging a rally to finish the day a net 83.2 off at 5,119.9, its lowest closing level since February 28. The fall-out from the 100 index affected all areas of the market, with the Techmark 100 index, already on its knees because of the latest sell-off in the TMT sectors, sliding a further 14.01 to a record closing low of 1,047.77. The index remains well clear of its record intraday low which saw the measure only just escape falling below the 1,000 level. The FTSE 250 took plenty of punishment too, closing 44 lower at 6,126.2, after 6,119.2, while the FTSE SmallCap dipped 15.9 to 2,567.4. Both indices suffered from marked weakness in tech and related stocks. Leading London fallers yesterday were the heavyweight sectors that provided such stalwart support for the market recently - the oils, banks and pharmaceuticals. Oils were buffeted by selling sparked by the decline in crude oil prices as Iraq said it would resume crude oil sales after its month-long freeze. Weakness in BP and Shell accounted for about 23 points of downside in the FTSE 100, while bearish broker comments drove many of the banks lower. And the gloom surrounding the telecoms arena saw Vodafone shares drift back to their lowest level since January 1998 at one stage. despite support from a handful of brokers.

251,2002-05-07,2002-05-08,Financial Times (FT.Com),Today's People on the Move.,"Bush nominates two more Fed board members A top adviser to Alan Greenspan and a highly regarded economics professor are to be nominated as members of the Federal Reserve's board of governors, as President George W. Bush extends the biggest reconstitution of the central bank's leadership in 60 years. President Bush will announce soon his intention to pick Fed economist Donald Kohn and Princeton University professor Ben Bernanke to fill two vacancies on the board. If they are approved by the Senate, Bush will have directly selected a third of the Fed's 12-seat, policy-making Open Market Committee. All board members sit on the FOMC. Bush won approval for the appointments of Susan Schmidt-Bies and Mark Olson last year. Not since the days of Franklin Delano Roosevelt, who built a reformed Federal Reserve board from scratch after the 1935 Banking Act, has any president had so much influence over the Fed's make-up in so short a time. ""It's unprecedented especially if Greenspan retires under Bush,"" said Tom Schlesinger, an expert on Fed history at the Financial Markets Centre. ""No president in the first two years of his term ever had as many board of governor openings."" Kohn, 59, is an official adviser to the Fed's board. He has worked closely with Greenspan, helping to devise monetary policy strategy. He was previously head of the Fed's Division of Monetary Affairs. Bernanke, 48, is an expert on monetary economics and chairman of the Princeton University economics department. He also sits on the recession-dating committee of the non-partisan National Bureau of Economic Research, which officially declared in November that the economy has slipped into a recession in March. If approved by the Senate, Kohn and Bernanke will fill seats left vacant by the departure of Laurence Meyer and Edward Kelley. Both would serve automatically as non-rotating members of the FOMC which, at full strength, is made up of seven board members selected by the President and five rotating regional Fed presidents elected by their regional boards. Peronet Despeignes Orchestream CEO resigns amid falling sales Orchestream, the UK internet software company, today announced the resignation of Ashley Ward, its chief executive, as it unv eiled three-month figures showing continuing deterioration in revenues. Orchestream said the resignation followed months of disagreement over business strategy between Ward, who had been CEO since mid 1998, and the rest of the Orchestream management which had now come to a head. The company said a successor would be announced within the coming weeks. In the interim period Ward's duties would be taken over by Anthony Finbow, chief financial officer, who was brought in earlier this year to improve cash collection. Alan Bates, chairman, said Ward's resignation was ""in the company's best long-term interests"". Ward's executive record had been mired during a year the company dubbed ""the most difficult year in the history of telecoms"". Full-year pre-tax losses ballooned to GBP35m in 2001 compared with GBP10.5m the previous year, while Orchestream's market capitalisation dwindled to GBP9.2m, compared to GBP873m at its height in 2000. Jonathan Loades-Carter Merrill Lynch creates new post James Quigley has been named senior vice-president of global client strategies at Merrill Lynch, a new position reflecting an emerging sales approach on Wall Street. The state-of-the-art sales pitch is based on offering a variety of solutions to business problems rather than a particular product. The focus is meant to cement relationships so banks can do more business with large clients over the long run. It favours bigger firms such as Merrill which can offer a variety of products. In his new client role, Quigley, 42, will report to the co-heads of the global markets and investment banking group, Arshad Zakaria and Paul Roy. He will also become the sixth member of the office of the chairman and president of Merrill Lynch International, the holding company for international businesses, a spokeswoman said.

Before Tuesday's rate decision, there had been some speculation the Fed might signal a shift toward raising rates. Instead, the FOMC sent a signal about its concerns over low growth, maintaining its assertion that the ""balance of risks"" facing the US remained evenly divided between economic weakness and higher inflation. The decision shows the US central bank finds it necessary to sustain aid to an economy still struggling to recuperate from last year's recession and the investment decline of the past two years. It also comes amid renewed doubts about America's economic recovery. Recent economic data have been inconclusive while financial reports, particularly among technology companies, have remained generally dismal, dragging down stock prices to six-month lows. The Nasdaq Composite over the past month has sunk to levels not seen since right after the September 11 terrorist attacks. The consensus is that monetary policy remains ""accommodative"", acting as adrenaline for a weakened economy. The question remains as to how long monetary policy can be used as a stimulus before the Fed risks an inflation problem. Alan Greenspan, Fed chairman, recently suggested it would take ""two to four months"" for the Fed to have enough confidence about the economy's direction to make a pre-emptive policy change and, presumably, reverse course. Futures markets have registered expectations for the Fed to end its anti-recession campaign and begin returning short-term rates to ""normal"" levels no sooner than September. A surge in inflation risks could disrupt this timetable. The Fed's hope is that it will not face such a possibility before the economy is back on a solid growth path. Inflation appears under control in spite of last year's dramatic monetary easing. Inflation has generally slowed, according to most measures, from around 3.5 per cent to roughly 1 per cent. A key influence will be the staying power of the nation's ""productivity miracle"". Figures released on Tuesday suggest it remains intact as companies continue to cut costs and the economy continues to produce more with less. The US labour department on Tuesday said output per work-hour, outside of agriculture, rose at its fastest pace in nearly two decades through the first quarter. Higher productivity growth blunts the effect of rising costs on prices. The first-quarter productivity surge led to the biggest drop in labour costs per unit of output in 18 years. However, the persistence of the slump in investment in labour-saving technologies and the pickup in government spending have raised doubts about how long the spurt in productivity will last. Inflation jitters have intensified over the past month. One measure closely watched by the Fed, the difference between yields on Treasury and inflation-indexed Treasury bonds (TIPS), has widened to a two-year high. "
253,2002-05-07,2002-05-08,Financial Times (FT.Com),Fed dispenses medicine to a still-sick economy.,"The Federal Reserve said inflation remained under control and signalled that short-term interest rates would stay at 40-year lows to help an economy still struggling to recuperate from last year's recession and the colossal investment bust of the past two years. What the US central bank did not say was that economic data have been increasingly mixed and financial news dismal, dragging down stock prices to six-month lows. The Nasdaq stock index, barometer of what is left of the ""new economy"", has over the past month sunk to levels not seen since the wake of the September 11 terror attacks. America's economic recovery is, once again, in serious doubt, with inflation brewing as a potential problem over the coming year. The Fed's worst nightmare remains the prospect of a race between inflation and recovery - the possibility it will be forced into a Hobbesian decision to tighten the noose on money and credit to suppress inflation before clear signs emerge of a genuine recovery. That dilemma would leave its chairman Alan Greenspan - widely thought to be on his way towards a triumphant retirement - with an important, final challenge: navigating between the dual threats of renewed economic weakness and inflation. The Fed's policymaking open market committee (FOMC) decided on Tuesday to leave short-term interest rates at a low of 1.75 per cent, where they have been since November. The general consensus is that monetary policy remains ""accommodative"" - in other words, adrenalin for a still-sick economy. The big question is how long it can remain so before risking an inflation problem. Mr Greenspan recently suggested it would take ""two to four months"" for the Fed to have enough confidence about the economy's direction to make a pre-emptive policy change and, presumably, reverse course. Futures markets have registered expectations the Fed will end its anti-recession campaign and begin returning short-term rates to ""normal"" levels no sooner than September. A surge in inflation risks could wreck this timetable. To the Fed's relief, inflation appears under control despite last year's dramatic monetary easing. According to the consumer price index, the 12-month trailing rate of inflation has slowed sharply in the past year from 3.5 per cent to just above 1 per cent. The implicit GDP deflator and deflator on personal consumption expenditures - considered better measures by Mr Greenspan - suggest inflation has slid below 1 per cent. While some prices - mainly for oil, gasoline and services such as housing, medical care and education - have surged and prices overall have stabilised, inflation appears generally subdued. However, economic indicators are backward-looking. The issue for the Fed is where inflation is heading from here and where markets expect it to go. A key determinant is the nation's productivity miracle. Figures released Tuesday suggest it remains intact as companies continue to cut costs and the economy keeps producing more with less. But the persistence of the slump in stock prices and in investment in labour-saving technologies, and the pick-up in government spending, have raised doubts about how long the productivity surge will last. Mr Greenspan said last month he did not expect high figures indefinitely: ""The world just doesn't work that well."" One measure closely watched by the Fed, the difference between yields on Treasury and inflation-indexed Treasury bonds (Tips), has grown to a two-year high. Gold dollar prices have jumped and the dollar itself has slid recently - possible preliminary signs of weakening foreign demand for, and an inflationary oversupply of, US currency. Two prominent economic watchdogs have sent warnings. In its latest quarterly industry survey, the National Association of Business Economics, the largest group of corporate economists, said inflation pressures ""were developing"", evinced by ""widely reported"" price increases in services and raw materials. The Institute for Supply Management said purchasing managers were reporting strong growth in costs, with service-sector executives reporting that their costs ""had increased at the fastest rate in 11 months"". A sign of the emerging confusion and policy tensions was an extraordinarily public confrontation last month between a current and a former member of the FOMC at the April 25 annual economic conference of the Levy Economic Institute. Gary Stern, president of the Minneapolis Federal Reserve, said that amid the unusual uncertainty, Fed policy action ""should be modest and infrequent"" to ""avoid destabilising the economy"". That prompted a stern warning from Laurence Meyer, an economist and former FOMC member, about the danger of being ""reactive"" and complacent on inflation - a possible omen of future divisions that are likely to widen if the ""productivity miracle"" falters and the economy does not recover quickly.

255,1996-08-20,1996-08-21,Financial Times,US STOCKS EDGE UP AFTER RATE MEETING.,"AMERICA: Wall Street The Dow Jones Industrial Average continued to edge ahead yesterday in very light trading after the Federal Reserve's policy-making committee left US interest rates unchanged, writes Richard Waters. Wall Street had already come to the view that the Federal Open Market Committee would elect not to raise rates, but yesterday's news still lent support to the more interest-rate sensitive stocks among the Dow's 30 constituents. The index of leading stocks continued where it had left off on Monday, a day which had seen the second-lowest trading volume of the year so far. By the end of the day, the Dow was at 5,721.26, up 21.86 from the previous close. That brought its total gains in the past five sessions to more than 70 points. The broader Standard &Poor's 500, meanwhile, lost ground, falling back 0.89 to 665.69, while the Nadsaq composite eased 6.24 to 1,124.67. The Dow's advance was driven largely by gains among companies whose earnings are most directly tied to the economic cycle, reflecting a belief that interest rates are unlikely to rise until late in the year, if then. Among the biggest movers, Alcoa rose $1 3/8 to $63 1/8, a rise of 2.2%, while Caterpillar was up $1, or 1.4%, at $71 3/8 and Du Pont rose $1 5/8 to $83 5/8. AT&T, which had been the biggest decliner among the 30 shares in the Dow index on Monday, recovered some of its lost ground, adding $1/8 to $54 1/4. That repaired some of the damage done by the departure of its highly regarded president, Mr Alex Mandl, who has left to join Associated Communications, a new wireless telecommunications company. Shares in Associated Group, that company's main shareholder, advanced further yesterday, adding another $2 to $32 1/4 after the $4 3/4 gain on Monday. AT&T's shares remain some 10% below their level of early July, when the company reported disappointing second quarter earnings. Another Dow stock to record solid gains was Philip Morris, which registered a further partial rebound from the sharp drop precipitated by an adverse court ruling 12 days ago. The company rose $1 5/8, or 1.8%, to $91 1/2. The Nasdaq slipped on a fall among some of the biggest stocks traded on the market, among them Intel, which slipped $1 1/4 to $79 1/2 and Cisco Sytems, which fell $1 to $55.

256,1996-08-20,1996-08-21,Financial Times,COVENTRY BUILDING SOCIETY MAKES A RARE APPEARANCE.,"Activity in the eurobond market was dampened yesterday by the ongoing meeting of the US Federal Reserve's Open Market Committee and jitters ahead of tomorrow's Bundesbank council meeting. The summer lull also continues to weigh on the market, but dealers said US dollar issuance might resume once the FOMC meeting was over - provided it bore no nasty surprises. ""Given the success of the World Bank's and Canada's issues, I think there's room for more 10-year paper,"" said one. Kansai International Airport is thought to be planning a transaction, with dealers expecting $200m of 10-year bonds via IBJ, with a yield spread rumoured to be in the high 20s. Among the sparse new offerings, Coventry Building Society made a rare appearance in the sterling sector with #100m of five-year floating-rate notes. It replaces a #100m issue which was called yesterday, making it the only outstanding Coventry deal in the market. Lead manager HSBC Markets said Coventry last year jointly topped UBS's annual survey of UK building societies with the Halifax Building Society. Moreover, the offering followed Monday's announcement of well-received interim results, it said. The bonds are rated single-A by IBCA, the European rating agency. HSBC said a sizeable part of the issue was placed away from traditional UK building-society accounts and reported buying by overseas banks, UK corporations and institutions. Other offerings were very much aimed at retail investors in continental Europe. In the D-Mark sector, triple-A rated Nederlandse Gasunie issued DM 200m of five-year bonds, yielding 17 basis points over German government notes, via Rabobank and SBC Warburg. ""Dutch credits are particularly popular in Switzerland,"" a syndicate official said. Another retail-targeted transaction was a NZ$100m issue for Commerzbank - the German bank's first appearance in the New Zealand dollar sector. Pricing of the bonds at five basis points over New Zealand government debt at the offer price compares favourably with a short-dated issue launched on Monday for the Province of Manitoba at a 6 basis point spread, lead manager Hambros Bank said. Commerzbank is rated Aa2/AA-and Manitoba A1/A+. South Africa's Department of Finance has appointed Merrill Lynch as lead manager of its forthcoming Yankee bond issue - its first foray into the US domestic bond market. Market conditions would determine the terms and timing of the deal, the department said. Market talk has been of $250m to $300m of 10-year bonds. Copyright Financial Times Limited 1996.

257,1996-08-20,1996-08-21,Financial Times,TREASURIES LITTLE CHANGED AS FED HOLDS RATES.,"US Treasury bond prices ended yesterday virtually unchanged on the day after the Federal Reserve's Open Market Committee decided, as expected, to leave US interest rates unchanged. The benchmark 30-year bond first rose by 1/8 on publication of June trade figures and then fell back by 1/4 on news early in the afternoon of the FOMC's decision. By the end of the day, the long bond had returned to where it started in light trading, with the price at 99 3/8 and the yield at 6.794%. The outcome of the FOMC meeting, though widely predicted, brought some relief after caution had set in early in the day, leading to some profit-taking among holders of longer-dated securities. Earlier, the trade figures had showed a deficit for June of $8.1bn, below the $9.6bn that had been forecast and an outcome that underpinned the dollar. That gave a modest, though short-lived, boost to the fixed income markets. Shorter-dated securities were also largely unchanged after the FOMC meeting, with the two-year Treasury note standing at 100 9/16, a rise of 1/32 on the day, to yield 5.937%. * Italian bonds showed the worst performance among European markets for the second consecutive day, as political uncertainty rose. Liffe's September BTP future closed at 115.71, down 0.17, but fell to a low of 115.37 in trading after the exchange's official close. In the cash market the 10-year BTP yield spread over bunds widened by 3 basis points to 329 points. In addition to the ongoing budget-related uncertainty, BTPs suffered when the reformed communist party voiced its opposition to the sale of Stet, the state-owned telecommunications group, and threatened to withdraw its support from the coalition government. The economic environment, although more favourable, failed to support bonds. Wholesale and producer price indices were below market expectations, reinforcing ""the view that the headline inflation rate will fall in August"", according to economists at Bear Stearns, who now expect consumer price inflation to show a headline rate of 3.4% for August, down from 3.6% in July. The Bank of Italy hinted earlier this summer that it would cut official interest rates again when the inflation rate approached 3%. * UK gilts ended a quiet day slightly lower, as uncertainty over the outcome of the FOMC meeting weighed on market sentiment. Liffe's September long gilt future settled at 108, down 1/8. Traders largely ignored the release of mildly bullish money supply data. The M4 monetary aggregate rose by only 0.4% in July, bringing the year-on-year rate of growth down to 8.8%, below its official monitoring range for the first time in 10 months. The Bank of England yesterday announced the details of the August 28 gilt auction. A total of #2.5bn of 7 1/2% treasury stock due 2006 will be tendered. * German bunds weakened slightly, in spite of the release of encouraging money supply data. Liffe's September bund future closed at 98.05, down 0.03. The Bundesbank announced that M3 money supply had fallen in July to an annual growth rate of 8.6%, in line with market expectations. Hopes of a cut in the repo rate tomorrow were intact, with analysts predicting a 10 basis point easing, to 3.20%. ""The data do not increase the chances of a cut"", one trader said. ""But they do not rule them out either."" Although an easing is widely believed to be already priced into bunds, it could ""help put the convergence process [of the high-yielding markets] back on the tracks"", one trader said. Economists at UBS in Frankfurt, however, warn that ""a repo cut is not a safe bet and there is certainly a risk that the Bundesbank might disappoint the market again"". * The weakness of the rand continued to drive activity on the South African market yesterday. Bonds mirrored the state of the currency, which ended a quiet day weaker after the battering it took in New York on Monday following publication of a report which claimed that it was over-valued. Dealers said the bond market had been fairly stable, ""apart from some short-covering"" by local traders in the morning and ""a bit of institutional nibbling at higher levels"". After trading in a range between 15.655% and 15.710%, the yield on the key R150 stock was last pegged at 15.665%, up from 15.565% late on Monday. Copyright Financial Times Limited 1996.

Although most Wall Street economists had dismissed the chance of an interest rate increase at the meeting, the fixed income and equity markets generally marked time The index of leading stocks continued where it had left off on Monday, a day which had seen the second-lowest trading volume of the year. By lunchtime it was at 5,713.49, up 14.05. The broader Standard &Poor's 500 was up only 0.09 at 666.67, while the Nadsaq composite eased 3.27 to 1,127.64. The Dow's advance during the morning was driven largely by gains among companies whose earnings are most directly tied to the economic cycle. That reflected the general belief that US short-term interest rates will remain unchanged, at least until after November's presidential election. Among the biggest movers, Alcoa rose $1 1/8 to $62 7/8, while Caterpillar $7/8 to $71 1/4 and Du Pont $1 1/8 to $83 1/8. AT&T, which had been the biggest decliner in the Dow on Monday, recovered some of its lost ground, adding $1/4 to $54 3/8. That repaired some of the damage done by the departure of its highly regarded president, Mr Alex Mandl, who left to join Associated Communications, a new wireless telecommunications company. Associated Group, that company's main shareholder, rose $2 3/8 more to $32 5/8 after the $4 3/4 gain on Monday. AT&T's shares remain some 10% below their level of early July, when the company reported disappointing second quarter earnings. The general mood of optimism about interest rates contributed to a good morning for bank stocks. Chase Manhattan rose $3/4 to $77 5/8, a new high, while First Bank System was $7/8 higher at $63 3/4. Wells Fargo rose another $2 1/8 to $256 5/8. Another group to record solid gains were the tobacco stocks, which showed a further partial rebound from the sharp drops precipitated by an adverse court ruling 12 days ago. Philip Morris rose $1 3/8, to $91 1/4, and RJR Nabisco $1/2 to $27 1/4. Copyright Financial Times Limited 1996. All Rights Reserved. "
259,1996-08-20,1996-08-21,Financial Times,TRADE FIGURE SURPRISE BOOSTS US DOLLAR.,"MARKETS REPORT: An unexpectedly sharp fall in the US trade deficit helped push the dollar higher against the Japanese yen, when most attention was focused on money supply data and interest rate decisions. Coming ahead of yesterday's Federal Open Market Committee meeting in Washington yesterday, the deficit data finally took the dollar over Y 108, after being range-bound in recent weeks. At the close of trading in London, the dollar was at Y 108.330, from Y 107.950 the previous day. But the dollar was muted against European currencies, ending against the D-Mark at DM 1.4893, from DM 1.4882. Against sterling it was worth $1.5472, from $1.5455. The slight D-Mark weakness came after the announcement of long-awaited German money supply figures. The decline in M3 growth was accurately anticipated by the markets, after comments earlier this month by Mr Otmar Issing, the Bundesbank's chief economist, that it would fall. In Australia, the new conservative government's first budget proved to be a disappointment for those expecting large spending cuts. Mr Peter Costello, the federal treasurer, held out hopes of interest rate cuts to come, and the Australian dollar fell against the US dollar in London, ending at A$1.2718, from A$1.2658. * The only game in town continues to be Bundesbank-watching - at least for the next 24 hours. European cross trades continued to be dominated by expectations of a cut in the repurchase rate or a move by the bank to a variable repurchase rate sooner or later. Germany's July M3 growth fell to 8.6% year-on-year, from 9.6% in the previous month. The M3 fall may herald a cut by the Bundesbank in its repo rate at its central council meeting tomorrow. But rumours circulated in the markets that today's Ifo German business sentiment survey would be very strong. That, if true, would reduce the chances of a rate cut tomorrow. Some areas of the market appear to have already discounted a relatively big rate cut. But Ms Alison Cottrell, international economist at Paine Webber in London, warns that those expectations risk disappointment. She is expecting a cut of only 5 basis points, after the bank's success in talking the D-Mark down in recent months. ""They've exhausted their barking potential, and now they've got to have some bite,"" she said. The bank could also include a switch to a variable repo rate within the next week or two. Ms Cottrell said the Bundesbank would also be looking to help France after its recent currency travails, not for political reasons but because economic recovery in both countries is vulnerable. * The US trade deficit in goods and services declined to $8.11bn, from a revised $10.55bn gap in May. Analysts had expected a $9.4bn deficit in June. Mr Larry Hatheway, senior currency economist at UBS in London, said that the US trade data was the final confirmation that the Federal Reserve had no need to raise interest rates. ""It's a further sign that the economy is not as robust as was thought two or three months ago,"" he said. * The Australian government's budget turned out to be a victim of its own success, as analysts pronounced disappointment with the final deficit figure of A$5.65bn and a headline surplus of A$474m for 1996/97. The disappointment followed speculation of harsher spending cuts, to get the deficit below A$5bn. Mr Peter Costello, the treasurer, said he would like an interest rate cut by the end of 1996. ""I'd like that to be an outcome and I am going to do the best to make sure we are going to get it,"" he said. Mr Costello said a rate cut was possible when the budget was passed by the Senate, the Australian parliament's upper house. That puts pressure on opposition parties in the Senate not to block the new measures. Copyright Financial Times Limited 1996. All Rights Reserved. "

The FOMC, which includes the seven Fed governors in Washington and the presidents of five of the 12 regional Feds, also left rates unchanged at its last meeting on July 3. The last policy move by the central bank was to lower the discount rate to 5% from 5.25% and the Fed funds rate to 5.25% from 5.5% on January 31.

265,2006-09-20,2006-09-21,Financial Times,Fed's hold on rates helps stocks higher GLOBAL OVERVIEW.,"The S&P 500 index, the US stock market benchmark, reached a 5 1/2-year high yesterday as the US Federal Reserve maintained its current pause in adjusting interest rates. Any nerves about broader fallout of political turmoil in Thailand and Hungary or large losses suffered by US hedge fund group Amaranth faded quickly with investors in a mostly positive mood over the outcome of the US Federal Reserve's meeting on rate policy. Wall Street sentiment was also lifted by a fall in US oil prices to briefly below the level at which they started the year and strong quarterly earnings from Morgan Stanley and Oracle. The Federal Open Market Committee kept its benchmark Fed funds rate unchanged at 5.25 per cent as expected. All 109 economists polled by Bloomberg beforehand had expected the central bank to do so. The statement accompanying the decision also did not contain any great surprises either with few changes from the August meeting statement. The Fed said the moderation in economic growth appeared to be continuing, partly reflecting a cooling of the housing market. However, it removed the word ""gradual"" from the August statement's description of that cooling. The Federal Open Market Committee added that readings of core inflation had been elevated, and high levels of resource utilisation and commodity prices had the potential to sustain inflation pressures. However, it said inflation pressures seemed likely to moderate over time, reflecting ""reduced impetus"" from energy prices and otherfactors. The statement appeared to slightly disappoint those betting on a more dovish statement. Treasuries and equities pared early gains. The S&P 500 index rose to an intra-day peak of 1,328, its highest level since February 12, 2001. It later slipped back to 1,327.16 by mid-afternoon, making a 0.7 per cent gain. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.6 per cent while the Nasdaq Composite firmed up 1.4 per cent. West Texas Intermediate crude fell below the Dollars 61.04 a barrel level at which it ended 2005. It settled Dollars 1.20 a barrel down at Dollars 60.46. Investors largely shrugged off the Thai and Hungarian tumults. The Thai stock market was closed and the baht was flat against the dollar. The Hungarian forint weakened but bounced off day lows to trade 0.3 per cent lower against the euro. The Budapest stock market fell 2.2 per cent. "

The Federal Open Market Committee kept its benchmark Fed funds rate unchanged at 5.25 per cent as expected. All 109 economists polled by Bloomberg beforehand had expected the central bank to do so. The statement accompanying the decision did not contain any great surprises either, with few changes from the August meeting statement. The Fed said the moderation in economic growth appeared to be continuing, partly reflecting a cooling of the housing market. However, it removed the word ""gradual"" from the August statement's description of that cooling. The FOMC added that readings of core inflation had been elevated, and that the high levels of resource utilisation and of the prices of energy and other commodities had the potential to sustain inflation pressures. However, it said inflation pressures seemed likely to moderate over time, reflecting ""reduced impetus"" from energy prices, contained inflation expectations, and the cumulative effects of monetary policy actions. The statement appeared to slightly disappoint those betting on a more explicitly dovish statement. Treasuries and equities pared early gains while the dollar rallied a little. By mid-afternoon, the S&P 500 was up 0.7 per cent at 1,327.16, its highest level since February 2001. The Nasdaq Composite was up 1.4 per cent, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average added 0.6 per cent. The rises came as oil prices fell further. West Texas Intermediate crude fell below the Dollars 61.04 a barrel at which it ended 2005, but by midday US time was trading at Dollars 61.25, down 41 cents. Michael Thompson, global managing director of research at Thomson Financial, said the market was finally starting to recognise the fact that the US was approaching its 13th consecutive quarter of double-digit earnings growth. Consensus forecasts compiled by Thomson Financial indicate 14.2 per cent earnings growth for the S&P 500 constituents in the third-quarter. Mr Thompson said current estimates indicated companies would maintain this double-digit pace through the first quarter next year - the longest run in more than 50 years. The Thai stock market was closed, and the bahtwas largely flat against the dollar. The Hungarian forint weakened but bounced off day lows to trade 0.3 per cent lower against the euro. The Budapest stockmarket benchmark, the BUX index, eased 2.2 per cent. The Hungarian events did not appear to have a great impact on investor risk appetite. The Vix index, the measure of market volatility that is sometimes called the investor ""fear gauge"", fell 4.17 per cent to 11.48. The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury fell 1.4bp to 4.7248 per cent. "
267,2006-09-20,2006-09-21,Financial Times (FT.Com),FT.com site : Market Overview: Dollar declines on US rate outlook.,"Heightened expectations that the next move for US interest rates would be downwards had only a limited impact on world equity markets on Thursday but sent the dollar and US Treasury yields lower. The Federal Reserve's Open Market Committee left interest rates unchanged at 5.25 per cent for a second successive month on Wednesday, as expected, but reiterated that it felt some inflation risks remained. But David Hensley, director of global economics at JPMorgan, suggested that the sharp recent fall in oil prices meant headline inflation ""would slow to a crawl"" in the fourth quarter. The consequent boost to household real incomes would support consumer spending while the economy absorbed the brunt of the housing slowdown, he added. ""This backdrop gives the FOMC ample room to stay on hold despite the continued breach of its 1-2 per cent inflation comfort zone."" ING Financial Markets went further, saying it was so concerned about the impact of the housing market slowdown on consumer sentiment and spending growth that it believed US rates would be cut to 4.25 per cent by the end of the first half of next year. ""A combination of weaker demand and lower energy prices suggests inflation could fall quickly in the first half of next year, offering the Fed scope to act promptly and aggressively to offset the potential for a more severe economic downturn,"" said James Knightley, economist. By midday in New York, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was flat, although the Nasdaq Composite index was 0.2 per cent higher. The S&P 500, which touched a 5l-year high on Wednesday, was up 0.1 per cent. Wall Street's muted showing took some of the shine off an early advance for European stocks, although continued merger and acquisition activity provided support and the FTSE Eurofirst 300 index ended 0.4 per cent higher at a four-month peak. Serono leapt more than 17 per cent after Germany's Merck launched a surprise bid for the Swiss drugs group, while Spanish property group Metrovacesa jumped nearly 16 per cent as a bid battle for the company intensified. Meanwhile, the dollar fell below the Y117 level and also eased back against the euro, while Treasury bond prices extended the previous day's moderate gains. Emerging markets remained in focus following the military coup in Thailand and political unrest in Hungary this week. ""These events are in themselves unlikely to be big market movers in the global emerging markets,"" said Lars Christensen at Danske Bank. ""However, they are nonetheless adding to risk aversion among international investors."" In Bangkok, the benchmark SET index initially tumbled 4 per cent but subsequently recovered to close just 1.4 per cent lower. The week's events unsettled Turkish investors, and the ISE 100 index fell 1.3 per cent. The RTS index in Moscow was also off 1.3 per cent. But Brazilian stocks, which fell nearly 2 per cent on Wednesday, were down 1 per cent at midday on Thursday amid political uncertainty. The Bux index in Budapest shed another 1.8 per cent, taking its fall since the start of the week to 5.1 per cent. Oil prices rallied off Wednesday's six-month lows, with the benchmark US crude future hovering around the $61 a barrel mark. However, this is more than 20 per cent down from the record high of $78.40 a barrel struck in July and several analysts suggested prices would soon fall below $60 a barrel. "
268,2006-09-20,2006-09-21,Financial Times (FT.Com),FT.com site : US dollar dips on dovish Fed statement.,"The US dollar slipped in European morning trade on Thursday as the market digested a modestly dovish monetary policy statement from the Federal Open Market Committee. As pretty much everyone expected, the Fed kept US interest rates on hold at 5.25 per cent. However the accompanying statement was a little softer than some had expected, with the Fed noting a ""cooling"" in the housing market, rather than the ""gradual cooling"" seen in the previous statement, as well as highlighting the ""reduced impetus from energy prices"" on inflation. ""The inclusion of falling energy prices as a downside risk to inflation as opposed to an upside risk to growth is something of an unexpectedly dovish tilt, albeit a minor one,"" said Steve Pearson, chief currency strategist at HBOS. Hans Redeker, head of currency strategy at BNP Paribas, said ""the more than 20 per cent drop in oil prices since early August should quell the Fed's fears of upside risks to inflation,"" arguing that the Fed could be forced to cut interest rates as soon as ""end 2006"" as the data ""begin to point to a quicker than expected slowdown"". However most saw the statement as only modestly dovish, with one member, Jeffrey Lacker, once again voting for a rate rise. As the result the dollar drifted just 0.5c to $1.2732 against the euro, Y0.55 to Y116.86 against the yen, 1.05c to $1.8982 against sterling and 0.5c to C$1.1233 against the Canadian dollar. Elsewhere the New Zealand dollar weakened after the island nation's already vast current account deficit widened still further than expected, and Michael Cullen, the finance minister, made another attempt to talk the kiwi lower. New Zealand's deficit rose to NZ$3.08bn in the second quarter, taking the annual deficit to 9.7 per cent of GDP, the worst level since 1975. Mr Cullen commented that: ""looking at the size of the current account deficit, there have still got to be significant downside risks on the New Zealand dollar and both the Reserve Bank and the government want to signal that fact quite clearly."" The kiwi slipped against the weakening greenback, being marked down 0.1c to $0.6593. The Thai baht recovered 0.7 per cent to Bt37.415 to the US dollar as tensions over the recent coup were soothed to some degree by an announcement that King Bhumibol had issued a royal order backing General Sonthi Boonyaratkalin, the army commander-in-chief leading the coup. However the Hungarian forint dipped a further 0.3 per cent to Ft275.38 to the euro following a third night of clashes between police and protesters calling for the resignation of prime minister Ferenc Gyurcsany. "
269,2004-03-16,2004-03-17,Financial Times,Federal Reserve keeps interest rates on hold.,"The Federal Reserve yesterday left interest rates on hold and kept its accompanying statement almost unchanged, a sign that the Federal funds rate is likely to remain at 1 per cent for several months to come. In the only significant change, the Fed's open market committee said that ""although job losses have slowed, new hiring has lagged"". Following its January meeting the committee said: ""Although hiring remains subdued, other indicators suggest an improvement in the labour market"". The slight downgrading of the Fed's assessment of labour market conditions follows February's disappointing employment report, which showed that the US economy added just 21,000 new jobs last month. The committee reiterated that with inflation quite low and resource use slack, it believed it could be ""patient in removing its policy accommodation"". Investors had expected no change in interest rates and few economists had expected a change in the language of the committee's statement, other than a tweak to employment assessment. Immediately following the meeting the yield on the 10-year Treasury note fell six basis points to 3.71 per cent. While employment conditions remain weak, economists expect the Fed rate to remain on hold. Following the February employment report, the yield on 10-year Treasury notes had dropped from above 4 per cent to below 3.8 per cent at present. Federal Reserve officials have indicated that the risk of the US economy slipping into deflation is no longer seen as a serious threat. However, the committee maintained its judgment that the probability of an unwelcome fall in inflation has diminished and appears ""almost equal"" to that of a rise in inflation. It also maintained the judgment that the risks to attaining sustainable growth over the next few quarters are ""roughly equal"". In the other change, the FOMC said the data since its last meeting ""indicate that output is continuing to expand at a solid pace"". Fed officials believe its commitment to be patient has helped hold down long-term interest rates, without tying the committee's hands as might have been the case with its previous formulation that policy accommodation can be maintained for a ""considerable period"". Investors saw the FOMC as inching closer to the start of the tightening cycle when it dropped the considerable period language at its last meeting, and said in December that the risks that the US could slip into deflation had diminished. The economic data have changed little since the Fed's last meeting, with healthy growth in consumer spending and business investment. Industrial output growth was stronger than expected last month, helped partly by the weak dollar. The labour market still disappoints. The Federal Reserve first referred to policy being ""accommodative"" at the start of 2002, when the Fed funds rate was at 1.75 per cent. "
270,2007-03-21,2007-03-22,Financial Times,THE SHORT VIEW MARKET COMMENT BY JOHN AUTHERS.,"Cub journalists are taught that ""burying the lead"" is a cardinal sin. The most important news in a story must be in the first sentence, not buried at the bottom. The market response to yesterday's communique from the Federal Reserve's open market committee was that chairman Ben Bernanke had done exactly that. Had he?  On the surface, the statement - more important than the decision to keep the Fed Funds rate at 5.25 per cent, which was expected - is hawkish. Core inflation was ""somewhat elevated"" (in January, readings had ""improved modestly""). Inflation is now the FOMC's ""predominant concern"" (whereas in January it merely said ""some inflation risks remain""). That was balanced by the removal of January's reference to ""somewhat firmer economic growth"" - but there was nothing to signal an imminent rate cut.  Then came an innocuous final sentence: ""Future policy adjustments will depend on the evolution of the outlook for both inflation and economic growth."" That is anodyne.After all, the Fed's remit isto limit inflation and foster employment. But previously, the Fed had referred to ""additional firming"" not the neutral ""policy adjustments"".  The market read this as removing the Fed's officialbias towards tightening, and therefore a signal that a rate cut is coming.  The dollar collapsed to two-year lows against the euro; bond yields shot downwards; and US stock indices rallied by about 2 per cent. Continuing the journalistic analogy: the invisible hand of the market acted like that of a good sub-editor and crossed out everything before the critical final sentence that no longer talked of additional firming. It also added a glaring headline: ""Rates are coming down"".  Bernanke may have been trying subtly to make room for manoeuvre - in case the debacle in subprime lending requires sharp easing - while maintaining in his inflation rhetoric an implicit bias towards tightening.  He probably did not wanta market response that would effectively ease monetary conditions. But markets arenot so subtle.  "
271,2007-03-21,2007-03-22,Financial Times,Decision by Fed on rates has tonic effect GLOBAL OVERVIEW.,"US equities and Treasury bonds raced higher and the dollar retreated after the Federal Reserve kept interest rates unchanged but removed a reference to ""additional firming"" in its post-FOMC meeting statement.  ""The Fed has not shifted toward balanced risks but it has taken one solid step away from a clear bias to tighten,"" said Alan Ruskin, chief international strategist at RBS Greenwich CapitalGreenwich Capital Markets. In mid-afternoon trade in New York, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up1.1 per cent while the Nasdaq Composite and the S&P 500 were up 1.4 per cent.  The yield on the 10-year Treasury bond was down 3.6 basis points while the dollar fell 0.4 per cent to Dollars 1.3370 against the euro.  But Rob Carnell, at ING, cautioned markets may be getting carried away. ""Whilst the amendment of the text on additional policy adjustments does perhaps take the Fed to a more neutral setting, the fact that inflation remains a problem means that we should not be rushing to forecast a bout of imminent rate cuts,"" he said.  The mood in equity markets was fairly positive even before the Fed published its statement. In Europe, the FTSE Eurofirst 300 index rose 0.3 per cent amid continued optimism about the outlook for bid and merger activity.  Asian stocks were also broadly higher, despite the closure of Japanese markets for a public holiday.  Shanghai attained a record high, less than a month after the market's 9 per cent slide helped trigger a wave of market turmoil.  Hong Kong managed a 0.8 per cent rise and Mumbai increased by 2 per cent.  Kevin Gardiner, global head of equity strategy at HSBC, believed market nerves about corporate earnings growth and the unwinding of carry trades - where investors sell low-yielding currencies to fund positions in higher-yielding assets - were overblown.  ""We see equities more than recouping their recent losses and hitting new cycle highs by year-end,"" he said. ""We do worry about valuations in parts of the emerging market bloc and about short-term leverage across trading desks. But as equity strategists, we can't get exercised about the carry trade and we think that slower US earnings growth is effectively in the price.""  Bernd Meyer, at Deutsche Bank, noted recent equity market volatility had not spilled over to analysts' earnings estimates.  The FTSE 100 index in London attained a three-week high point.  "
272,2007-03-21,2007-03-22,Financial Times (FT.Com),FT.com site : Opinion divided on rate message.,"Economists and interest rate strategists were divided on Thursday over whether the changes in Wednesday's Federal Reserve Open Market policy statement had opened the door to rate cuts.  ""The FOMC statement was tweaked to provide a new message whose meaning will be debated for days, if not weeks,"" said Stephen Stanley, chief economist at RBS Greenwich Capital. Although the FOMC warned that inflation might ""fail to moderate as expected,"" policymakers said ""future policy adjustments will depend on the evolution of the outlook for both inflation and economic growth"".  This eliminated its previous reference to ""future tightenings"" and triggered a sharp rally on Wednesday afternoon in stocks and bonds, as traders speculated that the Fed had removed its official bias towards further tightening.  As attempts to analyse the Fed in more detail ensued, markets were more subdued on Thursday. The S&P 500 was flat after a 1.7 per cent surge on Wednesday. While bond prices were lower, the yield on the 10-year was at 4.59 per cent, above that of the two-year note's 4.57 per cent. The 10-year yield had been below the two-year yield since August of last year. Historically, when bond investors have believed the Fed would ease policy, the two-year yield has fallen below longer dated yields and resulted in a steeper yield curve.  ""The Fed's main concern is still inflation, but the new wording suggests an increased likelihood that their next move will be an easing rather than a tightening,"" said William O'Donnell, fixed income strategist at UBS.  Economists at Lehman Brothers emphasised the FOMC's concern over inflation. They said: ""Despite the small change in the boilerplate language, the remainder of the statement was either as hawkish as before or slightly more hawkish than expected. We do not view the change in language to 'future policy adjustments' as a set-up for near-term moves.""  Others said the statement had shown the FOMC was prepared to act should problems in the subprime mortgage market worsen and spill over.  Strategists at Credit Suisse said: ""Although the central bank said that its primary concern is over inflation, this change suggests that its reaction is, in fact, skewed to possible downside economic risks,"" and ""we see the re-steepening of the US curve and the weakening of the dollar as justified reactions.""  "
273,2001-01-31,2001-02-01,Financial Times (FT.Com),FTSE 100 draws little comfort from US rate cut.,"There was a feeling of anti-climax in London equities on Thursday after the US Federal Reserve's open market committee did exactly as the markets have been expecting for some time - cutting its Fed funds rate by another 50 basis points for the second time in a month. And the Fed went a step further, announcing too that the risks in the US economy ""are weighted to conditions that may generate economic weakness in the foreseeable future"", or ""in other words there are more rate cuts to come"", as one dealer put it. Wall Street's response to the news proved a disappointment, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average finishing a mere 6 points higher, while the Nasdaq Composite endured a much worse session, finishing 65 points lower. So it was always going to be extremely difficult for London to make progress against that background. The upshot of the trading session was another poor performance by the FTSE 100, which closed another 45.7 off at 6,251.8, having fallen 64.1 at worst. The FTSE SmallCap eased 7.0 to 3.319.8 and the Techmark 100 36.97 to 2,771.043. The FTSE 250 provided some respite, edging up 6.4 to 6,742.3. And tending to make the possibility of any progress by London stocks even more awkward was the latest raft of domestic economic data, all of which tended to surprise a market expecting evidence of a slowing of the UK economy. In the event, the news turned those expectations upside down. The latest monthly survey of UK house prices by the Nationwide revealed prices rose by 2.5 per cent in January, the biggest monthly gain since October 1994, while the UK purchasing managers' index of manufacturing for came in at 52.0, compared with last month's 51.3. And the Confederation of British Industry's January Survey of Distributive Trades said that retail sales were rising at their fastest rate since May last year. ""The market is telling us that 25 basis points will come off UK interest rates after next week's monetary policy committee meeting,"" said one trader. But Richard Jeffrey, economist at ING Barings Charterhouse Securities, said: ""When looking at the strength of recent UK data, particularly the CBI retail survey, you could be forgiven for asking the question whether rates should be going up rather than down."" Wall Street performed reasonably well, the Dow pushing up 43 points as London closed and the Nasdaq 14 points, in response to more worryingly weak US economic data. That showed the National Association of Purchasing Management's business activity index slipping to 41.2 from 44.3, its lowest level since March 1991. The market view, in the wake of those numbers, was that another reduction in US interest rates, possibly even before the next FOMC meeting, scheduled for March 20. Turnover in equities was 2.2bn shares. "
274,2001-01-31,2001-02-01,Financial Times (FT.Com),Bunds stronger as euro firms.,"Euro-denominated government bonds strengthened on Thursday, responding well to Wednesday's half percentage point interest rate cut by the US Federal Open Market Committee. A stronger euro - supported by the narrowing interest rate differential between the US and the euro-zone - also helped bunds. At 1100 GMT the benchmark 10-year German bund was up 0.17 at 103.62, pushing its yield down 2.2 basis points to 4.776 per cent. At the short end of the curve, the yield on the two-year German Schatz was 4.1 basis points lower at 4.341 per cent. The euro was $0.9430. The December long bund future was 0.16 higher at 109.03. "
275,2001-01-31,2001-02-01,Financial Times,CURRENCIES &MONEY - Dollar unmoved as Fed cuts rates.,"Foreign exchange traders gave a muted reaction to the decision by the Federal Reserve to cut rates by 50 basis points. But traders said the dollar could suffer over the coming sessions. ""There had been some suggestion that the Fed would boost the equity markets with a 75 basis point cut, now the focus will continue to be on the deteriorating economy,"" said Robert Lynch of BNP Paribas. The dollar had been under pressure for most of the day, depressed by the continued flow of poor economic figures from the US. Gross domestic product data showed the US economy growing at a puny annualised rate of 1.4 per cent in the fourth quarter - well below expectations of around 2 per cent. Most worrying perhaps was the sharp slowdown in investment spending by businesses. From a rise of 7.7 per cent in the third quarter, business investment fell by 1.5 per cent in the fourth - the sharpest slowdown since 1991. The Chicago manufacturing purchasing managers index also made fairly grim reading - falling to its lowest level since 1982. ""It is being made painfully apparent that the manufacturing sector is in a deep recession,"" said Russell Jones, head of currency research at Lehman Brothers. When added to Tuesday's poor consumer confidence figures, the GDP release caused some in the market to suggest the prospect of a 75 basis point cut in US interest rates. By middle of London trading, the Fed funds futures - seen as the best gauge of US rate expectations - were pricing in the risk of a 75 basis point fall. The euro ended London trading at $0.93, half a cent higher on the previous day. * But while the economic data continued to affect the interest rate futures markets the damage to the dollar was relatively contained. The euro managed to probe only modestly above $0.93 in early London trading. Analysts said this reflected the reluctance of investors to write off the US economy just yet. ""There are certainly few who want to take big bets ahead of the FOMC decision and there is always the risk that the non-farm payroll figures on Friday will disappoint,"" said Tony Norfield, head of currency research at ABN Amro in London. In addition traders said that the euro continued to labour under the weight of long positions. Many traders were quick to buy into the currency as it surged at the end of last year and are now reluctant to add to these positions. The latest IMM data from the Chicago Mercantile Exchange showed that these positions had been pared back. ""These should soon be cleared, allowing the euro to move higher,"" said Mr Norfield. ""But for the moment they continue to hold the euro back."" * With the Fed decision out of the way, one question uppermost on European traders' minds is likely to be whether the European Central Bank will follow suit. The bank holds its fortnightly monetary policy meeting today, but recent comments by ECB board members have suggested a reluctance to ease monetary policy. ""Our central view is that the refinancing rate will remain on hold at 4.75 per cent throughout 2001,"" said David Page at Investec in London. But he adds that this view hinges on ""a visible recovery"" in the US by the second half of 2001. ""Without this the slowdown in the global economy will be sharper this year, with the repercussions felt more strongly in the euro area, thus prompting the ECB to cut rates."" Yesterday's slew of euro-zone producer price inflation data all pointed to moderating price pressures. Italian producer price growth registered its first month-on-month decline in two years, with the annual rate slipping to 6.2 per cent from 6.7 per cent. Producer price inflation in France fell to 4.7 per cent from 5.9 per cent. "
276,2001-01-31,2001-02-01,Financial Times,WORLD STOCK MARKETS - Bargain hunters help Seoul make a strong recovery.,"A sharp rebound in Pohang Iron and Steel after Tuesday's tumble, and strong demand for brokerages, sent Seoul 4.5 per cent higher. The composite index closed with a gain of 26.57 at 617.91. Posco picked up 11.4 per cent to Won97,000 as bargain hunters moved in on the view that Tuesday's 12 per cent fall was overdone. Brokerages jumped 9.2 per cent as expectations grew for a sharp cut in US interest rates last night. Bankrupt Hanbo Steel was up its daily 15 per cent limit to Won2,700 aftger the state run Asset Management Corp said it would sell the company in parts to accelerate its disposal. Tokyo ended marginally higher in cautious trading as investors awaited US interest rate developments, writes Bayan Rahman. The benchmark Nikkei 225 average finished virtually all square, up 0.1 per cent at 13,843.55 after trading narrowly between 13,726.51 and 13,855.74. The capital-weighted Topix index added 1.69 at 1,300.23 and the Nikkei 300 0.28 at 263.53. S&P's Topix 150 improved 1.15 at 1,165.44. ""The market has been moving in a very tight range the past few days while people are waiting for the result of the FOMC meeting,"" said Koji Fujiwara at BNP Paribas. Mr Fujiwara said the market was supported by hopes that a government panel would this week recommend measures to underpin the stock market. But on the down side was the continued unwinding of cross-held shares. The securities sector extended Tuesday's decline, falling 2.6 per cent. Sector leader Nomura, which reports its earnings on Monday, fell Y85 or 3.8 per cent to Y2,160. Daiwa dropped Y7 to Y1,189 and Nikko dropped Y15 to Y848. Technology shares were mixed with the sector bellwether Sony down Y10 at Y8,450. Chip maker NEC rose Y50 to Y2,375 but Fujitsu fell Y14 to Y1,963 and NTT DoCoMo, the mobile phone company, dropped Y20,000 to Y2.24m. Jakarta put on 2.2 per cent as foreign investors returned to buy up mostly oversold blue chips. The composite index ended 9.29 higher at 425.61 as turnover picked up significantly. Taipei continued to push higher on strong demand for blue chips. Taiwan Semiconductor went limit up at TDollars 105.50 and the electronics sector gained 3.5 per cent. The weighted index finished 2.5 per cent ahead at 5,792.50. "

In a related action, the board of governors approved a 50 basis point reduction in the discount rate to 5 per cent. Consumer and business confidence has eroded further, exacerbated by rising energy costs that continue to drain consumer purchasing power and press on business profit margins. Partly as a consequence, retail sales and business spending on capital equipment have weakened appreciably. Manufacturing production has been cut back sharply, with new technologies appearing to have accelerated the response of production and demand to potential excesses in the stock of inventories and capital equipment. Taken together, and with inflation contained, these circumstances have called for a rapid and forceful response of monetary policy. The longer-term advances in technology and accompanying gains in productivity, however, exhibit few signs of abating and these gains, along with the lower interest rates should support growth of the economy over time. Nonetheless, the committee continues to believe that against the background of its long-run goals of price stability and sustainable economic growth and of the information available, the risks are weighted mainly toward conditions that may generate economic weakness in the future. The Federal Reserve board approved requests submitted by the boards of directors of the Federal Reserve banks of New York, Philadelphia, Cleveland, Atlanta, Chicago, St Louis, Minneapolis, Dallas and San Francisco."" http://federalreserve.gov/fomc.

278,2001-06-27,2001-06-28,Financial Times (FT.Com),Fed harboured private worries about US inflation.,"The Federal Reserve fretted over ""rising"" inflation risks during its interest rate-setting meeting in May, even while appearing to dismiss them publicly. Minutes of the May 15 meeting of the Fed's policymaking Open Market Committee, released on Thursday, say members believed the slowdown ""would hold down inflation"" but ""nonetheless, there were some risks of rising inflation"". At that meeting, one member, Thomas Hoenig, refused to vote with the majority decision to cut rates a half-point, urging a more modest quarter-point cut. Alan Greenspan, Fed chairman, strives to achieve consensus and is largely successful. Dissent on the FOMC is rare. The minutes raise the likelihood that Mr Greenspan faced disagreement at this week's FOMC meeting. It means Wednesday's decision to cut rates by a quarter-point might have marked the beginning of the end (if not the end) of the Fed's most dramatic monetary easing in at least 14 years. The May minutes show concern that - with US labour markets ""still tight by historical standards"" and falling productivity failing to suppress unit labour costs - an economic recovery might ""put added upward pressure on prices"". This echoes concerns expressed recently by Fed officials Laurence Meyer and Robert McTeer, concerns appearing to contradict Mr Greenspan. He has repeatedly played down inflation risks this year, suggesting the Fed, as a body, was not worried about it. In a recent speech in Singapore, he said ""inflation is not a significant problem"", but added, ""at the moment"". In later comments to the Senate Banking Committee, he said: ""We have to be very careful about any evidence of emerging inflationary instability."" To some, tensions were evident in the brevity of the FOMC's statement on Wednesday announcing its latest move.""It was very general, short and less forward-looking, suggesting serious disagreement on the outlook and risks,"" said Peter Hooper, chief US economist at Deutsche Bank. ""When you do have considerable disagreement, it's easier to agree on fewer words."" The Fed may have less reason to worry. Gauges of inflation expectations, such as the gold price and one of the Fed's internal measures of market inflation expectations (the difference between yields on Treasury bonds and inflation-indexed Treasury bonds, adjusting for differences in duration and liquidity) surged to 12-month highs in May. But both have fallen in the past month. The Treasuries market appeared to have a strong reaction to the FOMC minutes acknowledging inflation risks. The yield for the inflation-sensitive 10-year bond yield was up 5 basis points and ended the session up 10 basis points. "
279,2001-06-27,2001-06-28,Financial Times (FT.Com),Fed cuts rates in bid to head off recession.,"The US Federal Reserve on Wednesday cut short-term interest rates by a quarter of a percentage point, extending its six-month campaign to head off the threat of recession to a US economy it has called 'unacceptably weak'. The central bank's policymaking open market committee voted to cut its target for the federal funds rate from 4 per cent to 3.75 per cent, its lowest level since April 1994. It also cut by a 1/4 point its largely symbolic discount rate, to 3.25 per cent. Hopes for a half-point cut had been weakened by recent positive economic data but it still extended what many consider to be the central bank's most aggressive easing of money and credit in 14 years. The Fed has now reduced its interest rate target by 23/4 percentage points in six months to revive an economy it has called ""unacceptably weak"". Explaining its latest move, the Fed said weakness in profits and investment, slowing growth overseas and emerging weakness in consumer spending were weighing on the economy. It asserted, as it has all year, that long-term economic trends remained favourable. But for now, ""the risks are weighted mainly toward conditions that may generate economic weakness in the foreseeable future"", it said, affirming the possibility of more rate cuts. But - unlike in recent statements - the Fed left out specific language that had signalled rate cuts between scheduled meetings in the past. The FOMC meets again on August 21. Economists are hopeful that the Fed's campaign, which began in January, will eventually have a big impact after the typical six-to-eight month lag. There are also high hopes for added stimulus from recent federal income tax cuts. But Fed officials have privately expressed concern that their work had been undermined by a strong dollar, which has hurt US exports, the recent upward drift in long-term interest rates and weak equity prices. Some investment strategists contend weak corporate profits and profit forecasts - which continue to tumble, threatening, the US with another round of cuts in production, investment and employment - may overwhelm the Fed's efforts. Some economists also fear heavy and rising debt levels among US consumers endanger the continued growth in consumer spending. Another potential worry for the Fed remains the risk that its actions will fuel imbalances that undermine the economy's long-term health. Several top Fed officials - including Laurence Meyer and Robert McTeer - have wondered aloud about the possibility of an inflation surge. These concerns may have provoked dissent within the FOMC, possibly playing a role in its decision to reduce rates a quarter-, instead of a half-, point. The Fed might have one less thing to worry about: Several market measures of inflation concerns have subsided. The Fed's internal measure of market inflation expectations - the gap between yields on Treasury bonds and inflation-indexed Treasury bonds - has dropped to its lowest level since early April after jumping to 12-month highs in May.

280,2001-06-27,2001-06-28,Financial Times (FT.Com),Fed cuts rate in bid to head off recession.,"The US Federal Reserve on Wednesday cut short-term interest rates by a quarter of a percentage point in a move to head off the threat of recession. The decision means the Fed has reduced its interest rate target by 23/4 percentage points in six months to jump-start an economy it has described as ""unacceptably weak"". Some expectations of a half-point cut had been undermined by recent positive economic data but Wednesday's action is still widely seen as the central bank's most aggressive easing of money and credit in 14 years. The central bank's policy-making open market committee voted to cut its target for the federal funds rate from 4 per cent to 3.75 per cent, its lowest since April 1994. The Fed also cut by a quarter-point its largely symbolic discount rate to 3.25 per cent. In a statement accompanying the move, the Fed said declining company profitability and capital spending, weak expansion of consumption, and slowing growth abroad continued to weigh on the economy. It pointed to continuing favourable trends helping long-term prospects for productivity growth and the economy. But, despite these, ""the risks are weighted mainly toward conditions that may generate economic weakness in the foreseeable future"". The Fed also said easing pressures in the labour and product markets were expected to keep inflation contained. But, unlike recent statements, the Fed left out language indicating readiness to make a further rate cut before the next scheduled meeting of the committee on August 21. Economists are hopeful the Fed's latest rate-cut campaign, which began in January, will have a significant economic impact after a typical six to eight month lag. Many also have high hopes for added stimulus from recent federal income tax cuts. A potential worry for the Fed remains the risk that its actions have fuelled - or will fuel - imbalances that undermine the economy's long-term health. Several top Fed officials - including Laurence Meyer and Robert McTeer-have wondered aloud about the possibility of an inflation surge. It is possible that these concerns led to dissent within the FOMC and played a role in its decision to cut rates by a quarter-point rather than the half-point widely expected. Fed officials have privately expressed concern that their efforts have been undermined by a strong dollar, which has hurt US exports, the recent upward drift in long-term market interest rates and the weakness of equity prices.

281,2002-06-26,2002-06-27,Financial Times,THE AMERICAS - Anxious Fed keeps rates at 40-year lows.,"Beset by economic uncertainty and financial turmoil, the US Federal Reserve decided yesterday for the fourth time this year to keep short-term interest rates pegged at 40-year lows. Futures markets, meanwhile, explicitly priced in a slight possibility of Fed rate cuts. That speculation gained a boost from mounting evidence that the US central bank is focusing on the risk of Japan-style deflation. The Fed's policymaking open market committee (FOMC) voted unanimously to keep its target for the fed funds rate - which regulates overnight lending between banks - at 1.75 per cent. Officials have consistently voiced mild optimism about a moderate recovery, but have avoided returning short-term rates to pre-recession levels, thinking the US still needs easy credit to recover from last year's downturn. The recovery is clearly reflected in economic data. Yesterday, the Commerce Department reported that orders for non-military capital goods rose in May at the fastest pace since December 2001 and sales of new homes surged to a record. But the surprisingly good news only moderated growing investor distrust of corporate America and anxiety about threats to the recovery posed by the decline of stock prices, faltering consumer sentiment and still-depressed levels of business confidence, profits, capital spending and hiring. Signalling its concern, the US central bank said, in a prepared statement, that the risks facing the Fed remained ""equally balanced"" between economic weakness and higher inflation, the shift towards stockpile building and growth in demand for goods and services ""appear to have moderated"", leaving the course of future strengthening ""uncertain"". A shift in expectations, under way since March, got more support from growing evidence of the Fed's focus on the risk of deflation, as short-term interest rates and measured inflation in the US linger near zero. Last week the US central bank published a study* of how Japan might have avoided its decade-long struggle with deflation. It involved discussion of ""unconventional"" measures in case interest rate cuts failed to arrest a recession. The discussion appeared to reflect concerns the US could have faced - and might face in the future - a dilemma in which interest rates were so low as to be rendered ineffective as a monetary policy tool. The latest study insists ""that when inflation and interest rates have fallen close to zero, and the risk of deflation is high, stimulus, both monetary and fiscal, should go beyond (convention)."" *Preventing Deflation: Lessons from Japan's Experience in the 1990s (Federal Reserve working paper, June 2002) London Edition 3.

282,2002-06-26,2002-06-27,Financial Times,CAPITAL MARKETS - Safe-haven buyers boost prices.,"Investors piled into the safe haven of government bonds yesterday after news of WorldCom's fraudulent accounting practices sent equities sharply lower. The Federal Reserve, as expected, left the Federal funds rate unchanged at 1.75 per cent and kept a ""neutral bias"", saying the risks were still balanced between inflation and economic growth. However, expectations have begun to mount that the Fed may cut interest rates further to prop up stock markets and the US economy. Lehman yesterday said it expected the Fed to cut rates by 25 basis points in the third quarter. ""There's a loss of faith in corporate America,"" said Gary Pollack, director of fixed income at Deutsche Bank Private Banking, adding that investors had now become even more worried about the prospect of a ""double-dip"" recession. The Fed did not, as had been hoped by some, yesterday address the market implications arising from WorldCom's accounting fraud. The 10-year note was up 1 point to 101 13/32 to yield 4.689 per cent after the FOMC meeting. The 30-year bond had gained 1 1/32 to 99 to yield 5.387 per cent. The two-year note was up 1/4 to 101 1/32, yielding 2.695 per cent. In the eurozone, bond prices rose in line with those of US Treasuries. The yield on the two-year German schatz bond fell 8.2 basis points to 3.935 per cent. The 10-year German bund yield fell 6.6 basis point to 4.905 per cent. The 10-year September bund future rose 0.52 to 107.79. Bond prices were also supported by the strength of the euro against the dollar but most investors in Europe were focused on the Fed's decision about interest rates. In emerging markets Brazilian bond prices fell further as risk appetite was hit by the WorldCom scandal. Japanese government bond futures prices rose yesterday, after the steepest fall in the Nikkei 225 Average since last September and another major accounting scandal rocked Wall Street. The buying came as the Japanese government tried unsuccessfully to halt a resurgent yen for the second time this week. The technology-sensitive Nikkei 225 Average lost 4 per cent to 10,074.56, while the broader-based Topix index closed below the 1,000 support level for the first time in four months. JGBs provided a safe haven for investors, who were also fleeing export shares hit by a yen that rose to its highest level against the dollar in eight months, in the wake of WorldCom's discovery of $3.8bn in accounting irregularities that inflated the group's profits. Analysts said that if the yen continued to gain against the dollar overnight, the bearish equities sentiment could continue, pushing nervous investors towards more purchases of government bonds. The key September 10-year JGB future contract rose 0.09 to 139.16. The benchmark No 240 10-year cash JGB rose 0.087 to 99.912, pushing the yield down 0.010 to 1.310 per cent. London Edition 1. "
283,2002-06-26,2002-06-27,Financial Times,COMMENT &ANALYSIS - A calm Fed watches the correction.,"COMMENT &ANALYSIS - A calm Fed watches the correction - Gerard Baker on why the central bank does not see pressing reasons in US economic conditions to raise or lower. As the world's investors took cover yesterday from the latest accounting bombshell to hit Wall Street, Federal Reserve policymakers put on a familiar display of phlegmatic order amid the turmoil. The US central bank, as expected, prosaically left its main monetary policy instrument, its target for the federal funds rate, unchanged for the fourth straight meeting of its policymaking open market committee (FOMC). But with US equity markets plunging through the low point they reached in the weeks after September 11, it must have been a troubling thought for policymakers that the combination of Kenneth Lay and Bernie Ebbers had done more damage to Americans' wealth than Osama bin Laden and Mohammed Atta. Last autumn, the Fed cut interest rates aggressively to shield the economy from terrorist-related blows to confidence. So far, and with not much further room for cuts, it has sat tight as markets have steadily crumbled in the past four months. Fed officials are concerned about equity weakness - and indeed about the steep slide in the dollar that has accompanied it. But, going into this week's FOMC meeting, policymakers remained cautiously optimistic that recovery would not be derailed. The biggest source of comfort is that, despite the big declines in equity values so far this year, the real economy continues to show encouraging signs of life. Overall, output growth in the second quarter of the year, which ends this weekend, will be a little more disappointing than looked likely two months ago but should still be in the range of 2.5 per cent at an annual rate. That is well below the inventory-adjustment-driven 5.6 per cent pace of the first quarter but still consistent with steady recovery. Especially encouraging has been the manufacturing sector, which is several months into a recovery from a two-year slide. Yesterday, the Commerce Department reported that durable goods orders rose by 0.6 per cent in May, the fifth increase in the past six months. Signs of strength in the capital goods markets are what the Fed has been hoping to see, since they should signal the start of a gradual revival in business investment - the collapse of which was the main factor that drove the economy into recession last year. And for all the concern in markets about the dollar's decline, Fed economists like to point out that the stimulative effect on exports will at least counterbalance the deflationary impact on US financial assets. Consumers hold the key. Fed policymakers have looked with awe on American consumers' resilience in the past few years. But they also know that part of Americans' capacity to keep spending has been provided by the Fed itself. In late 1998, when markets swooned after the Russian debt default and Asian financial crisis, and again after the September 11 attacks last year, Alan Greenspan and colleagues moved aggressively to cut short-term interest rates. This time, with the Fed running out of ammunition, falling stock prices could be more problematic for consumer spending. Consumers remain stretched, with heavy debt burdens and historically low savings rates. And this week the Conference Board, an independent research group, reported that June had seen the steepest fall in consumer confidence since last autumn, as Americans seemed to take fright at the events on Wall Street. Yet consumers may receive a shot of adrenaline from the same forces that have been sending stocks lower. As equities have declined in the past few months, bond prices have shot higher, sending interest rates lower. As a result, the housing market - where big gains have, for most Americans, more than offset the impact of falling stock prices - remains as strong as ever. Yesterday, the Commerce Department reported that new home sales in May rose by 8.1 per cent from a month earlier. Consumers seem to be in the early stages of another round of mortgage refinancing, which should put hundreds of billions of dollars back into their pockets. This may represent a belated adjustment in longer-term interest rates to the Fed's aggressive easing of last year. Or it may simply show that the market is once again ahead of the central bank in rebalancing financial conditions in the economy. The critical factor is that, as long as inflation stays low, the stimulus from lower interest rates need not be reversed any time soon. That is again the source of cautious Fed optimism. In spite of increases in energy prices this year, consumer prices remain flat - indeed some measures of inflation are showing the lowest rate of price increases in more than 40 years. Though the dollar's decline will push up import prices and some domestic prices, the US is still a relatively closed economy and is not likely to see a generalised and sustained increase in prices as a result of events on currency markets. Against that backdrop the Fed is under little pressure to raise interest rates. This same low inflation is, Fed officials believe, part of the reason for the weakness in equity markets. Policymakers do not appear to share some of the more alarmist views of inter-national investors that the accounting issues at World-Com and elsewhere mean US corporate reports are fundamentally untrustworthy, although clearly there are many significant problems. And it is hard to attribute the entire decline in US equity prices in the past six months, or even the bulk of it, to the corporate governance issue. A large part of it may be the result of the weakness of nominal demand in the economy. Inflation is low or even negative, so the relatively small increases in real demand of the past six months are reflected in very small gains in nominal demand - and in corporate sales and profits. Put another way, companies face a situation, unprecedented in the recent past, in which they have virtually no pricing power, even as real demand starts to recover. Of course, further steep falls in equity prices would complicate the Fed's task, especially if accompanied by a dive in the dollar. But for the moment, a benign inflationary environment and declines in market interest rates are keeping alive hopes at the central bank that a navigable path can be found through the unravelling of 1990s excess.

Some economists are concerned that the slowdown will turn into a recession, but recent comments by Mr Alan Greenspan, the Fed chairman, and by most other Fed governors and regional bank presidents on the FOMC have been less pessimistic. Regional bank presidents remain worried about inflationary pressures and believe it would be wrong to ease policy prematurely. The Administration, while believing a recession can be avoided, argues that the Fed is too concerned with inflation, which the Treasury maintains has stabilised. Yesterday's figures, in seasonally adjusted current dollars, show that shipments of manufactured goods increased 2 per cent in May, more than offsetting the previous 1.3 per cent decline.

The decision, made at the year's first meeting of the policymaking Federal Open Market Committee, had been widely expected. Although the economy grew by a faster-than-expected 3.8% last year, there has been little sign of inflation re-emerging. Last week Alan Greenspan, Federal Reserve chairman, warned that the effects of the Asian economic crisis were likely to trigger a slowdown in US growth later this year, prompting market speculation that the Fed's next move might even be to lower rates.

By early afternoon, the Dow Jones Industrial Average had fallen 35.88 to 8,124.47 while the broader Standard &Poor's 500 index was down 1.19 at 1,004.81. ""The market's somewhat eerily like it was on Tuesday,"" said Bill Meehan, chief market analyst at Cantor Fitzgerald in Connecticut. ""We had profit-taking in the morning with the Dow down 50 points early on, but the tech sector putting a bottom on the market."" Leading the Dow lower was Merck, off $1 9/16 to $114 3/4, and Johnson &Johnson, which fell $7/8 at $68 5/8. US Treasury prices were mixed by midday. Analysts awaited the outcome of the Federal Open Market Committee's two-day meeting to decide interest rate policy. By early afternoon the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond fell 7/32 to 103 13/32, sending the yield higher to 5.881%. In the health sector, shares of Aetna climbed $1 11/16 to $78 1/8 after the company announced earnings in line with expectations.

289,1998-02-04,1998-02-05,Financial Times,Concern over Iraq hits Europe.,"Russian President Boris Yeltsin's warnings on Iraq, combined with a big bund auction in Germany, knocked confidence in European government bond markets yesterday, but US Treasuries fared better ahead of the widely expected decision to hold interest rates. Nonetheless, Sonja Gibbs, senior market strategist at Nomura International, said: ""I would expect a bounce back in European markets tomorrow given the magnitude of the drop today - unless there is a sharp recovery in Asian equities."" Mr Yeltsin's comments, warning that US action in Iraq could spark a global conflict, were reported just as the Bundesbank was in the midst of a 10-year GERMAN BUND auction. In the circumstances, the auction went well, with DM 7.4bn of the bunds taken up, and bids of DM 14.3bn. However, the yield curve steepened, as longer-dated issues were hit by the new supply. The March bund contract in London fell by 0.52 at its worst, recovering to settle at 106.26, down 0.34 on the day. Turnover was active, with over 216,000 contracts traded in London, and 310,000 in Frankfurt. Ms Gibbs argued: ""There's a perception creeping into the German market, misguided in my view, that the economy is going to turn around."" There have been rumours that today's unemployment data will reveal a sharp fall. UK GILTS also suffered from concern that the growing Iraqi crisis could hit confidence in financial markets. The March contract settled 3/8 lower at 122 27/32, some 9/32 off its lows. Trading was brisk, with turnover of more than 86,000 contracts. There was some nervousness ahead of today's pronouncement on interest rates from the Bank of England's monetary policy committee. Short sterling futures have fallen by seven basis points this week, reflecting concern that there might be another rise. The adjusted yield spread against bunds widened by one basis point to 112. Andrew Roberts, gilts analyst at UBS Securities, said: ""This is the 'last chance saloon' for the hawks in the MPC. It was foolish of the market to ignore the possibility of a rate rise."" ITALIAN BTPs traded in line with other European markets, with the March contract settling 0.29 lower at 117.16, and the spread against bunds narrowing one basis point to 39 points. Carl Azeglio Ciampi, Treasury minister arrives in Bonn today on a two-day trip to ease German concern over Italian membership of European monetary union. The markets have remained relatively sanguine in the face of German criticism of Italian entry, but sentiment will be affected by the sound-bites emerging from Germany. US TREASURIES were mixed as the Federal Open Market Committee concluded its two-day meeting to set interest rate policy. The consensus opinion on the meeting was that there would be no interest rate change, although opinions were decidedly mixed as to what the Fed would do later in the year. In morning trading, investors favoured shorter-term issues over longer ones. The benchmark 30-year bond had fallen 7/32 to 103 13/32 by early afternoon, sending the yield up to 5.881%. The 10-year note also fell, by 3/32 to 104 3/32, yielding 5.565%, but the two-year note gained 1/32 to 100 1/8, yielding 5.308%. The Federal Funds rate was 5.37%. In overnight trading the yield curve had steepened, reflecting investors' preference for short-term issues. The yield spread between the two-year note and the 30-year bond was 57 basis points. The Treasury Department announced new auctions next week. It will sell $13bn in three-year notes, $12bn in 10-year notes, and $10bn in 30-year bonds.

290,1990-11-13,1990-11-14,Financial Times,United States treasury bonds up after signs of deterioration in manufacturing sector.,"US Treasury bonds moved broadly higher yesterday as signs of a further deterioration in the US manufacturing sector added to the market's bullishness. Longer-dated maturities posted strong gains throughout the day following the release of US industrial production figures for October, which fell 0.8 per cent, further than the expected 0.5 per cent. The market now expects the Fed to loosen monetary policy before the weekend, following yesterday's meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee, where policy decisions are made. In spite of the overall optimism, trading was quiet and volume will probably remain thin until the Fed sends a clear signal about monetary policy. In late trading, the Treasury's bellwether 30-year bond added 1 1/32 at 102 11/32, yielding 8.52 per cent. The gains were less pronounced at the short end of the yield curve, where the two-year note was only 1/32 higher for a yield of 7.57 per cent.

291,1990-11-13,1990-11-14,Financial Times,Foreign Exchanges: Nervous pound improves,"STERLING GAINED a little ground on the foreign exchanges yesterday, despite gloomy economic news and an attack on British government policy towards Europe by Sir Geoffrey Howe, who recently resigned as UK deputy prime minister. The threat to Mrs Margaret Thatcher's position as prime minister showed no sign of abating, amid rumours of a challenge to her leadership of the Conservative party. UK economic news was weaker than expected and tended to confirm a trend towards recession. Industrial production fell 0.4 per cent in September, against a revised drop of 0.6 per cent in August. City analysts were looking for a fall of 0.3 per cent. Manufacturing industry, stripping out energy production, appeared to be even weaker, falling 1.1 per cent, compared with 0.9 per cent the previous month. Forecasts pointed towards a drop of about 0.5 per cent. Dealers said that the data pointed towards a cut in UK bank base rates, although the pound's weak position in the exchange rate mechanism of the European Monetary System restricts the authorities room for manoeuvre. Sterling's overall position at the bottom of the ERM showed little change. The pound improved against the D-Mark, rising to DM2.9075 from DM2.9050. It also gained 20 points to Dollars 1.9645, while rising to FFr9.7775 from FFr9.7625; to SFr2.4600 from SFr2.4525; and to Y254.50 from Y252.50. On Bank of England figures sterling's index eased 0.1 to 93.9. The dollar traded quietly, waiting for any signs of monetary easing after yesterday's meeting of the Federal Open Market committee. Mr John Taylor, a member of the White House council of economic advisers, said that long-term interest rates should fall as a result of the US budget cutting agreement. He added that there was a risk of recession and that the Fed's stated policy would imply lower rates if the economy weakened substantially. At last night's close in London the dollar had eased to a record closing low of DM1.4800 from DM1.4805, but was a little firmer against most other currencies, rising to FFr4.9775 from FFr4.9750; to SFr1.2525 from SFr1.2500; and to Y129.55 from Y128.70. The dollar's index was unchanged at 60.1. This month's rise in the Bundesbank's Lombard rate has provided support for the D-Mark. In Frankfurt the Bundesbank did not intervene when the dollar was fixed at a record low of DM1.4788 against DM1.4793 on Monday. The German currency was also strong in terms of the Japanese yen, rising to Y87.55 from Y86.95 at the London close. The D-Mark improved to FFr3.3612 from FFr3.3607 at the Paris fixing, but higher Italian interest rates helped the lira recover. In Milan the D-Mark fell to L752.21 from a record L752.76 at the fixing. "
292,1990-11-13,1990-11-14,Financial Times,Government Bonds: Early rally peters out over Tory leadership worries,"A RALLY in the British government bond market, based partly on weak industrial production figures, petered out in the afternoon as worries about the leadership of the British government reasserted themselves. However, dealers reported genuine institutional buying over the last two days, based on the confirmation of UK economic weakness. One benchmark government bond - the 11 3/4 per cent of 2003-7 - closed the day yielding 11.41 per cent, compared with about 11.42 per cent at the previous close. More positive interpretations of prospects for real interest rates in the UK appear to have been behind a sharp jump in index-linked issues - particularly at the long-end of the market. The index linked issue maturing in 2024 jumped an unusually sharp 1 5/32 point to 92 5/16 . IN GERMANY, there was a similar picture, though for differing reasons. A continuation of Monday's largely technical rally in the morning was reversed by the close, with the key bund futures contract on the London International Financial Futures Exchange closing at 82.08, against Monday's 82.07, and it weakened further after hours to 82.04. Reports suggesting larger borrowing by the Federal government next year - of up to DM150bn, even after some DM30bn-35bn in spending cuts - depressed the market. So did the prospect of a nudge upwards in money market rates by the Bundesbank today. The new 9 per cent Bund closed at 100.08 to yield 8.983 per cent, up fractionally on the day. US Treasury bonds moved broadly higher yesterday as signs of a further deterioration in the US manufacturing sector added to the market's bullishness. Longer-dated maturities posted strong gains throughout the day following the release of US industrial production figures for October, which fell 0.8 per cent, further than the expected 0.5 per cent. The market now expects the Fed to loosen monetary policy before the weekend, following yesterday's meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee, where policy decisions are made. In spite of the overall optimism, trading was quiet and volume will probably remain thin until the Fed sends a clear signal about monetary policy. In late trading, the Treasury's bellwether 30-year bond added 1 1/32 at 102 11/32 , yielding 8.52 per cent. The gains were less pronounced at the short end of the yield curve, where the two-year note was only 1/32 higher for a yield of 7.57 per cent. The Fed refrained from operating in the open market and Fed Funds, the rate at which banks lend to each other, traded at 7 per cent through most of the day. However, the lack of intervention did not have any policy implications. THE FRENCH government bond market ended generally firmer, although the strength was concentrated at the long end of the market, causing the yield curve to flatten. The 10-year contract on the Matif futures exchange in Paris ended up 32 basis points at 98.38. But short interest rates came under pressure amid speculation that the Bundesbank could tighten German rates again soon, testing the strength of the franc. The strong performance of a FFr3bn 8-year Eurobond issued by the Kingdom of Spain prompted activity at that area of the yield curve, as underwriters covered short positions they had taken. "
293,2007-10-31,2007-11-01,Financial Times,Fed eases rates but warns on future cuts.,"The US Federal Reserve cut interest rates by a quarter point to 4.5 per cent yesterday, but warned investors against banking on further monetary easing, sending short-term government bond yields soaring.  The central bank signalled that it was shifting to a neutral stance on future rate cuts, saying ""the upside risks to inflation roughly balance the downside risks to growth"".  This means that Fed policymakers see the likelihood of further rate cuts as being no greater than the likelihood of increases in contrast to the market, which before the decision was pricing in substantial further easing in the months ahead.  One Fed governor, Thomas Hoenig of Kansas City, Missouri, dissented. He preferred to leave rates unchanged in another signal that the Fed may be more hawkish than the markets might have hoped.  ""This should not be read as the Fed closing the door on easing, but they are signalling that the bar will be set quite high for them to cut at the next meeting,"" said Alan Ruskin, chief international strategist at RBS Greenwich Capital.  The yield on the two-year note, which is particularly sensitive to short-term changes in monetary policy, rose 13 basis points to a high of 3.93 per cent. Interest rate futures reflected sharply lower odds of further rate cuts when the FOMC meets in December and January.  The dollar also fell to a record low of Dollars 1.4504 against the euro, while stocks staged a strong rally late in the day, amid optimism that the Fed had done enough to insulate the broader economy from problems in the housing and credit markets.  The central bank predicted in its statement accompanying the rate decision that ""the pace of economic expansion will likely slow in the near-term"" as the housing slump intensifies.  But it added that the second successive rate cut ""should help forestall some of the adverse effects on the broader economy that might otherwise arise from the disruptions in financial markets and promote moderate growth over time"".  The statement from the Fed played down expectations of future rate cuts.  Disappointing earnings in the banking sector and downbeat corporate forecasts have added to concerns about a slowdown.  However, US gross domestic product rose at an annual rate of 3.9 per cent in the three months to the end of September.  ""This one was for the banks. The cut is intended to keep money flowing freely and stem the risk of spillover from the financial markets to the real economy,"" said Jeoff Hall, an economist at Thomson Financial.

Equity investors were initially disappointed by the statement, but buyers soon emerged and stocks closed sharply higher.  The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 1 per cent to 13,930.01 after being up 0.4 per cent before the Fed's move. The S&P 500 rallied 1.2 per cent to 1,549.38, while the Nasdaq Composite rose 1.5 per cent to 2,859.12.

The Federal Open Market Committee said: ""The committee judges that, after this action, the upside risks to inflation roughly balance the downside risks to growth."" The FOMC also said this cut, along with September's 50-basis-point cut, ""should forestall the hit to economy caused by recent financial turmoil"".  Drew Matus, economist at Lehman Brothers said: ""More generally, when the FOMC discusses rate moves in cumulative terms, they are coming to or at the end of whatever cycle they had been in.""  The yield on the two-year Treasury note rose 13bp to 3.94 per cent and interest rate futures reduced expectations of further cuts when the FOMC meets in December and early next year. The yield on the 10-year note rose 8bp to 4.465 per cent.  ""The prospect of further rate cuts is not looking good,"" said Tom di Galoma, head of Treasury trading at Jefferies &Co. ""The economy and the markets have improved in the last six weeks and until housing weakness rolls over into the broad economy, the Fed will not aggressively ease.""

On currency markets , the dollar fell to a record low of Dollars 1.4504 against the euro after the rate cut was announced.

UK Gilt prices fell on the data, driving the yield on the 10-year note 3.9bp higher to 4.97 per cent.  The Bank of Japan kept interest rates on hold at 0.5 per cent, offering no support for the weak yen. Furthermore, the central bank's semi-annual outlook on economic activity revealed expectations of lower growth and inflation, limiting the likelihood of any further near-term interest rate increases. The dollar was up 0.6 per cent to Y115.33.  Oil prices rose sharply after a surprise drawdown in US stockpiles. Commodity markets had expected weekly inventory data to show a rise of 400,000 barrels of crude oil following the previous week's massive 5.3m-barrel fall.

300,2007-10-31,2007-11-01,Financial Times,The Short View.,"There were no nasty Hallowe'en surprises from the Fed. The Federal open market committee cut the Fed Funds rate by 25 basis points to 4.5 per cent, fulfilling market expectations.  But markets did not behave as this news was already in the price. Stocks sold off, and then resurged. Bond yields rose (suggesting the chances of future rate cuts had reduced). That should help the dollar, but it fell to new record lows.  The keys to this ride lay in the Fed's 173-word statement. The key words are that ""the upside risks to inflation roughly balance the downside risks to growth"". So it has no bias, towards tightening or easing.  Is the rest of the statement neutral? The Fed does not declare victory over the credit squeeze, saying only that strains in the money markets have ""eased somewhat on balance"". It also expects economic growth to slow because of the intensifying housing correction. Points for the doves. For the hawks, recent rises in energy and commodity prices ""may put renewed upward pressure on inflation"".  Also note that the Fed did not speak with one voice, as one governor voted not to cut at all.  In short the Fed, like any central bank, does not much want to cut rates. But it plainly fears that it may have to do so.  On balance, the chances of a rate cut at the next two meetings, in December and January, have reduced. That is how Fed Funds futures reacted. On Tuesday, they signalled that a 4.25 per cent Fed Funds rate was a certainty by February. Those odds were slashed by a third after the Fed statement.  So why did the dollar fall? The chances of rate cuts in the eurozone this year look to have been eradicated by yesterday's high inflation reading. The Fed is dependent on the data once more. With more bad housing data, it may cut. Forex traders decided it was still safe to bet against the dollar.  Editorial Comment, Page 10 Markets, Page 34 www.ft.com/shortview"
301,2007-10-31,2007-11-01,Financial Times (FT.Com),FT.com site : View of the day: Base metals.,"Interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve are bearish for base metals such as copper and aluminium, says John Reade at UBS. ""The FOMC cut both the Fed funds and discount rates by a further 25 basis points as was widely expected [on Wednesday] helping to underpin base metals and rallies are possible as economic growth will be stimulated.  ""Indeed, this was the case in September when the Fed made a surprise 50bp cut in Fed funds. However, an historical examination of the relationship between US interest rates and base metals prices shows a positive correlation.  ""That is to say, base metals will struggle in an environment of falling interest rates; central banks are cutting because economic growth is weakening.""  Mr Reade notes that: ""The strong rally in base metals over the past six years came amid rising interest rates which were a sign of strengthening economic growth.  ""We are witnessing a synchronised deceleration in global growth exacerbated by the credit crunch and very high oil prices.""  He adds that UBS is sceptical that with the US, Europe and Japan all slowing together, the developing world will be able to de-couple.  ""In conclusion, cuts in Fed funds are bearish for base metals. We are tactically negative on base metals as we do not believe that current prices are discounting slowing global growth expectations.""  "

304,1999-05-18,1999-05-19,Financial Times,US AND CANADA - US central bankers reveal their bias.,"For years the ""policy bias"" of the Federal Reserve's open market committee has been one of those arcana of monetary policy-making that fail to break out of the more rarefied corners of public debate. Everybody knows that every six weeks or so the members of the policy-making body of the world's most powerful central bank decide at their meeting whether to raise or lower short-term interest rates. But until yesterday few people had heard much of the other policy decision the members routinely vote on - deciding the ""bias"" in the directive they give to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York in conducting its market operations. That was because the decision was not announced publicly until the release of the minutes of the meeting - a day or two after the subsequent FOMC gathering, by which time it was stale news. Yesterday, however, the Fed's policy bias took its bold bow on the world's international economic stage, and with it the central bank inaugurated a new character in the drama of monetary policy-making. Announcing that the FOMC had decided not to raise interest rates, the Fed said for the first time that it had, however, decided to shift from a neutral to a ""tightening"" stance in its policy directive. In recent years the bias has had little or no practical significance. According to Fed insiders its primary purpose has been to maintain a solid consensus among the committee's 12 voting members. If, for example, a significant minority wanted to raise interest rates, while the rest wanted no change, the minority could usually be bought off by a change in the bias - towards tightening, in this case - maintaining the impressive near-unanimity of the committee. But by announcing the decision straight away the Fed has changed the function of the policy stance. And with a lengthy explanation of its move yesterday it made that function clear; it has become the latest weapon in the Fed's policy arsenal - less decisive than an interest rate change, but more emphatic than the often Delphic public ruminations of Alan Greenspan, the chairman. Yesterday's announcement was a warning to financial markets that, after months of tolerance of rapid growth and low unemployment, the Fed has not taken its eye off the inflation ball. It was the first change in the direction of the stance since autumn, when the central bank cut interest rates three times in rapid response to the crisis in international financial markets. The statement accompanying the announcement of the bias change was clear about the risks to the economy. ""Against the background of already-tight domestic labour markets and ongoing strength in demand in excess of productivity gains, the committee recognises the need to be alert to developments over coming months that might indicate that financial conditions may no longer be consistent with containing inflation."" The explanation seemed to be that the shift in the bias marked a return to something approaching normality in policy-making. In any usual circumstances, a prolonged period of truly extraordinary growth and record low unemployment would have the Fed on full alert for inflation. But because of the global crisis of the last year, these have not been normal times. The reason the Fed had not already been on tightening alert was that global conditions were still volatile. With the shift back to near normality, for the central bank not to return to a cautious stance would have seemed almost reckless. As the statement put it, ""domestic financial markets have recovered and foreign economic prospects have improved since the easing of monetary policy last fall"". But, as some economists pointed out, the Fed's move did not necessarily mean an interest rate increase was imminent. ""There have been many occasions in the past when the Fed has adopted a tightening stance and not tightened. It doesn't mean they will tighten this time,"" said Mickey Levy, chief economist at Bank of America. In fact, in the last three years the Fed has moved from a neutral to a tightening bias three times before yesterday. The first time interest rates were eventually raised, but not until a year after the adoption of the bias. The second time there was no increase and the bias returned to neutral a few months later. The third time the bias quickly reverted to neutral and rates were cut - three times - soon afterwards. This time few economists expect the Fed actually to increase rates until it has evidence of wage or price pressures. And the beauty of it is that if the central bank's new early warning system works, that may not be necessary. By more clearly signalling its mood to the markets, it may scare investors enough to achieve a de facto monetary tightening though higher bond yields and lower stock prices - a virtual monetary policy for the cyber age.

305,1999-05-18,1999-05-19,Financial Times,Fed signals concern over inflation.,"FRONT PAGE - FIRST SECTION - Fed signals concern over inflation - Central bank keeps US interest rates unchanged but hints at tighter policy. The Federal Reserve yesterday signalled its concern over rising inflationary pressures in the US economy by announcing a shift in its policy stance towards a greater readiness to raise interest rates. The US central bank's policymaking open market committee left short-term interest rates unchanged at its meeting yesterday but said its members had agreed to move to a ""bias"" towards tightening monetary policy. The move does not necessarily prefigure an increase in interest rates but indicates where the Fed's policymakers see the overall direction of the economy and the policy response that might be needed. ""While the FOMC did not take action today to alter the stance of monetary policy, the committee was concerned about the potential for a build-up of inflationary imbalances that could undermine the favourable performance of the economy, and therefore adopted a directive that is tilted toward the possibility of a firming in the stance of monetary policy,"" the Fed said. The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed little changed at 10,836, down 16.52, on the news. Bond prices held mostly steady, following some sharp falls in recent weeks in anticipation of the change, although the price of the benchmark 30-year US Treasury bond fell. It was the first time the Fed had chosen to make its policy bias public immediately after the committee meeting. In the past the stance had not been known until publication of the committee minutes, at least six weeks after the meeting. In a move aimed at improving transparency, the Fed said earlier this year it would begin announcing immediately changes in policy stance when it deemed it important for markets to know of the shift. The announcement came against a background of continuing strong growth in the US economy. Gross domestic product grew at an annual rate of more than 5 per cent in the six months to the end of March, and unemployment has fallen to 4.3 per cent, close to its lowest level in 30 years. Until yesterday's meeting, the Fed had not seemed unduly concerned about the inflationary risks of such rapid growth and tight labour markets. The central bank cut interest rates by 0.75 percentage points last autumn in response to international financial turmoil, and since then the open market committee has maintained a neutral policy stance, indicating it felt the risks to the economy were evenly balanced between inflation and recession. But last week, in what some economists saw as an ominous sign that the long-feared inflationary upturn had arrived, the Commerce Department said consumer prices rose 0.7 per cent in April, the largest monthly leap in nine years. In some ways that figure was an aberration, apparently distorted by exceptional factors. There have been no other firm indications of meaningful inflationary pressures. But yesterday's decision indicates that Alan Greenspan, the Fed chairman, and most of his colleagues believe the balance of risks has shifted and inflation has become a significant threat again.

306,1999-05-18,1999-05-19,Financial Times,STOCK MARKETS LONDON STOCK EXCHANGE - Indices blow hot and cold ahead of rate decision.,"A confidence-boosting opening performance by Wall Street - ahead of the crucial meeting of the US Federal Reserve's open market committee resurrected what looked like being another poor performance by London's equity market yesterday. Wall's Street's Dow Jones Industrial Average was up around 50 points as London closed. At the finish of an erratic trading session, the FTSE 100 was finally 40.6 ahead at 6,206.4, having swung in a 70-point arc that saw the index up almost 60 points at best before retreating equally quickly to post an 18.2 decline. Similarly, the broader FTSE All-Share index gave up good early gains and posted a minor fall over the lunchtime period, only to rally strongly later in the day to close a net 15.24 firmer at 2,887.91. The FTSE 250 index managed a minor 5.5 gain at 5,706.7, but the FTSE SmallCap was never able to shake off the effects of persistent selling pressure and ended 6.4 down at 2,556.9. ""Everything hinges on the outcome of the FOMC meeting. It's as simple as that,"" said one marketmaker, adding that a rate rise or an indication that the next move in US rates would be upwards, could open the way for more pressure to be put on Wall Street and global markets. Earlier, the market had kicked off in good heart, responding to Wall Street's late rally, which saw the Dow finish only 59 points off, having been down more than 150 points at worst, plus some encouraging domestic corporate and economic news. On the economic front, there was a warm welcome for the April consumer price index data, which showed headline inflation at 1.6 per cent year on year and core inflation dipping back below the government's 2.5 per cent target to show a 2.4 per cent increase year on year. Adding some spice to the day's events was the revelation that Allied Domecq has been the target of Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway, which has accumulated a 2.2 per cent stake in the drinks group. Allied shares spiralled upwards, topping the FTSE 100 performance table with the market adopting the view that Mr Buffett would substantially increase his stake. And there was considerable relief with the news that Marks and Spencer's preliminary results revealed no unexpected horrors. Profits were down 42 per cent, but were no worse than expected. There was more good news for the sector from Next, the fashion group, which reported a big jump in sales. The news invigorated the rest of the stores area of the market and boosted the FTSE 250, which contains many retail companies such as Arcadia, Storehouse and Debenhams. A couple of takeover bids produced some spectacular gains in smaller companies. Crown Leisure almost doubled on the management buy-out, while Portsmouth &Sunderland Newspapers raced higher after an agreed bid from Johnston Press. Turnover in equities picked up strongly from Monday's 856.1m, reaching 1.1bn by 6pm. Copyright Financial Times Limited 1999. All Rights Reserved. Not Available for Re-dissemination. "
307,1999-05-18,1999-05-19,Financial Times,CURRENCIES &MONEY - Dollar unruffled by FOMC warning.,"The US dollar was initially unchanged yesterday after the Federal Reserve decided to leave interest rates unchanged, but warned it was moving to a tightening bias. Following the announcement the dollar shot up against the yen but then surrendered its gains after a sell-off in US asset markets. ""The market has been slow to decide whether the prospect of higher interest rates will be dollar positive or not,"" said David Bloom, currency economist at HSBC. ""Ultimately the argument will turn on the response of the asset markets, where the initial reaction has been negative."" During the London session the dollar paced within a narrow range against other major currencies as the market awaited the decision. * The Israeli shekel firmed yesterday after the Labour party's electoral victory kindled hopes of progress in the middle east peace process. The shekel initially strengthened by just under one per cent against the dollar to Shk4.07. Analysts said the market's relatively guarded response reflected uncertainty ahead of the US rate decision. ""Part of the news had been priced in over the past few days,"" said Mike Wallace, manager of currency analysis at Standard and Poor's MMS. ""Caution about the prospect of a right-wing backlash and the difficulty of forging a coalition able to negotiate a deal with the Palestinians and Syria may have also played a part,"" he added. But most analysts believed the peace dividend expected under Ehud Barak, the new prime minister, would boost regional trade and re-start delayed investment projects. * A rating upgrade from Standard &Poors yesterday gave the Australian dollar a fresh turn of speed. David Beers, managing director of sovereign debt at the US credit rating agency, added to the optimism by saying that the upgrade of Australia's foreign currency rating from AA to AA+ did not preclude another step up. The Aussie burst up to $0.6720 on the news, recouping loses last week when uncertainty over the passing of the government's tax reforms cast the currency under a cloud. Analysts said the Aussie could meet resistence as it approached $0.6750, where some investors were said to be protecting positions. ""If this level is breached then technical factors could lift it up to $0.6820,"" said James McKay, global markets strategist at Commonwealth Bank of Australia. He added that the continuing sale of state assets, including the remaining stake in the telecom group Telstra, could further strengthen the ratings outlook for Australia. Merger and acquisition activity gave added impetus to the currency, with Telecom New Zealand emerging as a bidder for AAPT, the Australian telecom group. ""Telecom New Zealand have already bought close to 10 per cent of the Australian group and a successful bid should further stoke demand for the Aussie,"" said Chris Furness, head of currency analysis at economic consultancy 4Cast. * Malaysia moved yesterday to quash suggestions that it should revalue the ringgit. Daim Zainuddin, finance minster, said that although some analysts had argued for a M$3 per dollar level, the government was comfortable with the M$3.80 peg. Recent initiatives replacing some capital controls with a 10 per cent ""outflow tax"" raised expectations that Malaysia would take a more flexible approach to foreign exchange. But speaking to a group of fund managers, Mr Daim also dampened hopes of a further relaxation of capital controls in the near future. Analysts said the recent rally in the region's currencies left considerable scope for a rise in the ringgit. ""The currency is still about 52 per cent below its pre-crisis levels compared to 21 per cent below for the Singapore dollar,"" said Mr Wallace. However, Gene Frieda of economic consultancy 4Cast, argued that with the yen looking fragile the authorities were unlikely to judge this an ideal time to revalue.

308,1999-05-18,1999-05-19,Financial Times,INTERNATIONAL CAPITAL MARKETS - Fed sends Treasuries lower.,"The Federal Reserve's decision to change it bias towards interest rates, while keeping rates unchanged for now, led US bond prices to lose early gains. US Treasury prices were higher leading up to the announcement, but sold off quickly soon after, especially at the short-end. Morning prices had been helped by a new round of overseas buying, especially from Japan. In the hours prior to the announcement investors were less concerned about the threat of higher inflation and interest rates than in previous sessions, helped by the latest report on the US housing market. As a result the long bond yield dipped below 5.9 per cent. In the minutes after the Fed decision, the benchmark 30-year bond was just 1/32 higher at 91 3/32, yielding 5.887 per cent. Among short-term issues, the 10-year note was down 5/32 to 98 25/32, yielding 5.661 per cent. The two-year note yield rose to 5.358 per cent on a 1/8 fall in price. There had been little expectation that the Federal Reserve would raise interest rates but opinions were divided on whether the policy setting Federal Open Market Committee would move to a tightening bias, a decision that could have been revealed in a policy statement later in the day, or in the coming weeks. ""The two key engines of growth, housing and consumer spending, seem to be moderating,"" said Richard Gilhooly, at Paribas Capital Markets in New York. A morning economic report confirmed the trend. New house projects for the month of April were at their lowest level in nearly a year. European bond prices moved in line with US Treasuries. Dieter Wermuth at Tokai Bank in Frankfurt said euro-zone bonds had behaved as if they were part of the US economy. The 10-year German bund future closed 0.37 higher at 114.24. UK gilts continued to underperform euro-zone markets. The 10-year gilt future fell 0.14 to 114.14 and the 10-year yield spread between German bunds and UK gilts widened three basis points to 91 basis points. Copyright Financial Times Limited 1999.

309,1989-05-16,1989-05-17,Financial Times,Government Bonds: US Treasuries Mixed As FOMC Begins Meeting,"US Treasury bonds yesterday closed mixed after a day of inconsequential movements as the Federal Open Market Committee began its meeting. The cautious mood also reflected a lower dollar amid rumours that West Germany will raise interest rates this week. In late trading, the short end of the market was unchanged to 1/32 point lower while long-dated issues were as much as 1/8 point higher. The Treasury's benchmark long bond outperformed the rest of the curve, rising 9/32 point for a yield of 8.81 per cent. After Friday's brief upward tilt in the yield curve, it has now inverted again with the yield on two-year issues at 8.89 per cent. This suggests an erosion of optimism of a near-term easing in monetary policy. Most analysts are betting that the FOMC will keep policy on hold despite signs that growth is broadly decelerating, doubt about how strong inflationary pressures actually are and the dollar's surge to levels believed to be above Group of Seven reference ranges. * * * Prices in the German bond market around the official fixings were surprisingly stable given the dramatic appreciation of the dollar while the Germans were taking their Whitsun holiday. The recent federal bond, fixed for the first time on the stock exchanges, was priced at 100.10 to yield 6.99 per cent. The penultimate bond, due February 1999, was fixed 10 pfennigs weaker than on Friday at par yielding 7.00 per cent. * * * Interest rate concerns also beset the French market, although turnover was not high as dealers and investors drifted back from the long weekend. The June futures contract on the Matif opened 26 basis points lower at 106.34, dropping further during the day, as concerns about pressures for a German rate increase preoccupied traders. Some technical short covering helped the market to close off its lows at 106.40. * * * The UK gilt-edged securities market headed lower in listless trading ahead of major economic figures tomorrow and Friday. The issue of three non-government sterling bonds also depressed the market at the start. Despite a slightly firmer tone to sterling, opening gilts prices were up to 1/4 point weaker as traders and investors sold gilts in order to take advantage of two long-term domestic sterling issues. At the close, the Liffe long gilt future was trading at 95-08, compared with 95.15 the previous day. "

311,2005-09-20,2005-09-21,Financial Times,Dissenting vote on rate rise fails to ruffle Fed analysts.,"Fed-watchers yesterday played down the importance of a dissenting vote on the Federal Open Market Committee, as the US central bank indicated that it has more work to do in raising interest rates. The FOMC raised interest rates, as expected, and acknowledged the increased uncertainty in the economic outlook following Hurricane Katrina. But there was no hint of a pause to come, as the committee said that following yesterday's increase policy remained accommodative and that it expected to continue raising rates at a measured pace. Mark Olson, a Fed governor better known as a banking expert than as an economist, went against Alan Greenspan, Fed chairman, voting to leave interest rates on hold. And only seven of the 12 regional Fed branches asked for an increase in the Fed's discount rate, a largely symbolic gesture, though one that has been made with only rare exception as the Fed had increased rates consecutively at the last 10 meetings before yesterday. ""The dissent by Olson is probably not evidence of a split and some of the regional banks might have found it hard to ask for an increase right after the hurricane but I assume they will quickly fall into line behind the next one,"" said Richard Berner, chief US economist at Morgan Stanley. ""They gave no hint of a pause although of course they could do that in the future."" Ethan Harris, chief US economist at Lehman Brothers, referring to Mr Olson's dissent and the regional Fed requests, said: ""We do not believe these actions are significant and continue to expect the Fed to raise rates at a measured 25 basis points per meeting through the January meeting, bringing the Fed funds target rate to 4.5 per cent."" If anything, the FOMC statement was a little more hawkish than expected. The committee acknowledged the disruption following Katrina and the potential for energy price volatility. The committee said that while Katrina had increased uncertainty about ""near-term economic performance, it is the Committee's view that they do not pose a more persistent threat"". By raising rates another quarter point to 3.75 per cent, signalling more to come and focusing on inflation risks than growth risks, the FOMC left little doubt about its greatest concern. In a slight tweak in its language, rather than saying inflation expectations were ""well contained"" it merely said they were ""contained"". Last week's Michigan survey of consumer sentiment showed the expected drop - following Katrina - but also showed a rise in inflation expectations. ""The statement represents a real skilful exercise in risk management by the Fed. They acknowledged the increased uncertainty but in their view the risk of higher inflation outweighs the risk to growth,"" Mr Berner said. The last time a Fed governor dissented was in September 2002, when the FOMC left rates on hold, but a former governor, Edward Gramlich favoured easing monetary policy. "

Shortly after the decision the greenback was trading at Dollars 1.2130 against the euro, from Dollars 1.2163 prior to the decision, as well as firming up by a similar margin to Dollars 1.8000 against sterling, Y111.89 versus the yen and SFr1.2808 against the Swiss franc. The dollar index strengthened to 88.59, from 88.32 before the announcement. Although a minority of economists had expected the Fed to pause its rate-hiking cycle in the wake of Hurricane Katrina, the decision to push rates to 3.75 per cent had largely been priced in to the currency market. The accompanying statement was on the hawkish side with the Federal Open Market Committee saying monetary policy was still ""accommodative"", that rates could be raised at a ""measured pace"" and that Katrina would only set back the US economy in the ""near term"". The FOMC warned that rising energy prices could push inflation higher, rather than fretting about the potential hit to economic growth. ""Higher energy and other costs have the potential to add to inflation pressures,'' the FOMC said. However, dollar bears were able to take comfort from the fact that, unusually, the FOMC's decision was not unanimous, with one committee member, Mark Olson, dissenting from the 9-1 majority vote. Alan Greenspan, Fed chairman, has already commented on ""froth"" in the US housing market and there was little indication of any slowdown in figures released yesterday showing US housing starts remained strong at 2.009m (annualised) in August, a fifth consecutive month above the 2m mark. The recent push in the gold price to a 17-year high is seen as a sign that the market is becoming more concerned about inflation. The widening spread between 10-year Treasury yields and inflation protected TIPS suggests investors are concerned over how successful the Fed will be in fighting inflation with higher interest rates. The Canadian central bank is due to hold its interest rate setting meeting shortly. Comments from its US counterpart on inflation expectations could have some impact on the outlook for Canadian rates. The Canadian dollar moved in a narrow range against the dollar yesterday, trading at CDollars 1.1700 after the loonie reached a 14-year high against the greenback on Monday. ""The Canadian dollar has been one of our most favoured currencies for some time now, given the mix of rising energy costs, strengthening economic momentum, fiscal and current account surpluses and a central bank in the foothills of monetary tightening,"" said Simon Derrick at the Bank of New York. ""Such is the momentum of late, that further progress towards the all-time high (CDollars 1.1198 set in November 1991) now looks a distinct possibility."" In Germany, the ZEW survey of economic sentiment fell more sharply than expected in September with the decline blamed on uncertainty over the general election. Selling pressure on the euro appeared to be easing amid emerging optimism about the possibility of a agreement between the main political parties. Prior to the Federal Reserve decision the euro had been up 0.3 per cent at Dollars 1.2175 from Dollars 1.2134 overnight. Against sterling, the euro strengthened 0.1 per cent to Pounds 0.6749. In the UK, the housing market showed signs of stabilising, according to a survey by the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors. Concerns over the outlook for consumer spending and economic growth meant sterling remained under pressure against the dollar, trading at Dollars 1.8043 prior to the Fed decision, down fractionally on the day. "
313,2005-09-20,2005-09-21,Financial Times,Bankruptcy hanging over Delphi WALL STREET.,"Wall Street pulled back modestly after the monetary-policy setting committee of the Federal Reserve raised benchmark interest rates by a quarter point, as expected. The US central bank's Federal Open Market Committee acknowledged the ""widespread devastation"" inflicted upon the southern US by Hurricane Katrina but said ""these unfortunate events . . . do not pose a more persistent threat"" to long-term economic performance. Shortly after the Fed's announcement, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was 0.1 per cent lower at 10,544.34, the S&P 500 lost 0.2 per cent to 1,229.05, while the Nasdaq Composite put on 0.2 per cent to 2,150.36. Away from the Fed's decision, a handful of corporate stories provided an impetus for trading. Delphi tumbled 18.3 per cent to an all-time low of Dollars 2.755 but recovered slightly and was down 11.9 per cent at Dollars 2.97. The company is in ongoing discussions with General Motors, its biggest customer, in an attempt to stave off bankruptcy. Circuit City Stores rose 6.6 per cent to Dollars 16.54 after its third quarter profits beat expectations. The performance followed disappointing results last week by Best Buy, a rival. But Estee Lauder, the cosmetics retailer, fell 11 per cent to Dollars 36.03. After the close on Monday, the company cut its sales forecasts for the second half of 2005, blaming the effect of Hurricane Katrina on the southern US, lower-than-expected sales from promotions and the impact of rising energy prices on consumers. JPMorgan downgraded the stock from ""overweight"" to ""neutral"". Coca-Cola Enterprises was 1.8 per cent lower at Dollars 19.10, Pepsi Bottling Group fell 2.9 per cent to Dollars 27.23 and PepsiAmericas fell 3.9 per cent to Dollars 23.30 as Lehman Brothers downgraded the trio, citing rising costs due to energy inflation and the likelihood of sluggish volume growth as price rises are raised to cover these costs. Higher energy costs also took their toll on US Steel, which fell 4.2 per cent to Dollars 43.33 in the wake of a profits warning. Alongside a rising energy bill, US Steel also cited lower shipments and prices for its warning on third quarter earnings. Logistics company Swift Transportation fell 7.5 per cent to Dollars 17.04 as it said higher fuel costs and weaker demand for freight would cause it to miss third quarter earnings' expectations. Maytag fell 2.7 per cent to Dollars 18.04 after it said earnings would fall short of expectations this year. The company is the subject of a takeover approach from Whirlpool, a rival appliance group, which fell 2.9 per cent to Dollars 74.03. Tempur Pedic International, the mattress maker, plunged 26.7 per cent to Dollars 12.01. The company cut its earnings guidance, citing consumer reluctance to buy big-ticket items. "
314,2005-09-20,2005-09-21,Financial Times (FT.Com),FT.com site : Rita brings weakness to dollar.,"Increasing concerns about disruption from Hurricane Rita led to weakness in the dollar yesterday as the greenback failed to sustain the modest gains that followed the rise in US interest rates by the Federal Reserve on Tuesday. The latest spike in crude and oil product prices contributed to dollar weakness after the Federal Open Markets Committee warned that rising energy prices could push inflation higher. ""The message from the FOMC was clear,"" said Derek Halpenny, senior currency economist at Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi: ""Increasingly inflationary pressures are a greater concern within the FOMC than the slowdown in economic growth post-Katrina."" Traders said the reaction of the major currencies to the hawkish tone of the FOMC statement had been surprisingly muted. The dollar weakened by 1 per cent against the Swiss Franc to reach a low of SFr1.2684 before recovering slightly to trade at SFr1.2711. In spite of the rise in US rates, the dollar failed to breach the key support level of $1.21 against the euro. This encouraged the single currency to rally to $1.2230. A modest late rally in the dollar brought the euro back to $1.2211. Dealers said once Rita had passed, the dollar could find support from the widening spread between US and eurozone 10-year bond yields, which has reached the highest level since 1999. European bond yields have sunk to an all-time low amid concerns over the outlook for growth which were underlined by the IMF yesterday. The Canadian dollar continued its strong rally, reaching a new 14-year high of C$1.1644 against the dollar before easing to trade at C$1.1690. Sentiment was boosted by better-than-expected retail sales figures, which reinforced the view that gross domestic product was continuing to gain momentum. Support for the currency has also come from a pick-up in foreign demand for Canadian equities as its stock market is heavily weighted with resources companies. In the UK, the minutes of the September meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee were much as expected, showing the MPC voted unanimously to keep interest rates unchanged. ""We still judge the MPC's growth forecasts are too optimistic,"" said Philip Shaw of Investec Securities: ""However, while the committee frets over inflation, it is unlikely to cut rates and we see policy remaining on hold for the remainder of this year."" Sterling traded 0.6 per cent stronger against the dollar at $1.8090 but 0.2 per cent weaker against the euro at GBP0.6747. High oil prices are boosting the Norwegian krone, which is trading at a 30-month high against the euro. The Norwegian central bank kept interest rates unchanged at 2 per cent but signalled an increase was likely at the next meeting. The krone initially firmed to NKr7.7805 before easing back to trade at NKr7.7951. In Japan, although the Nikkei recently broke through the 13,000 level, stronger economic conditions appear to be translating into higher capital outflows by Japanese investors, offsetting the currency impact from the increase in foreign equity inflows. ""For the yen to gain more decisively, we need to see a more active rotation in favour of the Nikkei by Japanese investors and not just by foreign investors,"" said analysts at UBS. The dollar fell 0.9 per cent against the yen to a low of Y110.98 before recovering to trade at Y111.36. The euro traded 0.2 per cent stronger against the yen at Y135.91. "
315,2005-09-20,2005-09-21,Financial Times (FT.Com),FT.com site : Dollar softens as oil prices move higher.,"Having initially strengthened in response to the rise in US interest rates announced by the Federal Reserve on Tuesday, the dollar failed to sustain its gains and softened against other major currencies during mid-morning business in Europe. The accompanying statement was on the hawkish side with the Federal Open Market Committee saying monetary policy was still ""accommodative"", that rates could be raised at a ""measured pace"" and that Katrina would only set back the US economy in the ""near term"". ""The message from the FOMC was clear,"" said Derek Halpenny, senior currency economist at Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi: ""Increasingly inflationary pressures are a greater concern within the FOMC than the slowdown in economic growth post-Katrina."" Against the euro, after failing to break the key support level at $1.2100, the dollar weakened around 0.4 per cent to $1.2230 before rallying to trade at $1.2204. The latest spike in crude and oil product prices in response to the threat from Hurricane Rita was one factor contributing to dollar weakness on Wednesday after the FOMC warned that rising energy prices could push inflation higher. Trading against the Swiss Franc followed a similar pattern with the dollar weakening 1 per cent to reach a low of SFr1.2684 before recovering slightly to trade at SFr1.2712. The Candian dollar remains the strongest performer among the major currencies reaching a near 14 year high against the dollar recently. The currency has received support as Canada is a major supplier of natural gas to the US and has benefitted from higher gas prices following the recent hurricane-induced disruptions. Also foreign demand for Canadian equities appears to have picked up as the Canadian market is resource rich, again providing support for the currency. Against the Canadian dollar, the greenback traded at C$1.1672. More generally, traders said the reaction in the major currencies to the hawkish tone of the FOMC statement was surprisingly muted. The euro was continuing to be held back by uncertainty surrounding the political outlook in Germany following the inconclusive general election. The euro traded marginally stronger against the yen at Y135.83 and also against Sterling at GBP0.6749. However, against the Swiss Franc, the euro lost ground trading at SFr1.5518. In the UK, the minutes of the September meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee were much as expected showing the MPC voted unanimously to keep interest rates unchanged. The MPC identified two broad areas of risk. Firstly, that weaker demand could result in lower GDP growth which in turn would put downward pressure on inflation. Second there were upside risks to projections for inflation as energy prices could rise further. ""We still judge the MPC's growth forecasts are too optimistic,"" said Philip Shaw of Investec Securities: ""However, while the committee frets over inflation, it is unlikely to cut rates and we see policy remaining on hold for the remainder of this year."" Sterling traded fractionally stronger against the dollar at $1.8079. The Norwegian central bank meets today with a quarter point increase in interest rates to 2.25 per cent expected by some analysts. Norwegian inflation is on the rise but high oil prices are seen as providing a support for the currency. The Norwegian Krone traded slightly weaker against the euro at NKr7.7810 ahead of the announcement. In Japan, although the Nikkei recently broke through the 13,000 level, stronger economic conditions in Japan appear to be translting into higher capital outflows by Japanese investors which are more than offsetting the currency impact from the increase in foreign equity inflows. ""For the Yen to gain more decively, we need to see a more active rotation in favour of the Nikkei by Japanese investors and not just by foreign investors,"" said analysts at UBS. The dollar fell around 0.7 per cent against the yen to a low of Y111.16 before recovering modestly to trade at Y111.27. "
316,2005-09-20,2005-09-21,Financial Times (FT.Com),FT.com site : Dissenting vote on rate rise fails to ruffle Fed analysts.,"Fed-watchers on Tuesday played down the importance of a dissenting vote on the Federal Open Market Committee, as the US central bank indicated that it has more work to do in raising interest rates. The FOMC raised interest rates, as expected, and acknowledged the increased uncertainty in the economic outlook following Hurricane Katrina. But there was no hint of a pause to come, as the committee said that following Tuesday's increase policy remained accommodative and that it expected to continue raising rates at a measured pace. Mark Olson, a Fed governor better known as a banking expert than as an economist, went against Alan Greenspan, Fed chairman, voting to leave interest rates on hold. And only seven of the 12 regional Fed branches asked for an increase in the Fed's discount rate, a largely symbolic gesture, though one that has been made with only rare exception as the Fed had increased rates consecutively at the last 10 meetings before yesterday. ""The dissent by Olson is probably not evidence of a split and some of the regional banks might have found it hard to ask for an increase right after the hurricane but I assume they will quickly fall into line behind the next one,"" said Richard Berner, chief US economist at Morgan Stanley. ""They gave no hint of a pause although of course they could do that in the future."" Ethan Harris, chief US economist at Lehman Brothers, referring to Mr Olson's dissent and the regional Fed requests, said: ""We do not believe these actions are significant and continue to expect the Fed to raise rates at a measured 25 basis points per meeting through the January meeting, bringing the Fed funds target rate to 4.5 per cent."" If anything, the FOMC statement was a little more hawkish than expected. The committee acknowledged the disruption following Katrina and the potential for energy price volatility. The committee said that while Katrina had increased uncertainty about ""near-term economic performance, it is the Committee's view that they do not pose a more persistent threat"". By raising rates another quarter point to 3.75 per cent, signalling more to come and focusing on inflation risks than growth risks, the FOMC left little doubt about its greatest concern. In a slight tweak in its language, rather than saying inflation expectations were ""well contained"" it merely said they were ""contained"". Last week's Michigan survey of consumer sentiment showed the expected drop following Katrina but also showed a rise in inflation expectations. ""The statement represents a real skilful exercise in risk management by the Fed. They acknowledged the increased uncertainty but in their view the risk of higher inflation outweighs the risk to growth,"" Mr Berner said. The last time a Fed governor dissented was in September 2002, when the FOMC left rates on hold, but a former governor, Edward Gramlich favoured easing monetary policy. "
317,2008-08-05,2008-08-06,Financial Times,Equities rally amid weakening commodities,"GLOBAL OVERVIEW Fed opts to keep rates unchanged US services sector data improves US and European equities rallied strongly yesterday, as investors took their lead from weaker commodities prices and strong economic data, largely ignoring the decision by the Federal Open Market Committee to keep interest rates unchanged. The widely expected decision to keep the target for the federal funds rate at 2 per cent came as the Fed reiterated that the financial markets remain under ""considerable stress"". It also said that the outlook for inflation remained highly uncertain. ""Although downside risks to growth remain, the upside risks to inflation are also of significant concern to the Committee,"" the Fed said. Jason Brady, a portfolio manager at Thornburg Investment Management, said: ""They pretty much issued the same statement [as last month],"" ""If I had to guess the direction of the Treasury curve, you probably get it steepening. You probably get risk assets, like stocks, moving higher because any hint of a move higher in rates would have been bad for stocks and two-year Treasuries and that didn't happen."" Further support for equity bulls came from better-than-expected data on the US services sector - which accounts for about 90 per cent of the economy. Oil led a broad sell-off across the commodities spectrum, helping to soothe concerns about inflation in spite of the Fed's statement. Nymex September West Texas Intermediate, the benchmark US crude price, settled at $119.17 a barrel, down $2.24, having earlier touched a three-month low of $118 - nearly 20 per cent below the all-time high of $147.27. Gold retreated below the $900 an ounce mark to touch its lowest for six weeks, copper and zinc hit multi-month lows and agricultural commodities remained under pressure. Arne Lohmann Rasmussen, senior analyst at Danske Bank, said there was a clear possibility that in-creased pessimism on global growth in the next couple of months could drive commodity prices even lower. ""However, we very much believe that the commodity bull run has been fuelled by fundamentals,"" he said. ""And while the June peak in oil price might have been an exaggeration, we have to remember that non-Opec oil supply problems, Opec's hawkish stance and strong oil demand in Asia and the Middle East remain intact. Supply problems are also growing in base metals, and the costs push in agricultural is evident."" Meanwhile, the US Institute for Supply Management's non-manufacturing index edged up to 49.5 in July from 48.2 in June - still below the 50 level which indicates contraction but a higher reading than expected. The prices-paid component fell from June's record high of 84.5 to 80.8. ""The ISM non-manufacturing measure has held within two points on either side of 50 for six consecutive months, which neatly captures the sluggish nature of the economy,"" Omair Sharif, strategist at RBS Greenwich Capital, said. But ""the concern is always about future trajectory, and on that point, July's data were not necessarily reassuring."" Meanwhile, Eurozone service sector activity fell to a five-year low in July while retail sales in the region suffered their biggest-ever drop in June. Howard Archer, at Global Insight, said yesterday's data added to the mounting evidence the eurozone economic downturn was deepening. ""Nevertheless, stillelevated price pressures mean that the ECB will not be cutting interest rates any time soon to support economic activity and could yet raise them further."" In the UK, the services purchasing managers' index inched up to 47.4 in July from 47.1, a better-thanexpected reading. Equity markets , however, were in an uncompromisingly bullish mood on both sides of the Atlantic. At the close, the S&P 500 was up 2.9 per cent, while the pan-European FTSE Eurofirst 300 index rose 2.6 per cent. In Tokyo, the Nikkei 225 Average slipped 0.1 per cent, while Hong Kong tumbled 2.6 per cent. In government bonds, the yield on the 10-year Treasury rose 6 basis point to 4.02 per cent, while in Europe, the 10-year Bund yield was 2bp lower at 4.31 per cent. On the currency markets , the dollar hit a seven-week high against the euro on the back of oil's early decline and barely moved following the Fed's decision."
318,2008-08-05,2008-08-06,Financial Times (FT.Com),Dollar hits 7-month high against yen,"The dollar was mixed on Wednesday, hitting a seven-month peak against the yen but easing slightly from a seven-week high against the euro and sterling as traders digested the Federal Reserve's decision on US interest rates. On Tuesday, the US central bank, as expected, kept its main Fed funds interest rates on hold at 2 per cent. Analysts said the accompanying statement was clearly designed not to rock the boat, with no clear bias between the assessment of upside US inflation risks and downside growth risks. However, it was the vote that moved markets, revealing only one member of the Federal Open Market Committee wanted to raise interest rates, against expectations for two, or possibly three, dissenters. This saw investors marginally pare back expectations that the Fed would raise interest rates by the end of the year, halting the dollar's recent rally against european currencies and boosting equities. The dollar eased 0.2 per cent to $1.5479 against the euro, lost 0.1 per cent to $1.9540 against the pound and edged 0.1 per cent lower to Sfr1.0528 against the Swiss franc. The greenback advanced against the yen, however, rising 0.3 per cent to a six-month high of Y108.60 as a solid performance from global equities boosted risk appetite and drove investors away from the safe haven of the low-yielding Japanese currency. John Normand at JPMorgan said the Fed had left little doubt that US monetary tightening was some way off. However, he said this stance still stood in stark contrast to other major global central banks which were either easing, such as the Reserve Bank of New Zealand, about to ease, such as the Reserve Bank of Australia, suspected of easing next year, like the European Central Bank, or permanently on hold, like the Bank of Japan. ""With the US the only major economy that is not sliding into recession, the expected direction of Fed policy should sustain the dollar's gains versus the euro and commodity currencies,"" said Mr Normand. Analysts said the euro was receiving support, however, ahead of the European Central Bank's interest rate decision on Thursday, at which the central bank was widely expected to reiterate its concerns over inflation and hawkish monetary policy bias. Stuart Bennet at Calyon said with the ECB 's focus on above-target inflation, the FX market had been surprisingly indifferent to recent weak activity data from the eurozone. But he said that might change next week if growth figures showed an expected marked slowdown. Indeed, he said the EU Commission sentiment indicator was signalling a strong chance that the region's economy contracted in the second quarter. ""If correct, the spectre of a eurozone recession should finally force the FX market to sit up and listen, pushing the euro lower."" Nevertheless, the euro rose 0.1 per cent to £0.7921 against the pound and gained 0.1 per cent to SFr1.6285 against the Swiss franc. Elsewhere the New Zealand dollar fell 0.6 per cent to $0.7219 against the US dollar and lost 0.3 per cent to Y78.41 against the yen as traders awaited the New Zealand second quarter employment report. Sue Trinh at RBC Capital Markets said the figures would crucial in judging whether the country's economy was already in recession and whether market had underestimated the pace of monetary easing from the RBNZ, which was expected to cut rates by 25 basis points at its September meeting. ""A greater than expected jump in the unemployment rate would increase the risk of a 50 basis-point cut, and hence weigh on the New Zealand dollar,"" she said."
319,1988-12-14,1988-12-15,Financial Times,TRADE DEFICIT NARROWS TO $10.3BN IN OCTOBER.,"The country's trade deficit improved by $0.4bn to $10.3bn in October, the Department of Commerce announced yesterday (14.12.88). Meanwhile the Federal Reserve Board issued figures showing that output and capacity pressures continue to rise sharply in the final quarter of the year, after a slack third quarter. All the figures were closely in line with market expectations, and the markets continued to drift while awaiting the outcome of the meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee, which ended yesterday. The FOMC is considering statistics which suggest a high pressure of demand and activity, along with reports from member banks which paint a more subdued picture of the economy. The trade figures reflected falls in both imports and exports from their high September values, and the change in the balance was more than accounted for by a sharp rise in export deliveries of aircraft, always a volatile series. A major talking point yesterday was higher interest rates overseas. The Belgian and Dutch central banks moved key interest rates 1/4 point higher and there were widespread expectations that today's policy-making Bundesbank council meeting could decide on a rise in the key Lombard rate.

320,1988-12-14,1988-12-15,Financial Times,TREASURY BONDS DRIFT LOWER IN DULL TRADING AFTER LATEST US ECONOMIC DATA RELEASED.,"There were no surprises in yesterday's (14.12.88) batch of US economic data which were in line with expectations and left Treasury bonds drifting lower in dull trading. By the close, short-dated maturities were quoted around 1/16 point lower, medium-date issues were up to 1/8 point lower and long-dated issues slumped by as much as 3/4 point. Despite the relatively larger losses at the long end, the yield curve remained inverted with the yield on the 8.875 per cent 1990 issue at 9.155 per cent and the yield on the Treasury's benchmark long bond rising to 9.041 per cent. Although yesterday's figures were almost exactly as forecasters had predicted, the dollar slid on foreign exchanges which put some pressure on bonds. In late trading, the US currency was quoted at Y 122.65 compared with an early high of Y 123.45 and at DM 1.7385 from DM 1.7505 earlier. Yesterday's batch of figures confirmed that progress towards reducing the trade deficit is now very sluggish and that manufacturing production continues to be robust. It is still unclear, however, whether there is enough strength in the economy (and therefore a substantial enough threat of inflation) to push the discount rate higher. The Federal Open Market Committee ended its two-day meeting yesterday and the bond market will be focused on the Federal Reserve's money market operations over the next few weeks. Of more immediate concern will be the dollar's reaction to interest rate moves overseas amid expectations that the Bundesbank may raise its Lombard rate. Fed Funds yesterday closed at 8 1/2 per cent.

321,1988-12-14,1988-12-15,Financial Times,US Trade Deficit Narrows To 10.3 Billion Dollars In October,"The US trade deficit improved by dollars 0.4 bn to dollars 10.3 bn in October, the Department of Commerce announced yesterday. Meanwhile the Federal Reserve Board issued figures showing that output and capacity pressures continue to rise sharply in the final quarter of the year, after a slack third quarter. All the figures were closely in line with market expectations, and the markets continued to drift while awaiting the outcome of the meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee, which ended yesterday. The FOMC is considering statistics which suggest a high pressure of demand and activity, along with reports from member banks which paint a more subdued picture of the economy. The trade figures reflected falls in both imports and exports from their high September values, and the change in the balance was more than accounted for by a sharp rise in export deliveries of aircraft, always a volatile series. Other details showed the effects of high domestic demand; exports of chemicals and paper products, where capacity is under strain, fell sharply. On the import side there was a surge in shipments of manufactures, which rose dollars 2.2 bn from September and stood at dollars 2.8 bn above the monthly average for the first nine months of 1988. Such a surge was widely expected after earlier reports that wholesale and retail stocks had been reduced sharply in earlier months, in an effort to avoid the excess inventories which built up in the final quarter of 1987. The November industrial output figures from the Federal Reserve showed a volume increase of 0.5 per cent for the second successive month, with manufacturing output up 0.6 per cent. Capacity utilisation is reported to have risen to 84.2 per cent, the highest figures since 1983. This compares with 84 per cent in October and a revised 83.7 per cent in September. Yesterday's figures generally confirmed what the markets already knew about the economy: that progress in cutting the trade deficit is now very slow indeed and that manufacturing industry continues to produce at a healthy rate and is running at very high capacity levels. The economic releases did not give much strength to arguments either for or against a US discount rate rise and it was the dollar's weakness yesterday which prompted falls in stocks and bonds. The dollar closed at DM 1.73955 and at Y 122.70. Treasury bonds were as much as 3/4 point lower and the Dow Jones Industrial Average closed 9.25 lower at 2,134.24. A major talking point yesterday was higher interest rates overseas. The Belgian and Dutch central banks moved key interest rates 1/4 point higher and there were widespread expectations that today's policy-making Bundesbank council meeting could decide on a rise in the key Lombard rate. "
322,1988-12-14,1988-12-15,Financial Times,Government Bonds: Bank Auction Plan Cheers Dealers,"The UK government bond market put a positive initial interpretation on yesterday's announcement by the Bank of England that it would hold an experimental reverse auction in January, when it would undertake to buy back a maximum of 500 m pounds sterling of gilt-edged bonds from the short end of the yield curve. The two outstanding issues in question are 2.4 bn pounds sterling worth of 10 per cent Exchequer and 2 bn pounds sterling of 11 per cent Exchequer, both due 1989. The auction would be January 13, for settlement three days later. Corporate tax payments usually peak around this time, draining cash from the market. The Bank has been using repurchase facilities to inject the additional liquidity required; the reverse auction is effectively a repo without the buyback. There is not much precedent for central banking techniques of buying back government stock, a necessity forced on the Old Lady by the UK budget surplus. But market makers initially welcomed the experiment as a cleaner method of operating. Previously, the dealers had simply rung the Bank with offers of stock, and no one quite understood on what basis the issues were bought or refused. Now the bidding will be more in the open, although the Bank reserves the right to buy nothing if the market's pricing is too aggressive. Clearly the Bank of England sees a structural surplus continuing for a while. Participants interpreted this positively in terms of continuing artificially high support for prices. The implications for their job security in a shrinking market were another matter. Previously, the market had assumed the Bank would buy in stock primarily at the long end, but the move yesterday suggested purchases might be more evenly spread. Immediately afterwards, the short stocks through to about six-year maturities rose about 1/2 point on the news, whereas the long end was up 9/32 point or so, quickly falling back some 5/32. Thus the yield curve, which is steeply negative, flattened a little. After much consideration, the verdict was that the Bank's move was simply a technical adjustment. Yesterday was generally a bouncy day. Sterling weakness depressed morning prices, as the currency dipped below DM 3.18 by lunchtime. Gilts were then buffeted by a choppy US market, first cheered by predictable October trade numbers but quickly upset by higher capacity utilisation data which portends continuing strength in the US economy. A fall in UK industrial output was one of the few positive influences on the market, but not enough to prevent the benchmark 2002-2007 bond closing a full point down. * * * European talk was again of higher interest rates, as both the Dutch and Belgian central banks raised rates. German government bonds rose 15 basis points before yesterday's repurchase agreement, and up to a further 5 or 10 points afterwards, on the news that the Bundesbank had set rates between 5 and 5.5 per cent, in contrast with levels between 4.70 and 4.95 on the expiring facility. Although the amount of the repo was unexpected, the liquidity was necessary to meet cash needs for tax demands. There was little reaction by German bunds to US trade number. They finished the day roughly 15 basis points ahead. * * * Mr David Lange, New Zealand's Prime Minister who let slip in another context that he took no notice of markets, chose, probably unintentionally, the day the New Zealand Futures Exchange was closed to announce the sacking of Mr Roger Douglas, the Finance Minister. Markets fell sharply on the news that Mr Douglas's long-running dispute with Mr Lange had ended in dismissal, but sadly the automated, screen-based NZFE was shut because of a power workers' strike. Traders were thus unable to adjust their government bond book via futures, as the 5-year benchmark fell about their ears, and yields rose to 14.70 per cent from 14.14 before the news. The NZ dollar dropped 3 cents. * * * There were no surprises in yesterday's batch of US economic data which were in line with expectations and left Treasury bonds drifting lower in dull trading. By the close, short-dated maturities were quoted around 1/16 point lower, medium-date issues were up to 1/8 point lower and long-dated issues slumped by as much as 3/4 point. Despite the relatively larger losses at the long end, the yield curve remained inverted with the yield on the 8.875 per cent 1990 issue at 9.155 per cent and the yield on the Treasury's benchmark long bond rising to 9.041 per cent. Although yesterday's figures were almost exactly as forecasters had predicted, the dollar slid on foreign exchanges which put some pressure on bonds. In late trading, the US currency was quoted at Y 122.65 compared with an early high of Y 123.45 and at DM 1.7385 from DM 1.7505 earlier. Yesterday's batch of figures confirmed that progress towards reducing the trade deficit is now very sluggish and that manufacturing production continues to be robust. It is still unclear, however, whether there is enough strength in the economy (and therefore a substantial enough threat of inflation) to push the discount rate higher. The Federal Open Market Committee ended its two-day meeting yesterday and the bond market will be focused on the Federal Reserve's money market operations over the next few weeks. Of more immediate concern will be the dollar's reaction to interest rate moves overseas amid expectations that the Bundesbank may raise its Lombard rate. Fed Funds yesterday closed at 8 1/2 per cent. * * * The French futures exchange, the Matif, was closed for over an hour with a bomb scare just after the US trade figures were announced. Happily, French bonds reacted little to US trade data and French inflation figures, which were unchanged on a year-on-year basis. "
323,2009-03-18,2009-03-19,Financial Times,Treasury bonds gyrate as Fed's shock move causes confusion,"Traders struggle to make sense of plan Thirty-year Treasury bond yields gyrated wildly yesterday as traders struggled to make sense of the Federal Reserve's plans for buying government debt. The yield on the 30-year bond plunged as much as 42 basis points to 3.38 per cent after the Federal Open Market Committee said it had ""decided to purchase up to $300bn of longer-term Treasury securities over the next six months"". But the yield subsequently rose sharply in response to a statement issued 25 minutes later by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York that was meant to clarify the central bank's buying plans. The New York Fed said its open market desk - which trades bonds with dealers - ""will concentrate purchases in the two- to 10-year sector of the nominal Treasury curve, although purchases will occur across the nominal Treasury and TIPS yield curves."" Traders dumped 30-year bonds in response, sending the yield back to 3.70 per cent. By contrast, yields for the five-, seven- and 10-year notes did not experience a similar rise. ""A lot of people got twisted up in the curve,"" said Rick Klingman, managing director at BNP Paribas. ""Long-term Treasuries, to dealers, implies securities between 10 and 30 years."" By late yesterday, the yield on the 30-year bond had fallen back to 3.52 per cent. That was down 28bp for the day. In contrast, the 10-year note was down 51bp to 2.49 per cent, near its low for the day late in New York, while the seven-year note was down 54bp at 2.08 per cent. ""There is a slight bit of confusion at this point about exactly what part of the curve the Fed will be targeting,"" said Ted Wieseman, economist at Morgan Stanley. In general, the Fed move to buy Treasuries was a major shock for dealers, as Fed officials had downplayed such an action in recent speeches. Moreover, many traders had expected pressure on the Fed to buy Treasuries would only emerge should 10-year yields rise towards 3.5 per cent. John Spinello, strategist at Jefferies & Co said: ""The market had expected the Fed would focus on buying more mortgages and not target the purchase of Treasuries at their current yield levels.""

325,2009-03-18,2009-03-19,Financial Times (FT.Com),FT interview: Spencer Dale,"The following is an edited transcript of an interview between Chris Giles and Norma Cohen of the Financial Times and Spencer Dale, chief economist of the Bank of England, held on March 19 2009 FT: I suppose we should start with the economy. We're now a month on from the inflation report. What do you think has changed? How bad is it? SD: In absolute terms, it's bad. Output fell by 1.5% in Q4 and it looks like it's going to fall by a similar amount in Q1. So in the absolute sense, it's bad. I don't think the data since the February inflation report has changed the picture that much, and in some sense, I think are consistent with the broad story which was told in the inflation report, which was, first of all, the gradual easing in the rate of contraction during the middle of this year, so it's continuing falls in Q1 and starting to see some sort of easing in the rate of contraction, and with the possibility of some signs of recovery by the turn of the year. And that was the central view in February. And I think the data, since then, has been largely consistent with that. Now, it's one month's data and who knows, but it's been largely consistent with that. FT: The estimates in the February inflation report suggest that at the end of Q1, we are three quarters of the way through the contraction, as far as my estimate of your quarterly path goes. Do you think we are three quarters of the way through the recession? SD: It's very hard to say so I'm not going to, it's difficult to know. A story, in the central view, which is there's contraction coming through and a gradual recovery by the turn of the year as a significant stimulus that plays out would suggest that we've seen a substantial amount of the total contraction we're going to see has come through. But, A, there is a clear downside risk to that and, B, I think your question was framed in terms of recession. And I always get worried about recessions because statisticians can have one view of recessions and if people are losing their jobs or houses, they can have a very different view of recessions. And so I worry about being too particular and too technical about contractions about, but I think in a central view, we would have seen a substantial amount of the contraction that we expect to see by the time we get through the first half of this year. FT: And the IMF forecasts, although this is obviously unofficial at the moment, are worse than the central view, and I think actually worse than the mean of your forecasts. So they had in mind 3.8 and a very small negative number for 2010 which suggests a fall in output, through the whole of this year. Do you feel that's then a slightly too negative view? SD: I don't want to comment on the IMF data because I haven't seen the IMF data. It's one of those worlds where, I think the press think they've seen the IMF data but we certainly haven't because I don't think they're finalised yet. They certainly haven't been published yet so I can't comment on their data. I guess there are two stories here. The fundamental story is that we have a significant amount of stimulus feeding through this economy, partly related to the b monetary and fiscal stimulus we've seen and the support provided by the banking package. And then on top of that, the reduction we've seen in sterling and the reduction that we've seen in energy commodity prices. You add all those up; the scale of that stimulus is significant and significantly greater than that seen in comparable points in previous recessions. So that's why, in some sense, all forecasters are going to have a view of recovery at some point. And then we're asking, how quickly does it come through? And I guess point number one of that is, it's hugely uncertain and there are risks. I think one reason why I think my view is the data, thus far, has come in consistent with the view that we will start to see this easing in the pace of contraction through this year, and there are gradual signs of recovery, are the data since February report have been consistent with that. They saw the basic components of that. One is, we do see, we've seen a substantial de-stocking in the Q4 data, so a significant part of the falling out in Q4, which related to stock building. We know that, for stock building to continue to make that sort of contribution to growth, we need firms to keep running down their stocks at ever increasing rates - we know that can't happen. So just arithmetically, at some point, we would expect that stock cycle to come to an end as stocks get back to more normal levels. I don't know how much thought or what the IMF's view is, or other people's views are on that stock cycle. So that's one aspect. I think some other bits, you can point to some of the indicators which do seem to have started to stabilise and the key output stabilises; CIPS services indicators, they've stopped falling for three months. One can talk about the retail sales data that has held up a little bit better. You know, there are a number of pieces of data which are weak, in any absolute sense, but they're not continuing to get weaker and weaker, which is what you would expect to see. Who knows about the precise pattern? And I think I feel more confident about the fact that we will see a gradual recovery. There's no precise timing, but I think some of these components you can point to. The other thing in the Q4 data which is encouraging was the contribution from net trade, where particularly on the import side, there are signs, when you look at what's happening to the pattern of expenditure and relative to imports, it appears that you start to see some signs of expenditure switching from foreign produced output to domestic output. It's exactly the role we'd expect the exchange rate to play both in terms of imports and exports, and there were signs of that in the data as well. FT: I suppose if you were to play devil's advocate, you would point to other bits of data like the manufacturing or the industrial production data which was very weak at the start of Q1. And the downward revisions to other countries, so we would expect that exports, even if imports are falling very fast, exports are also going to be falling pretty fast. And so our international contribution to growth is probably worse than we thought a little while ago. How do you see the downside risks at the moment? SD: I think there are two or three downside risks. One downside risk clearly is what's happening in the world, and I wouldn't disagree with you that, on balance, the data about the world, the global outlook since February has been to the downside. The somewhat encouraging aspect of that is my impression from going to international meetings, and this was consistent with the governor's read from the G20 which he mentioned in his speech the other day, was when you sit around a table with other policy makers from other countries, you do get the impression that there's a very clear understanding of the need for policy makers to respond boldly and decisively to what's going on. So I think the world economy is a risk but that risk is mitigated somewhat by the determination of policy makers, and I think that was, a good example of that is in terms of the FOMC's decision yesterday. That's one risk. The second risk, which is another global risk, but it's both here and abroad, is in terms of the speed with which we manage to stabilise the banking system and get normal levels of bank lending happening again, and the financial markets stabilised. If we end up with a more sluggish recovery, that could be one strong candidate. If we were at a year's time and it was lower, and you say well, where did you go wrong? That would be one. And I think the third thing where it could go wrong is just the confidence effects. I think a key part of understanding the dynamic of the slowdown thus far is that we've seen a fall off in confidence. And the ability of policy makers, I think at the moment, part of what policy makers do is, they need to do the fundamental policies in the right way to stimulate demand, but also they need to make sure that they communicate those policies in such a way so as to provide reassurance to households and corporates about the future. FT: Was the trans-Atlantic spat between Finance Ministers over whether they were doing sufficient fiscal stimulus and other stimulus last week helpful in terms of communication? SD: I wasn't involved in the G20 thing at all so I can't comment on whether there was a spat or anything about that. FT: What can policy makers do to create confidence? What is the right strategy? You've done a lot of work on communications. What is the right thing to do? SD: One aspect of what to do is to go out and communicate more clearly and more urgently about your view of the economy. I think you have to tell it straight. Things are bad at the moment. Output is falling. Unemployment is rising. I think you have to tell that straight. But then you also have to say this is what we are doing about it and this is why we think we will gradually start to see signs of recovery towards the end of this year. And explain that outlook and explain the policy actions you're doing to that. I think there's also a potential role, and this is more a potential fiscal policy role than a monetary policy role, but you can think about designing policies which help to provide safety nets in the case of bad events. So for example, in a world where confidence is low and uncertainty is high, it makes sense for, households and corporates may start to behave quite cautiously - financial pull back in investments, households increase their cautionary savings, and for some households and corporates, that's a very sensible and prudent thing to do. They should do that. But the risk is, in a world where confidence is low, far more people behave in that way than actually are likely to be affected by the economy, and that acts to exacerbate the downturn. And so one role for policy makers is to find that safety net. An example of that would be the mortgage holiday that the government announced where if you go through a period of temporary hit to income, that you have ability to defer mortgage interest payments for a couple of years. That may end up providing reassurance to far more households than will actually ever use the policy, so it can provide that sort of reassurance aspect. I think the primary thing is for policy makers to do their jobs properly, which is to be clear, set the right policies and be clear and transparent in explaining why they think they will work. But then we also want to think about the design of some policies to help act as a safety net. FT: Can you think that, your characterisation of what some households might be doing, that it's right for some to be cautious but for others, they may actually be exacerbating the downturn. Is that a sense of what is happening at the moment? SD: I'm not sure that you can see, that you would point to many things at the moment to suggest it's happening at the moment. I think, compared with many commentators, and compared to my own priors, retail sales data over December, January period have held up stronger than you would have thought. If you look at consumer confidence measures, they've tended to pick up. And it's striking that the components of the consumer confidence measures, which have picked up most, are the forward looking components. That may help people feel more confident about their own personal situation I don't think I'm seeing it (the detrimental effects of excessive savings) yet, but I think it's a risk. FT: And is there excessive saving among companies, because investments have fallen? SD: Investment has fallen. Investment retention remains very low. Now, in a world where you expect output to be pretty sluggish, your capacity within your firm is pretty comfortable at the moment and credit conditions are tight. It would be odd if investment retentions were bullish. It's not obvious that they seemed to have moved by and extreme amount. And again, you can point to some of the most recent surveys where business confidence has come off its real low levels. All these measures remain absolutely low but they don't seem to be showing continual falls. You're not seeing that in some of those indicators. FT: Both you and the Governor have now said that you're doing more in terms of stimulus than in any time in the bank's history. Do you have a rule of thumb or something that gives us a sense of, in normal times, how much of a boost to both growth and inflation all the bits of stimulus would deliver? These range from monetary, fiscal and everything that's going on, low energy prices - there are a lot of things - how big is that and what would we think about that? And then how have our thoughts changed given the financial crisis? SD: No, is the answer. I don't. And it's hard because a lot of these stimuli are themselves in response to the shocks that we are facing. Therefore, the mechanisms by which they're responding are different. So I don't think it's simple to say that demand shock is doing this, the stimulus is doing that, and you add them up and you get to a number. I'm not sure I can think of a way of doing that. FT: Okay. But in normal times, it is large. And you go around saying it's a largest in 300 years, so you must have a sense… SD: I think the Governor has talked about the actions. It is up to the Governor to say what he says. But the point I made was the stimulus, as a whole, in terms of monetary, fiscal, exchange rate, the falls in commodity prices - we had a nice little table in the last inflation report - when compared with previous recessions and it's just very large. Now, the impact of a bank rate cut when spreads are rising and firms aren't lending is somewhat less. So you have to offset the effect of that stimulus. But in some sense, that's a shock to which you're responding, and that's why I'm reluctant to try and give any rule of thumb because I'm not sure I meaningfully can. FT: Does this mean that it's actually very hard for us and you to have any faith in your monetary [?] output and your inflation and growth forecasts because really, we don't know either the demand side or the stimulus side? Are we pretty much in the dark?. SD: No. All economic forecasts are uncertain. Are you telling me I'm certain about my forecast? No. I'm completely uncertain and if anything, we're more uncertain at the moment than in normal times. And I think the Bank has consistently bored you and many others explaining the importance of thinking about forecasts of distributions and the importance of stressing risks and so on. That remains even more the case now than before. All I'm saying is I think if you ever ask me to tell, at any point, in any forecast, can you separate out, into a forecast where you're taking all the different components together, can you parcel out each of those effects and would you have confidence? I don't think I would. FT: But you are thinking of different interest rates paths, so you do have…? SD: Yes, so I can do that one experiment, yes. FT: If you can't do that, you must have vague rules of thumb in your mind. We know the stimulus is big, and I don't want to belabour the point. But if you're trying to raise confidence and make sure that people don't become depressed about how badly the economy and you want to do it at a time when it does look very difficult, it is important to have some sense of how big it is. And I've been trying to ask a lot of policy makers… SD: Have they already given you an answer yet? FT: They've tried. SD: What I could do, and I don't have the numbers to hand; I could run experiments where I could say suppose, just holding everything else constant, commodity and oil prices fell, that increases purchasing power of families, what would that do to consumption? Hold that. And then I could do the next bit. I could add all that up. I must admit, for a household who is concerned about unemployment and worried about their job, they may find that a bit of an odd thing. They may think it odd to hear that they are better off and that their consumption should rise when they may be completely different in a world where they're thinking about the fact that their house has lost value and the guy down the road has lost his job. FT: I'm not going to continue asking the same question you won't answer. Saving on households, you've said that you've been rather surprised that retail sales have been holding up. Do we trust the ONS retail numbers now? Are we more confident in those relative to the retailers? And is it the time to expect a big rise in savings in more households now? SD: The ONS data, I think the values data for the ONS, the discrepancy between that and the surveys in recent months has lessened, and so I think all data, we tend to place weight on both. But the discrepancy between those two has lessened in terms of the values data. The reason why I'm stressing this value volumes thing is we know that the deflator used by the ONS is, the weights are out of date and they will be revised, and that when they are revised, it is very likely that the volumes data will be revised down. And so in some sense, I know that now and I'm taking that into account, but it's important, so I'm not going to be surprised with the volumes data… FT: It goes down backwards as well [?], will they? SD:Yes. FT: But even though some of the retail sales data and industry surveys were not as bad as expected, it is clear that demand for durable goods and even intermediate goods is still very weak, if not still falling. Does that concern you, the fact that big ticket items are not going on sale? Big ticket items don't appear to be to be moving in this economy.. SD: In some sense, I had expected part of the contraction output I expect to see, and have seen, I think is a function of consumption falling. And relative to that benchmark, the surprising thing is that retail sales haven't come off more. The durables consumption in some sense was part of the story, just as I was expecting to see. And I think what we need to see further ahead is what is going to happen to the savings ratio? Are we just seeing different parts of the consumption basket adjusting in different ways or, as is sometimes the case, that the durables consumption is reacting more quickly to shocks, and you're going to see this permeate into other types of consumption? And I think that's a key risk and that's exactly the key risk I was talking about earlier. If we see a substantial rise in the savings ratio - and we do expect the savings ratio to pick up - or put another way, if we see households reacting to the increasing uncertainty by increasing the levels of savings, they want to save for, buffer stops and save for rainy days, that will cause the recovery to be delayed and postponed. FT: Is there a level of savings rates that you would regard as troubling, say a pattern that emerged similar to that of the 1990s, post the 1990s recession? SD: No, because again, and I know I'm not very helpful here but it all depends on the context in what it's doing, so I don't think there's any one variable. But if we saw it shooting up and up, and nothing else is filling its place, then clearly that's going to mean that demand growth is less than you would otherwise have. And that's, in terms of our desire to stimulate normal demand, that's going to be problematic. FT: You set QE according to your sense of the outlook, and presumably some sense of the most likely outlook? What will you do if things get worse despite QE? SD: We do more. The purpose of QE is just like the purpose of setting interest rates more generally, or the monetary policy more generally. We do whatever it takes in order to hit the inflation target. If the economy does not respond enough, the thought experiment is exactly the same with interest rates. If you learn that the demand shock is greater than you think it is, then you will act on that policy and take the actions accordingly, in order to achieve the objective. FT: What's your sense of how QE is most likely to work to boost nominal spending? There are many channels that you have, which are the important ones? SD: Right. Again, my primary answer to that question is, 'I'm not sure'. I will give you a more helpful answer as well, but my general philosophy going into this is to be incredibly pragmatic and eclectic. We don't know the pace and the relative size of these different channels, and we're going to learn about that. We should enter this as an approach, rather than saying, 'This one is going to work and this one doesn't work and we're going to push on this rather than that.' In my view, we should go in saying, 'We'll see and we'll learn, and we'll adjust accordingly.' Now, let me help you out a little bit more, by saying what sort of different channels am I hoping to see, and I guess mine are a bit hard, because they're not completely distinct. I think that there are three different channels through which this can operate. First, we're buying gilts on the curve, and that's caused yield already on the curve to fall quite significantly. Over time, that's going to lead to a reallocation of investors' portfolios into other types of assets, such as corporate bonds. That will then, in principle lead to a lowering in the yields on those other types of borrowing, and a corresponding increase in the price of assets. That has a story where borrowing rates available to household and corporates should come down in line. The second channel is we've increased significantly the degree of liquidity in the economy. That liquidity by itself may help to stimulate borrowing and lending, so banks' deposits are likely to increase substantially as a result, as a first line of these asset purchases. They now have a ready source of funding to finance additional borrowing, if they wish. As this liquidity permeates out to the corporate sector, companies may feel less hindered by the need to haul liquidity and make them feel more comfortable undertaking certain types of spending, investment decisions. Liquidity is improved, so that's the second channel. And, the third channel is the purchases we're making of private sector assets, to improve the functioning of corporate markets. If they're successful, then you have proven that liquidity in those corporate markets should enable firms to be able to (improve). The availability of credit to corporates will improved, and allows firms to more easily raise finance via those capital markets at lower spending costs. That again has a cost channel effect, and also it helps to take some of the pressure off the banks as well. So, they're my three channels for which…now, I think many people would have other variants, but they're the three that I can fit various other things in. FT: And, in those, how do you think it's going in those three areas so far? SD: I'm afraid we can't say very much. It's a bit like saying when we change bank rates and after a week, we say, how is it going? FT: We've seen corporate bonds [overtalking]. SD: But, there's encouraging bits of news. We can't say much but there are some encouraging signs. I guess I would say there were three encouraging signs. Let me just…the first one isn't quite a price thing, but it relates to some of the communication things we were saying earlier. The reception, the reaction to the announcement, both by the financial markets and the public more generally, I think, has been pretty measured. People seem to understand what we're trying to do and why we're trying to do it, and that, I think, is an encouraging thing. I think it's an encouraging development. Some people have criticised the policy, of course. Some say we do too much, some say we're not doing enough and that's only right and proper. But I think I'm encouraged by the general measured and informed reaction. Secondly, we have seen gilt yields respond to the announcement at our initial purchases. Gilt yields are down, depending on where you look at the curve, by about 60 to 80 basis points, and if you look at non-financial corporate bond yields, they're down 30 to 50 basis points. You've already got some of the impacts feeding through into lower funding costs. The third thing is in terms of our operations within specific credit markets, we announced today our corporate bond scheme, and we put a market notice out today, explaining the operations, and those operations start next week. Within the commercial paper market, it seems to be having the sort of effects we want, in the market intelligence and the analysis we're doing shows people are able to issue commercial paper at tighter spreads than was the case before. We've had companies coming up to us, saying,' I wasn't sure whether to issue my commercial paper directly to you, or into the market, so I've actually decided to do it into the market, because I can actually get the paper away at the same price at which you were offering, which a month ago would have been impossible,'. I think we are starting to see some of those dividends. FT: Are you hearing from businesses in some of the really hard pressed sectors that they are able to finance more easily? SD: The people we're speaking to are those who are registered with our scheme to issue commercial… FT: Those are existing commercial paper issuers, right? SD: They don't have to be existing, because they can join the scheme. They don't have to be. There is no rule here, which I think may have been the rule in some other countries that you'd have to have an existing programme. You have to have a rating, so there's a process you have to go through, but there's nothing stopping a new firm going through that process. FT: There has been some speculation that the Bank might be uncomfortable with certain aspects of the asset purchase facility, because in effect it required you to take on credit risk. I realise that you're talking about high quality bonds, but I've been picking up that there was some discomfort about relying solely on credit ratings, or heavily on credit ratings in making your judgement. To what extent is this weighing on your considerations? SD: There are two issues here. One is, in terms of the credit risk, we have a government indemnity for all the risk associated with these operations, so in that sense, that's only right and proper and so it's not affecting, it won't have any risk to our balance sheet. I think more generally, the general point is many people's interpretation of what are the contributory factors to the general crisis we're going through at the moment is that rating agencies are fallible and that we need to find other ways. We shouldn't rely 100% on ratings. In that world, it would seem a bit odd if we set up new schemes and said,'All we're going to look at is the rating agency and they're perfect.' I think our response is just we know ratings aren't perfect, and we're going to use them, but we use other things as well as cross checks. I hope everybody will get to the point where they all think hard about ratings agencies and stop relying 100% on them. FT: I didn't think of that as one of your natural tasks. Are you going to outsource that in some way, or how are you going to do the analysis? I don't think there are corporate bond analysts at the Bank. SD: No, that's perfectly true. I think we developed some of those skills when we were doing the SLS, and I think we are buying in some of those skills as well. FT: Mm-hmm, from existing investment advisers? SD: Or via hiring people as well. FT: I see. SD: In terms of managing credit risk, you first of all work out the riskiness of the asset. That is the point you're making about the process we're going to use to do that. Then you then go out and you set the appropriate haircuts to cover you for that risk,. There's always clearly uncertainty in these things, so there's always a risk that you may suffer losses. But in principle, those haircuts over a period of time should provide sufficient compensation to cover for any individual losses. FT: Is it possible that the haircut that now exists in the market is exactly what is needed, and that you won't be able to offer spreads any better? SD: Okay, so this is a key point. What we're trying to do here is not affect credit spreads. What we're trying to do here is the over and above credit spreads, liquidity premia look high. For a plausible level of credit spreads, the overall spread just looks too big and what we're trying to do is not directly affect credit spreads, because that would seem an odd thing for us to try and second guess other people. What we're saying is for plausible estimates at credit spreads, the overall credit spread we're seeing is significantly greater than that and that reflects liquidity problems. What we're trying to do in each of these markets is not manage our credit spreads, but reduce the liquidity premium. FT: Can you decompose the spread into credit liquidity effectively, do you think? SD: You can do a whole range of different models. You can use things like Credit Default Swaps (CDSs) as one way of doing it. You can do fundamental analysis about the likelihood of default. You can do historical analysis of defaults in previous recessions and you can do a whole range and then you can cross, and you can get your best estimate. You can't perfectly do it, but there's a range of techniques which you can use to produce different estimates. FT: There have been suggestions, and in fact it said so in the minutes, that actually this asset purchase facility would be a very small part of the sum, and there was some suggestion that small meant 10 to 15 billion perhaps, but not much more than that. Are we right in thinking that? SD: So I think there's a danger of comparing apples and oranges when we're comparing the operation to increase the supply of money in the economy by buying assets and what we're trying to do in terms of the credit markets. What we're trying to do in terms of the credit market is improve liquidity. Now, in lovely textbook models, if a person comes along with huge pockets and said, 'I'm all trading this market and increasing liquidity,', they end up never having to actually buy anything, because just the knowledge that they stand ready means everybody starts trading with each other and its success. FT: And, what do you think you can do? SD: I'm not suggesting that we have unlimited, deep pockets and so on, but part of what we're doing here is, if we're successful, an element of success could correspond to us actually purchasing very few assets over a period of time. If the market has improved, liquidity has improved and (markets) can start to differ again, in that world that would be a definition of success,. It is not a definition of somehow the programme is not pulling it's weight or being important,. The amount of assets we're going to have to purchase to generate that, we don't know that yet. But it shouldn't be seen as an indicator of its relative importance. FT: Now, from your perspective, thinking about QE generally speaking, it's most ideal if the people who tender their bonds to you are not banks, ultimately, they're investors. Do you have measures in place to figure out who the ultimate tenders are? SD: We have a whole range of different indicators. As you well know, via the auctions, we buy it via the gilt-edged market makers so we don't observe (end sellers) that directly. We have a whole range of indicators, including market intelligence, where we're going out and just speaking to people, and finding it out, so over a period of time, I think we will learn who these sellers are. FT: Yes, I had talked to some of the institutional holders of bonds who said that their bids weren't being taken up. They thought that your initial auctions may have consisted of quite a bit of loose stock, and I just wondered whether you had some measures in place to either tilt your auction to ensure that you get it from those who are not the depositors. In other words, to put it into the hands of those who are likely to recycle it in some way? SD: No, so I don't think we're going to tilt the auctions in one way or another, because I think the nature of the auction is it's impossible to know who those investors are, if they're dealing via an intermediary. I guess I'd make two points. My understanding is that bank holdings of gilts are pretty minimal compared to the amounts we're doing. Therefore the risk that we're going to buy a substantial amount of gilts from banks, I don't think is likely. Secondly, to the extent that banks do hold gilts, they will tend to hold shorter maturity gilts. We're not buying gilts with a maturity of less than five years. Part of the reason why we chose the maturity ranges was to ensure that there was less chance of us buying gilts from banks. I think those two reasons mean I am reassured that this is not a first order issue. FT: And, the reason you don't want to buy from banks, is that just because of the money market channel, or the channel that they will buy another asset? SD: Well… FT: Because it's going to end up in a bank anyway? SD: Yes, one way of characterising this is by not purchasing from the banks you know almost certainly you're going to get an increase in bought [?] money and so you can then start with those types of channels, and start to offer that. FT: Yeah, but you get an increase in M4 anyway, if you bought from a bank? SD: No, I don't think you do. But, more generally, by going to non-bank investors, there's less chance that if banks are catching the strain at the moment and aren't keen to lend out, there's clearly some risk that the banks won't actually lend out those funds. If we are able, and if we start dealing with non-banks, that mitigates that issue. We start to see this reallocation of the rest of the portfolio, which we were talking about. FT: One of the things that you were just talking about, brings up the whole issue of exit strategy. If you could just be the guy with deep pockets and you don't actually have to do anything, just the announcement effect solves everything. In terms of exit strategies, how quickly can you roll back QE, do you think? SD: As quickly as we put it in, and I think that's really important. So, the inflation target is symmetric, therefore our behaviours have to be symmetric. We will need to be equally as bold and decisive when we're withdrawing this thing as it is when we put it in. The key point of what we're doing here is trying to hit the inflation objective, the inflation target objective. That's the whole raison d'etre of QE and therefore the amount of QE we've been doing and the automatic purchases we carry out initially will be a function of our view of the medium term outlet of inflation, and how it relates to the inflation target. Likewise, the time at which we start taking the stimulus out, by combination of both reversing the assets with purchases and also by raising bank rates will be a function of the outlook relative to the inflation targets. The good news is as an exit strategy, that's very open, it's transparent and it's open to public scrutiny by people such as yourself. You can hold us to account, to make sure that we are behaving exactly the way we say we are. FT: But you're sort of talking about auctions of five or six billion a week? SD: Yes, but my view is that just because you (used) bank rates at some sort of effective way around and then started QE doesn't mean, I think, you have to go back in the same way. If the market sees ordering reasons, there's a limit on the pace of which you sell back gilts. Then you can raise bank rates at the same time. FT: How will you know when it's time to roll back? What will you look for, to tell you that QE has worked and now is the time to roll back? SD: Our forecast for inflation will be sustained, that if we don't roll back, we'll overshoot the inflation target, so I'm sorry, I know it's a bit of a banal answer to your question, but ultimately all of this will be judged by the outlook for inflation targets, just like all other monetary policy actions. FT: Would you expect, for instance, would you be looking at things like M4 stripped out for interbank transactions? Is it guidelines like that to tell you this is working? SD: I don't think our approach to analysing the economy is going to be substantially different to before, so if you had come to me a year ago and asked what key factors are you going to look at, to decide when you're going to cut rates, I would have said, I can't tell you, because I'm going to look at the whole economy. I am going to look at it in that context, and we'll see what that says about the medium term outlook for inflation and we'll make that judgement. That is true when we're reversing this policy as well. I think there's potential for misunderstanding. That is because particular variables, like nominal demands, having increased in importance and somehow that now becomes a key indicators of what we're trying to do. I don't think that's right. I think at any one point in time in the economy, when you're looking at particular shocks you must try to understand the nature of that shock. You focus on a particular variable. That doesn't mean that variable has suddenly risen in status and has become some sort of intermediate target or some key indicator. Rather it's when you're trying to understand the nature of that shock, you focus on it at the moment. The nature of the monetary and credit contraction we're seeing at the moment means the growth brought of credit, the growth of nominal demand are key features in understanding the nature of the shock. That is why we're going to look at those, but the general approach to policy is exactly the same as always. We look at all the variables and take a view about the medium term outlook. FT: Can you envisage a world…is this impossible, that you could have QE to be very effective on nominal demand and very ineffective on real demand? So, that we get real demand being extremely sluggish, maybe even contracting, but we get a lot of inflation and not much growth? So, the nominal demand doesn't actually have any real effect? SD: I think that what a Central Bank can do is stimulate nominal demand. What it's harder for it to do is control in a dynamic sense, and in a transitional sense the price volume split of that. We can help make sure that the inflation component comes out right by having a credible policy. That means that people's inflationary expectations are anchored around 2%. I think the likelihood of the sort of outcomes you're describing will depend in part on your view about the nature of the shocks affecting the economy at the moment. They depend to what extent are some of the adjustments we're seeing real adjustments. There's an adjustment in household balance sheet, which is the real thing, and monetary policy can make sure that adjustment is a smooth process, but it can't avoid that process. It that is a necessary adjustment in real spending? Will it give you a different path that is more likely than the split here.. FT: If, let's say, in a year or two's time we've had 2% inflation, so the inflation target has been hit perfectly but no growth at all, how would that make you as policy makers feel? SD: We'd be very uncomfortable. If you said to me now, would that be an acceptable outcome, if we hit the inflation target, I think the answer would be no. But then what we'd then have to understand is why that is. What is going on, and what factors are causing the real economy to be so weak, and is there a role for monetary policy to play there. If not, what other policies should we be doing? FT: Well, I just wanted to ask about something else about counter cyclical capital requirements. I don't know of anyone in the world who actually disagrees with the idea of it as the great new hope of banking regulation for the future. I guess it's for regulators to decide who has their fingers on the levers. But in another situation like we've just been in, where monetary policy is control and demand, and let's say everything works as we liked. Wouldn't the body controlling those counter cyclical requirements be in effect setting monetary policy because it would have the ability to control interest rates paid by households and businesses. That is because banks are profit maximising institutions and would price their loans to take account of higher capital requirements. SD: So, I am not sure about the separability proposition. I won't surprise you by being the first person in the world who disagrees with counter cyclical regulation. My view is that in terms of macro policy at the moment, there's a strong literature in understanding about the need for fiscal monetary coordination. I think what will go hand in hand with this developments is that we will bank regulators become more aware of the need for monetary regulatory coordination. I think the appropriate setting of bank rate will be a function of what is going on in terms of the regulatory authorities. If the regulatory authorities are behaving in such a way as to affect the volume and price at which credit is being offered, that will clearly have implications for monetary policy. That is why we need to have coordination. I think that argument is distinct from the idea which I also agree with, that bank rates alone are not a very good instrument to tackle these things with. The fact that it's not a very good instrument or a very effective instrument to try and tackle some of these problems doesn't mean it's entirely independent of it. Does that make sense? FT: So, on the first of those, are you saying that on monetary policy - and tell me if this is wrong - that you would want to lean against the wind, if the regulatory authorities were too lax? That you would want to set the bank rate to move accordingly? SD: What I was saying was in an ideal world, when the regulatory authorities were doing what you wanted them to do, that would have implications, just like the degree of fiscal stimulus has implications for bank rates. Likewise the nature of the regulatory authority and the extent to which that was being changed in response to risks would affect bank rates as well. FT: But, is that really a change from the past? Surely it's always been that way? SD: No, it's not a change from the past but if you move to a world where some aspects of the regulatory regime are designed explicitly in a classical way, that will be a different nature. The nature of the interaction will not fundamentally changed. It's just going to be heightened in importance. FT: So, you're saying that no, you wouldn't particularly see (monetary policy) leaning against the winds if the regulatory authorities fail? Or as we now believe they failed in the recent upswing, then you wouldn't now be thinking of setting tighter policy because bank rates are not the right tool? Do you hope that they would have had some tighter capital requirements or provision or whatever? SD: I'm saying that (monetary policy) remains our tool with contingency at bank rate to hit the inflation target. I remain of the view that bank rate is a pretty poor instrument to try and tackle some of these issues, and I hope as we go forward we learn from the errors we've made in the past that we get to a world where we have a regulatory regime better suited to avoid these sort of problems again. In the future, and all I was saying is, a corollary, an aspect of that will be a need for monetary and regulatory coordination. FT: Just to think through, so if the regulators or the authorities do set banking regulations such that it's tighter in the next upswing, how do you think that will affect interest rates, as faced by companies and households? Do you think that will affect those, if the spread over bank rates rise? SD: So, to an extent it does, to an extent that those regulatory regimes prevent banks or private pricing centres (from aggressive pricing) and that leads to an effective tightening, then yes. In that world, the appropriate start of bank rate would be different to a world where they won't be behaving that way. That is purely the point I was making. FT: Do you think that the channel through which monetary policy has worked in the past is going to be the same after this? SD: Yes, the fundamental structures of the economy can't change. The key channels through which the monetary policy operates won't change, but the appropriate setting of policy will be a function of other types of policies in existence. It is a function of fiscal policy and it's always been a function of the regulatory regime, but if the regulatory regime is being used in a more counter cyclical way, then that will have more direct feedback back onto the other bank rates."
326,1994-07-06,1994-07-07,Financial Times,LONDON STOCK EXCHANGE - SHARES GIVE GROUND AGAIN ON CURRENCY WORRIES - MARKET REPORT.,"Nervousness regarding progress at the US Federal Open Market Committee meeting increased yesterday and UK shares turned down smartly in mid-afternoon. Trading volume remained light, however, and equities closed above the day's lows. The second half of the session was dominated by the dollar and the US Federal bond markets, both of which turned lower as New York absorbed strongly worded comments from the German economics minister. Markets grew fearful that the Federal Reserve might either take no action on rates or lift them by 1/2 percentage point. Either course would threaten problems for currency and bond markets. The FT-SE 100 Index closed 18.3 down at 2,946.7. Around 4 points of the Footsie fall reflected the heavy setback in GEC, which was among the most actively traded shares after severely disappointing City analysts with virtually unchanged profits. A market now looking for growth of around 6% overall in UK corporate earnings this year is no longer prepared to be forgiving of slow progress, even when accompanied by a cash mountain, as is the case with GEC. The reaction to GEC's figures helped to upset equities in early trading. However, news that UK manufacturing output had grown by 0.3% in May, and industrial output by 0.1%, was favourably received, as was the UK Treasury monthly report which said that economic indicators signal steady economic recovery. The market was also helped by a trading programme, said to be from NatWest Securities, investment arm of the UK investment bank. A second programme was later identified, with Smith New Court believed to be the house responsible. Weakness in sterling against the German D-Mark was a discouraging factor at first for UK blue chip exporting stocks, although domestic interest rate concerns remained more closely focused around the dollar's progress. The fall in the US currency as New York opened brought a rash of red on to trading screens in the London equity market. The earlier low point for the day was quickly lost as investors shied away, but nerves steadied as the dollar picked itself up off the floor. London traders went home to watch television for any move by the Federal Reserve. Once again, a contrary performance from the FT-SE Mid 250 Index, 2.4 firmer at 3,438.2, suggested determined bargain hunting across the broad range of the market. Seaq trading volume of 506.2m shares showed improvement against recent levels, although it remained well short of acceptably profitable levels. Non-Footsie stocks made up around 59% of the day's total. Retail business, the more convincing valuation of investment activity in equities, remained disappointing as the big investors waited for the FOMC and G7 meetings to bring a guide to near term prospects. On Tuesday, retail business was worth only #968.8m, still well below the levels to which the stock market has become accustomed during its bull phase. The comments from Herr Rexrodt, the German economic minister, that the Bundesbank had not favoured the last round of dollar intervention further dispelled hopes for concerted action from the G7 meeting. They also served to focus attention on the meeting this morning of the Bundesbank policy council. (c) The Financial Times Limited 1994. "
327,1994-07-06,1994-07-07,Financial Times,WORLD STOCK MARKETS (AMERICA) - DOW'S STRENGTH MASKS BROAD MARKET DECLINE.,"Wall Street Blue chip issues posted solid gains yesterday, but otherwise US stock prices were mostly flat to lower in light trading after the Federal Reserve's open market committee meeting ended with no hint of any change in monetary policy, writes Patrick Harverson in New York. At the close the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 22.02 at 3,674.50. The strength in the Dow, however, masked weakness in the wider market. The more broadly based Standard and Poors 500 ended 0.24 off at 446.13, the American SE composite eased 0.15 to 423.55 and the Nasdaq composite was 2.59 weaker at 701.00. Trading volume on the New York SE totalled a moderate 236.2m shares. As on Tuesday, trading yesterday was hamstrung by the unwillingness of many participants to become involved in the market while the FOMC was still holding its meeting. When the meeting started on Tuesday, there was considerable speculation that the FOMC might vote to raise interest rates to support the dollar, which has dropped steadily against the yen in recent weeks. Although by yesterday the consensus was that the FOMC would not change monetary policy, and would wait until it saw tomorrow's June employment report before deciding whether to act, uncertainty about the outlook for interest rates continued to restrain demand. There was little subsequent reaction when the meeting ended during the afternoon with no announcement from the Fed, which was taken by analysts as a sign that monetary policy had not been changed. While much of the market languished, the one bright spot was the Dow, which outperformed other indices thanks to strength in a few cyclical stocks, including International Paper, which closed $1 3/4 ahead at $68 3/4, Alcoa, up $1 at $76 7/8, and Caterpillar, climbing $2 3/4 to $104 1/2. Texaco advanced $1 5/8 to $62 1/2 as investors bought more stock following Tuesday's announcement of a major restructuring by the oil group aimed at cutting costs. The share price was given an additional lift yesterday by rat-ings upgrades from two broking houses, Wertheim Schroder and Dean Witter Reynolds. Dime Bancorp was one of the most active stocks on the NYSE, dropping $1 3/8 to $9 1/4 in volume of 3.2m shares after investors signalled their displeasure at news of the savings bank's acquisition of Anchor Bancorp in a $1.2bn stock swap. The news also failed to lift Anchor shares, which ended $3/8 cheaper at $15 1/2. Salomon fell $2 to $45 1/2 after the company warned that it would incur a loss of $200m in the second quarter because of poor results at its Salomon Brothers brokerage unit. The warning hit other brokerage stocks: Morgan Stanley softened $1/4 to $55 5/8, PaineWebber $1/4 to $15 1/2 and Dean Witter Discover $3/8 to $37. Canada Toronto closed modestly lower in light trading after the falling gold bullion price again pushed gold shares downward. The TSE 300 composite index lost 10.2 at 4,043.4 and declines led rises by 409 to 311 after volume of 42.8m shares. Ten of the 14 sub-indices lost ground, with the golds group weakening 1.5% as the price of gold in New York dipped $2.10 an ounce to $383.85. The transportation group gained 1.4%. Laidlaw 'B' rose C$1/4 to C$9 5/8 in anticipation of its third-quarter financial results, expected to be released soon. Brazil Sao Paulo rose 5.3% in local currency terms in strong volume, on optimism over the government's anti-inflation plan and a presidential election poll expected later this week. The Bovespa index ended 1,892 higher at 37,535 and turnover was about RDollars 221.5m ($242.1m). Traders saw local and foreign investors coming back into the market and said a dip in the Sao Paulo price of the basic basket of goods of 0.69% between Monday and Tuesday provided a boost to stocks, given that inflation was running at 1 or 2 percentage points a day before the government's latest anti-inflation plan came into operation.

328,1994-07-06,1994-07-07,Financial Times,MARKETS REPORT - AILING DOLLAR DRIVEN LOWER.,"The dollar lost more ground against both the D-Mark and the yen yesterday as markets assumed that the Federal Reserve would leave interest rates unchanged for the time being, writes Motoko Rich. The US currency lost about 1 1/2 pfennigs against the D-Mark to close in London at DM 1.5685 from DM 1.5826. Against the yen the dollar ended above the session's low of Y 97.70 in London at Y 98.125, down from Y 98.825. In New York, however, it rallied to finish at DM 1.5778 and Y 98.90. Germany's currency remained strong in Europe as investors continued to pressure the Swedish krona, Belgian franc and Italian lira while markets focused on these countries' budget deficits. Sterling followed the dollar down against the D-Mark, hitting a 15-month low against the German currency. As South African President Nelson Mandela reassured businesses that economic policy would remain unchanged under new finance minister Mr Chris Liebenberg, the financial rand held steady against the dollar. As the markets awaited an announcement on the final day of the meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee, the policy-making arm of the Federal Reserve Board, investors bearishly assumed that a dollar support package was not forthcoming and pushed the US currency down to a 14-month low against the D-Mark. Markets were not expecting a rise in US interest rates, and when the Fed added reserves to the banking system it signalled no monetary policy changes. In late trading the dollar came off the session's lows as analysts suggested that the Fed could be waiting to make an interest rate move tomorrow when the US employment figures are released. Hopes for concerted intervention or the emergence of co-ordinated interest rate pol-icies to rescue the dollar collapsed when German economic minister Mr Guenter Rexrodt indicated that the Bundesbank had been opposed to the most recent round of interven-tion on behalf of the dollar. Mr David Cocker, economist at Chemical Bank, said Mr Rexrodt could be playing a psychological game and setting a bear trap. 'But I do not think the German administration or the Bundesbank are overly concerned about the level of the dollar against the D-Mark,' he added. The dollar rallied slightly after Mr Lawrence Summers, undersecretary of the US Treasury for international affairs, said the US currency would be discussed at the G7 economic summit meeting which begins tomorrow in Naples. In addition to benefiting from the dollar's weakness, the D-Mark performed well as it continued to play the safe haven currency for investors repelled by gaping budget def-icits in Sweden, Italy and Belgium. The Swedish krona sagged to SKr5.004 from SKr4.955, breaking through the psychologically important barrier of SKr5.00 against the D-Mark as jittery markets took a negative view of Sweden's raised budget deficit forecast. The Italian lira was also flirting with an important level of L1,000 against the D-Mark as the markets waited for today's publication of Italy's three-year plan, in which the government will need to address its budget deficit. In London the lira closed at L995.5 from L993.8. Mr Steve Hannah, head of research at IBJ International, said the Belgian franc weakened quite sharply against the D-Mark by Belgian standards, as it normally trades within very narrow margins. 'There is a growing concern that the budget will not be settled in a satisfactory way, and that the political coalition is breaking down,' he said. The Belgian franc finished in London at BFr 20.67 from BFr 20.63. Sterling fell to a 15-month low against the D-Mark, mirroring the sickly dollar and further depressed by a rumour that an unnamed UK official said the Treasury would be indifferent even if the pound fell to DM 2.00. Mr Tony Norfield, economist at ABN/Amro, said sterling performed poorly against the D-Mark in spite of good industrial production figures. UK industrial production rose a seasonally adjusted 0.3% in May after 1.6% in April. Analysts said these figures indicated a healthily steady industrial recovery. In the UK money markets, the Bank of England provided #217m liquidity at established rates after forecasting a shortage of #850m. The Bank gave late assistance of #590m. The markets held their ground with the financial rand as Mr Nelson Mandela reassured businesses that economic policy was on course after the resignation of Mr Derek Keys as finance minister. Mr Mandela said Mr Chris Liebenberg, who replaced Mr Keys after he resigned on Tuesday, would 'follow government policy'. The rand finished in London at R4.84 against the dollar from R4.845. The December short sterling futures contract closed at 93.67 from 93.73. The December Euromark contract finished at 94.97 from 94.95. (c) The Financial Times Limited 1994. "
329,1994-07-06,1994-07-07,Financial Times,GOVERNMENT BONDS - TREASURIES SLIP AS FOMC LEAVES POLICY UNCHANGED.,"Longer-dated US Treasury prices slipped lower in light trading yesterday as traders and investors remained on the sidelines following the conclusion of the meeting of the Federal Reserve's open market committee. In late afternoon trading, the benchmark 30-year government bond was down 3/16 at to 84 3/16, yielding 7.600%. However, the two-year note was up 1/32 at 99 13/16, to yield 6.084%. Prices at the long end declined from the start in the wake of a modest weakening in the dollar during early trading. The dollar fell because the perception on Wall Street overnight was that the FOMC would not vote at its meeting to raise interest rates to support the ailing US currency. Analysts said the Fed realised it would send the wrong signal to financial markets if it allowed the foreign exchange speculators, who have been selling the dollar, to dictate the direction of monetary policy. Once the meeting ended without an announcement, it was judged the FOMC had decided to leave policy unchanged, at least until more is known about the state of the economy. The next set of important data is due tomorrow when the June employment report is published. Traders said nervousness ahead of the jobs figures explained why longer-dated prices were stuck in negative territory and trading remained subdued. European government bonds traded nervously yesterday, with dealers eyeing the FOMC meeting and currency volatility. German government bonds ended a directionless session slightly higher on short-covering in the futures market. Investors remained sidelined as they awaited the outcome of the FOMC meeting, today's Bundesbank Council meeting, tomorrow's US employment data and the weekend Group of Seven summit in Naples. Bunds shrugged off the three-basis-point reduction in the Bundesbank's minimum securities repurchase rate to 4.93% and the downward revision of May M3 money supply growth to an annualised 13.4%, from a provisional 13.7%. Although most market participants expect another cut in the Bundesbank's 4.5% discount rate this year, few expect to see it today. 'Cutting again with M3 growth so much above target would damage their credibility,' said one trader. The Bundesbank's M3 growth target range is 4% to 6%. UK gilts ended a jittery session slightly lower in thin volume as investors eyed the FOMC meeting. Trading was dominated by activity in the futures pits and dealers reported sporadic and trendless activity in the cash market. D-Mark strength against sterling added to pressure on gilts, causing the UK market to underperform Germany. French bonds ended the day slightly weaker, depressed by the prospect of today's auction of FFr 19bn-FFr 21bn in medium-and long-dated bonds. Weakness in the French currency against the D-Mark reduced hopes that the Bank of France might follow the Bundesbank's latest rate cut with an easing move today. Swedish bond yields hit a new high for the year, pressured by currency weakness as the krone fell to a low for the year. After Tuesday's auction of government bonds had gone better than expected, many of Tuesday's buyers became sellers yesterday. 'The auction went well because the currency had weakened sharply and yields were high - you got some opportunistic investors into the auction stock who were looking to make money quickly and get out,' said Mr Jouni Kokko, international economist at S. G. Warburg Securities. The yield on the nine-year benchmark bond closed at a new high at 10.73%, a rise of 20 basis points from Tuesday. Spanish bond yields hit a high for the year, dogged by political uncertainty and fears that heavy funding at the short end will push short rates higher. The 10-year benchmark yield rose as high as 11.11%. In Belgium, reports that domestic troubles were weakening prime minister Jean-Luc Dehaene's government, and recent nervousness over the budget outlook, caused short-dated yields to rise sharply.

Weakness in sterling against the German D-Mmark was a discouraging factor at first for UK blue chip exporting stocks, although domestic interest rate concerns remained more closely focused around the dollar's progress. The fall in the US currency as New York opened brought a rash of red on to trading screens in the London equity market. The earlier low point for the day was quickly lost as investors shied away, but nerves steadied as the dollar picked itself up off the floor. London traders went home to watch television for any move by the Federal Reserve. Once again, a contrary performance from the FT-SE Mid 250 Index, 2.4 firmer at 3,438.2, suggested determined bargain hunting across the broad range of the market. Seaq trading volume of 506.2m shares showed improvement against recent levels, although it remained well short of acceptably profitable levels. Non-Footsie stocks made up around 59% of the day's total. Retail business, the more convincing valuation of investment activity in equities, remained disappointing as the big investors waited for the FOMC and G7 meetings to bring a guide to near term prospects. On Tuesday, retail business was worth only #968.8m, still well below the levels to which the stock market has become accustomed during its bull phase. The comments from Herr Rexrodt, the German economic minister, that the Bundesbank had not favoured the last round of dollar intervention further dispelled hopes for concerted action from the G7 meeting. They also served to focus attention on the meeting this morning of the Bundesbank policy council. (c) The Financial Times Limited 1994. "
331,1994-07-06,1994-07-07,Financial Times,WORLD STOCK MARKETS (AMERICA) - DOW'S STRENGTH MASKS BROAD MARKET DECLINE.,"Wall Street Apart from gains in a few blue chip issues, US stock prices were mostly flat to lower in directionless trading yesterday morning as the market's attention remained fixed on the dollar and the second day of the Federal Reserve's open market committee meeting, writes Patrick Harverson in New York. By 1 pm, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 18.13 at 3,670.61. The strength in the Dow, however, masked weakness in the wider market. The more broadly based Standard and Poors 500, for example, was down 0.12 at 446.25, while the American SE composite eased 0.31 to 423.39 and the Nasdaq composite declined 2.06 to 701.53. Trading volume on the New York SE came to 135m shares by 1 pm. As on Tuesday, trading yesterday was hamstrung by the unwillingness of many participants to become involved in the market while the FOMC was still holding its meeting. When the meeting started on Tuesday, there was considerable speculation that the FOMC might vote to raise interest rates to support the dollar, which has dropped steadily against the yen in recent weeks. Although by yesterday the consensus was that the FOMC would not change monetary policy, and would wait until it saw tomorrow's June employment report before deciding whether to act, uncertainty about the outlook for interest rates continued to restrain demand. A modest weakening in the dollar during the morning, and a slight decline in bond prices which pushed the yield on the benchmark 30-year issue back above 7.6%, also contributed to the mostly downbeat session. The one bright spot was the Dow, which outperformed the rest of the market thanks to strength in a few stocks, most notably Texaco, which rose a further $1 3/8 to $62 1/4. Investors have been buying the stock since the company announced a major restructuring on Tuesday aimed at cutting costs, and the share price was given an additional lift yesterday by ratings upgrades from two broking houses, Wertheim Schroder and Dean Witter Reynolds. Another Dow constituent on the rise was Caterpillar, which climbed $2 5/8 to $104 3/8. There was no specific piece of news behind the rise, although it may have been sparked by hopes that the long running industrial dispute between the company and unions may be nearing a resolution. Dime Bancorp was the most active stock on the NYSE, falling $1 1/8 to $9 1/2 in volume of 2.5m shares after investors signalled their displeasure at news of the savings bank's acquisition of Anchor Bancorp in a $1.2bn stock swap. The news, however, lifted Anchor shares $1/16 to $16. Salomon dropped $1 7/8 to $45 5/8 after the company warned that it would incur a loss of $200m in the second quarter because of poor results at its Salomon Brothers brokerage unit. The warning hit other brokerage stocks, including Merrill Lynch, which eased $1/8 to $35, and Morgan Stanley, $1/2 down at $55 3/8. Canada Toronto eased in sluggish early trade on soft gold shares and weaker conglomerates. The TSE 300 composite index had declined 17.19 to 4,036.37 by midsession in 18.94m shares valued at C$231m. Precious metals showed the worst decline, losing 200.43, or 2.1%, at 9,168.17 as bullion slipped on the New York Comex market. Active issues included Nova Corp, up C$3/8 at C$11 1/8 in 2m shares dealt, and Methanex Corp, which continued its upward march with a rise of C$5/8 to C$18 in 921,744 traded. Brazil Sao Paulo advanced 5.6% in local currency terms in low mid-morning volume, on optimism over the government's anti-inflation plan and a presidential election poll expected later this week. The Bovespa index rose 1,990 to 37,633. Traders said a dip in the Sao Paulo price of the basic basket of goods of 0.69% between Monday and Tuesday provided a boost to stocks, given that inflation was running at 1 or 2 percentage points a day before the government's latest anti-inflation plan came into operation.

332,1994-07-06,1994-07-07,Financial Times,WORLD STOCK MARKETS (ASIA PACIFIC) - LATE RISE IN YEN LEAVES NIKKEI LOSING GROUND.,"Tokyo A late rise in the yen triggered arbitrage selling and profit-taking, and the Nikkei 225 average lost ground in low volume, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. The index was down 205.34 at 20,629.03 after a high for the day of 20,878.78 in the morning, and a low of 20,627.43 just before the close. The yen returned to above Y 98 to the dollar, prompting profit-taking in the high-technology sector and depressing the futures market. Volume amounted to 368m shares, against 391m. Small-lot buying by foreigners and institutional investors failed to counter selling by arbitrageurs and dealers. The Topix index of all first section stocks receded 12.84 to 1,670.65, while the Nikkei 300 declined 2.85 to 303.43 and falls led rises by 701 to 330, with 160 issues unchanged. In London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index was 0.07 firmer at 1,352.80. Dealers predicted that equities would trade in a narrow range throughout this week, ahead of the Naples Group of Seven summit tomorrow. A Japanese broker noted large-lot buying orders around the Nikkei 20,500 mark, but more investors waiting to sell around 21,000. Arbitrage selling depressed bank shares. Dai-ichi Kangyo Bank declined Y 40 to Y 1,890 and Bank of Tokyo by Y 40 to Y 1,560. High-technology issues, which had recovered earlier this week on the brief retreat of the yen against the dollar, were sold. Hitachi, Y 1,070, and Fujitsu, Y 1,110, slipped Y 30 apiece. Terumo, the medical equipment maker, rose by its daily limit of Y 200 for the second consecutive day to Y 1,220 on continued bullishness among investors over the company's development of a new three dimensional television screen. Speculative investors continued to buy stocks seemingly linked to the 'hot weather' theme. Traders explained that Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, the most active issue of the day, put on Y 6 at Y 817 due to its popular air conditioner, while Mitsubishi Shindoh, an air conditioner parts maker, gained Y 8 at Y 724. Shikoku Chemicals, a pool disinfectant producer, climbed Y 40 to Y 625. In Osaka, the OSE average slipped 91.07 to 23,252.30 in volume of 41m shares. Roundup Uncertainty about the direction of world and domestic interest rates left most of the Pacific Rim region lower. HONG KONG worried about the weak dollar and the impending end of the US FOMC meeting later yesterday, and a late afternoon sell-off left the Hang Seng index down by 168.27, or 1.95%, at 8,454.92, just off the day's low of 8,449.36. Turnover remained below HKDollars 2bn, registering a preliminary HKDollars 1.84bn against Tuesday's adjusted HKDollars 1.60bn. Brokers said investors were betting on higher interest rates in the short term. Meanwhile, worries about the profits of property developers, the focus of the late sell-off, also dogged the bourse. Cheung Kong weakened HKDollars 1 to HKDollars 31.80 and SHK Properties HKDollars 1.10 to HKDollars 42.20. SYDNEY surrendered recent gains to sink below the 2,000 barrier on the All Ordinaries index, which finished 12.2 points weaker at 1,991.2 and well below an intraday high of 2,010.5. Turnover was nearly A$353m. Trade was marked by Western Mining's announcement of an A$7.5bn alumina merger with Aluminum Co of America and an A$720m rights issue to fund its side of the deal. The stock dipped 50 cents, or 6.7%, to a two-month low of A$7.02. WELLINGTON fell on sell orders just before the close, the NZSE 40 index shedding 13.19 to 1,984.14. SEOUL saw profit-taking in blue chips. The composite index fell 7.01 to 953.48. SINGAPORE's Straits Times Industrial index fell 25.07, or 1.15%, to 2,162.88. Brokers said the sliding US dollar in recent weeks had prompted institutions to sell their Singapore investments as a hedge. KARACHI tried to rise on new account buying early in the day, but institutions and investors took to the sidelines, and attendance at the exchange was poor as rains disrupted communications and power supplies. The exchange closed an hour early, and the KSE 100 index lost 3.32 at 2,296.27 in thin volume. TAIPEI, the exception, concentrated on domestic issues, brokers hoping that the central bank may maintain its loose monetary policy after Tuesday's announcement of June inflation at 2.14%, and the weighted index gained 50.23 at 6,115.18.

333,1994-07-06,1994-07-07,Financial Times,MARKETS REPORT - DOLLAR AILING.,"The dollar lost more ground against both the D-Mark and the yen yesterday as markets assumed the Federal Reserve Board would leave interest rates unchanged for the time being, writes Motoko Rich. The US currency lost about a pfennig and a half against the D-Mark to close in London at DM 1.5685 from DM 1.5826. Against the yen, the dollar closed above session lows of Y 97.70 in London at Y 98.125 from Y 98.825. Germany's currency remained strong in Europe as investors continued to pressure the Swedish krona, the Belgian franc and the Italian lira while markets focused on these countries' budget deficits. Sterling followed the dollar down against the D-Mark, hitting a 15-month low against the German currency. As South African president Mr Nelson Mandela reassured businesses that economic policy would remain unchanged under new finance minister Mr Chris Liebenberg, the financial rand held steady against the dollar. As the markets awaited an announcement on the final day of the meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee, the policy-making arm of the Federal Reserve Board, investors bearishly assumed a dollar support package was not forthcoming and pushed the dollar down to a 14-month low against the D-Mark. Markets were not expecting a rise in US interest rates and when the Fed added reserves to the banking system, it signalled no monetary policy changes. In late trading the dollar came off its session lows as analysts suggested the Fed could be waiting to make an interest rate move tomorrow when the US employment figures are released. Hopes for concerted intervention or the emergence of co-ordinated interest rate policies to rescue the dollar collapsed when German economic minister Mr Guenter Rexrodt indicated the Bundesbank had been opposed to the most recent round of intervention on behalf of the dollar. Mr David Cocker, economist at Chemical Bank, said Mr Rexrodt could be playing a psychological game and setting a bear trap. 'But I do not think the German administration or the Bundesbank are overly concerned about the level of the dollar against the D-Mark,' he said. The dollar rallied slightly after Mr Lawrence Summers, undersecretary of the US Treasury for international affairs, said the US currency would be discussed at the G7 economic summit meeting which begins tomorrow in Naples. In addition to benefitting from the dollar's weakness, the D-Mark performed well as it continued to play the safe haven currency for investors repelled by gaping budget deficits in Sweden, Italy and Belgium. The Swedish krona sagged to SKr5.004 from SKr4.955, breaking through the psychologically important barrier of SKr5.00 against the D-Mark as jittery markets took a negative view of Sweden's raised budget deficit forecast. The Italian lira was also flirting with an important level of L1000 against the D-Mark as the markets waited for today's publication of Italy's three-year plan, in which the government will need to address its budget deficit. In London the lira closed at L995.5 from L993.8. Mr Steve Hannah, head of research at IBJ International, said the Belgian franc weakened quite sharply against the D-Mark by Belgian standards, as it normally trades within very narrow margins. 'There is a growing concern that the budget will not be settled in a satisfactory way, and that the political coalition is breaking down,' he said. The Belgian franc closed in London at BFr 20.67 from BFr 20.63 against the D-Mark. Sterling fell to a 15-month low against the D-Mark, mirroring the sickly dollar and further depressed by a rumour that an unnamed UK official said the Treasury would be indifferent even if the pound fell to DM 2.00. Mr Tony Norfield, economist at ABN/AMRO, said sterling performed poorly against the D-Mark in spite of good industrial production figures. UK industrial production rose a seasonally adjusted 0.3% in May after 1.6% in April. Analysts said these figures indicated a healthily steady industrial recovery. In the UK money markets, the Bank of England provided #217bn at established rates after forecasting a shortage of #850m. The bank provided late assistance of #590m. The markets held their ground with the financial rand as Mr Nelson Mandela reassured businesses that economic policy was on course after the resignation of Mr Derek Keys as finance minister. Mr Mandela said Mr Chris Liebenberg, who replaced Mr Keys after he resigned on Tuesday, would 'follow government policy'. The rand closed in London at R4.84 against the dollar from R4.845. The December short sterling futures contract closed at 93.67 from 93.73. The December Euromark contract finished at 94.97 from 94.95. (c) The Financial Times Limited 1994. "
334,1994-07-06,1994-07-07,Financial Times,GOVERNMENT BONDS - TREASURIES SLIP AS TRADERS AWAIT FOMC DECISION.,"Longer-dated US Treasury prices slipped in light volume yesterday morning as traders and investors stayed mostly on the sidelines while the Federal Reserve's open market committee finished its two-day meeting. By midday, the benchmark 30-year government bond was down 9/32 at 84 3/32, yielding 7.610%. The two-year note was unchanged at 99 3/4, to yield 6.118%. The early decline in prices was attributed to the modest weakening in the dollar during morning trading due to the growing perception on Wall Street yesterday that the FOMC would not vote at its meeting to raise interest rates to support the ailing US currency. Most analysts believe that the Fed realises it would send the wrong signal to financial markets if it allowed the foreign exchange speculators who have been selling the dollar to dictate the direction of monetary policy. Those same analysts believe the FOMC would only raise interest rates if awaited economic statistics indicated the economy needed cooling further. The next set of important data is due out tomorrow when the June employment report is published, and nervousness ahead of the release of the jobs figures was partly to blame for yesterday's early losses and the overall lack of trading activity. European government bonds traded nervously yesterday, with dealers eyeing the FOMC meeting and continuing currency volatility. German government bonds ended a directionless session slightly higher on the back of short-covering in the futures market. Investors remained sidelined as they awaited the outcome of the FOMC meeting, today's Bundesbank Council meeting, tomorrow's US employment data and the weekend Group of Seven summit in Naples. Bunds shrugged off the three-basis-point reduction in the Bundesbank's minimum securities repurchase rate to 4.93% and the downward revision of May M3 money supply growth to an annualised 13.4%, from a provisional 13.7%. Although most market participants expect another cut in the Bundesbank's 4.5% discount rate this year, few expect to see it today. 'Cutting again with M3 growth so much above target would damage their credibility,' said one trader. The Bundesbank's M3 growth target range is 4% to 6%. UK gilts ended a jittery session slightly lower in thin volume as investors eyed the FOMC meeting. Trading was dominated by activity in the futures pits and dealers reported sporadic and trendless activity in the cash market. D-Mark strength against sterling added to pressure on gilts, causing the UK market to underperform Germany. French bonds ended the day slightly weaker, depressed by the prospect of today's auction of FFr 19bn-FFr 21bn in medium-and long-dated bonds. Weakness in the French currency against the D-Mark reduced hopes that the Bank of France might follow the Bundesbank's latest rate cut with an easing move today. Swedish bond yields hit a new high for the year, pressured by currency weakness as the krone fell to a low for the year. After Tuesday's auction of government bonds had gone better than expected, many of Tuesday's buyers became sellers yesterday. 'The auction went well because the currency had weakened sharply and yields were high - you got some opportunistic investors into the auction stock who were looking to make money quickly and get out,' said Mr Jouni Kokko, international economist at S. G. Warburg Securities. The yield on the nine-year benchmark bond closed at a new high at 10.73%, a rise of 20 basis points from Tuesday. Spanish bond yields hit a high for the year, dogged by political uncertainty and fears that heavy funding at the short end will push short rates higher. The 10-year benchmark yield rose as high as 11.11%. In Belgium, reports that domestic troubles were weakening prime minister Jean-Luc Dehaene's coalition government, in addition to recent nervousness over the budget outlook, caused short-dated yields to rise sharply.

335,1996-09-24,1996-09-25,Financial Times,FOMC LEAVES US INTEREST RATES UNCHANGED.,"The Federal Reserve's monetary policy committee yesterday left US interest rates unchanged, causing a mild surprise to the markets. The decision suggested the Federal Open Markets Committee, which is responsible for setting interest rate policy, was not convinced that signs of inflationary pressure in the US economy warranted tightening. The FOMC's decision left the Federal funds rate, the interest banks charge each other for overnight loans, unchanged at 5.25%. It also left unchanged the discount rate, which the Federal Reserve charges banks, at 5%. Analysts were divided over what effect the decision would have on the dollar, although most considered that a rate rise was now most likely to take place after the US presidential elections in November. With the currency markets in Europe closing before the FOMC decision, trading was generally light and within narrow ranges for most currencies, as the market awaited the interest rate news from the US. The announcement of the UK's buoyant current account and growth figures was followed by sterling making small gains against the dollar and the D-Mark. The pound closed against the dollar at $1.5580 by end of trading in London, up slightly from $1.5569 the previous day. Against the D-Mark, sterling finished at DM 2.3576, up from DM 2.3562. The French franc continued its bullish trend against the D-Mark, climbing to FFr 3.383 from FFr 3.385. The D-Mark continued to trade in a narrow band against other European currencies. But it weakened slightly against the yen, to Y 72.52 compared with Y 72.62. The Swedish krona hit a recent high against the D-Mark in intra-day trading at SKr4.32, after yet another cut in the Swedish central bank's repo rate. The krona finished the day at SKr4.351, up from SKr4.359. The Italian lira was stable at L1,006. But Italian government debt markets rose strongly on positive inflation data and growing confidence in the government's ability to pass its 1997 budget through parliament. The benchmark December government bond futures contract rose to a contract high of 119.20, slipping back to a close of 119.15. * Britain recorded its largest current account surplus for nine years in the second quarter of 1996, and its annual rate of economic growth was revised up to 2.2% yesterday. The current account deficit for the second quarter showed a #457m ($712m) surplus after a deficit of #786m in the first quarter. Financial markets had expected a second quarter deficit of around #1.2bn. Mr Tony Norfield, treasury economist at ABN Amro bank in London, said the current account data was good news for the British economy and for sterling. ""The lack of a base rate cut should help sterling - it seems pretty unlikely we'll see any more base rate cuts for a while,"" he said. Official interest rates appeared to have been left unchanged at 5.75% after Monday's monetary policy meeting between Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor of the Exchequer, and the Bank of England. * The Riksbank, Sweden's central bank, showed its faith in the country's economic recovery by cutting interest rates for the twentieth time this year.<Its latest quarterly report on economic and monetary policy said inflation in Sweden was under control. After the publication of the inflation report, the central bank cut its key repo rate by 10 basis points to 5.05%. The repo rate has now dropped by nearly four percentage points, from 8.91% in January. * Mr Romano Prodi, Italy's prime minister, said Italy would face economic ruin if it failed to join Emu. ""There can no longer be a situation where some arrive first and others later, but there will be a large number of countries that enter right away,"" Mr Prodi said. ""Not being among these countries means economic ruin for Italy,"" he said. Mr Prodi said Italy's 1997 budget, due to be presented on Friday, would help Italy clinch a place in Emu.

336,1996-09-24,1996-09-25,Financial Times,CREDIOP ISSUES SEVEN-YEAR FRNS TO RAISE DM 500M.,"As the bond markets' tense vigil for the outcome of the Federal Open Market Committee meeting continued, activity in the eurobond market dried to a trickle, with only a handful of new issues surfacing yesterday. The largest deal of the day was a DM 500m floating-rate offering for Crediop, the Italian financial institution that lends to local authorities. Crediop's credit rating was upgraded by Moody's to Aa3 in July, making it one of the few Italian issuers with the same rating as the state. Moreover, forthcoming redemptions of D-Mark floating-rate paper are expected to provide good support for the transaction, said a syndicate manager at Paribas, joint book-runner with HSBC Trinkaus. ""More than DM 1bn of floating-rate notes are maturing in September and October, and we hope this deal will benefit from some reinvestment demand,"" he said. He reported demand from banks in the Benelux region and Italy, as well as money market funds in the UK and France, in spite of the deal's relatively tight pricing. At the re-offer price, the notes paid a spread of 5.7 basis points over Libor, which widened to full fees - 9 basis points over Libor - in the course of the day, in line with Crediop's dollar-denominated FRNs. In the sterling sector, Yorkshire Building Society issued #200m of five-year floating-rate notes, increased from the initial launch size of #150m due to strong demand, an official at lead Dresdner-Kleinwort Benson said. While it is only the 10th largest UK building society in terms of assets, it ranks third in UBS's relative creditworthiness league table of building societies, after the Halifax and Northern Rock, both of which are due to convert to banks next year. Most of the paper went to UK corporates and financial institutions, he said. In France, Merrill Lynch increased a FFr 1bn issue of 10-year bonds, launched in May at a spread of 51 basis points, by another FFr 1.5bn yielding only 43 basis points over French government bonds. The deal's strong spread performance, which had seen the differential tighten to as little as 38 basis points, lent good support to the new tranche, an official at Banque Paribas, one of the joint leads, said. Also in the French franc sector, dealers are awaiting the next foray by Cades, the government entity set up to manage the country's accumulated social security debts. It is expected to issue up to FFr 20bn - possibly in two tranches of differing maturities - as early as this week. In the emerging markets, the Philippine jumbo 20-year bond, which on Monday had tightened from its launch spread of 225 basis points to 220 basis points, continued to trade well and closed at a spread of 218 basis points over Treasuries. The rest of the sector was muted by the FOMC meeting, but dealers are looking to the forthcoming D-Mark issues for Colombia and the Czech Republic's Komercni Banka.

337,1996-09-24,1996-09-25,Financial Times,EQUITY FUTURES AND OPTIONS TRADING.,"The derivatives sector was marking time yesterday as dealers waited for the outcome of the US Federal Open Market Committee meeting, writes Joel Kibazo. In futures, the December contract on the FT-SE 100 opened on a firm note at 3,954, well ahead of its previous close. Early buying, said to have been mainly by independent (local) traders, saw the contract rise steadily to 3,969. This turned out to be the high of the day as the more cautious view on the interest rate outlook gained the upper hand. December drifted lower for the rest of the morning but later settled to trade in a tight range of 3,940 to 3,950. The early falls on Wall Street did little to improve sentiment while a false rumour about a resignation from the UK government only served to increase the gloom surrounding the market. The contract closed at 3,945, up 2 on its previous close and around 2 points above its estimated fair value premium to cash of 33 points. Turnover rose slightly and closed at 10,809 contracts. Volume in the traded options also improved and reached 43,776 contracts against 37,227 lots on Monday. The FT-SE 100 option saw business of 19,309 lots while 14,584 was dealt in the Euro FT-SE contract. BP was the busiest stock option with a total of 3,015 trades.

338,1996-09-24,1996-09-25,Financial Times,US SHARES MIXED AFTER RATE NEWS.,"Investors showed a mixed reaction to news that the Federal Reserve had decided to leave interest rates unchanged at yesterday's meeting of its Open Market Committee, writes Lisa Bransten in New York. Bluechip shares in the Dow Jones Industrial Average initially surged on the news and then almost as quickly fell back into negative territory in part because of pressure from AT&T, which issued a profits warning early yesterday morning. Just before 3pm the Dow was off 13.68 at 5,881.06 and the Standard &Poor's 500 slipped 0.86 at 686.66 while the American Stock Exchange composite added 0.74 at 564.36. Wall Street economists had been sharply divided over whether the Fed's policy making body would raise interest rates. Technology shares mostly remained higher as they rebounded from the drop seen on Monday. The Nasdaq composite, which is weighted toward that sector, added 3.33 at 1,214.80 and the Pacific Stock Exchange technology index climbed 1.1%.<Semiconductor shares were particularly strong. Intel added $1 1/4 at $97, Applied Materials was up $1 3/8 at $27 5/8, Micron Technology climbed $2 1/2 at $30 1/2, Texas Instruments added $3 1/2 at $55 1/4, Motorola was $1 1/4 stronger at $52 5/8 and National Semiconductor climbed $1 3/8 at $20 1/2. Telecommunications shares were sharply lower on the heels of a warning from the industry giant, AT&T, that competitive pressures in the long distance business would push third quarter earnings as much as 10% below analysts' estimates. AT&T, which is a component of the Dow, was off $5 3/8 or 9% at $51 7/8, MCI Communications shed $1 3/8 or 5% at $25 3/4 and Sprint gave up $1 1/2 or 4% at $40. Interest rate sensitive commercial banks were mostly flat ahead of FOMC news. Citicorp was $1/4 stronger at $89 5/8, Chase Manhattan Bank was unchanged at $79 3/8 and JP Morgan shed $1 at $88 3/4. Pan Am World Airways rose in their first day of trading on the American stock Exchange. Shares in the newest reincarnation of the well-known carrier were priced at $15 and by 1pm had risen by $1 to $16. Shares in Revco gained $1 1/8 or 4% at $26 7/8 after the drug store chain said that its first quarter earnings were 21 cents a share, 6 cents ahead of analysts' estimates.

339,1996-09-24,1996-09-25,Financial Times,TREASURIES OFF HIGHS AS FED HOLDS RATES.,"US Treasuries surged and then fell back from their highs on news that the Federal Reserve's Open Market Committee had left interest rates unchanged. Bonds began rising in early afternoon and then moved sharply higher at 2:15pm when the news was announced. The yield on the benchmark 30-year Treasury dipped below 7% on the news, but some 45 minutes later moved back above the psychologically important level. By late afternoon the long bond was 5/32 stronger at 96 to yield 7.008%. Shorter maturity Treasuries however, managed to hold on to a good portion of their gains, with the two-year note climbing 5/32 to 99 15/16 to yield 6.140%.<The curve that maps the spread between two-year and 30-year Treasuries jumped by eight basis points. Wall Street economists had been almost evenly divided about whether the Fed would raise the federal funds target rate by 25 basis points or leave it steady. At mid-morning bonds moved modestly lower on news of a jump in the consumer confidence index since the start of the summer. Reaction to the figures, however, was overshadowed by the market's focus on the FOMC meeting. The Conference Board said that it had revised its August figure to 112 - its highest level in nearly six years - and that the index was only modestly lower at 111.8 in September. The August figure was originally reported as 109.4. * European government bond markets languished as traders waited nervously for the outcome of the FOMC meeting. Trading ranges in most markets were narrow and volumes low, and where significant price changes did occur, they were mostly driven by mark-ups in the futures markets. ""No investor flows were backing the rally"", said Mr Graham McDevitt, a bond strategist at Paribas. * Italian government bonds had the most volatile day among European markets, weakening in the morning on stronger than expected consumer price data released after the close of the market late Monday by five Italian cities. However, mounting hopes that the government could push through a convincing 1997 budget package helped the market recoup its losses during the afternoon. Traders also cited hopes that further inflation data would show that Monday's figures were an aberration. ""If the government comes up with the goods on the 1997 budget and the Bank of Italy are impressed enough, it won't be too long before we should expect to see rate cuts entering back into the equation again,"" said Mr David Brown, chief international economist at Bear Stearns. The BTP contract on Liffe rose by 0.46 to settle at 119.17, before reaching an all-time high of 119.34 in after-hours trading. * UK gilts traded in a very narrow range, ending the day flat or slightly higher. Liffe's December long gilt future settled at 107 15/32, up 3/32. In the cash market, the 10-year gilt was 3/32 higher at 97 3/8, its yield spread over the equivalent bund 3 basis points wider at 180 points. This spread is now some 15 points wider than at the beginning of the month. ""Gilts have not only underperformed bunds, but all European markets in recent weeks"", said Mr Andrew Roberts, gilts analyst at UBS. ""Yield convergence has resumed in Europe, but gilts are not part of it."" Mr Roberts also said ""economic fundamentals are against the gilt market"", with high spending growth and consumer price inflation constantly overshooting the Bank of England's 2.5% target. ""Only an end to the convergence process could help gilts, by attracting funds out of the high-yielding markets"", he said. * Swedish government debt ended mostly unchanged, after rising in early trading on abullish central bank report on inflation, while the krona firmed to SKr4.352 against the D-Mark, from SKr4.361 on Monday.

340,1996-09-24,1996-09-25,Financial Times,EQUITY FUTURES AND OPTIONS TRADING.,"The derivatives sector was marking time yesterday as dealers waited for the outcome of the US Federal Open Market Committee meeting, writes Joel Kibazo. In futures, the December contract on the FT-SE 100 opened on a firm note at 3,954, well ahead of its previous close. Early buying, said to have been mainly by independent (local) traders, saw the contract rise steadily to 3,969. This turned out to be the high of the day as the more cautious view on the interest rate outlook gained the upper hand. December drifted lower for the rest of the morning but later settled to trade in a tight range of 3,940 to 3,950. The early falls on Wall Street did little to improve sentiment while a false rumour about a resignation from the UK government only served to increase the gloom surrounding the market. The contract closed at 3,945, up 2 on its previous close and around 2 points above its estimated fair value premium to cash of 33 points. Turnover rose slightly and closed at 10,809 contracts. Volume in the traded options also improved and reached 43,776 contracts against 37,227 lots on Monday. The FT-SE 100 option saw business of 19,309 lots while 14,584 was dealt in the Euro FT-SE contract. BP was the busiest stock option with a total of 3,015 trades.

341,1996-09-24,1996-09-25,Financial Times,US SHARES MIXED AFTER RATE NEWS.,"Investors showed a mixed reaction to news that the Federal Reserve had decided to leave interest rates unchanged at yesterday's meeting of its Open Market Committee, writes Lisa Bransten in New York. Bluechip shares in the Dow Jones Industrial Average initially surged on the news and then almost as quickly fell back into negative territory in part because of pressure from AT&T, which issued a profits warning early yesterday morning. Just before 3pm the Dow was off 13.68 at 5,881.06 and the Standard &Poor's 500 slipped 0.86 at 686.66 while the American Stock Exchange composite added 0.74 at 564.36. Wall Street economists had been sharply divided over whether the Fed's policy making body would raise interest rates. Technology shares mostly remained higher as they rebounded from the drop seen on Monday. The Nasdaq composite, which is weighted toward that sector, added 3.33 at 1,214.80 and the Pacific Stock Exchange technology index climbed 1.1%. Semiconductor shares were particularly strong. Intel added $1 1/4 at $97, Applied Materials was up $1 3/8 at $27 5/8, Micron Technology climbed $2 1/2 at $30 1/2, Texas Instruments added $3 1/2 at $55 1/4, Motorola was $1 1/4 stronger at $52 5/8 and National Semiconductor climbed $1 3/8 at $20 1/2. Telecommunications shares were sharply lower on the heels of a warning from the industry giant, AT&T, that competitive pressures in the long distance business would push third quarter earnings as much as 10% below analysts' estimates. AT&T, which is a component of the Dow, was off $5 3/8 or 9% at $51 7/8, MCI Communications shed $1 3/8 or 5% at $25 3/4 and Sprint gave up $1 1/2 or 4% at $40. Interest rate sensitive commercial banks were mostly flat ahead of FOMC news. Citicorp was $1/4 stronger at $89 5/8, Chase Manhattan Bank was unchanged at $79 3/8 and JP Morgan shed $1 at $88 3/4. Pan Am World Airways rose in their first day of trading on the American stock Exchange. Shares in the newest reincarnation of the well-known carrier were priced at $15 and by 1pm had risen by $1 to $16. Shares in Revco gained $1 1/8 or 4% at $26 7/8 after the drug store chain said that its first quarter earnings were 21 cents a share, 6 cents ahead of analysts' estimates.

342,1996-09-24,1996-09-25,Financial Times,TREASURIES OFF HIGHS AS FED HOLDS RATES.,"US Treasuries surged and then fell back from their highs on news that the Federal Reserve's Open Market Committee had left interest rates unchanged. Bonds began rising in early afternoon and then moved sharply higher at 2:15pm when the news was announced. The yield on the benchmark 30-year Treasury dipped below 7% on the news, but some 45 minutes later moved back above the psychologically important level. By late afternoon the long bond was 5/32 stronger at 96 to yield 7.008%. Shorter maturity Treasuries however, managed to hold on to a good portion of their gains, with the two-year note climbing 5/32 to 99 15/16 to yield 6.140%. The curve that maps the spread between two-year and 30-year Treasuries jumped by eight basis points. Wall Street economists had been almost evenly divided about whether the Fed would raise the federal funds target rate by 25 basis points or leave it steady. At mid-morning bonds moved modestly lower on news of a jump in the consumer confidence index since the start of the summer. Reaction to the figures, however, was overshadowed by the market's focus on the FOMC meeting. The Conference Board said that it had revised its August figure to 112 - its highest level in nearly six years - and that the index was only modestly lower at 111.8 in September.

343,1996-09-24,1996-09-25,Financial Times,FOMC LEAVES US INTEREST RATES UNCHANGED.,"The Federal Reserve's monetary policy committee yesterday left US interest rates unchanged, causing a mild surprise to the markets. The decision suggested the Federal Open Markets Committee, which is responsible for setting interest rate policy, was not convinced that signs of inflationary pressure in the US economy warranted tightening. The FOMC's decision left the Federal funds rate, the interest banks charge each other for overnight loans, unchanged at 5.25%. It also left unchanged the discount rate, which the Federal Reserve charges banks, at 5%. Analysts were divided over what effect the decision would have on the dollar, although most considered that a rate rise was now most likely to take place after the US presidential elections in November. With the currency markets in Europe closing before the FOMC decision, trading was generally light and within narrow ranges for most currencies, as the market awaited the interest rate news from the US. The announcement of the UK's buoyant current account and growth figures was followed by sterling making small gains against the dollar and the D-Mark. The pound closed against the dollar at $1.5580 by end of trading in London, up slightly from $1.5569 the previous day. Against the D-Mark, sterling finished at DM 2.3576, up from DM 2.3562. The French franc continued its bullish trend against the D-Mark, climbing to FFr 3.383 from FFr 3.385. The D-Mark continued to trade in a narrow band against other European currencies. But it weakened slightly against the yen, to Y 72.52 compared with Y 72.62. The Swedish krona hit a recent high against the D-Mark in intra-day trading at SKr4.32, after yet another cut in the Swedish central bank's repo rate. The krona finished the day at SKr4.351, up from SKr4.359. The Italian lira was stable at L1,006. But Italian government debt markets rose strongly on positive inflation data and growing confidence in the government's ability to pass its 1997 budget through parliament. The benchmark December government bond futures contract rose to a contract high of 119.20, slipping back to a close of 119.15. * Britain recorded its largest current account surplus for nine years in the second quarter of 1996, and its annual rate of economic growth was revised up to 2.2% yesterday. The current account deficit for the second quarter showed a #457m ($712m) surplus after a deficit of #786m in the first quarter. Financial markets had expected a second quarter deficit of around #1.2bn. Mr Tony Norfield, treasury economist at ABN Amro bank in London, said the current account data was good news for the British economy and for sterling. ""The lack of a base rate cut should help sterling - it seems pretty unlikely we'll see any more base rate cuts for a while,"" he said. Official interest rates appeared to have been left unchanged at 5.75% after Monday's monetary policy meeting between Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor of the Exchequer, and the Bank of England. * The Riksbank, Sweden's central bank, showed its faith in the country's economic recovery by cutting interest rates for the twentieth time this year. Its latest quarterly report on economic and monetary policy said inflation in Sweden was under control. After the publication of the inflation report, the central bank cut its key repo rate by 10 basis points to 5.05%. The repo rate has now dropped by nearly four percentage points, from 8.91% in January. * Mr Romano Prodi, Italy's prime minister, said Italy would face economic ruin if it failed to join Emu. ""There can no longer be a situation where some arrive first and others later, but there will be a large number of countries that enter right away,"" Mr Prodi said. ""Not being among these countries means economic ruin for Italy,"" he said. Mr Prodi said Italy's 1997 budget, due to be presented on Friday, would help Italy clinch a place in Emu.

344,1996-09-24,1996-09-25,Financial Times,CREDIOP ISSUES SEVEN-YEAR FRNS TO RAISE DM 500M.,"As the bond markets' tense vigil for the outcome of the Federal Open Market Committee meeting continued, activity in the eurobond market dried to a trickle, with only a handful of new issues surfacing yesterday. The largest deal of the day was a DM 500m floating-rate offering for Crediop, the Italian financial institution that lends to local authorities. Crediop's credit rating was upgraded by Moody's to Aa3 in July, making it one of the few Italian issuers with the same rating as the state. Moreover, forthcoming redemptions of D-Mark floating-rate paper are expected to provide good support for the transaction, said a syndicate manager at Paribas, joint book-runner with HSBC Trinkaus. ""More than DM 1bn of floating-rate notes are maturing in September and October, and we hope this deal will benefit from some reinvestment demand,"" he said. He reported demand from banks in the Benelux region and Italy, as well as money market funds in the UK and France, in spite of the deal's relatively tight pricing. At the re-offer price, the notes paid a spread of 5.7 basis points over Libor, which widened to full fees - 9 basis points over Libor - in the course of the day, in line with Crediop's dollar-denominated FRNs. In the sterling sector, Yorkshire Building Society issued #200m of five-year floating-rate notes, increased from the initial launch size of #150m due to strong demand, an official at lead Dresdner-Kleinwort Benson said. While it is only the 10th largest UK building society in terms of assets, it ranks third in UBS's relative creditworthiness league table of building societies, after the Halifax and Northern Rock, both of which are due to convert to banks next year. Most of the paper went to UK corporates and financial institutions, he said. In France, Merrill Lynch increased a FFr 1bn issue of 10-year bonds, launched in May at a spread of 51 basis points, by another FFr 1.5bn yielding only 43 basis points over French government bonds. The deal's strong spread performance, which had seen the differential tighten to as little as 38 basis points, lent good support to the new tranche, an official at Banque Paribas, one of the joint leads, said. Also in the French franc sector, dealers are awaiting the next foray by Cades, the government entity set up to manage the country's accumulated social security debts. It is expected to issue up to FFr 20bn - possibly in two tranches of differing maturities - as early as this week. In the emerging markets, the Philippine jumbo 20-year bond, which on Monday had tightened from its launch spread of 225 basis points to 220 basis points, continued to trade well and closed at a spread of 218 basis points over Treasuries. The rest of the sector was muted by the FOMC meeting, but dealers are looking to the forthcoming D-Mark issues for Colombia and the Czech Republic's Komercni Banka.

345,1998-03-31,1998-04-01,Financial Times,*** No headline found ***.,"The June FTSE 100 future spent much of the day trading sideways but received a powerful push from Wall Street just before the close, writes Martin Brice. June had opened at 5,960, which was 53 points above the cash market with fair value variously estimated at a premium of between 63 and 69 points. June edged up to the 5,974 region, before easing to the 5,955 area before 9.30am, and these levels were to set the restrained tone for trading during much of the day. The FOMC meeting in the US and the continued strength of sterling tended to encourage this restrained tone, and suggestions from trading in the S&P futures that the US market would move ahead just a few points tended to reinforce caution. June touched the low of the day, 5,933, ahead of the US opening, but in the event Wall Street was stronger than anticipated and the contract found a spring in its step. The one-hour shift in UK time left just 40 minutes of pit trading between the US opening and settlement, which was at 5,967. After-hours electronic trading saw June reach 6,008. Volume was 20,200, or 8,000 in the old contract size. Copyright Financial Times Limited 1998. All Rights Reserved. Not Available for Re-dissemination. "
346,1998-03-31,1998-04-01,Financial Times,Dollar lifts Zurich exporters.,"A strong dollar and window dressing at the end of the first quarter sent ZURICH back into record territory, although analysts cautioned the market looked increasingly overbought and a correction remained on the cards. The SMI index rose 49.2 to 7,585.5, eclipsing the previous peak set last Friday. Exporters gaining from the firmer dollar included Novartis. It jumped SwFr 36 to SwFr 2,710 and was was also recommended by Zurich Kantonalbank as a trading buy. Roche certificates added SwFr 150 to SwFr 16,500, still recovering from last week's losses, and Ems Chemie, SwFr 80 higher at SwFr 7,995. Nestle jumped SwFr 31 to SwFr 2,913 as CSFB reiterated its buy recommendation and raised its 1998 earnings estimates. It was the turn of CS Group to outperform the financial sector with a rise of SwFr 4.50 to SwFr 305. SAir Group, which on Monday said it was cautiously optimistic about 1998 prospects, rose SwFr 22 to SFDr2,129. Food company Hero, which said it expected higher 1998 profit, rose SwFr 15 to SwFr 965. PARIS, too, rallied to a fresh closing high in spite of a mixed reaction to the Opec agreement to reduce oil production. Total lost FFr 11 to FFr 744, but Elf, which announced a boost to its reserves with 15 new offshore blocks in the Gulf of Mexico, was marked FFr 11 higher at FFr 812. Elsewhere, Eridania Beghin-Say, the Franco-Italian food group, rose FFr 42 or 3.5% to FFr 1,240 after announcing net profit for 1997 at the top end of analysts' forecasts. Retailer Pinault-Printemps surged FFr 370 or 8.4% as the group denied more market rumours it was planning to sell its Printemps department stores. A FFr 21.10 or 4.6% rise in Schneider to FFr 477 was attributed to its relatively high proportion of dollar earnings. Bouygues rose FFr 35 to FFr 1,080 ahead of its results announcement expected after the market's close. AGF gave up FFr 4.30 to FFr 348.70 on profit-taking. Analysts said that the share was overbought on Monday after a series of recent broker upgrades. The CAC-40 index closed with a gain of 75.58 at 3,875.81. MILAN was supported by a switch out of bonds into equities and the benchmark Mibtel index reached a fresh high. The index rose 280 or 1.2% to 24,583, with banking shares stronger. Credit Italiano rose L315 to L9,045 after the release of its 1997 earnings, while Banca Intesa added L892 to L11,376. FRANKFURT kept the motor stocks firmly in its headlights on a day in which the broad market managed only a modest advance. The Xetra Dax index was just 27.36 higher at the close of electronic trade at 5,097.25, with investors reluctant to commit fresh funds ahead of the US Federal open market committee. BMW dropped DM 67.50 to DM 2,050.95 in the wake of 1997 and first quarter results, with the carmaker's plans to take over Rolls-Royce Motor Cars still weighing on its shares. Analysts said that while the results were mostly in line with expectations, news that an overvalued pound had significantly hurt results in its Rover division caused some concern. Volkswagen, which declined to comment on reports that it might raise its offer for the UK luxury carmaker, fell DM 34 to DM 1,425. AMSTERDAM was hit by profit-taking in low-volume trade and the AEX index lost 2.57 to 1,126.43. Concerns of oil price volatility hurt Royal Dutch. The group, which owns 60% of Royal Dutch Shell, lost Fl 1.20 to Fl 118. Grolsch, the brewer, was supported by speculation the company could become a takeover target, and rose Fl 4.30 to Fl 59.80. Tulip, the computer maker, plunged Fl 2.10 to Fl 5.10 on reports that it was seeking state aid. MADRID edged marginally higher in spite of weakness in Telefonica. The general index rose 1.08 to 888.67 as Telefonica, which lost Pta100 to Pta6,920, wiped out strength in banks and utilities. Argentaria rose Pta100 to Pta13,000, while Popular gained Pta250 to Pta15,150. ATHENS pulled back as foreign investors took to the sidelines and local funds unloaded stock after the market's spectacular run. The general index, up almost 50% since February 26, dropped 78.07 or 3.8% to 2,005.82. Cement stocks were marked down as ABN Amro recommended Titan and Heracles General, saying that they would continue to outperform the market. Sustained growth in cement demand and the shift from exports to domestic sales would result in a further widening of their operating margins. Titan lost Dr1,717 to Dr23,360 and Heracles was off Dr490 at Dr7,510. COPENHAGEN finished at a record high, fuelled by solid gains for selected stocks in an otherwise mixed market. The KFX top 20 index rose 1.96 to 244.86. A government pledge to close a corporate tax loophole which has allowed some financials to reduce their tax burden hit Den Danske Bank, DKr4 down at DKr921, Tryg-Baltica, which lost DKr18 to DKr554, and Cowdan, which gave up DKr4 to DKr1,250. OSLO fell 1% on weaker oil prices as scepticism spread over Opec's production cut agreement. The Total index fell 14.4 to 1,362.44, led down by oil-related companies. Norsk Hydro fell NKr7 to NKr378 and Saga Petroleum lost NKr5 to NKr136. Written and edited by Michael Morgan, Emiko Terazono, Peter Hall and Paul Gregan Copyright Financial Times Limited 1998.

348,1998-03-31,1998-04-01,Financial Times,Dow surges as FOMC meets on rate policy.,"US shares traded higher at midsession as the Federal Reserve's open market committee met to determine interest rate policy, writes John Labate in New York. At midday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average had surged 81.96 to 8,864.08, while the broader Standard &Poor's 500 gained 12.14 or 1.1% to 1,105.69. Falling oil prices ignited the transport sector. Airline stocks made steady advances as UAL, parent to United Airlines, gained $2 1/4 to $92 and AMR shot up $3 1/16 to $142 1/8. Federal Express rose $2 1/2 to $70 3/4. Bond prices also moved higher after the release of the Chicago purchasing managers report. Although the report showed a rise in economic activity, especially in employment and shipments, the closely watched prices-paid component was sharply lower, suggesting that inflation remains well contained. By midday the price of the benchmark 30-year bond was 7/16 higher at 102 15/32, sending the yield to 5.946%. Banking and other financial shares rose as bond prices rallied in morning trade. The Philadelphia Stock Exchange's banking index shot up 18.92 or 2.3% to 852.52. Citicorp gained $3 5/16 to $143, while Bank of New York rose $2 3/8 to $63 3/16. In the Dow, Allied Signal gained $1 3/16 to $42 11/16, while Boeing rose $1 3/8 to $51 7/8 and United Technologies advanced $2 3/8 to $93 5/16.

349,1998-03-31,1998-04-01,Financial Times,Funds injection boosts Nikkei.,"A last-minute injection of public funds into the futures market boosted share prices in TOKYO on the last day of trading for the fiscal year, writes Michiyo Nakamoto. However, the Nikkei 225 index ended far short of the 18,000 level, widely regarded as an important benchmark. The Nikkei traded erratically throughout the day. On the positive side was the expectation that public funds would come in to support stock prices. A comment by the head of the government's tax commission calling for tax cuts of Y 10,000bn also spurred positive sentiment. Purchases by public funds were noticed towards the end of the session in the futures market, which triggered arbitrage buying in the cash market. Post office funds reportedly handed Y 971.2bn to trust banks to invest in the stock market. At the same time, however, substantial selling came from financial institutions reducing their cross-shareholdings at the year-end. After a turbulent session, in which the Nikkei moved between a low of 116,178.22 and a high of 16,584.62, the index closed 246.13 higher at 16,527.17. Volume rose to 650m shares, up from 395m on Monday. Winners outnumbered losers 678 to 477 with 103 issues unchanged. The Topix index rose 10.43 to 1,251.70. Nippon Steel gained Y 1 to Y 214 on news that it would use reserves to buy back up to 150m of its own shares, valued at about Y 32bn. The yen's persistent weakness supported exporters such as Honda, which gained Y 180 to Y 4,800. MANILA lost 1.6% as investors became cautious following a drop in Asian currencies and ahead of the US Federal open market committee meeting. The composite index fell 35.38 to 2,238.42, also under pressure from profit-taking in some issues that have done particularly well recently. Among blue chips, PLDT lost 15 pesos to 1,055 pesos and Ayala Land slipped 50 centavos to 18.25 pesos. The heavily traded Metro Pacific fell 6 centavos to 2.34 pesos after it denied rumours of a possible merger between its telephone business, Smart Communications, and Pilipino Telephone. BANGKOK traded lower as investors unloaded bank and finance issues after the central bank tightened rules on loans for local banks that are likely to force them to raise their capital. The SET composite index was marked down for the sixth straight trading day, losing 5.98 or 1.3% to 459.11. Analysts said sentiment was weak even before the government's announcement, after Moody's lowered the long-term subordinated debt ratings and financial strength ratings of the country's five largest banks. That outweighed comments by Mark Mobius, who runs the $15bn emerging markets fund of US financial group, Templeton Worldwide, that large, well-capitalised Thai and Indonesian banks could be big winners from the Asian financial crisis. Bangkok Bank fell Bt3.50 to Bt81.50 and Thai Farmers Bank Bt2 to Bt75.50. SINGAPORE saw late selling after SIA dismissed speculation that it was about to announce plans to merge its foreign and local share tranches. SIA originally said a decision would be made by the end of March and rumours of a briefing led traders to believe that a merger announcement was imminent. SIA local closed unchanged at S$9.30, having touched a high of S$9.65, while SIA foreign finished 20 cents lower at S$11.50, off a low of S$11.40. Property stocks extended losses seen since the end of last week as profit-taking continued. The Straits Times Industrial index closed 19.38 weaker at S$1,629.18.

350,1998-03-31,1998-04-01,Financial Times,Investors await news on US rates.,"Prices ended mixed yesterday as investors awaited the outcome of a meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee, which sets US interest rate policy. Although no rate rise was expected, there was an air of caution about whether the Fed would shift its bias towards higher rates. European markets were also interest rate-sensitive after Luis Angel Rojo, governor of the Bank of Spain, seemed to signal that further cuts in rates would come at a slower pace than expected because the country's economic growth was so strong. Mr Rojo did not rule out further cuts, and the Spanish central bank is still expected to ease its money market rates in the next few weeks because of continued good inflation figures and European monetary union factors. Analysts said, however, that the prospect of no rate cut in Spain this week would hit hopes that Italian rates would also come down. ""Some central bank governors clearly do not want to be rushed into cutting rates while they are still keeping inflation in check. Given the strength of the Spanish economy and potential inflation, there are serious doubts whether Spanish interest rates should be cut now,"" said Jeremy Hawkins, at Bank of America. Mr Rojo's comments hit SPANISH BONOS, which under-performed other European markets in fairly active trading, with the short end taking the brunt. The June future settled unchanged at 108.82 with 105,000 contracts exchanged. The future had been as low as 108.55 but recovered when European markets perked up after the US posted good early gains. ITALIAN BTPs were also undermined in quiet trading but closed well above the day's lows. The June future settled at 119.11, up 0.02, with 55,000 contracts changing hands, while in the cash market the yield spread over 10-year bunds ended at 28 basis points. GERMAN BUNDS were range-bound, with investors awaiting results from the FOMC meeting, but they later firmed with Treasuries on the back of more US figures confirming the lack of inflation in the economy. The June future settled 0.10 higher in London at 107.30, while in Frankfurt turnover was active at 350,000 contracts. UK GILTS were better, outperforming bunds as sterling continued to soar - it climbed above DM 3.10 early in the day before falling back. Analysts said the outlook for gilts in the context of the strong pound was good, because the possibility of another interest rate rise was minimised. The June gilt future settled 11/32 higher at 108 3/16 with 80,000 contracts traded on Liffe by early evening, while the spread over 10-year bunds contracted sharply to 106 basis points. US TREASURIES were higher in morning trading. By early afternoon the benchmark 30-year bond had gained 1/2 to 102 17/32, sending the yield lower to 5.942%. The two-year note rose 1/16 to 99, yielding 5.600%, while the 10-year note gained 9/32 to 98, yielding 5.670%. Despite expectations that the Fed will not raise rates in the near term, the market has been weaker in recent weeks as the latest economic data have failed to show evidence of economic slowdown. A report by the Chicago Purchasing Managers yesterday continued to point to robust growth. The Chicago business barometer rose to 59.5 in March, from 57.8 in February, but the bond market focused on the prices paid component. Prices paid dipped to 48.7 from 55.5. ""The bond market was thrilled to see signs of disinflation in this morning's Chicago report,"" said Patrick Dimick, treasury market analyst at UBS Securities. * The UK debt management office takes over responsibility for gilt market operations today from the Bank of England.

351,1998-12-22,1998-12-23,Financial Times,US manufacturers call for tax cut as Fed holds interest rates.,"US manufacturing industry has called for a 10% tax cut for companies and individuals as a way of sustaining the country's seven-year economic expansion. The call came as the US Federal Reserve left interest rates unchanged and as new forecasts predicted a sharp slowdown in growth next year. The National Association of Manufacturers said a 10% tax cut, costing $80bn ( #47.6bn) a year, would lead to sharp increases in consumption and investment. Otherwise, it said economic growth would slow next year to about 2.1%, down from 3.6% this year and below potential output growth of 3%. The tax cut, it said, would allow growth next year of 3%, rising to 4% in 2000 and 2.9% in 2001. It said the main factors contributing to the long economic expansion - investment, personal consumption and exports - would not hold up next year without such a cut in tax rates. ""Exports, already down in 1998, are expected to deteriorate further next year due to continued troubles in Asia, and a likely slowdown in Latin America,"" it said. Business investment would also slow as companies' profits came under pressure because they had little power to raise prices. Consumers, already dipping into investments to spend, would also retrench next year. The Fed's decision to hold rates unchanged, following the last meeting this year of the policy setting Federal Open Market Committee, was expected and was to some extent signalled after the previous meeting in November. Then, the Fed cut interest rates by a quarter point for the third time in seven weeks in response, it said, to strains in the financial markets. Those market strains, which emerged after the Russian debt default in August, appear to have eased, and analysts were expecting the Fed to begin to focus on evidence of weakness in the real economy. In a separate forecast, Standard &Poor's, the US credit rating agency, said the economy would slow sharply in the first half of next year, growing annually at 1%. Growth would accelerate somewhat in the second half to give a 2% figure for the whole year, it said. Nonetheless, there remained a 40% chance that the economy would sink into recession in 1999 - though if it did, it would be a mild one, S&P said. It predicted the Fed would over the course of the year resume its interest rate reductions. The current Fed Funds rate of 4 3/4% would be cut to 4% by the year end, it said. David Blitzer, S&P's chief economist, said: ""Consumers have been the driving force for the economy, but they cannot keep increasing their spending twice as fast as their earnings. ""Other sectors of the economy - foreign trade, capital spending, government spending and housing - are not big enough or strong enough to replace the consumer as the growth engine.""

352,1998-12-22,1998-12-23,Financial Times,WORLD STOCK MARKETS - Profit takers rub shine off high-tech rally.,"Wall Street was mixed at midday as high-tech shares gave way on profit-taking while blue chips made only modest headway, writes John Labate in New York. By midsession, the Dow Jones Industrial Average had clambered back above the 9,000-point level. Modest selling was seen ahead of the Federal open market committee meeting, which as expected left rates unchanged. US Treasuries were weaker, with the benchmark 30-year bond falling 25/32 to 102 3/32, yielding 5.112%. By early afternoon the Dow had gained 13.65 at 9,002.50, while the Standard &Poor's 500 index was down 1.15 to 1,201.69. Cyclical consumer shares were the main movers in the Dow, with Coca Cola up $1 1/2 to $67 1/4 and Procter &Gamble up $2 1/2 at $89 1/2. But Goodyear Tire, another Dow member, fell $1 15/16 to $50 3/8 after Morgan Stanley cut the stock to a ""neutral"" rating from ""strong buy"". The Nasdaq composite was down 13.01 to 2,125.02 as major computer shares, ranging from Intel to Compaq Computer fell back, one day after Monday's rally sent the Nasdaq and the S&P 500 to new record closes. Semiconductor shares fell back, with Cypress Semiconductor down $7/8 to $8 after Morgan Stanley cut the stock to ""neutral"". In the networking computer sector Cabletron Systems lost $15/16 to $8 after the company reported quarterly results. Internet stocks continued higher, buoyed by online broker Ameritrade, which raised its outlook for quarterly earnings. Ameritrade shares shot up $10 1/8 to $31 1/8. Also bucking the tech trend was Apple Computer, which gained $1 7/8 to $36 15/16 on a report that its iMac computer was the best selling retail personal computer in November. In the healthcare sector, Cigna was $1 1/8 higher to $78 7/16 after the company confirmed it was in talks with Ace Limited. Southeby's rose $2 1/2 to $30 1/2 after Merrill Lynch raised its rating. TORONTO was mixed, but with a positive bias, at midsession as investors took profits following the gains of recent sessions. The TSE-300 composite index was 6.50 higher at 6,387.50 in volume of 37m shares. Analysts noted that weakness in the gold sector had tempered the market's performance during morning trade, while the oil and gas sector was also lower. Copyright Financial Times Limited 1998.

353,2004-06-30,2004-07-01,Financial Times,Stronger Brazil seen as having little to fear.,"Two years ago, a tightening of monetary policy by the US Federal Reserve might have tipped the balance against Brazil's fight to stave off default. But yesterday there were few signs of distress in Brazil, the world's largest emerging-market debtor. The country's bonds rallied over the past month, and their yield over US treasuries narrowed by roughly 150 basis points. Investors had priced in a more benign scenario of gradual rate hikes by the Fed. With yesterday's confirmation, Brazil's financial markets could rally further. ""Brazil should be the big winner as investors realise that the FOMC will raise interest rates at a gradual pace,"" Walter Molano, head of research at BCP Securities, a Connecticut-based investment firm, said before the announcement. Conventional wisdom has it that higher interest rates in the US will drain capital from emerging markets, put pressure on their currencies, increase borrowing costs and even force a tightening of monetary policy. Brazil's central bank will now have less room to cut interest rates from the current level of 16 per cent. Leading financial institutions expect a cut of only 1 percentage point by the end of the year, down from forecasts in late March of 2 percentage points. But Brazil's economy is in a much stronger position to withstand more hostile capital market conditions than a few years ago. Economists have maintained economic growth forecasts of around 3.5 per cent and may even increase them. Brazil has cut external financing requirements dramatically. Exports grew by 40 per cent in 2003 and are up by an estimated 20 per cent this year. This has turned a current account deficit of 4.6 per cent of gross domestic product in 2001 into a surplus of roughly 0.8 per cent of GDP last year and 1.1 per cent of GDP this year. Foreign debt and exposure to currency volatility have fallen. ""The reliance of the Brazilian private sector on external markets has fallen sharply in the past few years,"" said JP Morgan, the investment bank, in a report last month. The corporate sector ""is well positioned to withstand a reduction in the availability of external credit lines, should that occur"", the bank added. Net foreign debt has fallen from 36 per cent of GDP in 2002 to an expected 26 per cent of GDP by year-end. The government also has reduced its dollar-linked domestic debt by Dollars 26bn to 16.6 per cent of its total public debt, from 37 per cent in December 2002. ""Brazil and emerging markets in general are in a much better situation than they were a few years ago,"" said Drausio Giacomelli, head of Latin American strategy at JP Morgan. ""Strategic demand for emerging market debt may slow but it won't unravel."" For regional reports, www.ft.com/usawww.ft.com/americas"
354,2004-06-30,2004-07-01,Financial Times,Rate rise signals the end of bonds bull run.,"For many on Wall Street, yesterday's interest rate rise served as a marker to the end of a 20-year-plus bull run for the bond markets. As interest rates have generally fallen since the early 1980s, bond prices have risen as the dividends they offer, or yields, fall in line with interest rates, providing rich capital returns for investors. But yesterday's move is widely forecast to have been the first in a series of rate rises that will push bond prices lower. Expectations of rate rises have already led the Dollars 3,000bn-plus (Euros 2,463bn, Pounds 1,651bn) US Treasury market to its worst quarterly returns in 24 years in the three months to June. ""You're not going to get the gains we saw before in bonds,"" said John Derrick, director of research at US Global Investors. ""There's a floor to how low rates and yields can go."" Despite the rout in bond prices over the last quarter, the markets had steadied in the run-up to the Fed's decision in the belief that future rate rises were largely now priced in to the market. Strategists and fund managers do not predict disaster, though they acknowledge returns will be lower. ""The Fed is most likely to tighten in baby steps,"" said Edward Marrinan, head of North American high grade strategy at JP Morgan. A decline in issuance - an indicator of market confidence - was related to strong corporate profits lessening the need for borrowing, he said. ""Given that Mr Greenspan has bent over backwards to telegraph the FOMC's intention to raise rates, I doubt many companies feel they will have missed the boat on borrowing."" Issuance for riskier high yield, or junk bonds, is up on last year and has risen recently as bond markets steadied. ""Investors are still showing a strong interest in taking on risk,"" said Kingman Penniman of KDP Investment Advisors. Investors have also pointed out that the historically low level of rates means an increase will still mean affordable borrowing. Citing the predicted end-of-year rate, James Kauffmann, head of fixed income at ING Investment Management, said: ""Fed funds at 2.25 per cent . But the low level of rates even after rises - which can take up to 18 months to feed into the economy - might fail to curb the recent pick-up in inflation. Unexpectedly strong inflation could force the Fed to raise rates more aggressively. This would push bond prices lower, and any uncertainty the extra rate rises created could weigh further on prices. ""The real concern is if the market prices in much more"" than 100 basis points this year, said Bill Kohli, bond fund manager at Putnam. Rising yields would force up interest rates on other products such as home loans, and could slow the economy. The good news for bond buyers is that research by ING Financial Markets shows that under Alan Greenspan's leadership of the Fed, the markets have historically overestimated the level of rates by almost a percentage point. The bad news is that the few periods when they have underestimated interest rates coincide with periods of rising rates. "
355,2004-06-30,2004-07-01,Financial Times,Federal Reserve delivers quarter point rise.,"The US Federal Reserve raised interest rates by a quarter point to 1.25 per cent yesterday, the first increase in more than four years. The move was expected after the Fed's efforts to prepare the ground for higher rates in recent weeks. But it kicks off what is likely to be a long tightening cycle fraught with risk, after a period in which households, businesses and investors have become used to cheap credit. The policymaking Federal open market committee sounded a slightly more hawkish tone in its accompanying statement. As expected, the Fed maintained its judgment that upside and downside risks to inflation remain balanced. It reiterated the committee's belief that policy accommodation could be removed at a ""measured"" pace, but added: ""Nonetheless, the committee will respond to changes in economic prospects as needed to fulfil its obligation to maintain price stability."" The FOMC acknowledged in its statement that incoming inflation data were ""somewhat elevated"" while adding that ""a portion of the increase in recent months appears to have been due to transitory factors"". Fed officials have been surprised by the sharp rise in inflation in the first half of the year - but expect a moderation in the second half. Alan Greenspan, Fed chairman, and his colleagues have stressed that they would move more aggressively against inflation if their sanguine outlook proved to be incorrect. ""The baseline case is that it is likely the Fed will tighten at a measured pace, but now they have spelled out the risk case,"" said Paul McCulley, Fed-watcher at Pimco, the giant bond fund. A gradual approach to tightening rates will allow the US central bank to gauge the effect on consumer and business spending. Anything other than a quarter-point rate rise would have been a surprise, and there was little market reaction yesterday. Between the start of 2001 and last June, the Fed slashed interest rates from 6.5 per cent to 1 per cent - a 45-year low.

Ahead of the Federal Open Market Committee's meeting yesterday, a tense stand-off in front of the Fed building developed between a farmer who claimed his tractor - stuck in the National Mall's reflecting pool - was packed with explosives, and the FBI, the secret service, the US park police, and Washington police and firefighters. Streets around the reflecting pool were closed, and non-essential staff in the area's many federal buildings - including the Fed - were evacuated. Luckily, the Fed said the FOMC meeting would go ahead as planned. After all, the Treasury has just pledged to assist in co-ordinating the response of state and local authorities with critical financial institutions. Perhaps someone should call a tow truck.

357,2003-03-18,2003-03-19,Financial Times,Uncertainty prompts Fed to hold rates US ECONOMY MARKETS MORE CONFIDENT BUT CENTRAL BANK SAYS ...,"Uncertainty prompts Fed to hold rates US ECONOMY MARKETS MORE CONFIDENT BUT CENTRAL BANK SAYS GEOPOLITICAL EVENTS MAKE ASSESSMENT OF SITUATION DIFFIC. The US Federal Reserve kept interest rates on hold at 1.25 per cent yesterday, but warned about the huge uncertainty surrounding the US economy. The decision, ahead of an imminent war with Iraq, had been predicted by most economists and priced in by investors. But despite a more confident tone in oil and financial markets in recent days, the Fed's open markets committee (FOMC) said that geo-political risks were making any assessment of the US economy very difficult. In a statement released with the decision, which was unanimous, the Fed indicated it was standing ready to cut rates immediately if the economic outlook deteriorated suddenly. The Fed said it would practise ""heightened surveillance"" of the economy - similar to language used in the past ahead of an interest rate move between scheduled meet-ings. In a highly unusual move, the Fed also said it could not tell whether the risks to the economy were balanced or weighted one way or another, citing ""unusually large uncertainties clouding the geopolitical situation in the short run and their apparent effects on economic decisionmaking"". The FOMC's next scheduled meeting is on May 6. Gloomy data released in recent weeks had put the possibility of a cut back on the table, particularly figures that showed employment and retail sales dropping sharply and confidence among both consumers and the housing industry sinking fast. But economists had predicted that the recovery in financial markets, with the prospect of a quick war blowing away the clouds of uncertainty covering the US economy, would keep the Fed on hold. Financial and commodity markets have taken a much more optimistic tone in recent days, beginning to focus on the possibility of a swift and decisive war with Iraq. Before the Fed's announcement yesterday, the futures market had lowered still further its estimate of the probability of a quarter-point cut to less than 20 per cent. Oil prices dropped sharply yesterday, with most key price indices falling by nearly $2 a barrel. The US benchmark crude oil hit $31.75, 20 per cent below its high of $39.99 last month. Traders have been speculating that a war in Iraq would be short and that the US was likely to tap into its strategic stockpile of crude oil. In the run-up to the meeting, US stocks held their gains after the sharp rally on Monday, while the dollar added to its recent gains against the other large currencies. Interest rates have been on hold at 1.25 per cent since November, when the Fed sprang another surprise by cutting borrowing costs by half a percentage point. London Edition 2. "
358,2000-11-15,2000-11-16,Financial Times,CURRENCIES &MONEY - Forex market waits for ECB decision.,"The euro, after three days of plain sailing, returns to the spotlight today as the European Central Bank makes its fortnightly rate decision. The European currency kept a low profile yesterday as the market waited for the Federal Open Market Committee to comment on its monetary policy bias. It did, however, capitalise briefly on confusion in Asian trade. A Japanese news agency reported that Lawrence Lindsey, advisor to George W. Bush, had told Japanese politicians that a Bush government could seek a weaker dollar to help curb the current account deficit. A senior spokesman for the Bush campaign subsequently denied the account, saying: ""A Japanese politician is misattributing what Mr Lindsey said. Mr Lindsey has been consistent and unequivocal in saying that Governor Bush would continue to pursue a strong dollar policy."" The dollar climbed steadily against the yen, from below Y108.00 to a peak of around Y108.80. Traders identified some short-term speculative selling of the yen on the hope that Japan's political situation would deteriorate further, putting pressure on the currency. But some think the importance of the political situation is being overstated. ""I think the market is rather clutching at straws,"" said Paul Meggyesi, senior currency strategist at Deutsche Bank. ""It seems a little too neat to reason that if Prime Minister Yoshiro Mori is replaced he might be succeeded by a more reform-minded personality who would pursue a less expansionary fiscal policy, which would inhibit growth and therefore weaken the currency. ""Fiscal consolidation is necessary, but it can't happen without growth. It is likely to follow only once the recovery is assured."" A simpler explanation might be that yen carry trades are simply becoming more attractive because of the low volatility of the yen, in other words people can borrow cheaply in yen and invest in dollars. And this means more short-term selling of the yen. * Sterling weakened against the dollar as UK unemployment was shown to have risen for the first time in two years. The October jobless count rose by 3,500, supporting the view that UK interest rates had peaked. Headline earnings growth rose slightly from 4.0 to 4.1 per cent, but this remained below the 4.5 per cent threshold that the Bank of England deems consistent with its inflation target. Late in London the pound was trading at $1.4260 against the dollar, after a low of $1.4229. The euro peaked at #0.6040 against sterling, slipping back to around $0.6010 in late trade. * Like the euro, the ailing Australian dollar has been receiving some support from the threat of currency market intervention by the Reserve Bank of Australia. The bank confirmed in its semi-annual statement this week that it had been in the market several times in recent weeks to reinforce what it identified as an emerging trend towards stability. The Australian dollar, which has been struggling since last week, staged a brief half-cent rally as intervention rumours hit the market, but fell close to record lows as they proved groundless. Critics of the RBA's intervention policy argue that the bank is fighting against deteriorating fundamentals. They point to signs of weakening domestic growth against a backdrop of lower global growth prospects. This would imply both reduced demand for Australian exports in the key Asian region, and negative price effects as commodity prices decline. Some argue that the impact of the intervention is limited by the fact that the RBA's foreign exchange reserves are relatively modest. The market knows that the bank's capacity to wage a prolonged or heavy intervention campaign is limited. Late in London the Australian dollar was $0.520 against the US dollar, after a low of $0.518. It fell to a record of $0.511 last month. "
359,1997-03-25,1997-03-26,Financial Times,US shares slip after rate rise.,"US shares slipped yesterday after the Federal Reserve's Open Market Committee moved to boost the federal funds rate by 25 basis points to 5 1/2%, writes Lisa Bransten in New York. By the close the Dow Jones Industrial Average was off 29.08 at 6,876.17 and the more broadly traded Standard &Poor's 500 had fallen 1.82 at 789.07. Volume on the NYSE came to 485m shares. Most Wall Street economists had expected the rate increase and the market initially rallied after the news, with the Dow jumping more than 47 points before quickly reversing course. Economists were divided about whether the move was a one-off tightening or the first in a series of moves to slow the economy. In a statement the FOMC said the ""action was taken in light of persisting strength in demand, which is progressively increasing the risk of inflationary imbalances developing in the economy"". The interest rate increase weighed heavily on cyclical shares, which would be hit hardest by an economic slowdown. The Morgan Stanley index of cyclical shares shed 1.2%, while the counterpart index of consumer shares was just 0.4% weaker. Falling cyclical shares in the Dow included Aluminium Company of America (Alcoa) off $2 at $70, Du Pont dropping $2 3/8 at $111 7/8, and International Paper, which shed $7/8 at $42. Meanwhile, the Dow got some support from rising shares in consumer goods companies. Merck added $1 at $90 7/8, Philip Morris rose $2 5/8 to $118 1/2 and McDonald's was $1/8 stronger at $47 1/2. Technology shares, which have been falling for most of the month, held on to modest gains despite the rate increase. The Nasdaq composite, which is weighed toward technology shares, was 5.42 stronger at 1,248.06 and the Pacific Stock Exchange technology index was 0.4 stronger. Intel, the semiconductor giant that is the biggest issue on the Nasdaq, regained $2 5/8 at $133 1/4. Since February 4, the company has lost $34 1/8 or nearly 21% of its value as some investors took money out of the technology sector. TORONTO ended flat after a morning rally was cut short by the US Federal Reserve's decision to raise interest rates. The TSE-300 composite index fell just 0.49 or 0.01% to 6143.76. Declines outpaced advances 477 to 462 and trade of 87.8m shares worth C$1.60. Ten of the 14 stock groups rose. Metals dropped 1.83%, Falconbridge falling C$1.30 to C$30.45 and Alcan Aluminium sliding C$1.20 to C$48.80. Golds declined 0.92%, with Barrick Gold easing 50 cents to C$35. Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce ended 35 cents lower at C$33.45 following news that each CIBC dividend capital receipt and secondary warrant would be split on a two for one basis.

360,1997-03-25,1997-03-26,Financial Times,Dollar steady on US rate rise.,"The dollar remained steady following the decision to raise US rates by 25 basis points yesterday, and was trading almost unchanged from its London close immediately after the announcement by the US Federal Reserve. Ahead of the US Federal Open Market Committee policy making meeting, the dollar remained firm on technical activity. It closed up Y 1.1 against the yen in London at Y 123.9 and 0.3 pfennigs against the D-Mark at DM 1.691. Hedge funds sold the yen aggressively against the D-Mark, triggering yen selling against sterling. The D-Mark closed Y 0.56 against yen to Y 73.29 while the pound finished Y 2.7 higher at Y 200.6. The yen was also hit by a decline in Japanese short term interest rates. The Bank of Japan's accommodative stance in its daily money market operations reconfirmed expectations of low interest rates in the foreseeable future as did comments by a leading Japanese banker. Traders are concerned about extra volatility over the next few days due to the Easter holiday weekend and the end of the Japanese fiscal year. The increase in technical activity amid low trading volumes is likely to boost price volatility. ""Our primary concern is a liquidity problem,"" said Mr Michael Wallace, senior currency economist at MMS International, adding that the pound and the dollar which have gained on hopes of higher interest rates could see some profit taking. Nervousness that higher rates in the US could lead to rate increases in Europe affected Swiss short term rates. Short term deposit rates edged up to the 2% level on comments by German officials over a possible US interest rate increase earlier in the week. However, the Swiss central bank has expressed its resolve to counter factors which would hamper an economic recovery, and analysts expect the phenomenon to be temporary. * The Italian lira closed unchanged at L1001 after a volatile day. Comments by Mr Lamberto Dini, the Italian foreign minister, that he would have preferred to see the launch of European monetary union put back by a year pressured the lira, although he added that it was impossible for Italy to backtrack at this point. Reports that the IMF's draft forecasts for Italy's budget deficit came to four per cent of GDP in 1997 also added to the pessimism. An Italian financial daily said that the country needed extra budget deficit cutting measures worth L20,000bn this year if it wanted to reach the three per cent deficit to GDP ratio required to join Emu. Strategists said comments by politicians were unnerving investors. ""The clever course for Italy is to say nothing. The problem is that the more the politicians try to calm the markets, the more the markets are perturbed,"" said Mr Mark Fox, chief European strategist at Lehman Brothers in London. The government is expected to announce its mini-budget with up to L16,000bn in budget cutting measures later this week, and may choose to release it on Friday since its financial markets are scheduled to remain open. * Concerns over Emu and the Swedish government's budget weighed on the krona. A flurry of selling sent the currency lower against the D-Mark although the currency finally closed down SKr0.007 at SKr4.513. The Norwegian krone saw support from investment bank buying yesterday, rising NKr0.034 against the D-Mark to NKr3.946. While some analysts see the krone undervalued, there are worries of an overheating economy and the central bank's continued priority to focus on currency stability over inflation. Last week's first quarter inflation report highlighted the risk of rising price pressures due to a tightening labour market and higher capacity. The krone has appreciated by 5% since the start of the year on the back of its strong economic growth. However, there are some fears of an inflationary boom and a subsequent bust if the central bank does not increase its rates, said Mr Paul Meggyesi, senior currency economist at Deutsche Morgan Grenfell.

361,1997-03-25,1997-03-26,Financial Times,Stock shortage drives shares sharply higher.,"London's equity market looked to have come to terms with the prospect of a rise in US rates after the FOMC meeting held in Washington yesterday. After six consecutive sessions of losses, the FTSE 100 index yesterday rallied strongly, largely on the back of thebig rally on Wall Street. On Monday the Dow Jones Industrial Average picked up a confidence-restoring 100 points, and it built on that performance at the outset of trading on Wall Street yesterday when the Dow pushed up a further 26 points in quick time. The FTSE 100 index, which had fallen over 200 points during the previous six sessions recouped 55.9 or 1.3% to end the day at 4,270.7. Demand for the leaders spilled over into the second liners, where the FTSE 250 put on a more sedate performance, finishing a net 15.8 ahead at 4,552.7. But the market's smaller stocks were overlooked with the FTSE SmallCap index showing a 0.4 decline at 2,311.7. There was no news on the Fed during London market hours; a decision on rates was expected shortly after 7pm London time. Dealers said a rise of 25 basis points in US interest rates was fully priced into global markets and that Wall Street would probably consolidate its gains if that was the extent of the policy change. Some warned, however, that a no change policy or a 50 basis points increase would be unwelcome and could trigger another setback on US markets. But the overall feeling in London was that Mr Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, had done an expert job in softening up markets to expect a rate rise. ""He's warned of irrational exuberance, overheated asset prices and pre-emptive strikes,"" said one trader. Gilts gave a measure of support to the equity market, climbing in a range of 6 to 11 ticks in front of today's auction of #2.5bn-worth of 10-year stock. The big recovery in UK stock prices was evident from the start of trading when marketmakers, who added to the market's weakness on Monday by unloading all their remaining long positions ahead of the FOMC meeting, had to cope with buyers chasing UK shares after the Dow's rise. They hoisted their opening levels, hoping to head off any big buying orders, but encountered a flurry of buyers adopting the view that a correction had run its course in the short term. Demand for good quality stocks continued throughout the morning and carried on into the afternoon when the Dow's early strength gave London a second wind, driving the FTSE up more than 50 points. There were hints, however, that the big marketmakers were becoming increasingly reluctant to make aggressive prices in large sizes because of the extreme volatility in stock markets. Turnover remained at relatively high levels, reaching 975m by 6pm, well ahead of Monday's 805.9m. Customer business on Monday was valued at #3bn. Copyright Financial Times Limited 1997.

362,1997-03-25,1997-03-26,Financial Times,Bourses respond to overnight US gains.,"With the FOMC decision on US interest rates expected after European hours, bourses decided that they had discounted a 25 basis point increase and did their best to match the Dow's overnight gain of 100 points or 1.5%. FRANKFURT saw the dollar clear the DM 1.69 mark, the German domestic bond market gain from better than expected consumer price data, and a further rise in US share prices by the American mid-morning. The Dax index responded with a rise of 72.36 or 2.2% to an Ibis-indicated 3,374.93, turnover rising from DM 9.7bn to DM 12.4bn. The response to corporate news was mixed. In steels, Thyssen dived DM 35.50 or 8.7% to DM 375 after Krupp Hoesch called off its reverse takeover bid. This setback, however, followed a gain of more than 50% this year. Krupp, relatively strong against the market but on a less hair-raising trajectory than its target, fell DM 8 or 2.4% to DM 329. On the brighter side, BMW reported higher profits, aimed for higher productivity and profits this year and said that it wanted to raise its return on sales from 3.2% to 7% in the longer term. The carmaker's shares rose DM 61 or 5.1% to DM 1.253. In pharmaceuticals, meanwhile, Merck climbed DM 2.35 or 3.6% to DM 68.35 after the company reported that its 1996 profits surged 36%, and said that the current business year had started well. PARIS pitched in with a gain of 1.7%, the CAC 40 index closing 44.97 higher at 2,624.25 and turnover rising from FFr 4.8bn to FFr 6.7bn. There was another twist in the Suez/Lyonnaise des Eaux merger speculation after the newspaper, Le Monde, suggested that Lyonnaise would be the bidder. Suez recovered FFr 3.70 or 1.3% to FFr 281 but Lyonnaise fell FFr 2 to FFr 572. Sanofi rose FFr 19 or 3.6% to FFr 542; it signed an agreement to sell sophisticated blood sample test equipment to Beckman Instruments of the US. Essilor, the lens maker, talked about cutting its debt and rose FFr 30 to FFr 1,530. Higher profits came from CIC, the banking group, which rose FFr 13.50 to FFr 368.50; and from Damart, the mail order thermal underwear group, which was the biggest riser of the day with a gain of FFr 385 or 8.7% to FFr 4,825. ZURICH looked for support to Wall Street and the rising dollar and, by the close, the SMI index stood 61.3 or 1.4% higher at 4,558.6. Novartis, SwFr 46 higher at SF1,760, was the day's winner among the pharmaceuticals on switching out of Roche. The latter's certificates gave up SwFr 80 to SwFr 12,170 as the market digested details of its 1996 profits, which were released after the market closed on Monday. Banks put in a positive performance with UBS up SwFr 19 at SwFr 1,282 and SBC SwFr 7.50 higher at SwFr 301.50. Credit Suisse rose SwFr 6.50 to SwFr 173. Insurers were mixed, with Zurich Insurance up SwFr 9.50 to SwFr 448 and Swiss Re SwFr 29 ahead at SwFr 1,492, both making up for ground lost recently. Winterthur edged SwFr 2 lower to SwFr 987 on profit-taking. Nestle was up SwFr 6 to SwFr 1,577; CS First Boston expected the food group to announce earnings growth today of 9.1% to SwFr 81.20 a share for 1996. Among the smaller issues, Surveillance and Richemont underperformed, losing SwFr 80 and SwFr 15 to SwFr 2,950 and SwFr 1,925 respectively. MILAN moved ahead on renewed strong demand for the telecoms sector, traditionally a target for foreign investors, and the Comit index registered a rise of 5.54 to 735.87. Stet, the telecoms holding company, jumped L270 to L7,475 and Telecom Italia was L155 ahead at L4,265; on Monday, the treasury fixed 3% as the maximum stake that any one investor could take in the company after the Stet-TI merger and privatisation. TI was also supported after Salomon Brothers confirmed its buy recommendation on the stock. Tim, the mobile telephone operator, was also in demand, rising L157 to L4,747. AMSTERDAM recouped Monday's losses, the AEX index closing 12.62 higher at 727.84; financials, similarly, recovered from weakness a day before with Fortis Amev up Fl 2.60 or 3.8% at Fl 71.50 after Monday's Fl 2.70 decline. Heineken rose Fl 12.20 to Fl 334, boosted by Lehman Brothers' decision to put the brewer on its European recommended list; but Polygram fell Fl 2.10 to Fl 92.80 although two films from the entertainment group collected three awards at Monday's Oscar ceremonies in Los Angeles. MADRID brokers said that most buying was technicallybased, and influenced by adjustment of positions at the end of the March quarter as the general index rose 7.34 or 1.6% to 5,438.76. Telefonica rose Pta70 at Pta3,450, helped partly by unconfirmed reports of a tariff adjustment; Repsol rose Pta100 to Pta5,900 in the run up to the privatisation of the government's last 10% stake in the oil company after Easter. COPENHAGEN celebrated a 68% rise in pre-tax profits, well above analysts' expectations, from the cement and engineering group, FLS Industries. FLS closed DKr25 higher at DKr845 as the KFX index rose 0.46 to 153.30. ISTANBUL took a 4.5% dive following last week's 10.3% surge, blaming political tensions between the military and the Islamist government wings of the Turkish establishment and a rise in bond yields from last week's 106.77% to 114.71% following the latest auction. The IMKB National-100 index tumbled 74 to 1,577 but turnover plunged to TL26,150bn from Monday's TL40,730bn.

363,1997-03-25,1997-03-26,Financial Times,S Africa gold stocks end flat.,"Johannesburg was steady in cautious trade awaiting the US FOMC meeting although, analysts said, a 25 basis point rise in interest rates was already discounted. The bullion price, trading above $351 an ounce, rekindled limited interest in golds in afternoon trade, but the golds index ended flat. Analysts said that some institutional buying was seen at the day's lower levels but turnover was moderate at R613m.

364,1997-03-25,1997-03-26,Financial Times,US shares slip after rate rise.,"US shares showed modest losses yesterday after the Federal Reserve's Open Market Committee moved to boost the federal funds rate by 25 basis points to 5 1/2%, writes Lisa Bransten in New York. At 3pm, 45 minutes after the announcement was made, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was off 21.90 at 6,883.35 and the more broadly traded Standard &Poor's 500 had added 1.17 at 789.72. Volume on the NYSE came to 394m shares. Most Wall Street economists had expected the rate increase and the market initially rallied after the news, with the Dow jumpingmore than 47 points before quickly reversing course. Shares fell as the text of the Fed's statement was released. That statement - which referred to ""persisting strength in demand, which is progressively increasing the risk of inflationary imbalances developing in the economy"" - was interpreted by some as a sign that there was more monetary tightening to come. The interest rate increase weighed heavily on cyclical shares, which would be hit hardest by an economic slowdown. The Morgan Stanley index of cyclical shares shed more than 1%, while the counterpart index of consumer shares was just 0.2% weaker. Falling cyclical shares in the Dow included Aluminum Company of America (Alcoa) off $2 at $70, Du Pont dropping $1 3/4 at $112 1/2, and International Paper, which shed $1 1/2 at $41 3/8. Meanwhile, the Dow got some support from rising shares in consumer goods companies. Merck added $1 1/4 at $91 1/8, Philip Morris rose $3 5/8 to $119 1/2 and McDonald's was $1/8 stronger at $47 1/2. Technology shares, which have been falling for most of the month, held on to modest gains despite the rate increase. The Nasdaq composite, which is weighed toward technology shares, was 3.87 stronger at 1,246.51 and the Pacific Stock Exchange technology index was 0.6 stronger. Intel, the semiconductor giant that is the biggest issue on the Nasdaq, regained $3 1/2 at $134 1/8. Since February 4, the company has lost $34 1/8 or nearly 21% of its value as some investors took money out of the technology sector. TORONTO was firm at midday, following through from Monday's rally, but trade was thin and cautious as investors waited for news from the FOMC, and with most already discounting a quarter point increase in interest rates. The TSE-300 composite index rose 21.93 to 6,166.18 in trade of 33.2m shares worth C$586m. Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce rose 45 cents to C$34.25 following news that each CIBC dividend capital receipt and secondary warrant would be split on a two for one basis. The potential merger involving Avenor, Repap Enterprises and Domtar continued to attract attention. Avenor lost 60 cents to C$23.40 while Repap rose 16 cents to C$2.35 and Domtar was flat at C$11.45.

365,1997-03-25,1997-03-26,Financial Times,MARKET REPORT - FOOTSIE DERIVATIVES SHOOK OFF MONDAY'S GLOOM.,"Footsie derivatives shook off Monday's gloom as dealers in both futures and traded options came to terms with the prospect of a rise in US interest rates, writes Joel Kibazo. Dealers appeared to settle for a US rate rise of 25 basis points following the FOMC meeting held yesterday. ""A rise any higher than that will see us going back down,"" said one. Traders instead turned their attention to the overnight gains on Wall Street. The higher than expected opening trade in the June futures contract on the FTSE 100 was an indication of the trend that lay ahead. It started at a firm 4,264. But for a brief retreat to 4,260 in the first hour, June moved steadily ahead for the rest of the session. There was a brief pause in the contract ahead of the opening of New York, but a firm start to trading in that market triggered a further bout of buying of June in London. It closed at 4,293, up 55 on its previous session and at a 23 point premium to the underlying cash market. Continued demand in after-hours trading saw June break through the 4,300 barrier to settle at 4,301. Volume in the sector was 11,825 contracts. Increased activity in traded options brought higher turnover. Volume was 55,448 lots against 42,765 dealt on Monday. BG was the busiest stock option with a total of 4,173 trades.

371,1997-03-25,1997-03-26,Financial Times,US shares slip after rate rise.,"US shares slipped yesterday after the Federal Reserve's Open Market Committee moved to boost the federal funds rate by 25 basis points to 5 1/2%, writes Lisa Bransten in New York. By the close the Dow Jones Industrial Average was off 29.08 at 6,876.17 and the more broadly traded Standard &Poor's 500 had fallen 1.82 at 789.07. Volume on the NYSE came to 485m shares. Most Wall Street economists had expected the rate increase and the market initially rallied after the news, with the Dow jumping more than 47 points before quickly reversing course. Economists were divided about whether the move was a one-off tightening or the first in a series of moves to slow the economy. In a statement the FOMC said the ""action was taken in light of persisting strength in demand, which is progressively increasing the risk of inflationary imbalances developing in the economy"". The interest rate increase weighed heavily on cyclical shares, which would be hit hardest by an economic slowdown. The Morgan Stanley index of cyclical shares shed 1.2%, while the counterpart index of consumer shares was just 0.4% weaker. Falling cyclical shares in the Dow included Aluminium Company of America (Alcoa) off $2 at $70, Du Pont dropping $2 3/8 at $111 7/8, and International Paper, which shed $7/8 at $42. Meanwhile, the Dow got some support from rising shares in consumer goods companies. Merck added $1 at $90 7/8, Philip Morris rose $2 5/8 to $118 1/2 and McDonald's was $1/8 stronger at $47 1/2. Technology shares, which have been falling for most of the month, held on to modest gains despite the rate increase. The Nasdaq composite, which is weighed toward technology shares, was 5.42 stronger at 1,248.06 and the Pacific Stock Exchange technology index was 0.4 stronger. Intel, the semiconductor giant that is the biggest issue on the Nasdaq, regained $2 5/8 at $133 1/4. Since February 4, the company has lost $34 1/8 or nearly 21% of its value as some investors took money out of the technology sector. TORONTO ended flat after a morning rally was cut short by the US Federal Reserve's decision to raise interest rates. The TSE-300 composite index fell just 0.49 or 0.01% to 6143.76. Declines outpaced advances 477 to 462 and trade of 87.8m shares worth C$1.60. Ten of the 14 stock groups rose. Metals dropped 1.83%, Falconbridge falling C$1.30 to C$30.45 and Alcan Aluminium sliding C$1.20 to C$48.80. Golds declined 0.92%, with Barrick Gold easing 50 cents to C$35. Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce ended 35 cents lower at C$33.45 following news that each CIBC dividend capital receipt and secondary warrant would be split on a two for one basis.

372,1997-03-25,1997-03-26,Financial Times,Dollar steady on US rate rise.,"The dollar remained steady following the decision to raise US rates by 25 basis points yesterday, and was trading almost unchanged from its London close immediately after the announcement by the US Federal Reserve. Ahead of the US Federal Open Market Committee policy making meeting, the dollar remained firm on technical activity. It closed up Y 1.1 against the yen in London at Y 123.9 and 0.3 pfennigs against the D-Mark at DM 1.691. Hedge funds sold the yen aggressively against the D-Mark, triggering yen selling against sterling. The D-Mark closed Y 0.56 against yen to Y 73.29 while the pound finished Y 2.7 higher at Y 200.6. The yen was also hit by a decline in Japanese short term interest rates. The Bank of Japan's accommodative stance in its daily money market operations reconfirmed expectations of low interest rates in the foreseeable future as did comments by a leading Japanese banker. Traders are concerned about extra volatility over the next few days due to the Easter holiday weekend and the end of the Japanese fiscal year. The increase in technical activity amid low trading volumes is likely to boost price volatility. ""Our primary concern is a liquidity problem,"" said Mr Michael Wallace, senior currency economist at MMS International, adding that the pound and the dollar which have gained on hopes of higher interest rates could see some profit taking. Nervousness that higher rates in the US could lead to rate increases in Europe affected Swiss short term rates. Short term deposit rates edged up to the 2% level on comments by German officials over a possible US interest rate increase earlier in the week. However, the Swiss central bank has expressed its resolve to counter factors which would hamper an economic recovery, and analysts expect the phenomenon to be temporary. * The Italian lira closed unchanged at L1001 after a volatile day. Comments by Mr Lamberto Dini, the Italian foreign minister, that he would have preferred to see the launch of European monetary union put back by a year pressured the lira, although he added that it was impossible for Italy to backtrack at this point. Reports that the IMF's draft forecasts for Italy's budget deficit came to four per cent of GDP in 1997 also added to the pessimism. An Italian financial daily said that the country needed extra budget deficit cutting measures worth L20,000bn this year if it wanted to reach the three per cent deficit to GDP ratio required to join Emu. Strategists said comments by politicians were unnerving investors. ""The clever course for Italy is to say nothing. The problem is that the more the politicians try to calm the markets, the more the markets are perturbed,"" said Mr Mark Fox, chief European strategist at Lehman Brothers in London. The government is expected to announce its mini-budget with up to L16,000bn in budget cutting measures later this week, and may choose to release it on Friday since its financial markets are scheduled to remain open. * Concerns over Emu and the Swedish government's budget weighed on the krona. A flurry of selling sent the currency lower against the D-Mark although the currency finally closed down SKr0.007 at SKr4.513. The Norwegian krone saw support from investment bank buying yesterday, rising NKr0.034 against the D-Mark to NKr3.946. While some analysts see the krone undervalued, there are worries of an overheating economy and the central bank's continued priority to focus on currency stability over inflation. Last week's first quarter inflation report highlighted the risk of rising price pressures due to a tightening labour market and higher capacity. The krone has appreciated by 5% since the start of the year on the back of its strong economic growth. However, there are some fears of an inflationary boom and a subsequent bust if the central bank does not increase its rates, said Mr Paul Meggyesi, senior currency economist at Deutsche Morgan Grenfell.

373,2007-01-31,2007-02-01,Financial Times (FT.Com),FT.com site : Markets Overview: Mixed US data damps Fed's upbeat view.,"There was slightly more worrying news on the growth front when the Institute for Supply Management's manufacturing index unexpectedly fell to 49.3, below the 50 level that divides expansion from contraction, and its lowest since April 2003.  James Knightley at ING noted that there had now been two sub-50 readings on the ISM in the space of three months. ""The rate doves will seize on the fact that whenever we have had a sub-50 ISM reading in the past 30 years or so, the Fed has cut interest rates within around six months,"" he said.  But he added that much broader weakness in the US economy would need to be seen in order to get the Fed in the frame of mind to lower borrowing costs.  Stephen Lewis, chief economist at Insinger de Beaufort, said the US central bank was now likely to be satisfied that 5.25 per cent represented funds rate neutrality. He noted that when the market harbours neutral rate expectations, the two-year Treasury bond yield hovers a few basis points above the federal funds rate. But, the yield is currently about 30 basis points below Fed  funds. ""A significant 'hope factor' is still built into the bond market's expectations, which is not warranted on the basis of the FOMC's statement,"" he said.  Treasuries initially pushed higher after the inflation and ISM data. But the rally ran out of steam following the release of strong data on pending home sales.  The dollar briefly came under pressure from the weak ISM data but recovered as investors positioned themselves for today's crucial US employment report.  Equity markets largely took the data flood in their stride. By early afternoon in New York, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 0.10 per cent, after earlier setting a fresh all-time high of 12,667.03. The S&P 500 was up 0.26 per cent and the Nasdaq Composite was 0.02 per cent higher.  Europe put in an even stronger performance, with heavily-weighted oil and mining stocks providing much of the impetus. The FTSE Eurofirst 300 index rose 1.02 per cent to a six-year high, while the FTSE 100 in London outperformed with a 1.3 per cent advance. Unusually, not a single FTSE 100 stock fell in price.  In Asia, the Nikkei 225 in Tokyo climbed 0.8 per cent to a nine-month peak, Hong Kong rallied 1.6 per cent and there were record highs for Sydney and Singapore.  Oil prices retreated after two days of strong gains, with the benchmark US crude future slipping back below $58 a barrel.  European and Asian equity markets responded strongly to reassuring comments on the US economy from the Federal Reserve on Wednesday, although Wall Street was more subdued as investors digested another barrage of mixed economic data.  The US central bank said the economy was ""somewhat firmer"" and that inflation readings had ""improved modestly"" as it announced its decision to leave interest rates unchanged at 5.25 per cent.  A tame reading yesterday for the December PCE core price deflator - the Fed's favoured inflation indicator - backed up the Fed's relatively optimistic view on pricing pressures.  However, Stephen Stanley, chief economist at RBS Greenwich Capital,  "
374,2007-01-31,2007-02-01,Financial Times (FT.Com),FT.com site : Wall Street buoyant as Fed calms fears.,"US stocks were set for a higher start on Thursday, with the confidence of investors buoyed by the Federal Reserve's assessment of the economy and inflation, while a management change at Dell was favourably received and ExxonMobil reported record annual profits.  In a busy day for data, December personal income and spending rose 0.5 and 0.7 per cent respectively. The headline personal consumption expenditure index was 0.1 per cent, while the year-on-year core rate that excludes food and energy prices rose 2.20 per cent. That placed it just below the Fed's central tendency of 2.25 to 2.5 per cent for 2006.  After the opening bell, investors will receive the latest survey of manufacturing activity from the Institute for Supply Management. Economists expect a reading of 51.7 for January, up from 51.4 in December, indicating an expansion in activity.  Stocks rallied broadly on Wednesday, after the Federal Reserve concluded its policy meeting and noted the economy was 'somewhat firmer' and core inflation had 'improved modestly in recent months'.  Less than an hour before the opening bell, S&P 500 futures were up 3.30 points at 1446.30, while Nasdaq futures were up 6 points at x1808.50.  Fair value for the S&P 500 is 1443 and 1802.74 for the Nasdaq.  Futures for the Dow Jones Industrial Average were up 30 points at 12,690 and the Dow was poised to break the record peak of 12,657.02 is set on Wednesday.  Stocks in the spotlight included Google and Dell.  After the close on Wednesday, Google reported earnings of $3.18 a share, beating estimates of $2.92. In pre-market trade the stock fell 1.5 per cent to $44.16.  Meanwhile, Dell announced Chairman Michael Dell would return to the role of chief executive, replacing Kevin Rollins, effective immediately. The company also forecast fourth-quarter profit and sales below Wall Street expectations. The stock was 5.1 per cent higher at $25.45 in pre-market trade.  In earnings news, ExxonMobil reported fourth-quarter earnings of $10.25bn, or $1.76 a share, on revenue of $90.03bn. Excluding special items, the company earned $9.84 bn, or $1.69 a share, above the forecast of $1.51 a share. For 2006, the oil producer earned $39.5bn, beating its previous record of $36.1bn set in 2005. Shares in Exxon rose 0.9 per cent to $74.75 in pre-market trade.  Late on Wednesday, Starbucks reported net income for the fiscal first quarter was $205m, or 26 cents a share, and the results matched estimates. The stock was 1.8 per cent higher at $35.17 in pre-market trade.  Shares in JDS Uniphase were off 2 per cent at $17.42 in pre-market trade. The telecommunications equipment maker swung to a fiscal second-quarter profit of 10 cents a share, compared with a net loss last time of $42.1m, or 20 cents a share. Excluding special items, JDS earned 13 cents a share, above estimates of 11 cents a share.  Companies due with earnings on Thursday, include Raytheon and Amazon.  On Wednesday, the S&P 500 had risen 0.7 per cent to 1,438.24, after being unchanged before the Federal Open Market Committee meeting ended.  The Russell 2000 index of small companies closed above 800 for the first time and rose 0.5 per cent to 802.12.  "
375,2007-01-31,2007-02-01,Financial Times,Broad rally in stocks as Fed signals soft landing *Interest rates kept at 5.25% on 'firmer' growth.,"The Federal Reserve yesterday signalled growing confidence that the economy was heading for a soft landing, triggering a broad rally in the stock market.  The statement issued at the end of the Fed's January policy meeting - which kept interest rates on hold at 5.25 per cent - for the first time raised the possibility that the US housing market could be bottoming out.  At the same time, it cited progress on inflation, noting ""readings on core inflation have improved modestly in recent months"".  These comments suggest that the Fed is growing comfortable with the outlook for both growth and inflation.  The Fed's encouraging words came after figures showed the US economy grew at an above-trend rate of 3.5 per cent in the fourth quarter, while inflation and wage growth moderated. Consumer spending grew at a blistering rate, while growth was also supported by a surge in US exports.  Stocks and bonds rose in response to the Fed's outlook. The Dow Jones Industrial Average set a record high in afternoon trading, before closing up 0.8 per cent at 12,621.69. Bond prices rallied, with 10-year yields ending the day nearly 5 basis points lower at 4.83 per cent. The dollar slipped against the euro and the yen, while interest rate futures were broadly unchanged.  The Fed acknowledged the strong economic data in its statement, noting that growth looked ""somewhat firmer"" than it did at the time of the last meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee in October.  However, the Fed hinted that its views on growth had not changed very dramatically since the October meeting.  It cited only ""tentative"" signs that housing might be stabilising and altered only slightly its description of how growth was likely to evolve this year.  The Fed said it expected the economy to expand at a ""moderate pace over coming quarters"" - the same phrase it used in October. This implies that policymakers think the pace of growth will slow from the fourth quarter to the first as the effect of lower oil prices, higher stock prices and mild weather in late 2006 fades.  Yesterday's figures showed gross domestic product rose 3.5 per cent in the last three months of 2006 after a gain of 2 per cent in the previous quarter, while the rate of increase in core prices slowed to 2.1 per cent from 2.2 per cent.  The expansion was led by a 4.4 per cent increase in personal consumption, which showed that Americans continued to spend, in spite of the slowdown in housing.  Exports were also exceptionally strong, rising 10 per cent, compared with an increase of 6.8 per cent in the third period.  Drew Mathus, an economist at Lehman Brothers, said: ""The strong growth shows us that 2006 ended with a bang. It also tells us that the first quarter is not likely to be exceptionally weak.""  "
376,2007-01-31,2007-02-01,Financial Times,Treasuries regain ground.,"US Treasury bond prices strengthened yesterday after the Federal Open Market Committee's statement appeared to somewhat downplay inflation fears while at the same time upgrading its assessment of the outlook for the US economy.  The Fed left overnight interest rates steady at 5.25 per cent as expected, but made changes to its statement. It said economic growth was ""somewhat firmer"", helped by ""stabilisation"" in the housing market, while readings on core inflation had ""improved modestly"". Nonetheless, the committee still sounded its familiar note of caution, saying inflation risks remain.  Richmond Fed president Jeffrey Lacker, a dissenter in recent FOMC meetings, has rotated out of voting status, and yesterday's vote was unanimous.  ""The FOMC statement has changed more materially than recent meetings but the essence of the statement is that they have upgraded the growth outlook/risks and downgraded the inflation risks,"" said Alan Ruskin, chief international strategist at RBS Greenwich Capital.  Bonds had already gained on the day. Data showing that US gross domestic product grew at a rate of 3.5 per cent in the fourth quarter, above expectations, initially weighed on bonds.  But later figures showed that business activity in the US Midwest contracted in January. Chicago's purchasing managers' index had its lowest reading since April 2003.  Shortly after the release of the statement, the yield on the 10-year Treasury was down 3.3 basis points to 4.843 per cent, while the two-year yield was down 2.9bp at 4.946 per cent.  European government bonds largely tracked the movements in the US Treasury market after finding little direction from mixed eurozone economic data.  In late trading in London, the 10-year Bund was yielding 4.099 per cent, down 0.4bp. The yield on the two-year Schatz was down 0.3bp at 3.958 per cent.  UK gilt prices were mixed, with the yield on the 10-year gilt down 1.1bp to 4.979 per cent and the yield on the two-year up 0.2bp to 5.483 per cent.  Prices rose on Japanese government bonds on news of a fall in wage earners' cash earnings. The figures highlighted companies' reluctance to raise salaries, despite record profits. The yield on the two-year, which is highly sensitive to interest rate expectations, slipped 1.5bp to 0.725 per cent.  "
377,2007-01-31,2007-02-01,Financial Times,Dow warms to Boeing optimism WALL STREET.,"US stocks rallied broadly yesterday after the Federal Reserve concluded its policy meeting and noted the economy was 'somewhat firmer'.  As expected the Federal Open Market Committee kept the overnight borrowing rate steady at 5.25 per cent and still expressed concern over inflation in its accompanying policy statement.  The reference to stronger-than-expected data since December came after data yesterday revealed the economy grew by 3.5 per cent during the last three months of 2006, beating estimates of 3.1 per cent.  Stocks shrugged off a mixed performance, marked by weakness in technology shares, after the FOMC meeting concluded.  At mid-afternoon, the S&P 500 had moved 0.4 per cent higher to 1,435.04, after being unchanged before the FOMC meeting ended.  The Nasdaq Composite rebounded from negative territory and was 0.4 per cent higher at 2,457.81.  The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.7 per cent at 12,607.67.  The Dow was boosted mainly by stellar earnings at Boeing.Its quarterly earnings of Dollars 1.16 a share beat estimates of 98 cents, and the aircraft maker also raised earnings guidance for 2007. The stock rose 4.6 per cent to Dollars 89.98  Bristol-Myers Squibb was up 2.5 per cent at Dollars 28.74, after the Financial Times reported that the pharmaceuticals company had appointed Lehman Brothers to work alongside Citigroup and Morgan Stanley to examine its options ahead of an expected takeover bid from Sanofi-Aventis.  Altria posted fourth-quarter earnings of Dollars 1.40 a share, above estimates of Dollars 1.23, and said the long planned distribution of its 89 per cent stake in Kraft would take place on March 30. The tobacco conglomerate was 0.3 per cent lower at Dollars 87.27.  Time Warner was 0.9 per cent lower at Dollars 21.84 ater reporting fourth-quarter profits rose more than 30 per cent.  Eastman Kodak rebounded to a fourth-quarter profit from a year-earlier loss. It rose 1.9 per cent to Dollars 26.  The New York Times reported a fourth-quarter loss of Dollars 648m as the publisher wrote down the value of its New England media business. Its shares rose 1.4 per cent to Dollars 23.21.  Hess reported lower fourth-quarter net income of Dollars 1.13 a share that nudged ahead of the estimate of Dollars 1.12 a share and its stock rose 3.1 per cent to Dollars 54.43.  CBOT said fourth-quarter profit more than doubled, with net income of 85 cents a share. The derivatives exchange, which is being acquired by the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, said net income for the latest quarter totalled Dollars 1.03 a share excluding merger expenses. That was above estimates of 99 cents a share.  CBOT was 0.4 per cent lower at Dollars 168.40.  "
