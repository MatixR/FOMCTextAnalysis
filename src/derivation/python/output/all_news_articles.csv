0,,2004-11-11 00:00:00,"['The Federal Reserve raised interest rates for the fourth time this year and left the door open to more increases in coming months. The Fed\'s interest-rate setting committee raised its short-term interest-rate target to 2% from 1.75%, as widely expected. The Fed has boosted the rate a quarter of a point at each of four consecutive meetings since June, when the rate stood at a 46-year low of 1%. Several commercial banks responded by raising the prime rate, a benchmark for commercial and consumer loans, to 5% from 4.75%. The Federal Open Market Committee said, as it did after each of its past three increases, that it can raise rates ""at a pace that is likely to be measured,"" leaving the door open to another increase at its Dec. 14 meeting. Economists are split on the likelihood of such an increase. ""If they see evidence hiring is holding up and consumer spending isn\'t tanking despite high oil prices, they\'ll not be too concerned,"" even if oil prices rise some more, said Peter Hooper, chief U.S. economist at Deutsche Bank, who expects a December rate increase. But Laurence Meyer, a former Fed governor now working for the forecasting firm Macroeconomic Advisers, said the Fed sees little momentum to economic growth at present. ""If the economy is stuck in this [trend] for another quarter or two, they are going to pause in December."" One wild card is the dollar. ""Even with the rate hikes, the dollar has been weakening,"" noted David Malpass, chief global economist at Bear Stearns. A lower dollar raises the prices of imports and thus puts upward pressure on inflation. Though yesterday\'s meeting was devoid of surprises, it appears to mark a transition. The past four increases have been motivated mostly by the Fed\'s desire to lift rates from emergency levels that were appropriate when deflation was more of a concern than inflation. For almost two years, the ""real,"" or inflation-adjusted, funds rate had been negative, and Fed officials considered that to be a recipe in the long run for accelerating inflation. Though 2% is still below neutral, it is now above the underlying inflation rate of 1.4%, based on the Fed\'s preferred price index. Neutral, in Fed jargon, means a level that neither stimulates nor restrains growth, and commonly is estimated at 3% to 5% in the long run. ""Now that the real fed-funds rate is out of [or very close to being out of] negative territory, the [interest rate] path is expected to become more data dependent,"" Morgan Stanley economist David Greenlaw wrote in a note to clients. The strength in employment and declines in oil prices have led markets to expect a rate boost in December, but signs of weaker consumer or business spending or another jump in oil prices could change that. The statement accompanying the rate decision gave little hint of the Fed\'s plans. It said, ""Output appears to be growing at a moderate pace, despite the rise in energy prices, and labor-market conditions have improved."" The assessment was a bit more upbeat than the one issued in September, when the Fed said output growth had regained ""some traction"" and the job market had improved ""modestly."" The Fed also said, ""Inflation and longer-term inflation expectations remain well contained."" And once again, it stated that the risks to both inflation and growth in the next few quarters were balanced. Because the Fed signaled no inclination to pause in its rate increases, futures markets continued to put about 80% odds on a quarter-point increase in December. Still, some Fed officials may want to pause. Just 10 of the Fed\'s 12 regional banks requested a quarter-point increase in the little-used discount rate to 3% before yesterday\'s meeting, whereas all 12 had asked for the three prior increases. The San Francisco and Dallas regional banks didn\'t ask for an increase before yesterday, though San Francisco did so after the meeting. The president of the San Francisco bank, Janet Yellen, recently has been more cautious on the economic outlook than her peers. The Dallas bank\'s president, Robert McTeer, resigned last week to take another job, but that was well after his bank\'s board last met. Regional-bank boards send requests to change the discount rate, which is charged on short-term Fed loans to commercial banks, to the Federal Reserve Board in Washington. Those requests usually reflect the monetary-policy recommendation of the bank\'s president. Though all 12 voting members of the 19-member FOMC supported yesterday\'s rate increase, neither Ms. Yellen nor the acting Dallas president, Helen Holcomb, have a vote this year.

1,,2006-08-09 00:00:00,"['WASHINGTON -- By leaving interest rates unchanged yesterday after two years of steady increases, the Federal Reserve sought to balance the risks of a sharp slowdown and rising inflation -- an effort many economists said might not succeed. Reflecting the difficulty of the Fed\'s task, economists -- like the Fed\'s policy makers themselves -- aren\'t unanimous about what the central bank should do as the economy sends mixed signals. Some economists feel the Fed has raised rates too far already, while others say it hasn\'t raised them enough. In keeping its target for short-term interest rates at 5.25%, the Fed acknowledged that ""readings on core inflation have been elevated in recent months."" But, reiterating Chairman Ben Bernanke\'s forecast last month, it added: ""Inflation pressures seem likely to moderate over time, reflecting contained inflation expectations and the cumulative effects of monetary-policy actions and other factors."" That sentence suggests the Fed feels it has done enough, or almost enough, to rein in economic growth and nudge inflation down to a more acceptable level. Still, as it did in June, the central bank left the door open to further rate increases, saying that ""some inflation risks remain. The extent and timing of any additional [increases] . . . to address these risks will depend on the evolution of the outlook for both inflation and economic growth."" Yesterday\'s decision was widely, though not universally, expected. Stocks initially rallied on the news, but ended the day lower, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average falling 45.79 points at 11173.59. Bonds were little changed on the day. The Fed is entering what has traditionally been one of the most delicate phases of the business cycle. The economy has reached full strength and inflation pressures have built. There are signs that higher interest rates are slowing the economy, but it remains unclear if they have slowed it enough -- or too much. The Fed paused at a similar point in February 1995 and in May 2000. The first time, the economy had a ""soft landing"" -- slow growth followed by five more years of expansion. The second time, it fell into recession. If economic data ""do signal some relief on the inflation front and further softening in the economy this could be the end of the [rate-raising] cycle,"" said Al Broaddus, former president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond. ""And if they\'re lucky and timed it right, that would reduce the risk that the Fed causes the economy to weaken too much."" But by retaining its bias toward raising rates, the Fed has discouraged investors from driving down long-term interest rates and made it easier to raise rates again if needed, Mr. Broaddus added. In recent months, inflation has risen above the Fed\'s informal ""comfort zone"" of 1% to 2%, excluding food and energy. The Fed attributes the rise primarily to companies passing higher energy costs on to consumers, and it believes inflation will drop back so long as energy prices stabilize and growth doesn\'t exceed ""potential"" -- the rate at which the economy can grow without straining the available work force and industrial capacity. Meanwhile, it expects economic growth to remain steady as businesses and exports offset a slowdown in consumer spending. Recent data, however, haven\'t fully supported that view. Economic growth slowed to a 2.5% annual rate in the second quarter in part because of a surprise drop in investment on business equipment. Payroll growth was sluggish, and the jobless rate rose in July. Moreover, inflation pressures appear to have been bubbling longer than previously realized. The Labor Department said yesterday that growth in nonfarm business productivity -- or output per hour worked -- in the second quarter slowed sharply to a 1.1% annual rate from 4.3% in the first quarter, and was 2.4% in the four quarters ended in June. Wage-and-benefit costs per unit of output grew 4.2% in the second quarter, and were up 3.2% from a year earlier. Unit labor costs fell in early 2004, but began growing late that year. Since then, those costs have accelerated and now are growing fast enough to eat into profit margins, which could encourage companies to raise prices. Pat Henry, executive vice president of operations at RehabCare Group Inc., a St. Louis provider of rehabilitative health services, said a shortage of physical, occupational and speech therapists is driving up wages for those positions and forcing the company to rely on costly contract labor. Last year, RehabCare raised contract rates to clients an average of 3% to 4% to compensate for higher wages. This year, Ms. Henry estimates around 50% of the company\'s contracts will see price increases. ""Labor costs keep going up, so we keep having to go back to our clients and say, ""Hey, we can\'t do this anymore at this price,\'"" she says. In its statement yesterday, the Fed didn\'t repeat its assertion in June that ""ongoing productivity gains have held down the rise in unit labor costs."" After three years in which monetary-policy decisions were relatively simple, economic crosscurrents have made the Fed\'s decisions much trickier and views within the central bank have diverged. Yesterday\'s was the first meeting since Mr. Bernanke succeeded Alan Greenspan as chairman on Feb. 1 that the policy-setting Federal Open Market Committee wasn\'t unanimous. Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond President Jeffrey Lacker dissented, favoring another quarter-point rate boost. Mr. Lacker has been worried about the pace of inflation, inflationary psychology, and the Fed\'s anti-inflation credibility. In an interview with The Wall Street Journal in mid-June, he expressed concern at how much inflation expectations, as measured by inflation-indexed Treasury bonds, had fluctuated in response to new economic data. ""That\'s evidence of some residual uncertainty about our intentions regarding inflation,"" he said then. In theory, those expectations wouldn\'t move much if the markets thought the Fed would always keep inflation stable and low. Inflation expectations rose in late April, after Mr. Bernanke broached the possibility the Fed might pause in its rate increases. They later declined after the Fed talked tough on inflation and raised rates in June, and have since moved higher again, on both new data and yesterday\'s rate decision. The Richmond Fed is traditionally one of the more hawkish of the Fed\'s 12 regional banks. Mr. Broaddus, Mr. Lacker\'s predecessor, speculated that Mr. Lacker wanted another increase for ""additional credibility insurance. I probably would have gone the same way."" Futures markets now put only about a 20% probability on the Fed\'s raising rates at its next meeting Sept. 20. They see no additional increases beyond that. Economists, however, are deeply split on what the Fed should do. ""There was a strong case for pausing at 4.5%,"" said Ian Shepherdson, chief U.S. economist at High Frequency Economics. ""There was already plenty of evidence the previous hikes had begun to soften growth."" He predicted the Fed will start to cut rates by next April. Ethan Harris, chief U.S. economist at Lehman Brothers, said the Fed shouldn\'t have paused, and predicted it will eventually raise its short-term rate target to 5.75%. ""You can\'t fight inflation without risking overkill on the economy,"" he said. ""That is a risk, and it\'s a risk they should take."" Though unhappy with the current level of inflation, Fed officials also realize the economy can change direction suddenly, especially when prices of assets -- such as stocks or homes -- fall sharply. Inflation and labor costs were both rising in 2000 when the Fed halted its previous cycle of rate increases. As it later became clear, however, the slump in stocks and business investment had already set in motion a slide into recession the following year and a big drop in inflation. Fed officials acknowledge that a key risk to their forecast is that the housing market could fall harder than they expect, with ripple effects on consumer confidence, spending and investment. Avoiding such a low-probability, high-cost event may have been a motivation for pausing. Nouriel Roubini, an economist at New York University and author of a popular economics blog, said it is already too late. ""The Fed should have tightened earlier to avoid a festering of the housing bubble early on. The Fed is facing a nightmare now: the recession will come and easing will not prevent it."" --- Christopher Conkey contributed to this article. --- Online Today: WSJ.com subscribers can read economists\' reactions to the decision, plus see how the Fed\'s statement compares with the one it released in June, at WSJ.com/OnlineToday.

2,,2006-08-09 00:00:00,"['The dollar struggled back to end a bit below day-earlier levels after declining and then reversing course several times in the wake of the Federal Reserve\'s decision to leave its benchmark federal-funds rate unchanged. The dollar plunged in a knee-jerk reaction to the central bank\'s decision and policy statement, hitting an intraday low of 114.55 yen while the euro jumped as high as $1.2899, only to retrace its losses shortly thereafter. The pause in the Fed\'s rate-tightening campaign was largely expected, as was the tone of the policy statement which left the door open for future rate increases. After 90 minutes of choppy trading, the dollar ended the North American session close to its predecision levels, as many analysts had predicted. Volatile currency trading isn\'t unusual following an announcement from the policy-setting Federal Open Market Committee because investors always adjust their positions as soon as the decision is made public. Late in New York, the euro was at $1.2848 from $1.2835 immediately before the decision and from $1.2841 late Monday. The dollar was at 115.10 yen from 115.22 yen predecision and 115.11 yen late Monday, while the euro was at 147.77 yen from 147.87 yen and from 147.82 yen late Monday. The dollar was trading at 1.2244 Swiss francs from 1.2259 francs late Monday, and sterling was fetching $1.9092 from $1.9069. ""The rate pause was as expected,"" Marc Chandler, global head of foreign exchange at Brown Brothers Harriman, said. But ""the [dollar\'s] initial knee-jerk reaction"" came as investors were ""revising down their expectations of a September rate increase."" Following the release of the central bank\'s decision, the market upgraded its expectation for a September rate increase from 44% to just under 50%. In its accompanying policy statement, the Fed said that ""inflation pressures seem likely to moderate over time,"" though ""some inflation risks remain."" Officials reiterated that they remain on guard for any signs of inflation, citing factors such as ""high levels of resource utilization"" as well as energy and commodity prices. ""The extent and timing of any additional firming that may be needed to address these risks will depend on the evolution of the outlook for both inflation and economic growth, as implied by incoming information,"" the central bank said. The move to keep the Fed funds rate, governing overnight interback loans, unchanged at 5.25% -- a 9-to-1 decision -- breaks a string of 17 straight quarter-point increases since June 2004. Yet the decision and policy statement were so close to market expectations, that the dollar\'s knee-jerk drop was short-lived and it quickly strengthened to levels close to those predecision. The as-expected statement from the Fed is therefore unlikely to change the market\'s general dollar-bearish tone, analysts said. Investors are now awaiting June wholesale inventory data slated for release today, as well as June trade data tomorrow. More important, however, the market will be looking for the July retail-sales report Friday.

3,,2007-08-08 00:00:00,"['The dollar was down versus the yen and stronger against the euro after the Federal Reserve acknowledged recent turbulence in financial markets but didn\'t stray too far from its tightening bias. The Federal Open Market Committee voted to keep its benchmark federal-funds rate at 5.25% as expected. All eyes were on the Fed statement, which said ""downside risks to growth have increased somewhat,"" although inflation is still the ""predominant"" concern. The Fed also added language saying ""financial markets have been volatile in recent weeks, credit conditions have become tighter for some households and businesses, and the housing correction is ongoing."" Some investors -- particularly in the stock market -- had been hoping the Fed would signal a more dovish position in light of the recent credit crunch. Equities dropped sharply immediately after the statement and this sent the yen higher versus the euro and the dollar. Later on, however, stocks bounced into positive territory and the Japanese currency ceded its gains. ""The Fed didn\'t really say enough to calm market volatility, and as long as markets remain volatile, I think that risky assets will continue under pressure"" and lend strength to the yen, said Sophia Drossos, currency strategist at Morgan Stanley in New York. Late in New York, the euro was at $1.3750, down from $1.3783 late Monday, while the dollar was at 118.71 yen, down from 119.09 yen. The euro was at 163.37 yen, down from 164.05 yen, while the pound was at $2.0228, down from $2.0301. The dollar was at 1.1960 Swiss francs, up from 1.1922 francs. With the Fed still clinging close to its central scenario that inflation is its main concern, the statement did little to move the dollar versus the euro. ""It\'s kind of a tough-love message from the Fed,"" Ms. Drossos said. ""The Fed doesn\'t want to interfere with the risk repricing process, and though it recognizes some downside risks to growth . . . it\'s not enough to cause the Fed to veer from its path.""

4,,2003-09-17 00:00:00,"['WASHINGTON -- The Federal Reserve left interest rates unchanged as a government report that showed underlying inflation at a 37-year low kept the central bank on alert for inflation falling too much. The Fed, as expected, left its target for the federal-funds rate, charged on overnight loans between banks, at 1%, its lowest since 1958. It also said, as it has since May, that the risks to economic growth are balanced, but there is a greater risk of an ""unwelcome fall in inflation"" than of an increase. It also said that rates could remain low for a ""considerable period."" The statement accompanying the unanimous rate decision by the 12 voting members of the Federal Open Market Committee, the central bank\'s policy-making body, was almost identical to the statement after its Aug. 12 meeting. ""They don\'t want to do anything to upset the markets in terms of changing the communications strategy,"" said Janet Yellen, a former Fed governor. Indeed, there was almost no reaction in bond or stock markets. By contrast, when Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan tried in previous statements to convey that the Fed would take its time about raising interest rates, bond prices plunged and yields shot up. Still, the overall tone of the message and the minor changes the Fed did make underlined its caution on the economy and falling inflation. Despite recent strong economic data that have prompted private economists to expect growth at more than a 4% annual rate in the second half of this year, the Fed merely acknowledged, as it did last month, that ""spending is firming."" It actually struck a more pessimistic note about employment, which it said has been ""weakening,"" than it did a month ago, when it said job indicators were ""mixed."" The biggest question hanging over Fed policy is what it means by a ""considerable period."" The phrase was added last month to underline that with inflation already so low, the Fed doesn\'t need to raise interest rates as quickly as it has in previous recoveries to head off surging price pressure. The Fed\'s concern about inflation falling too low got some support from yesterday\'s Labor Department report that the consumer price index rose 0.3% in August from July, almost entirely as a result of a 2.7% jump in energy prices. Excluding food and energy, ""core"" prices rose just 0.1% and were up only 1.3% from a year earlier, the lowest annual increase since 1966. The so-called chained consumer price index, which better reflects shifting spending patterns than the regular index, shows an even lower core inflation rate of 0.8%. Either way, inflation is near the bottom of the 1% to 2% range that many Fed officials think is ideal. Below that range, there is a heightened risk that a shock to the economy could turn low inflation into deflation, or generally falling prices. Deflation can undermine the economy by squeezing heavily indebted borrowers and making it difficult for the Fed to stimulate spending. --- Journal Link: WSJ.com subscribers can see the latest economic reports, at WSJ.com/JournalLinks.

5,,2003-09-17 00:00:00,"['NEW YORK -- On a day when Federal Reserve policy makers deliberated interest-rate policy, the focus of foreign-exchange markets was very much on a central bank from a different country: Japan. With the yen surging 1.2% yesterday against the dollar and 2.1% against the euro, investors were waiting to see whether Japan\'s Ministry of Finance -- which has been a dominant force in the markets of late -- would once again step in to stop the yen from getting too strong and derailing the country\'s export-led recovery. In the end, Japan\'s government was apparently a no-show. And while the dollar strengthened against its European counterparts, its lack of good fortune against the yen reflects the fact that currency speculators were betting Japanese authorities would be hesitant to intervene heavily to support the dollar ahead of this weekend\'s meeting of finance ministers from the Group of Seven industrialized nations. ""We\'re in a highly dangerous situation,"" as far as the yen\'s exchange rates are concerned, said the senior dealer at a Japanese bank in New York. ""It\'s a very difficult market to trade right now."" Against this backdrop, investors largely ignored a decision by the Federal Reserve to leave benchmark rates on hold at a 45-year low of 1%, as expected. Once again, the policy-setting Federal Open Market Committee said rates will remain low for a ""considerable period."" While noting that monetary policy and productivity growth is ""providing important ongoing support to economic activity,"" the FOMC did shift slightly from language used after its last meeting on Aug. 12, in noting that the labor market ""has been weakening."" The dollar softened slightly in a knee-jerk reaction to that statement, said John McCarthy, director of foreign exchange at ING Barings Capital Markets in New York. But he and other traders called the decision a nonevent for currency markets, and the euro quickly slipped to a low of $1.1155. Meanwhile, the yen reached its strongest level in nearly two weeks against the dollar at 116.13 yen, and a week high against the euro at 129.81 yen. Late Tuesday in New York, the euro was trading around $1.1178, down from $1.1286 Monday. The common currency was at 129.80 yen, down sharply from 132.56 yen on Monday while the dollar was at 116.18 yen, also much weaker than 117.50 yen late Monday in New York. Against the Swiss franc, the dollar was quoted around 1.3897, up from 1.3803, while sterling was trading at $1.5880, from $1.6013. The yen\'s strength was supported by an improved economic outlook for Japan and a continued influx of foreign capital. But traders said the apparent discovery in Asian trading that much-discussed bids placed with banks on behalf of the BOJ had been pulled, fueled the rally. As a result, the market pushed the yen higher still, in the process extending the already massive outstanding long yen positions. Certainly, this is the way almost the entire spectrum of foreign-exchange-market participants -- speculators, momentum funds, technical traders and longer-term global investors -- is positioned. Merrill Lynch\'s latest survey of fixed-income fund managers yesterday showed managers more bullish on the yen now than at any time in the past 10 years. Deutsche Bank\'s Russell Mellon equivalent last week showed yen bullishness to be at a nine-year high. And the latest data from the International Monetary market on the Chicago futures exchange show net yen long positions at a four-year high. However, some traders suspected the Bank of Japan, acting on behalf of Japan\'s Ministry of Finance, had a hand in keeping the dollar above 116 yen. But that was only after a loss of about 1.5 yen on the day for the dollar, and nearly a 3-yen decline by the euro. ""The yen strengthened based on the fact that people perceived the BOJ wouldn\'t be around, and probably they weren\'t,"" said Mr. McCarthy, adding that the euro and dollar probably bottomed because the selling spree simply ran out of gas. Foreigners have been heavy buyers of Japanese stocks, and the Nikkei closed up 1.6% at 10,877.03 yesterday after the BOJ upgraded its assessment of the domestic economy. Demand for Asian stocks -- and upward pressure on region\'s currencies -- remains strong, according to the latest client equity flows data from UBS Investment Bank. The Asia-Pacific region enjoyed a net $262 million inflow in the week ended Sept. 12. Meanwhile, this weekend\'s G7 meeting in Dubai has become the market\'s biggest focus, with currency policy expected to be high on the agenda. Calls on both sides of the Atlantic have grown louder for China to remove or loosen the yuan\'s peg to the dollar, which officials see as supporting Chinese exports by keeping the currency artificially undervalued. Yet while the G7 communique isn\'t considered likely to specifically target China\'s foreign-exchange policy, analysts expect it to echo comments made by U.S. Treasury Secretary John Snow on his recent trip to Asia in support of flexible and market-based exchange rates. The discussions could be sticky for Japan, which has pumped just under $80 billion into the market in the first seven months of the year to keep the yen from appreciating too rapidly, with market participants estimating there has been another $15 billion or more of intervention so far in September.

6,,2003-06-26 00:00:00,"['NEW YORK -- The dollar advanced against its widely traded counterparts in the afternoon, taking back some of the day\'s earlier losses after the Federal Reserve decided to trim U.S. interest rates less aggressively than many had expected. Prior to the Federal Open Market Committee\'s announcement of a reduction of 0.25 percentage point in the federal-funds target rate, the dollar had slipped sharply on a flurry of last-minute positioning that sent a slew of currencies to highs for the day against the dollar. Some investors had shifted to higher-yielding currencies such as sterling and the Canadian, Australian and New Zealand dollars to guard against a more aggressive 0.50-percentage-point cut that would have further widened interest-rate differentials and made dollar-denominated assets even less attractive. The euro had also benefited against the dollar, while the yen remained relatively steady, with fears of intervention by Japanese monetary authorities capping any pre-FOMC tendency for the yen to appreciate and covert Bank of Japan action believed to have supported the dollar after the rate announcement. ""This certainly wasn\'t as dramatic a move as it could have been, and at the margin it\'s positive for the dollar, providing we see positive U.S. growth numbers continuing to come through,"" said Tim Stewart, chief currency strategist with Morgan Stanley in New York, referring to the Fed\'s decision. Late yesterday, the euro was trading at $1.1542, well off its day\'s high of $1.1621 and down from $1.1595 moments before the rate announcement, but still up from $1.1517 late Tuesday. The dollar was trading at 117.97 yen, up from 117.54 yen before the Fed news, and little changed from 117.92 yen late Tuesday. The dollar was also buying 1.3287 Swiss francs, steady from 1.3282 francs on Tuesday. Sterling was at $1.6720, up sharply from $1.6643 on Monday. Meanwhile, the dollar also managed to recover some of its losses against its Canadian counterpart following the Fed decision. Late yesterday, it remained well below Tuesday\'s close of C$1.3592, but had retraced substantially to C$1.3459 from session lows of C$1.3385.

7,,2005-05-04 00:00:00,"['With both economic growth and inflation taking a turn for the worse, the Federal Reserve signaled that for now, inflation is its priority. The Fed yesterday raised its target for the federal-funds rate to 3% from 2.75%, its eighth quarter-percentage-point increase in as many meetings, and said it planned to keep raising rates at a ""measured"" pace -- taken to mean no more than a quarter-percentage point per meeting. The widely expected move brings the rate, charged on overnight loans between banks, to its highest level since the weeks after the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. The Federal Open Market Committee, the Fed\'s interest-rate panel, faces conflicting trends. Job growth, retail sales and business investment all softened in March. Such developments normally call for looser monetary policy. At the same time, inflation has risen, as companies pass higher energy and raw-material costs on to consumers. That would normally call for tighter monetary policy. In its action and words yesterday, the Fed demonstrated that while it is concerned about both trends, it puts more weight on inflation. Spending growth has ""slowed somewhat, partly in response to the earlier increases in energy prices,"" the Fed said. That suggests the Fed considers the slowdown temporary: Energy prices have declined in recent weeks, and claims for unemployment insurance declined in April. The Fed said job-market conditions ""apparently continue to improve gradually."" On inflation, the Fed repeated a line from its March 22 statement that ""pressures on inflation have picked up in recent months and pricing power is more evident."" But it omitted a sentence from March 22 that said higher energy prices had yet to feed through to consumers. The omission follows two months of elevated gains in consumer prices that have lifted inflation excluding food and energy, according to the Fed\'s preferred price index, from 1.2% early last year to 1.7% in March. That\'s at the top of the 1.5% to 1.75% range Fed officials had forecast for later this year. As it did after its four prior meetings, the Fed said inflation expectations are ""well contained."" But in an unusual error, the statement first issued at 2:15 p.m. EDT didn\'t include that sentence. Wall Street analysts at first pounced on the omission as evidence of even greater inflation worries, noting a recent University of Michigan consumer survey found higher expected inflation. ""Any time a central bank removes a phrase that long-term inflation expectations remain well contained from a statement, we should take notice,"" J.P. Morgan Chase initially said in a note to clients. The Fed corrected the statement at around 4 p.m. A Fed spokeswoman said the sentence was in the actual draft statement that FOMC members discussed in their meeting. The omission occurred inadvertently when Fed staff were preparing it for public release, she said. The omission was noticed by a Fed staffer and corrected immediately, she said. The gyrations of markets and analysts in response to the error and subsequent correction attest to the enormous impact just a few of the Fed\'s words now carry. Changes to the federal-funds rate ripple out to rates charged on a variety of consumer and business savings-and-loan rates. Commercial banks announced that they were raising their prime lending rate, the benchmark for many loans, to 6% from 5.75%. The Fed also raised its less-important discount rate, charged on short-term central-bank loans to commercial banks, to 4% from 3.75%. Eleven of the 12 voting members of the 19-member Federal Open Market Committee voted in favor of the rate change. Governor Ben Bernanke has recused himself from FOMC deliberations as he awaits confirmation to become chairman of President Bush\'s Council of Economic Advisers. Fed officials have puzzled over why the yield on the 10-year Treasury bond is lower now than it was when the Fed started raising rates last June. Yields, which reflect in part expectations for where the federal-funds rate will be, normally rise when the Fed tightens. Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan in February called low yields a ""conundrum,"" suggesting that he thinks the federal-funds rate would go higher this year than the 3.75% the futures market now expects. His remarks helped send the Treasury yield from below 4.2% to above 4.6% during the winter, but it has since returned to below 4.2%. ""The markets are always a little ahead of the Fed,"" said Peter McTeague, interest-rate strategist at RBS Greenwich Capital. ""It\'s less of a conundrum why rates are here because the trajectory of the economy is different from what it was a few weeks ago."" ""The bond market is telling us the risk of recession is higher than the Fed thinks,"" Kevin Hassett, economist at the American Enterprise Institute, told a panel discussion hosted by the institute. Inflation isn\'t the risk that the Fed seems to think it is, Mr. Hassett said, because it reflects global, not U.S., demand for oil and other commodities. Data in the next eight weeks, including Friday\'s jobs report, will help determine whether the Fed or the bond market is right. Continued softness could force the Fed to reconsider its hawkish stance and its ""measured"" pace. The use of ""measured"" has been a source of growing debate inside the central bank. Some officials believe the phrase limits their flexibility, and gives investors a false sense of certainty about the Fed\'s actions. Most officials feel it gives the markets useful information but acknowledge that as inflation pressures mount and the federal-funds rate approaches a more normal level, the sentence will have to go. But the word survives in part out of worries that dropping it would elevate expectations of an imminent shift to bigger rate increases. The Federal Reserve Bank of New York\'s trading desk asked bond dealers last week if they expected ""measured"" to change, and how they would interpret such a change. Bank of America chief economist Mickey Levy said that rather than scrap ""measured,"" the Fed can ""just use more and more descriptive language to describe economic and inflation conditions and let that more colorful language supersede the importance of the term measured."" Mr. McTeague said minutes of the Fed\'s March 22 meeting ""suggest measured could mean anything. . . . They watered down the meaning of it, but the fact they left it in there probably comforts some people in the markets."" --- Journal Link: WSJ.com subscribers can see a graphic scrutinizing the Fed\'s statement and read economists\' reactions to the rate increase, at WSJ.com/JournalLinks.

8,,2005-05-04 00:00:00,"['Financial markets accustomed to the Federal Reserve\'s fine-tuned communications strategy got a rude awakening yesterday, when the central bank issued a late amendment to its policy statement that appeared to modestly alter its assessment of inflation. The benchmark 10-year Treasury note, which had slipped modestly in the wake of the Federal Open Market Committee\'s original statement, ended the day higher, while shorter-dated issues managed to pare their losses after the Fed reinserted into its policy statement the line that ""longer-term inflation expectations remain well contained."" The apparent dropping of that line in the FOMC\'s earlier statement, issued at 2:15 p.m. EDT, had been pounced on by many in the markets as evidence of a more-hawkish bent from the Fed, as well as proof that it didn\'t intend to pause at any point in its monetary-tightening cycle. The correction, released just before 4 p.m., seemed to alter that view, fueling gains in bond prices. ""As a further irony, the bond-market rally after the Fed\'s revision to the statement has been larger than would have been the case if the Fed had left the sentence in to begin with,"" said Alan Ruskin, head of research at financial consultancy 4Cast in New York. At 4 p.m., the benchmark 10-year note was up 5/32, or $1.56 per $1,000 face value, at 98 19/32. Its yield fell to 4.178% from 4.196% on Monday. The 30-year bond was up 11/32 at 113 11/32 to yield 4.495%, down from 4.515%. Economists\' reactions to the Fed\'s stumble were more measured than participants in the financial markets, where mistakes cost money. Andy Brenner, head of institutional fixed income at Investec in New York, blasted the Fed for its mistake and for when the correction was announced, given that markets had little time to fix bad positions. He noted ""there is mass confusion"" about what the Fed was trying to accomplish. The bank said the wording was ""dropped inadvertently."" The topsy-turvy market moves came despite a sense that the Fed\'s underlying message remains unchanged from its last policy communique, in March: it intends to continue to raise interest rates against a backdrop of higher inflation. ""The confirmation from the FOMC that they were unable to complete a `cut and paste\' and inadvertently excluded the comment on long-term inflation expectations fits with the evidence that inflation expectations are at least as contained as they were back at the March meeting,"" said Mr. Ruskin. In the end, noted Stephen Stanley, chief economist at RBS Greenwich in Greenwich, Conn., the Fed turned out to be ""exactly where we thought (they were) albeit two hours later than expected: the growth assessment was downgraded, but the core inflation outlook is more threatening."" The confidence was further underlined by a narrowing of the benchmark-Treasury yield curve, with the difference between the two- and 10-year yields flattening to 0.53 from 0.55 percentage point. That is a level not seen since March 2001 and underscores the bond market\'s faith that the central bank will keep inflation pressures contained by staying on the path of measured rate increases. ""Inflation is more of a concern, but they are not panicking and the Fed is saying that although economic growth is somewhat slower, they are staying on the path of measured rate hikes,"" said Dominic Konstam, head of interest-rate strategy at Credit Suisse First Boston in New York. With another quarter-point rate increase set to arrive in June, Mr. Konstam expects the yield curve to grind flatter, toward the 0.40-percentage-point area. Over the past 16 months, the curve has experienced a strong flattening trajectory -- kicking off from around 2.50 percentage points in January 2004 -- against the backdrop of a rising federal-funds rate and relatively low levels of inflation.   --- Shayna Stoyko, Michael Mackenzie and Michael Derby contributed to this article.

9,,1989-08-23 00:00:00,"['NEW YORK -- The dollar sank, hampered by weak fundamentals, a general move to marks and sterling, and a U.S. durable-goods report that fell short of market expectations. Durable-goods orders fell 1.9% in July, following a revised 1.4% drop in June. Economists surveyed by Dow Jones Capital Markets Report predicted orders would be unchanged in July, and the poor showing opened the door for dollar-dumping in New York after the U.S. currency had been flagging in Asia and Europe. In late afternoon New York trading, the dollar was at 1.9395 marks, down from 1.9577 marks late Monday, and at 142.20 yen, down from 143.10 yen. Sterling was at $1.5890, up from $1.5725. In Tokyo Wednesday, the dollar opened for trading at 142.30 yen, down from Tuesday\'s Tokyo close of 142.78 yen. Terri Reid, an investment officer with Harris Trust & Savings Bank, Chicago, said talk of a ""fairly large"" order for marks in that city may have pushed the dollar below critical technical support at 1.9500 marks. ""Once we broke below 1.9510 marks, the market hit sort of a black hole. There were simply no dollar bids until we moved down to about 1.9460 marks."" At that point, traders said, a rash of stop-loss sell orders expedited the dollar\'s decline to around 1.9400 marks. Traders said the action was more a reflection of strength in sterling and the mark than dollar weakness. Sterling is benefiting from optimism ahead of today\'s British current account report, which is expected to show improvements in July for the trade and current accounts. Pound strengthening started Friday, and shows no signs of abating -- at least against the dollar -- until the current account report appears. Sterling\'s strong advance has some dealers worried that disappointing current-account results could lead to widespread profit-taking and major losses for holders of the British currency. But Cynthia Johnson, vice president and manager of corporate foreign exchange at Lloyds Bank in New York, doesn\'t entirely agree. While a partial pullback may occur, she says firm technicals and an improving outlook on British interest rates will provide the safety net in the event of lackluster trade numbers. ""Sterling\'s smooth rise above $1.5800 and 3.06 marks -- both were tough resistance -- was evidence of the pound\'s technical strength,"" she said. Meanwhile, the feisty mark posted impressive gains against all currencies save the pound amid persistent rumors in Europe and later in New York that the West German Bundesbank was planning to raise interest rates when the bank\'s Central Council resumes its regular meetings tommorrow after a summer recess. Generally, however, traders and analysts say they don\'t expect the Council -- the German equivalent of the U.S.\'s Federal Open Market Committee -- to make any major decisions this month. Said one trader at a West German bank in New York: ""These rumors would have made sense if the dollar were reaching new highs against the mark. But as we stand now, there\'s no basis for a {Bundesbank} rate hike."" The West German central bank last raised interest rates June 29, boosting the discount and Lombard rates by one-half percentage point to 5% and 7% respectively. Some rumor-supporters pointed to the Bundesbank\'s announcement that West Germany\'s M3 money supply growth accelerated to an annualized rate of 4.9% in July, up from 4.3% in June, though just below the central bank\'s 5% growth target for 1989. M3 consists of cash in circulation, sight deposits, time deposits under four years, and most savings accounts. But the increase in M3 growth was widely expected by West German economists surveyed by Dow Jones, who said the repeal of a 10% witholding tax on interest income on July 1, which was announced in April, temporarily slowed money growth in June. Additionally, July\'s rate is down from May\'s 5.3% growth, and a robust 6.1% expansion rate in April. As for the FOMC, which convened to consider credit policy at the U.S. Federal Reserve, traders don\'t expect a monumental change in monetary approach while the U.S. economy continues to hum along at a gentle pace and inflation remains under control. On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for current delivery settled at $367.90 an ounce, down 50 cents. Estimated volume was a light 1.3 million ounces. In early trading in Hong Kong Wednesday, gold was quoted at $366.65 an ounce.']",Dollar Fall Tied to Weak Fundamentals And Decline in Durable-Goods Orders,1989-08-22,The Wall Street Journal
10,,2003-12-10 00:00:00,"['NEW YORK -- The dollar sank against its major rivals after the Federal Reserve affirmed its reluctance to raise interest rates anytime soon. But the U.S. currency managed to claw back from yet another record low against the euro. Apparent intervention by Japan\'s Ministry of Finance late in the day also shored up the dollar against the yen after it had fallen through a key support level to its worst showing in three years, although for many dealers, the reprieve seemed temporary. The Federal Open Market Committee, the policy-making arm of the Fed, issued yet another nuanced official statement on its monetary policy, but clearly signaled it isn\'t prepared to raise its federal funds target of 1% anytime soon. ""The things that changed weren\'t necessarily what people thought would change,"" said Jason Bonanca, currency strategist at Credit Suisse First Boston in New York. Currency traders had expected the Fed to drop the phrase ""considerable period"" when describing how long the Fed would keep rates low for, as a nod to the improving economic landscape. Instead, the Fed kept that language, but instead de-emphasized the threat of falling inflation, a risk first flagged by the central bank back in May. In its official statement, the Fed said ""the probability of an unwelcome fall in inflation has diminished in recent months and now appears almost equal to that of a rise in inflation."" Low inflation and slack in the economy allow the Fed to keep short term interest rates low for ""a considerable period,"" the FOMC said. ""We\'re left with a slightly more hawkish Fed,"" said Mr. Bonanca. But it is ""still much move dovish than what we see on the central bank landscape,"" given recent tightening of monetary policy in Australia and the United Kingdom. This should continue to weigh on the dollar, he said. Lower interest rates in the U.S. have weighed heavily on the dollar this year and are likely to continue to encourage investors to park funds elsewhere, which could further erode the dollar\'s value. Some analysts believe the Fed would have to raise rates by 50 basis points, or half a percentage point, before the dollar could find its footing against its major rivals. ""Persistently low interest rates erode the greenback\'s reward potential,"" noted Ashraf Laidi, chief currency strategist at MG Financial in New York. In late trading, the euro was fetching $1.2254, down from a fresh record high of $1.2278 hit earlier in the session, but above Monday\'s $1.2226. The dollar, meanwhile, recovered from its worst levels of 106.82 yen touched soon after the FOMC statement, to trade at 107.03 yen, down from 107.37 yen Monday. Dealers said the Tokyo branches of large Japanese banks -- familiar agent banks for the Bank of Japan, which intervenes in currency markets on behalf of the Ministry of Finance -- aggressively bought dollars when the dollar traded as low as 106.74 yen. ""They quickly started bidding it there,"" said a dealer at a Japanese bank in New York. Japanese authorities have sold more than 16 trillion yen ($148.9 billion) so far this year in an attempt to stem the yen\'s rapid appreciation, which they contend undermines the competitiveness of Japanese goods on global markets and threatens the country\'s export-led recovery. Against the Swiss franc, the dollar was trading at 1.2626 francs, up from the new seven-year low of 1.2598 francs established earlier in the session, but down from Monday\'s 1.2666 francs. Sterling also hit an 11-year high of $1.7466 in the aftermath of the Fed meeting as that currency looked particularly attractive with the Bank of England already raising rates in the U.K. In late trade, sterling eased back to $1.7464, up from $1.7329 late Monday. Earlier in the global session, the euro spiked to a new all-time high of $1.2278 for the eighth consecutive trading day. The new highs in the euro and the pound, however, convinced some hedge funds they should book some hefty profits, a move that began in the higher-yielding currencies and then spilled into the European currencies. --- Jamie McGeever contributed to this article.

11,,1991-12-18 00:00:00,"[""NEW YORK -- The Federal Reserve Bank of New York said it named William J. McDonough executive vice president of the bank and manager of foreign operations for the Federal Reserve System. Mr. McDonough, 57 years old, succeeds Sam Y. Cross, 64, who retired earlier this month. Mr. McDonough, who begins work Jan. 6, will be in charge of the bank's foreign group, which consists of the foreign exchange area and the foreign relations area. The New York Fed maintains relationships in the U.S. with foreign central banks, and Mr. McDonough will be the senior officer for the New York Fed in dealing with these banks. He also will be manager for foreign operations of the System Open Market Account. As such, Mr. McDonough will make recommendations to the Fed and the Treasury about intervening in the foreign exchange markets, and then will supervise the intervention under the direction of those authorities. He will report to the Federal Open Market Committee and Congress on intervention matters. Mr. McDonough retired from First Chicago Corp. and its bank, First National Bank of Chicago, in 1989 after a 22-year career there. From 1986 until his retirement, he was vice chairman of the board and a director of the bank holding company. Prior to that, he was executive vice president and chief financial officer of the bank. Since leaving First Chicago, he has been an adviser to the World Bank and International Finance Corp., special adviser to the president of the Inter-American Development Bank, and chairman of the Illinois Commission in the Future of Public Service.""]",New York Fed Picks McDonough to Lead Foreign Operations,1991-12-17,The Wall Street Journal
12,,2006-06-30 00:00:00,"['The Federal Reserve raised interest rates for the 17th consecutive time, but its words suggested growing prospects for a pause in rate increases, helping to spark a rally in stock markets. As widely expected, the central bank boosted its short-term interest-rate target to 5.25% from 5%. But for the first time since it began raising rates from a low of 1%, in June 2004, the Fed didn\'t explicitly say another rate increase was under consideration -- and markets took that as a welcome signal. ""The extent and timing of any additional"" rate increases ""will depend on the evolution of the outlook for both inflation and economic growth,"" the Fed said in a statement. By contrast, the Fed\'s last statement, on May 10, said ""some further"" rate increases ""may yet be needed."" The language shift reflects Fed officials\' decreased confidence that they know now what they\'ll do next, given how much rates already have risen, its view that the economy is slowing and its concern over an unexpected rise in inflation that it nonetheless hopes is temporary. The new language doesn\'t rule out another rate increase, but gives the Fed added flexibility to base its decision more on coming economic data than on any previous guidance it gave to markets. The Dow Jones Industrial Average, which was up about 80 points before the statement was released, soared to close 217.24 points higher, a gain of about 2%, its best day in more than three years. The Nasdaq Stock Market was up 3%, its biggest one-day rally since March 2004. Long-term bond yields edged down. ""The Fed was not as hawkish as investors expected, and we\'re seeing a \'relief rally\' here,"" said David Ader, a strategist at RBS Greenwich Capital. Futures markets lowered the odds of a quarter-percentage point increase at the Fed\'s next meeting, on Aug. 8, to 60% from 80%. The Fed statement acknowledged, as many Fed officials have in the last month, that recent measures of inflation have been ""elevated."" But it softened the sting by suggesting the Fed expects inflation to edge lower as the economy slows. ""Economic growth is moderating,"" the statement said. ""Although the moderation . . . should help to limit inflation pressures over time, the (Fed) judges that some inflation risks remain."" Mickey Levy, chief economist at Bank of America, termed it ""a favorable statement from the market\'s perspective, but it\'s a risky statement from the Fed\'s perspective."" Inflation is likely to accelerate over the next few months, reflecting the lagged impact of strong economic growth in recent years, he said, and that could force the Fed to raise rates again. Economists, investors and even some on Capitol Hill have lately begun to worry the Fed might raise rates too much, tipping the economy into recession. That concern has been helping roil markets in recent weeks. In a new Wall Street Journal survey, 12 of 56 economic forecasters said they saw a possible Fed ""policy mistake"" as the biggest risk to the U.S. economy in the next year -- a greater threat than a housing downturn, inflation, an energy-price crunch or avian flu. Six months earlier, only eight economists cited a Fed mistake as the biggest risk; a housing downturn was at the top of the list. Some Fed officials share the worries about raising rates too far. All 10 voting members of the 17-member Federal Open Market Committee agreed to raise the target for the Federal funds rate, which is charged on overnight loans between banks. Two committee seats are vacant. But two of 12 reserve banks did not request an accompanying increase in the less-important discount rate, which is charged on Fed loans to commercial banks. Their presidents -- Janet Yellen in San Francisco and Thomas Hoenig in Kansas City -- have recently warned of the risks of raising rates too much. The Fed\'s statement attempts to balance the competing risks of slowing growth and rising inflation. The Commerce Department reported yesterday that the economy grew at a robust 5.6% annual pace in the first quarter. Economists believe growth slipped below 3% in the current quarter under the weight of higher oil prices and interest rates. At the same time, inflation has edged above what Fed officials sometimes call their ""comfort zone."" After a period of rising interest rates, the economy often decelerates while inflation rises for a while. But that creates a challenge for new Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke, who faces the task of demonstrating he will be as tough on inflation as his predecessor, Alan Greenspan. Mr. Bernanke suffered a setback in that effort when he first raised the possibility of a pause in interest-rate increases in April, causing some investors to question his anti-inflation resolve. To compensate, he and numerous other Fed officials in the past month have unleashed a rhetorical broadside, labeling recent inflation developments ""unwelcome,"" ""beyond acceptable,"" ""corrosive"" and ""unhinged,"" raising market expectations of monetary tightening. ""Bernanke\'s a new Fed chairman and his credibility is on the line as an inflation fighter,"" said Scott Anderson, senior economist at Wells Fargo &Co. ""That might push him to raise rates higher -- higher than Greenspan would have had to."" The Wall Street Journal survey doesn\'t see a Fed mistake as the most probable outcome. ""That\'s a risk, that\'s not the expectation,"" said Peter Hooper, chief U.S. economist at Deutsche Bank Securities in New York. More than half of the economists in the Journal survey -- 31 of the 56 surveyed -- think the Fed will be able to control inflation without damaging the economy. Only a quarter believe the Fed will overshoot. Mr. Bernanke likely will elaborate further on the Fed\'s view of the economy and interest-rate outlook when he testifies before Congress on July 19 as part of his semiannual monetary report. Economists generally have a high opinion of Mr. Bernanke, who this week oversaw the Fed meeting for the third time. Survey respondents gave him a B-plus for his interest-rate decisions, a bit lower than the ""A-minus"" they gave him in an early May survey. Lehman Brothers chief U.S. economist Ethan Harris, who gave Mr. Bernanke an A, also gave the media a C for misinterpreting the Fed chairman. Drew Matus, an economist at Lehman, said the latest statement, by raising the prospect of a pause, seems inconsistent with the hawkish rhetoric of the past month -- and as a result, the Fed could ""get caught in another credibility issue."" Yesterday, expected inflation, as implied by the behavior of inflation-indexed bonds, rose three-hundredths of a percentage point. Following the Fed decision, commercial banks raised their prime rate, a benchmark for many consumer and business loans, to 8.25% from 8%. --- Serena Ng contributed to this article. --- Online Today: WSJ.com subscribers can read economists\' reactions to the decision, plus see how the Fed\'s statement compares with the one released in May, at WSJ.com/OnlineToday.

13,,2006-06-30 00:00:00,"['Treasury bond prices rallied yesterday after the Federal Reserve increased rates by a quarter of a percentage point but gave investors hope it may soon pause its money-tightening campaign. Bonds rose across all maturities, sending their yields lower. The 10-year Treasury note gained 11/32 point, or $3.44 for every $1,000 invested, to 99 12/32. The two-year note rose 5/32 to 99 27/32. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note slipped 0.04 percentage point to 5.21%, while the yield on the two-year note fell 0.08 percentage point to 5.20%. It was the first time in three weeks that yields on 10-year Treasurys, which generally carry more risk because of their longer terms, had even slightly exceeded yields on their 2-year counterparts. The Federal Open Market Committee hiked the Federal Funds target rate to 5.25% from 5.00%. The central bank has now lifted the funds rate 4.25 percentage points since June 2004. The tone of the committee\'s announcement took some of the wind out of expectations for another quarter point rate increase at the Fed\'s Aug. 8 meeting and sparked gains in the battered Treasury market, which has suffered in the past two weeks on concerns that inflation was worsening, and the Fed would extend its hiking campaign to fight it. ""It was a reasonably favorable announcement, which opened the door to a pause and put away the bears who were talking about a 50 basis point hike,"" said Robert G. Smith, chief investment officer of Smith Affiliated Capital Corp., a New York fixed-income money manager. Over the past two weeks, some investors had expressed worries that Fed chairman Ben Bernanke and other officials might approve a 0.5 percentage point increase. The market also took the view that another hike in August was less likely. Jerry Webman, director of fixed income at OppenheimerFunds, said yesterday\'s Fed statement means ""continued uncertainty and markets that continue to price with uncertainty in mind."" Still, he said, the bond markets are likely to have a smoother ride than the stock market, because the Fed appears to be committed to continued vigilance against inflation. The bonds of Embarq Corp., a Kansas telecommunications company, rallied Thursday as buyers snapped up the securities, which have been largely under water since the telecommunications company sold the debt in May. Yields on 10-year bonds sold by Embarq were 2.05 percentage points higher than Treasurys with the same duration, and yields on 30-year Embarq bonds were 2.76 percentage points higher. David Novosel, investment analyst at Gimme Credit, an independent research firm specializing in corporate bonds, said the Embarq bonds were due for relief after being hammered after they were issued. ""It was a bit overdone in terms of selling,"" he said. The successful sale Wednesday of junk-rated bonds from Windstream Communications -- also a land-line phone company -- reminded investors that Embarq\'s bonds had become oversold. Embarq, which focuses on the land-line sector of the telecommunications market, sold $4.485 billion of bonds on May 12, preparing to spin off from Sprint five days later. Investors lined up for the bonds that offered attractive yields, placing as much as $17 billion in orders. The risk aversion that swept through financial markets in the weeks that followed, however, weighed on the securities, with shorter-term investors quickly exiting their positions before their profits turned into losses. The 30-year bond traded as wide as 3 percentage points over Treasurys on June 21 and the 10-year piece as wide as 2.3 percentage points over Treasurys last week.

14,,2004-08-11 00:00:00,"['FOR TWO YEARS, Alan Greenspan has stood on the deck of the American economy under a banner reading ""Mission Accomplished."" In that time, the Fed chairman has been eager to take credit for stewarding the economy through a financial bubble and its turbulent aftermath. Two years ago, in Jackson Hole, Wyo., he said it was ""reasonable"" to assert that ""no low-risk, low-cost, incremental monetary tightening exists that can reliably deflate a bubble."" Perhaps. But, controversially, he went further, arguing that it appears there isn\'t even a Federal Reserve policy that ""can at least limit the size of a bubble and, hence, its destructive fallout."" Cut to last month, when he testified before Congress with a full-throated endorsement of the strength of the economy. Even as oil prices pressed higher, employment flagged and consumer spending trickled down, Sir Alan dismissed concerns, saying that the economy has hit merely a ""soft patch"" that would be ""short-lived,"" and that the current condition ""bodes well for consumer spending."" Mr. Greenspan and the Fed have boxed themselves in. After a few strong payroll reports and some inflation numbers that topped expectations earlier this year, the Fed\'s pledge of ""patience"" and ability to wait a ""considerable period"" went out the window. The Fed then went on its current measured course to raise rates to maintain price stability and seemingly won\'t be deterred, even in the face of a sputtering economy. Therefore, the sluggishness must be defined as temporary. So the federal-funds rate went up a quarter of a point to 1.5% yesterday, with little substantive change in the Fed policy makers\' description of the outlook. They are raising rates into a slowing economy because they have said they were going to. To not have raised interest rates yesterday risked seriously wrong-footing the markets and eroding credibility. But the Fed and its chairman aren\'t just in that one box. They are in the middle of a Russian doll of their own making. Mr. Greenspan must now raise rates, because, for Mr. Greenspan\'s legacy, the economy must be on a steady expansion path. It must be so because he has asserted that he dealt with the bubble and its aftermath correctly. For that amount and duration of stimulus -- coupled with the enormous tax cuts from the Bush administration -- not to revive the economy would mean that the Fed\'s ""Deal With Bubbles After They Pop"" policy isn\'t a successful course. Goldman Sachs economist Bill Dudley thinks the Fed has ""fundamentally underweighted the importance of the bursting of the bubble."" It is difficult for Mr. Greenspan to say the bubble is the reason for the current lackluster conditions ""because then they have to say the bubble had real consequences, not just financial consequences. It forces them to take responsibility."" Mr. Greenspan could have mitigated this problem by not declaring victory prematurely. He could have been more cautious about the sustainability of this fragile economic expansion. The Fed needs to keep an eye on inflation, but it needs to do less jawboning and more plain speaking. The Federal Open Market Committee shouldn\'t have been cheerleading for the economy in its statement yesterday, and it probably should have waited out this soft patch before raising rates again. Mr. Greenspan might take satisfaction that he is now being criticized by some economists and Wall Streeters for raising interest rates, when only a couple of months ago, he was being lambasted by other investors for being hopelessly behind the inflation curve. But just because different factions have equal and opposite critiques of your tenure doesn\'t mean you are doing a good job. It is true that corporations are in shipshape, with strong balance sheets and high margins. The tide of the global economy is rising. If Mr. Greenspan turns out to be right and the economy starts to pick up steam again, he will -- again -- look brilliant. If not, start bailing. --- Send questions and comments to longandshort@wsj.com. Select letters appear most Mondays at WSJ.com/JournalLinks.

15,,2004-08-11 00:00:00,"['WASHINGTON -- The Federal Reserve raised short-term interest rates for the second time in two months and, suggesting that the recent economic slowdown was temporary, signaled that more rate increases remain in store this year. The Fed\'s policy-making committee increased its target for the federal-funds rate -- the rate charged on overnight loans between banks -- to 1.5% from 1.25%. It began lifting that target in June. It had cut it 13 times, to 1% from 6.5%, in the prior four years. Explaining its reasoning, the Fed said that ""in recent months, output growth has moderated and the pace of improvement in labor-market conditions has slowed"" -- developments that it blamed on ""the substantial rise in energy prices."" Some recent economic reports have been downbeat, in particular a surprisingly weak increase of 32,000 nonfarm jobs in July. That report, together with a softening in consumer spending in June triggered largely by higher oil prices, has prompted some economists to warn that the economic expansion could be in danger. The Fed doesn\'t share that view. In its statement, it said: ""The economy nevertheless appears poised to resume a stronger pace of expansion going forward."" Morgan Stanley economist David Greenlaw called the inclusion of such an explicit forecast in the Fed\'s statement ""highly unusual"" and ""a clear indication that the Fed feels the recent incoming data represent a temporary soft patch."" The statement suggests that the Fed is more likely than not to raise interest rates at its next few meetings, including Sept. 21, the last meeting before the election. It remains to be seen whether the Fed\'s optimism is well-grounded. For one thing, something other than high oil prices may be undermining consumer spending. If so, economic data in coming months could prove disappointing. Another risk is that oil prices may ratchet higher. If either happens, the Fed would have to consider a halt to rate increases. Still, the Fed seemed to go out of its way to suggest that its previous plan remains largely on track. It repeated that it expected to raise rates at a ""measured"" pace and retained its caveat that it would modify that course as necessary to preserve ""price stability."" The Fed first inserted that caveat in June as a warning that more robust growth or inflation numbers could force it to switch to half-point or larger moves. It did say that the likelihood of higher or lower inflation was about even, as were the risks of stronger and weaker economic growth, for the next few quarters. Even so, recent remarks by Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan and his colleagues clearly show they are more worried about breeding inflation by leaving rates low, than they are about aborting the expansion by continuing to raise them. Yesterday\'s rate move was approved by all 12 voting members of the Fed\'s 19-member Federal Open Market Committee. All 12 reserve banks had also requested a quarter-point increase in the more-symbolic discount rate, which is the rate charged on short-term advances to commercial banks The moves had divergent effects on stocks and bonds. Stocks sold off initially, then rallied to close on their highs, heartened by the Fed\'s optimistic outlook. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 130.01 points to 9944.67. Bond prices, which move in the opposite direction to yields, sold off in anticipation of higher short-term rates. The yield on the 10-year Treasury bond rose to 4.3% from 4.25%. ""I hadn\'t anticipated the explicit vote of confidence in the continuing underlying thrust of the expansion,"" said Michael Prell, a former top Fed staffer and now a consultant in Arlington, Va. ""Many in the [bond] market were hoping for a more neutral message."" Paradoxically, higher interest rates, which a sitting president normally deplores, might be good news for President Bush\'s re-election hopes. The Fed\'s optimistic outlook, ratified by the stock market\'s rally, will give credence to Mr. Bush\'s assertion that the economy is improving and hurt challenger John Kerry\'s claims to the contrary. In response to the Fed\'s raising the discount rate to 2.5% from 2.25%, several banks raised their prime lending rate to 4.5% from 4.25%. Other savings and loan rates will probably respond in coming days. Over time, higher rates discourage business and consumer borrowing, and thus keep the economy from overheating. The Fed\'s action and statement affirmed its overall strategy, first rolled out in May: to raise the funds rate at a ""measured"" pace, a euphemism for quarter-point moves. Fed officials say the 1% funds rate in place before June made sense only with last year\'s tepid growth, extreme business caution and risk of deflation, which is defined as generally falling prices. With the Fed confident that the expansion is entrenched, its goal now is to get rates back to a more normal level to avoid planting the seeds of inflation a year or two down the road. Before Friday\'s jobs report, that suggested the Fed would raise rates at most of its remaining meetings this year: in September, November and December, even if growth slowed a bit along the way. The weakness in July\'s employment report raised the possibility that growth had softened more than the Fed was willing to tolerate. Many analysts speculated that the Fed wouldn\'t change rates in September in part to avoid controversy close to the Nov. 2 election, although Fed officials say the election would have no bearing on their decision. To be sure, the Fed\'s acknowledgment of recent weakness does make coming rate increases a bit less certain. Futures markets late yesterday put the odds of a quarter-point increase in September at 68%, down from 78% Thursday but above 60%, where they stood before the Fed meeting yesterday. A key measure of credit conditions is the ""real"" interest rate, which is the interest rate minus the inflation rate. For almost three years, the real federal-funds rate has been negative. Many Fed officials, in particular some reserve-bank presidents who heard growing reports of price increases from local business contacts, are anxious to make the real funds rate positive again (implying a nominal rate of 2% or higher), fearing that leaving it negative would inevitably fuel price pressures. Some Fed governors in Washington were less concerned, believing the recent inflation jump to be transitory and confident that still-high unemployment would contain inflation pressures. Mr. Greenspan himself has edged closer to the inflation hawks lately. One of his concerns is that a major bulwark against inflation in recent years -- strong productivity growth, which enables firms to boost wages and sales without raising prices -- is fading. Yesterday, the Labor Department said growth in nonfarm business productivity slowed to an annual rate of 2.9% in the second quarter from 3.7% in the first. That\'s still a healthy pace but down from the exceptionally high 4% average of the prior three years. Slower growth in output per hour, coupled with brisk growth in hourly wages and benefits, caused labor costs per unit of output to grow 1.9% in the second quarter, the fastest pace in two years. --- Question of the Day: How many more times do you think Fed policy makers will raise rates before the end of the year?

17,,2001-10-03 00:00:00,"['NEW YORK -- The dollar shrugged off a widely expected interest-rate cut by the Federal Reserve, ending the day slightly weaker against the euro and slightly higher against the yen as heightened political risk continued to weigh on the currency. Sterling, meanwhile, weakened sharply against its major counterparts after U.K. Prime Minister Tony Blair gave his strongest endorsement yet to joining European Monetary Union during the five-year lifetime of his current Parliament. As expected, the Fed cut its overnight federal-funds rate target (which governs overnight interbank loans) to 2.5% from 3.0%, its lowest level since 1962. It also lowered the discount rate (a key benchmark) by the same amount, to 2%. The Federal Open Market Committee reiterated that ""the risks are weighted mainly toward conditions that may generate economic weakness in the foreseeable future."" This was exactly what currency markets had been expecting, a fact that sparked a slight selloff in the dollar in the aftermath of the rate decision, but not much price movement. In late New York trading, the euro was at 91.88 U.S. cents, up from 91.41 cents in London and from 91.71 cents in New York late Monday. The dollar was at 120.83 yen, up from 120.75 yen in London and above 120.27 yen late Monday in New York. Sterling was trading at $1.4692, off its intraday low of $1.4625, but well weaker than $1.4794 in New York Monday. The dollar was at 1.6191 Swiss francs, up from 1.6168 Swiss francs Monday. The fact that the Fed indicated it stood ready to ease again was another factor the market had been hoping to hear, but again, had already priced into the dollar. Increased war rhetoric from Mr. Blair at the Labor Party conference in Brighton, England, as well as another refusal yesterday by Afghanistan\'s ruling Taliban to surrender Osama bin Laden without proof he was involved in the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks kept currency markets focused on the political risk to the dollar. From a pure monetary policy perspective, the Fed rate cut further widens the interest-rate differential between the U.S. and euro zone, a factor that should lead to some euro strengthening, said Mike Rosenberg, head of foreign-exchange research at Deutsche Bank in New York. On the other hand, the fact that the Bank of Japan has been almost as aggressive as the Fed in easing policy likely points the way to further dollar strength against the yen, he said. Sterling weakened sharply against both the dollar and euro, however, as traders sold it heavily after Mr. Blair said the U.K. should join the common European currency this Parliament if the economic conditions are met. Elsewhere, the Swiss franc lost some ground, partly on the back of Swissair Group\'s  decision to ground all its planes because the company failed to make payments for fuel and other expenses. Ashraf Laidi, chief currency analyst at MG Financial in New York, said Swissair\'s announcement had ""lowered the Swiss franc to attractive low levels,"" although prospects of a deal between the airline and its bankers ""may also help the franc."" Elevated risks of near-term military action and/or further terrorist attacks should allow the Swiss franc to continue to benefit from its safe-haven status, however, Mr. Laidi added.']",Dollar Shows Little Reaction to Fed Rate Cut,2001-10-02,The Wall Street Journal
18,,1988-11-02 00:00:00,"['Stock and bond prices languished yesterday, while central bank intervention slowed the dollar\'s fall. Investors were reluctant to make major moves early in a week full of economic uncertainty and seven days away from the presidential election. Although most Wall Streeters assume their choice, George Bush, will win next week\'s election, traders said that with stock prices at the upper end of a yearlong trading range there isn\'t much incentive to bid prices higher, nor any reason to sell. Investors would ""rather see that the question has been resolved before going out on any big limbs as far as committing new funds is concerned,"" said Christine Callies, a Dean Witter Reynolds analyst. The lack of action was apparent in the Dow Jones Industrial Average, which closed up 2.31 at 2150.96 after swinging in and out of negative territory. With few exceptions, takeover stocks moved higher. Arbitragers employed the additional buying power they gained from Monday\'s $7 surge in Kraft\'s stock price on the news of its weekend agreement to be acquired by Philip Morris for $106. Kraft itself weakened 5/8 to close at 102 7/8. Some arbitragers began worrying whether the government might force an extension of the mid-month deadline for Philip Morris\'s offer by seeking a fuller antitrust review of the proposed merger. Among the gainers yesterday, Pillsbury rose 1 1/4 to 61 1/4 amid rumors that the company will be auctioned to the highest bidder, rather than go to Grand Metropolitan under the $60 a share offer it extended late last week. Interco shot up 4 to 71 3/4 after a Delaware judge barred its poison pill defense against the Rales group\'s hostile $74 offer. Other takeover target gainers included Holly Farms, which rose 1 to 53 1/4, well above Tyson\'s $52 offer price. West Point-Pepperell rose 7/8 to 45 1/2, and First Boston 1/2 to 49 3/4. Stock and bond buyers searched for hints of action taken by the Federal Open Market Committee, the policy-making arm of the Federal Reserve Bank, yesterday. While the committee\'s decisions aren\'t disclosed, analysts said the most likely course was one calling for no immediate change in monetary policy. Meanwhile, investors are awaiting the announcement today of the Treasury\'s quarterly refunding plans and the release Friday of the government\'s report on October employment. The refunding plans are especially important to the bond market because it still isn\'t clear if the refunding will include a new 30-year bond. Although Congress recently granted authority for new long-term debt, President Reagan hasn\'t yet signed the bill into law. In major market activity yesterday: Stock prices were mixed in light trading. Volume on the New York Stock Exchange totaled 151.3 million shares. Although blue-chip issues edged higher, declining issues on the Big Board were ahead of gainers 743-717. Government bond prices eased. The Treasury\'s benchmark 30-year bond fell 3/8 of a point, or $3.75 for each $1,000 face amount. The issue\'s yield rose to 8.78%. The dollar was off slightly. In late New York trading, the U.S. currency was quoted at 1.7815 marks and 125.00 yen, down from 1.7868 marks and 125.65 yen.']","Stock Prices Languish; Bonds Ease --- Investors Await News Of Jobless, Election; Dollar's Slide Slows",1988-11-01,The Wall Street Journal

Individual investors took money out of taxable money-market funds with both government- and nongovernment-focused securities. But institutional investors put $20.32 billion into taxable funds the past week, nearly all of it in government funds whose holdings include Treasurys and agency bonds. As lending rates eased last week, notably the London interbank offered rate, interest rates on short-term money-market funds rose. For example, seven-day yields for institutional government funds advanced to 0.95% from 0.83%, while the 30-day yield continued falling, dropping to 0.91% from 0.94% as investors continued flocking to safe-haven investments. Retail investors also pulled $2.43 billion from tax-free money-market funds, while institutions added $469.1 million. Yields on seven-day funds tumbled nearly three-quarters of a percentage point for the second straight week, while 30-day yields tumbled similarly after changing little the prior week. Yields on money-market funds have fallen significantly as the Federal Reserve\'s Federal Open Market Committee has continued cutting interest rates -- on Wednesday rates were reduced another one-half percentage point to 1%.

20,,2008-10-30 00:00:00,"['The euro remained stronger against the dollar, even though U.S. stocks reversed a rally, after the Federal Open Market Committee fulfilled Wall Street calls for a rate cut. The Fed cut its fed-funds target rate half a percentage point, to 1%, the lowest level since June 2004. Initially, the euro and equities markets declined in the wake of the announcement. The market had expected the cut, and traders took profits on bullish positions in advance of the announcement. But the Fed in its statement noted it was adopting a range of extraordinary measures to pump liquidity into the credit markets and signaled that it was open to further cuts. This helped U.S. bank stocks bounce in a late-day rally characteristic of volatile markets over the latest weeks. In turn, currency traders went back to their higher-yielding, riskier bets. When the equities rally then reversed, pushing the Dow Jones Industrial Average to close down 74.16 points, the euro held on to its lead on the dollar. However, the dollar slipped and was slightly lower against the yen. Late Wednesday afternoon in New York, the euro was at $1.2941 from $1.2699 late Tuesday, while the dollar was at 97.18 yen from 97.63 yen. The euro was at 125.76 yen from 123.98 yen. The U.K. pound was at $1.6393 from $1.5898 and the dollar was at 1.1326 Swiss francs from 1.1567 francs Tuesday. Earlier in the session, the dollar fell to its lowest level this week against the euro as markets geared up for the rate cut, U.S. stocks rose and crude-oil futures prices sank. The euro hit an intraday high of $1.2993. Nevertheless, analysts said financial-market uncertainty persists, especially as the Fed\'s economic outlook was more dire than many in the market expected. ""The pace of economic activity appears to have slowed markedly, owing importantly to a decline in consumer expenditures,"" the statement said. The financial crisis, it added, ""is likely to exert additional restraint on spending."" As a result, said Ron Leven, a currency strategist at Morgan Stanley in New York, position reduction continues to be the driving force of markets, which leads to dollar demand. The dollar is considered among the most liquid and safe assets, the reason it is a reserve currency. That high demand led the Fed Wednesday to also announce temporary reciprocal currency arrangements with Brazil, Mexico, South Korea and Singapore to improve liquidity in global financial markets. The Brazilian real and Mexican peso narrowly advanced on the news. The facilities will support the provision of U.S. dollar liquidity in amounts of as much as $30 billion each by the four non-U.S. central banks. Volatility in these countries and the consequent exit of investors back to funding currencies have been a big part of the dollar\'s recent strength. The Fed already has swap lines with several major central banks, including the European Central Bank, Bank of England and Reserve Bank of Australia. The move by the Fed ""broadens cooperation with a wider net of countries, and it should limit the extent to which money-market instability creates currency instability that becomes destabilizing for all asset classes, eventually hurting U.S. exports,"" said Alan Ruskin, international strategist at RBS Greenwich Capital.

21,,1990-11-14 00:00:00,"['NEW YORK -- The dollar ended slightly higher against its European counterparts though stronger against the yen, after being caught between interest rate concerns and uncertainty in the Persian Gulf. Lacking definitive news to drive either an aggressive sell-off or buying spree, the greenback remained bound in tight trading ranges, taking a back seat to the mark as the main market-mover. A robust German economy and widespread expectations of a firm, if not tightening, monetary policy by the Deutsche Bundesbank is fostering the sentiment in the market that ""one can hold marks against everything,"" said Albert Soria, first vice president and foreign exchange manager at Kansallis-Osake-Pankki in New York. While the high costs of reconstructing the former East Germany might normally be perceived as a strain on the German economy and currency, the market is apparently interpreting it the opposite way. Germany\'s massive need for capital amid a global credit shortage suggests that to attract the necessary funds, the Germans will coordinate a firm interest rate policy and the architecture for a strong mark, said Marc Cohen, vice president of corporate foreign exchange for Fuji Bank in New York. This optimism over the mark, coupled with the speculation of a further cut in U.S. interest rates, sent the dollar to yet another historic low against the German unit of 1.4735 marks. The previous low was 1.4753 marks set in intraday European trading Monday. Expectations of a U.S. rate reduction were heightened because of yesterday\'s meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee, the policy-making body of the U.S. Federal Reserve. The perceived federal funds target rate is currently at 7 3/4%. Another 25 basis point cut is widely expected by the market, participants said. Several traders said that expectations of a Fed easing the same day as the FOMC meeting were premature. Nevertheless, it appeared that many participants had sold off the dollar in expectation of money market intervention by the Fed yesterday. When no such activity materialized, however, disappointed participants took back some dollars, traders said. Mounting evidence that U.S. interest rates will have to come down soon to bolster an ""economy dripping with recessionary fears"" continue to encourage taking slightly short positions, said Joseph Cambria, foreign exchange manager at Banque Paribas in New York. Participants are expecting an easing of monetary policy as early as this week, traders said. But, because a small relaxation in monetary policy already is factored into the market, ""we could see a spike in the dollar just after the move if it comes in {as expected} at 7 1/2%,"" he added. Meanwhile, the rhetoric out of the Persian Gulf seemed to blow alternately hot and cold, leaving participants unwilling to buy dollars in expectation of war and equally reluctant to be extremely oversold on the U.S. unit. Late in the New York trading day, the dollar was quoted at 1.4785 marks, up from 1.4780 marks late Monday in New York. The U.S. currency was also changing hands at 129.69 yen, up from 128.33 yen in New York late Monday. Sterling was trading at $1.9630, down from $1.9655 late Monday. In early trading in Tokyo Wednesday, the dollar was trading at 129.47 yen, up from Tuesday\'s Tokyo close of 128.77 yen. Meanwhile, the U.S. currency was quoted at about 1.4798 marks, up from Tuesday\'s Tokyo close of 1.4755 marks. Tokyo\'s markets were closed Monday for a holiday. The White House insisted that it seeks a ""peaceful resolution"" of the Iraq crisis and that the suggestion that Congress be recalled to debate offensive military action was unnecessary. As a result, many traders felt that the threat of an immediate flare-up in the Gulf was lessened, traders said. Other traders, however, may have concentrated on more menacing comments, such as U.K. Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher\'s statements that she believes Iraqi President Saddam Hussein is close to acquiring nuclear weapons, and that force must be used unless Iraq ends its occupation of Kuwait. The net effect of belligerent and conciliatory rhetoric was effectively to keep participants unsure as to how the Gulf-factor would affect the dollar. Much more attention was consequently paid to non-dollar foreign exchange trading. Yesterday was generally a day of broad mark strength and yen weakness. The mark ended New York dealings at around 87.72 yen, up from 86.83 yen late Monday. The mark also gained against the Swiss franc, finishing at 0.8465 Swiss franc, up from 0.8437 Swiss franc Tuesday. Sterling also stumbled against the mark, changing hands at 2.9023 marks, above its intraday low of 2.8985 marks, but down from 2.9050 marks late Monday and well below its central European Monetary System rate of 2.9500 marks. The yen lost not only against the mark, but also weakened against sterling and the Swiss unit. Sterling was quoted at 254.58 yen, above 252.23 yen late Monday. The Swiss franc was at 103.63 yen, up from 102.91 yen late Monday. On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for current delivery settled at $386 an ounce, up $3.70. Estimated volume was a moderate 2.5 million ounces. In early trading in Hong Kong Wednesday, gold was quoted at $385.50 an ounce.']","Dollar Closes Slightly Higher, but Takes A Back Seat to the Market-Moving Mark",1990-11-13,The Wall Street Journal
22,,1990-11-14 00:00:00,"['NEW YORK -- Bond prices shot up yesterday as strong bullish sentiment, fueled by perceptions that both interest rates and inflation are declining, continued to lure buyers into the market. The benchmark 30-year bond ended one point higher yesterday in U.S. trading when compared with Friday\'s closing levels. The advance translates into a gain of $10 for a bond with a $1,000 face amount. The issue\'s yield, which moves in the opposite direction of its price, eased to 8.53%. Corporates, tax-exempt municipals, mortgage-backed securities and junk bonds also posted solid gains. Some traders argue that the advance in the Treasury market wasn\'t that spectacular considering prices of government notes and bonds had been surging overseas long before the U.S. market opened. The U.S. bond market was essentially closed Monday in observance of Veterans Day, although many domestic investors purchased U.S. Treasury securities on Monday in London. The benchmark 30-year Treasury bond rose 7/8 point in London on Monday. Michael Moran, manager of government trading at Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette Securities Corp., said trading yesterday amounted to ""catch up from overnight"" trading in overseas markets. ""We came in at these levels but were not able to make substantially new highs,"" due to profit taking. Mr. Moran said the profit takers dominated trading for much of the morning. That, combined with rising oil prices and disappointment that the Federal Reserve didn\'t reduce interest rates yesterday, constrained the market\'s upward potential. But traders said the mood in the market remains decidedly bullish. Although the Federal Reserve did not reduce short-term interest rates yesterday, market players are ""optimistic that the Fed will ease in the next few days,"" said James Capra, a senior vice president at Lehman Brothers Government Securities Inc. He said inflationary expectations also are improving, largely because investors believe that oil prices will soon resume their downward drift as the fear of war in the Middle East recedes. The Fed\'s policy-making Federal Open Market Committee met yesterday to discuss the direction of interest rates. Many investors expect the central bank to loosen its monetary stance as early as today. Treasury Securities Treasury prices rose sharply from Friday\'s closing levels, but were up only modestly from levels reached on Monday in London. The benchmark 30-year bond was quoted late yesterday in New York at 102 8/32, up from 101 8/32 late Friday in New York. The bond was quoted late Monday in London at 102 3/32. The benchmark bond\'s yield ended domestic trading yesterday at 8.53%, down from 8.62% in New York on Friday. Prices of short-term securities also rose. The price of two-year notes ended at 100 9/32 to yield 7.57%. That was up from Friday\'s price of 100 8/32 to yield 7.59%. The government sold $20.1 billion of Treasury bills yesterday at its regular weekly auction. The average discount rate for three-month bills was set at 7.05%, while 7.02% was the rate set for six-month bills. The rates were down from last week\'s auction, when they were 7.07% and 7.05%, respectively. The 7.05% rate on the three-month bills was the lowest at an auction since the average of 6.94% at the Aug. 8, 1988 auction. The average rate on six-month bills was the lowest at an auction since the average of 6.99% at the July 11, 1988 auction.

Corporate & Junk Bonds More than $1.4 billion of investment-grade debt was offered yesterday, including a $500 million issue of 40-year bonds by Hydro-Quebec, a Canadian state-run utility. The debentures were priced by underwriters led by First Boston Corp. to yield 9.556%, a spread of 1.03 percentage points above the Treasury\'s 30-year bond. The Hydro-Quebec issue is one of the few long-term bond offerings to hit the market in the fourth quarter. Prior to Hydro-Quebec\'s offering yesterday, only $750 million in long-term corporate debt had been priced this quarter. With so few long-term fixed-income securities to choose from, analysts said that investors snapped up the Hydro-Quebec securities, which are rated double-A-3 by Moody\'s Investors Service Inc. Coca-Cola Enterprises Inc. priced an issue of 250,000 units through underwriters led by Salomon Brothers Inc. Each unit consists of one three-year 8.20% note and one warrant which is exercisable between June 19, 1991 and July 10, 1991 into one 8.20% note three-year note. Other corporations that tapped the market yesterday included Pennzoil Co. and Phillips Petroleum Co. In trading yesterday, the investment-grade corporate debt market ended 3/4 to 1 point higher. Junk bonds ended 3/8 to 1/2 point higher. Municipal Bonds Municipal-bond prices ended 1/4 to 5/8 point higher. In new-issue dealings, PaineWebber Inc. officials reported that an unsold balance on an issue of $303.3 million New York State general obligation bonds would be released on Wednesday. The single-A rated bonds, won via competitive bid, are priced to yield from 5.90% in 1991 to 7.40% in 2016 to 2020. Several New York traders said Tuesday that the state paid virtually no penalty for its current fiscal problems on the price of the bonds. Among actively traded issues, the New Jersey Turnpike Authority\'s 7.20% securities of 2018 were 3/8 higher at 99 3/8 to yield 7.24%. No large new competitive deals are expected to be priced today. Mortgage-, Asset-Backed Securities Mortgage-backed securities ended between 3/8 and 1/2 point higher yesterday. Government National Mortgage Association 9.5% securities for November delivery, for example, were up 14/32 at 100 3/32. There were no new mortgage-backed or asset-backed offerings announced. Foreign Bonds Spain\'s debut in the French franc eurobond market was given a rousing welcome yesterday. The three-billion-franc ($601 million) offering of eight-year bonds was the largest raised in a single transaction in the fixed-rate Eurofranc market. And Spain was the first sovereign borrower to tap the sector all year. ""Spain wanted to make a splash, and it\'s done exactly that,"" said a syndicate manager of a French bank. Credit Commercial de France won the mandate for the Spain Eurobond after intense competition among five banks. The issue was sold to investors at a fixed price of 99.27 to yield 10.64%. The bonds were freed to trade minutes after pricing and closed at a price of 99.28 bid, 99.38 offered. The yield was about 0.40 percentage point above the comparable French Treasury issue, the low end of expectations. In trading, seasoned Eurodollar bonds were quoted about 3/8 point higher, but spreads between yields on Eurobonds and U.S. Treasurys widened because the Euromarket lagged the U.S. Treasury market\'s gains.']",Bond Prices Climb Sharply as Bullish Sentiment Is Encouraged by View That Inflation Is Easing,1990-11-13,The Wall Street Journal

24,,2002-03-20 00:00:00,"['WASHINGTON -- The Federal Reserve left interest rates unchanged at a key policy meeting, but it laid the first, tentative groundwork to possibly reverse an unprecedented string of rate cuts last year and start lifting rates later this year. As expected, the central bank left its target short-term interest rate at a 40-year low of 1.75% yesterday, and in a break with the past, it also disclosed that all 10 members of its policy-making body voted in favor of that decision. More significantly, the Fed declared that risks are now evenly balanced between economic weakness and inflation, the first time since November of 2000 that it hasn\'t seen risks tilted toward weakness. The shift in its assessment of risks, which could signal that the recent era of declining rates is over, follows a spate of signs lately that the economy is recovering more quickly than Fed officials had anticipated. ""The information that has become available since the last meeting of the committee indicates that the economy, bolstered by a marked swing in inventory investment, is expanding at a significant pace,"" the Fed said in a statement. In January, Fed officials generally expected the economy to expand 2.5% to 3% over the course of the year, and unemployment to top 6%. But some now acknowledge those figures are conservative. Private-sector forecasts put growth at 4% or better, and the unemployment rate dropped to 5.5% in February from 5.8% in December. The change in risk assessments was widely anticipated by analysts, who predict the Fed will soon start reversing some of the 11 rate cuts undertaken last year to counteract the recession and the fallout from the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks. The economy\'s speedy rebound suggests that, at 1.75%, the Federal funds rate is too low for the expansion to continue without eventually generating inflation. Long-term rates, such as on mortgages, have risen this year in anticipation of such a reversal. Futures markets put high odds that the Fed will raise rates a quarter of a percentage point in May and an additional quarter point in June, though yesterday they trimmed those odds slightly. The Fed did allude to the low level of rates, saying ""the stance of monetary policy is currently accommodative."" But it also underlined the continued risks to the expansion by noting: ""The degree of the strengthening in final demand over coming quarters, an essential element in sustained economic expansion, is still uncertain."" That suggests an increase in rates could still be further off than investors expect. Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan has warned that a boost to growth from inventory replenishment could peter out without a follow-through from business and consumer spending. Although auto and retail sales have held up, and business spending also appears to have turned the corner, Mr. Greenspan has also warned that some of stimulants to growth could be temporary, such as the boost to purchasing power from falling energy prices, which has since begun to reverse, and mortgage refinancing, which has cooled with the recent climb in long-term rates. With Fed officials still seeing no imminent outbreak of inflation, they can afford to wait several months to be sure the recovery is sound. Like the Fed, central banks in Europe slashed rates last year to stave off recession. The formal end to that cycle of monetary easing took place yesterday, when Sweden\'s central bank became the first major central bank to raise interest rates. The much-larger European Central Bank, which sets interest rates for the 12 nations that use the euro, is signaling that interest rates won\'t fall further, but that they will not rise anytime soon either. For the most part, though, the euro zone economy does appear well on the way to economic recovery. For the Fed, the assessment of the ""balance of risks"" -- something it makes at each meeting of policy makers -- is part of a new disclosure policy adopted in January 2000, which replaced the old ""bias"" to raise or lower interest rates. Fed officials made the change out of concern that the bias was too often interpreted as a commitment to raise or lower rates. The balance of risks was designed to be less constricting, by removing any direct linkage to rates or to any specific time period. Thus, the shift to balanced risks doesn\'t mean a rate increase will follow soon. On the other hand, the Fed could also raise rates without first tilting risks toward inflation. By releasing how members of the Federal Open Market Committee vote on the funds rate, the Fed is taking another step to make its decision-making more transparent. In 1994, it began releasing a statement when it changed the funds rate. At its December 1998 meeting, the FOMC decided also to announce immediately major shifts in its policy bias. Beginning in 2000, it began releasing a statement after every meeting. With yesterday\'s change, the Fed will disclose immediately if any member of the committee, made up of the board\'s seven governors (two of whose seats are now vacant) and five of the 12 regional bank presidents, dissented. That had been disclosed in the meeting\'s minutes, released after the subsequent FOMC meeting. --- G.

25,,2004-05-05 00:00:00,"['In many ways, it is not the most logical or convenient time for the Fed to be raising interest rates. After all, there are more than 500,000 fewer private-sector jobs today than there were at the recession\'s end in November 2001. And an army of young people is floating in school or at home with mom and dad -- many of them discouraged and no longer reflected in the official labor-force totals -- waiting for a better job market. The headlines are filled with stories about outsourcing of jobs to Asia, while others reflect fears that interest-rate hikes could undermine the housing market. To top it off, a heated presidential race is under way and, well, it\'s largely about the economy. Don\'t worry. The Fed\'s not going to hike rates unless the economy is poised for sustained above-trend growth. Moreover, inflation is not going to force its hand. After all, the policy-making Federal Open Market Committee yesterday characterized the risks to price stability as balanced, and found inflation expectations to be benign. Although some analysts and investors hit the panic button when the March CPI spiked -- and when that same report rippled through the GDP deflators -- the Fed would have none of it. In contrast, Fed policy makers expressed relief that inflation may be stabilizing, easing their earlier worries about deflation risks. They also noted that the economy is far from fully employed. But the economy will surpass expectations, just as it has in the past year. Investors have caught the scent and so has the Fed. If Fed officials seem less ""patient"" after yesterday, it\'s not because growth thus far provides a compelling case for tightening. Rather, it\'s because they recognize the economy\'s impressive momentum. For sure, the hiring pace is nothing to write home about yet, but the trend-like 171,000 monthly payroll gains in the first quarter are beginning to look like a transition to a stronger job market. If both investors and the Fed appear to be increasingly open to the prospect of monetary-policy tightening, it is because the U.S. economy persistently outperformed consensus forecasts over the past year, producing faster than expected growth and slower than expected inflation. Even following the recent round of upward revisions to 2004 forecasts, it is likely that these same errors are being repeated. As a result, further upward adjustments to consensus growth forecasts are in store, while remaining doubts about the expansion\'s durability will fade. As new data confirm the economy\'s strength, the Federal Reserve\'s prospective path for withdrawing its monetary stimulus will appear to be both more straightforward, and less threatening. Already, investors have discarded earlier concerns that upcoming U.S. elections would discourage the Fed from implementing appropriate policy adjustments. Current uncertainties about whether the Fed should follow a gradual or aggressive tightening path also will tend to fade, as improving growth prospects will make the prospective policy moves implicit in current forward prices seem to be somewhat cautious. Although the U.S. economy has been growing for the past two and a half years -- and since mid-2003 at an annual pace of more than 5% -- doubts had lingered about the expansion\'s speed and durability. For example, consensus estimates currently anticipate GDP growth in this year\'s second half at an annual pace of 4%, slowing to 3.5% annual pace by next year\'s second half. As most Fed officials consider a 4% growth pace to be sustainable in current circumstances, it hasn\'t been clear why the Fed would be expected to hike rates if growth was expected to slow soon to a below-trend pace. Recognition is growing that sluggish employment growth mainly has reflected outsized productivity gains. The unstated implication is that the economy\'s growth potential has been higher than understood previously, as few observers would claim that the labor force is fully employed already. Despite analysts\' doubts, however, advance signs of persistently strong growth have been accumulating. The powerful combination of solid gains in household demand, record profits and unprecedented corporate liquidity represent the classic building blocks of business expansion. All have been present to a striking degree for at least the past few quarters. In fact, investors implicitly anticipate a sharp shift in the outlook. In particular, current prices are consistent with a 25 basis point hike in the funds rate target at the FOMC\'s Aug. 10 meeting. Moreover, the structure of rates today points to a series of Fed rate hikes that would put the funds rate -- currently 1% -- at about 3.5% by the end of next year. Nonetheless, consensus forecasts still are likely to underestimate growth prospects, as the widely cited potential roadblocks to sustained rapid growth are far from convincing. Undoubtedly, expectations will key off job gains. This stands to reason: Accelerating employment growth will represent a more powerful influence on household spending than either the absence of new tax measures or the end of mortgage refinancing. If job gains accelerate to a monthly average pace of 200,000 or more in the coming quarters -- as seems highly plausible -- it is reasonable to expect that 2004 growth forecasts will be raised to more than 5%, while 2005 growth forecasts will rise into a 4% to 5% range. With growth firmly above trend, the case for monetary policy tightening will be compelling, even in the absence of heightened inflation pressures. A series of Fed rate hikes beginning in August would seem appropriate, with the Funds rate hitting around 4% by the end of next year. The implications for long-term interest rates of stronger growth are less certain. Investors already anticipate an eventual return of consumer price inflation to at least a 2.5% annual rate. However, it is likely that inflation will continue to fall short of consensus worries. It is difficult to envision a significant acceleration in inflation with unit labor costs stable or falling. The moderate recent rise in the Employment Cost Index, and the wide gap between current job totals and the pre-2001 employment peak, suggests that unit costs are not likely to accelerate quickly. The Fed may be tightening as the Democrats and Republicans gather for their national conventions in Boston and New York late this summer. But before that happens, the economy and job market are going to demonstrate more strength than we\'ve seen to date. --- Mr. Lipsky is chief economist at J.P. Morgan.

26,,2004-05-05 00:00:00,"['NEW YORK -- Long-dated Treasurys plummeted on fears that the Federal Reserve isn\'t acting aggressively enough to avert a rise in inflation. But two-year notes, which often weaken quickly amid concerns about Fed policy tightening, scarcely moved, reassured by the Fed\'s apparent pledge to move only gradually in raising interest rates. ""The market doesn\'t agree with the Fed\'s assessment"" on inflation, said Gerald Lucas, head of U.S. Treasury and agency strategy at Banc of America Securities. After concluding its meeting yesterday, the Fed\'s policy setting Federal Open Market Committee said in a statement that ""at this juncture, with inflation low and resource use slack, the committee believes that policy accommodation can be removed at a pace that is likely to be measured."" That was ""a very, very benign statement,"" said Bill Quan, economist at Mizuho Securities in Hoboken, N.J. Treasurys initially rallied after release of the Fed statement, largely on relief that the wording, at first glance, didn\'t appear to suggest a rate boost was imminent. Yet, as the market digested the Fed\'s stance, it began to question that conviction also. At 4 p.m., the benchmark 10-year note was down 12/32 point, or $3.75 per $1,000 face value, at 95 22/32. Its yield rose to 4.551% from 4.502% Monday, as yields move inversely to prices. The 30-year bond\'s price was down 25/32 point at 100 17/32 to yield 5.337%, up from 5.282% Monday. For holders of longer-dated issues, or those beyond a maturity of five years, inflation is the primary enemy as rising prices erode the value of investing in a fixed sum for a long period of time. Two-year notes were unchanged to yield 2.319%. In other markets, mortgage-backed securities weakened across the board, with Fannie Mae\'s 30-year, 5% issue off 6/32 at 96 19/32. Interest-rate swaps spreads widened to levels not seen since early September, reflecting the selloff in long-dated Treasurys. Analysts noted that the Fed could still raise its federal-funds target rate -- which it left unchanged yesterday at 1% -- at its next meeting, in late June, if data continue to point to robust growth and accelerating inflation. But looking at the Fed\'s statement, policy makers don\'t seem to think that will occur, said Dominic Konstam, head of interest-rate strategy at Credit Suisse First Boston. ""The Fed is slowly moving to unravel their dovish sentiments of recent statements,"" Mr. Konstam said.   Corporate and Junk Bonds Stock floor-trading ""specialist"" firm LaBranche &Co. sold $460 million of senior Rule 144a notes via Credit Suisse First Boston: $200 million of five-year notes, noncallable for three years, priced to yield 9 1/2%, and $260 million of eight-year notes, noncallable for four years, priced to yield 11%. The issue was rated single-B by Standard &Poor\'s. Moody\'s Investors Service has a Ba1 rating on LaBranche\'s senior unsecured debt. The yields are exceptionally high for single-B-rated bonds, and in fact were a quarter percentage point higher than expected. That was enough to attract blue-chip high-yield money managers, who comprised a majority of the issue, said a person familiar with the allocations. The sale was seen as crucial for the company. In March, LaBranche warned it probably wouldn\'t be able to repay $100 million of senior notes due in August without a refinancing or asset sale. Meanwhile, BMW Motor Credit\'s $1.5 billion auto securitization was priced at what were said to be the tightest overall interest rate spreads ever for a prime auto issue, according to bankers at joint lead manager J.P. Morgan Securities. --- Simona Covel and David Feldheim contributed to this article.

27,,2005-08-10 00:00:00,"['WASHINGTON -- The Federal Reserve raised short-term interest rates for the tenth-consecutive time, lifting its short-term rate target to 3.5% from 3.25%, and signaling more increases to come. Analysts and markets are raising their estimates of how much further the Fed will go, because the economy is strengthening, inflation a bit less favorable and long-term interest rates remain unusually low. ""Aggregate spending, despite high energy prices, appears to have strengthened since late winter, and labor market conditions continue to improve gradually,"" the Fed said in a statement accompanying its decision, affirming that the spring soft patch is over. Inflation, excluding food and energy prices, ""has been relatively low in recent months and longer-term inflation expectations remain well contained, but pressures on inflation have stayed elevated."" The Fed repeated its view that rates would likely continue to rise at a ""measured"" pace, which has come to mean no more than a quarter-point per meeting. The 12 voting members of the 19-member Federal Open Market Committee, which sets interest-rate policy, agreed unanimously on the increase in their target for the federal-funds rate, which is charged on overnight loans between banks. The Fed also raised its less-important discount rate, charged on central-bank advances to commercial banks, to 4.5% from 4.25%. Wells Fargo Bank and other commercial lenders raised their prime rates, the benchmark for many consumer and business loans, to 6.5% from 6.25%. The Fed has raised the funds rate a quarter-point at every policy meeting since June of last year, when it stood at a 46-year low of 1%. In the last six weeks, futures markets have raised the expected year-end funds rate to between 4% and 4.25% from below 3.75%. Economists have followed suit. Bill Dudley, chief U.S. economist at Goldman Sachs Group Inc., recently revised upward his forecast for the funds rate next spring to 5% from 4.5%. ""The growth outlook has improved, and the labor market is tighter,"" said Mr. Dudley. For the last year, Fed officials have characterized their actions as raising rates from a level that was still stimulating spending to a ""neutral"" level that neither stimulates nor restrains growth. The Fed has no specific interest rate in mind for neutral, but assumes it will have arrived when the economy is using all readily available labor and capital without straining capacity. But some economists see a risk that economic growth could soon outstrip capacity, putting upward pressure on prices and wages. ""The question the Fed should start to ask is whether neutral is the appropriate end point,"" said Bruce Kasman, head of economic research at J.P. Morgan Chase &Co. ""An economy that continues to grow 3.5% to 4% will require not just neutral, but restrictive policy."" There aren\'t any signs of strain yet. The Labor Department said yesterday that productivity -- that is, output per hour -- of workers outside farms and government rose at a 2.2% annual rate in the second quarter, down from 3.2% in the first, but still in line with the brisk performance of the past decade. Productivity growth enables firms to expand sales with the same amount of labor, containing costs. Growth in labor costs adjusted for productivity also slowed to 1.3% in the second quarter, the lowest in a year, from 3.6%. A narrower measure of productivity, which includes only incorporated, nonfinancial businesses and is watched closely by Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan, is more encouraging. That measure rose a sharp 5.4% in the year through March. (Second-quarter figures aren\'t available yet.) Labor costs also grew much more slowly by this measure. By either measure, productivity growth is strong, said Martin Baily, a scholar at the Institute for International Economics, a Washington think tank. ""This is good news in terms of keeping . . . inflation down,"" and should comfort the Fed, he said. On the negative side, annual productivity growth was revised down to an average of 3.7% from 2002 to 2004, from 4.2%, and labor-cost growth has been revised up to 0.3% from negative 0.2%. The Commerce Department already had revised up inflation this year, according to the Fed\'s preferred price index, to 2% from about 1.6%, which some analysts said would encourage tighter monetary policy. However, the revisions were primarily technical and didn\'t unsettle Fed officials, as their reference in yesterday\'s statement to ""relatively low"" inflation suggested. Ironically, the more markets price in additional Fed tightening, the less likely such tightening becomes. That\'s because as markets price in more Fed increases, long-term bond yields have risen, to 4.4% now from 4% in late June. If they rise enough, that could cool the economy, especially housing prices, without more action by the Fed. For now, Fed officials feel their actions haven\'t tightened overall credit conditions much, and thus plan to keep raising short-term rates. --- Online Today: WSJ.com subscribers can see how the Federal Reserve\'s statement compares with the one in June, and read the full text of the Fed\'s statement, at WSJ.com/OnlineToday.

28,,1990-08-22 00:00:00,"['NEW YORK -- Bond prices gyrated in nervous trading, reacting to changes in interest rates and news reports out of the Middle East. The Treasury\'s benchmark 30-year bond fell nearly 3/4 point in early trading, but rebounded during midday to end slightly lower. The yield on the bond ended at 8.94%, slightly higher than Monday\'s 8.93% closing yield. Mortgage and tax-exempt municipals underperformed the Treasury market and posted modest losses. But junk bonds posted moderate to sharp declines, taking their cues from the troubled stock market. Most top-tier junk bonds posted declines of 1/2 to 3/4 point, while prices of many middle-tier and lower-tier bonds sank one to two points. The bond market opened lower on rumors, later denied, that a U.S. warplane had been shot down over the Persian Gulf. The prospect of war between the U.S. and Iraq alarmed investors because it raised the chances that oil prices would rise further, which in turn, would put more upward pressure on inflation. But as the yield on the benchmark 30-year bond exceeded the psychologically important 9% level, the market began to bounce back. ""The market was getting ahead of itself on the sell side,"" said Steve Ricchuito, economist at Barclays De Zoete Wedd Securities Inc. ""When the yield went above the 9% level, the market started to attract interest from investors,"" he said. Bonds continued to rebound when Iraqi President Saddam Hussein hinted that he may be willing to reconcile differences with the U.S. ""We had some indications that the Iraqi annexation of Kuwait might be negotiable,"" said Lincoln Anderson, economist at Bear, Stearns & Co. ""That contributed to the bond market rally."" Oil prices, which lead bond prices in the inverse direction, fell after Mr. Hussein\'s remarks, giving the fixed-income market an added boost. A decline in the closely watched federal funds rate also sparked some modest buying in the Treasury market. The decline in the rate banks charge each other for overnight loans occurred shortly after the Federal Reserve executed $2 billion in customer repurchase agreements. The rate fell from 8% to as low as 7 3/4%. The intervention came as a surprise to the market. Although many economists said the Fed action was probably technical in nature and designed to offset reserve shortages in the banking system, ""many people think there may be a Fed ease afoot,"" said an economist at Shearson Lehman Government Securities Inc. One reason investors may have been suspicious is that members of the Fed\'s policy-making Federal Open Market Committee met yesterday to discuss monetary policy and consider whether the time is right to lower short-term rates. Adding speed to the upward swing in bond prices was buying on the part of speculators who had taken short positions by selling borrowed securities in hopes of buying them back at a lower price and pocketing the difference. When the market rose instead, these investors scrambled to unwind their short positions. Dealers said trading dried up in the afternoon, with government securities drifting at slightly lower levels. Treasury Securities The benchmark 30-year bond ended slightly lower at 97 30/32, compared with 97 31/32 Monday. Short-term securities also posted small declines. The latest two-year notes ended at 99 21/32, down from 99 23/32 on Monday. The yield on the two-year notes rose to 8.17% from 8.14%. Treasury bill rates were slightly higher when compared with Monday\'s average auction rates. The discount rate on three-month Treasury bills was 7.58% yesterday for a bond-equivalent yield of 7.82%, while the rate on six-month bills ended at 7.48% for a bond-equivalent yield of 7.86%. Corporate Issues The junk bond market mirrored the stock market, falling sharply as equity prices plunged. Top-quality high-yield names ended 1/2 to 3/4 point lower, while middle-tier and lower-tier junk bond issues were battered even more and tumbled more than one point. Meanwhile, the Dow Jones Industrial Average plummeted 52.48 points to end at 2603.96. Among the issues that were hard hit yesterday: RJR Nabisco\'s 17 3/8% convertible pay-in-kind debentures, which ended down 2 3/8 points at 108 1/2 after falling as low as 108 on the New York Stock Exchange. RJR\'s 17% exchangeable pay-in-kind debentures closed down 2 1/2 points at 84 3/4 after sinking as low as 82 5/8. Because equity arbitrage accounts are heavy investors in RJR\'s pay-in-kind bonds, the securities tend to plunge whenever the stock market tumbles, and they surge when equity prices soar. Recession-prone junk bonds continued to take a beating yesterday. American Standard\'s 12.875% senior subordinated debentures, maturing in 2000, skidded 1 3/4 points to 88 1/4 after losing three points Monday. In a recent report, Citicorp Securities Markets Inc. said the company would be negatively affected by higher interest rates and surging energy costs because it relies heavily on energy in making plumbing ceramics. Junk bonds of another building materials manufacturer, USG, also sank. The company\'s 13.25% senior subordinated debentures closed at 51, down two points. Meanwhile, junk bonds of AmBase plummeted after Moody\'s Investors Service Inc. said it has changed the direction of its review of the company\'s debt ratings to possible downgrade from uncertain. Ambase\'s 14.875% senior subordinated notes lost 8 3/8 points to close at 71 1/8 on the New York Stock Exchange after plunging nearly 15 points in active trading last week. Foreign Bonds Yields on some West German government bonds exceeded 9% as international investors continued to dump their holdings. Among new issues, West Germany issued 10-year bonds yesterday for its postal agency that had a coupon rate of 9%. That was the highest coupon seen on government or government agency debt in eight years. Although domestic investors were big buyers of the postal bonds, statistics compiled by the nation\'s central bank show that foreign investors have been selling large amounts of West German bonds this year. The Bundesbank said international investors sold a net 8.4 billion marks ($5.37 billion) in the first six months of 1990, a sharp reversal from the 22.5 billion marks of bonds they bought in 1989. The selling was sparked by fears stemming from monetary union between East and West Germany. It comes just as West Germany\'s borrowing needs are expected to soar because of East German-related expenses. Private economists see net public sector borrowing around 80 billion marks this year and 120 billion marks in 1991, significantly above pre-monetary union forecasts of 40 billion marks for this year. The last time foreigners were net sellers of West German bonds was nine years ago, when they sold a comparatively paltry 1.45 billion marks of bonds. In trading, West German bonds ended modestly lower. The benchmark 8 3/4% bond due in 2000 fell 0.17 point to 98.60 to yield 8.96%. The 8 1/2% bond due in 2000 fell 0.07 point at 96.70 to yield 9.01%. Municipals Municipal bonds ended as much as 3/4 point lower. A rise in Treasury market yields above 9% and oil price declines pushed tax-exempt issues into a tailspin, traders said. While Treasurys later recovered, municipals were unable to reverse the downward trend. The New Jersey Turnpike Authority\'s 7.20% issue of 2018 was 3/8 point lower at 97 5/8 bid to yield 7.37%. ""We\'re just catching up to governments,"" one trader said. ""We weren\'t trading off as much as Treasurys had been, and we just had some people selling because they thought the market was going to go weaker"" because of the Persian Gulf crisis, he added. Mortgage-Backed Securities The mortgage securities market posted losses after staging a considerable rebound from the most depressed levels of the day in sympathy with the gyrations of the Treasury market. After being down as much as 5/8 point, 9 1/2% pass-through securities for September delivery issued by all three agencies were down 7/32. The volatility has kept many inactive, market players say. Meanwhile, the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp. is offering $501 million of floating-rate and inverse floating-rate funding note pass-through certificates through Lehman Brothers. The issue is the agency\'s third funding note certificate offering. But it is the first time that a transaction in the secondary mortgage market has been structured with recombinable inverse floater classes. Also, $218 million of home-equity loan pass-through certificates, priced to yield 9.26%, are being offered through Shawmut National Remic Trust 1990-A by Morgan Stanley & Co. Shawmut Bank is the seller of the underlying home equity loans, and Connecticut National Bank is the servicer. Both banks are units of Shawmut National, based in Hartford, Conn.']","Bond Prices Rebound From Early Drop to Finish Slightly Lower; Rate Moves, Mideast Stir Market",1990-08-21,The Wall Street Journal
29,,1990-08-22 00:00:00,"['The Federal Reserve System almost always finds itself in some sort of box. Some people will want the central bank to ease money while others will urge it to tighten up. Usually, the Fed finds a way to work itself out of such trouble. This time, however, it may have waited too long. Until March, things seemed to be going fairly well. The economy had slowed, but recession forecasts were few. The Shadow Open Market Committee, a group of academic and business economists often critical of the Fed, said at its semiannual meeting, ""Monetary policy remains consistent with moderate recovery and declining inflation."" That\'s about as nice a comment as it ever makes about the Fed. But things soon began to change, and not really for the better. Nearly everyone realized that the 8.2% spurt of the consumer price index in the first quarter, on an annual-rate basis, was a temporary phenomenon, produced by cold-weather increases in food and energy costs. These factors faded in the second quarter, but new price difficulties arose. Labor costs, which had been unusually quiet through the long business expansion, were climbing. Even before the Mideast crisis sent oil prices soaring, analysts were predicting rising inflation the rest of this year. So far, that looks like a good forecast. As the real Federal Open Market Committee met yesterday, it had to ponder that consumer prices rose at an annual rate of close to 5% in July -- when energy prices were falling. That compared with a 3.8% rise for the full second quarter. Ordinarily, the Fed\'s next move would seem automatic. Inflationary pressures are growing, so the inflation-hating Fed tightens up, right? Not necessarily. Administration officials for weeks have been reminding the Federal Reserve that it has some responsibility for the health of the economy. The rise in the inflation-adjusted gross national product slowed to an annual rate of 1.2%, and the Mideast oil shock has increased talk of recession. Treasury Secretary Brady and other officials argue that the Fed should cut the federal funds rate, the fee charged on short-term loans of bank reserves. The Fed had been expected to reward the administration and Congress for a budget-deficit cut by reducing the funds rate. But the deficit cut, never anything like a sure thing, now seems even more unlikely in the wake of the Mideast military buildup. So the funds rate has been allowed to edge downward by only a quarter-point in the face of the weakening economy. It was a difficult exercise, not without its ridiculous aspects. The Federal Reserve uses the funds rate to signal its monetary policy. The funds rate does have some influence on other short-term rates, but its influence on long rates is limited. But as the economy has weakened in recent weeks, short-term rates have tended to decline. To keep the funds rate from declining more than the Fed wanted, the central bank has had to pull reserves out of the banking system. Got that? The Fed has not only been resisting pressures to ease by reducing the funds rate, but it has moved in the opposite direction by tightening bank reserves. That leads to the Federal Reserve\'s current unhappy situation. The central bank can\'t move against the increased inflationary pressures without, in all probability, triggering a recession. If the Fed, instead, moves significantly to spur the sagging economy, the bond market and analysts generally will assume the Federal Reserve has caved in to administration pressure and inflation will take off. Is there anything the Fed could have done to avert this debacle? It could have paid more attention to bank reserves. Reserves have been flat-to-declining all this year. Talk about credit crunches; without reserves, banks don\'t make loans. The Fed should have permitted reserves to grow steadily at a modest rate, accepting cheerfully any federal funds rate declines that went along with such a policy. What should the Fed do now? If it chooses to ease, the inflationary pressures increase. If it chooses to tighten, the recessionary pressures increase. Easing, of course, offers no guarantee of avoiding recession. It may merely ensure that inflation will rise so high that everyone will find it intolerable. The result could be a deep recession like 1981-82. Similarly, tightening is not a perfect solution. The Federal Reserve presumably would prefer to move gradually, with the result that the recession\'s anti-inflation benefits will be delayed. In 1981 gradualism was urged on Paul Volcker, then chairman of the Fed, as a cure for double-digit inflation. Mr. Volcker decided gradualism wouldn\'t work and moved quickly. History could repeat itself. The best bet is that the Fed will mark time, hoping for some development in the domestic economy that will make the appropriate action more readily visible. Monetary policy in the next few weeks is likely to be shaped by events, not by new Fed policy. There are times when nothing is the best thing a government agency can do. There\'s no telling what those events might be. Real war in the Mideast might make the recession worries disappear in an inflationary blur. Congress might return from vacation, notice that the Fed hadn\'t moved, and take a small step toward budget control, even in the midst of the Mideast situation. One thing is certain. As a Federal Reserve economist said privately last week, ""We should keep a closer watch on bank reserves."" It would have been nice if that thought had occurred to someone three or four months ago.']",Speaking of Business: It May Be Too Late for the Fed to Ease,1990-08-21,The Wall Street Journal
30,,1989-12-20 00:00:00,"['Stock prices stabilized and were widely mixed after Monday\'s skid, and other financial markets were moribund in pre-holiday trading. The Dow Jones Industrial Average edged down 1.92 points to 2695.61 in active trading. Long-term bond prices were off slightly, while the dollar posted modest gains against the other major currencies. Early action in the stock market looked as if Monday\'s steep slide, touched off by the gloomy outlook for both commercial and residential real estate, would continue. The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost more than 42 points Monday in a broad-based sell-off. Analysts had predicted that the selling would spread as institutions moved to lighten their portfolios. By midmorning yesterday the Dow industrials were off another 31 points. But a round of buy programs related to stock index arbitrage, as well as some bargain hunting, turned around the market by noon and resulted in some brief afternoon gains. Late selling pulled the average back down at the close. However, the selling was again broad-based, with declining issues on the New York Stock Exchange leading advancers by a nearly two-to-one margin. ""You don\'t usually get sustained moves at this time of year,"" said A.C. Moore, director of research at Argus Research. ""Certainly the news Monday pounded on investors\' sensitivity, but seasonal strength took over yesterday."" He said most tax-related selling has been done by this time and money managers are usually content to hold their positions at least until the new year begins. Beyond that, anticipation of a market rise in January as new investment money comes available contributes to an underlying strength in the stock market, he said. Bond traders said the pre-holiday quiet has pervaded that market, making extreme moves unlikely. There was some selling around noon after the Federal Reserve made it clear it wasn\'t allowing short-term interest rates to drop. The Fed yesterday ended its regular meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee, which sets monetary policy. In major market activity: Stock prices were widely mixed in active trading. Volume on the New York Stock Exchange totaled 186 million shares. Declining issues on the Big Board outnumbered gainers 1,021 to 513. Bond prices eased a bit. The Treasury\'s benchmark 30-year bond lost less than an eighth of a point, or less than $1.25 for each $1,000 of face amount. The yield was unchanged at 7.83%. The dollar rose. In late New York trading the U.S. currency was quoted at 1.7368 marks and 143.69 yen compared with 1.7223 marks and 143.60 yen Monday.']","Stock Prices Stabilize, Bonds Ease --- Dollar Posts Gains; Equity Issues Slide Before Recovering",1989-12-19,The Wall Street Journal
31,,1989-12-20 00:00:00,"['NEW YORK -- Concerns about bad real-estate loans continued to depress the debt of some Northeast banks, causing the securities to trade at junk-bond levels. In recent days, the bonds of Bank of Boston and Shawmut National Corp. have been hit so hard that yields have soared to double-digit ranges. The long-term senior securities of Bank of New England, which were downgraded by Moody\'s Investors Service Inc. to ""speculative"" grade on Monday, were offered yesterday at a price to yield about 16%. ""The current pricing reflects considerable uncertainty"" about the ability of the nation\'s regional banks to cope with mounting loan losses, said James McDermott, a banking analyst at Keefe Bruyette & Woods. He said selling pressure on bank debt is likely to continue until analysts comprehend the extent of the real estate problem. New England banks have been suffering from troubled real estate loans for months, but the problems are expected to spread to the mid-Atlantic region and even the Midwest and California. Shawmut National\'s 9.85% subordinated capital notes due in 1999, which traded at par as recently as last week, were quoted yesterday at a price to yield 14%. Midlantic Banks Inc. securities, which had yields of about 10% last week, now are quoted at prices to yield 11 3/4%. Although the mid-sized regional banks are being hurt the hardest, some traders said the weakness has spilled over into the high-quality banking sector as well. In the Treasury market, bond prices ended little changed. Traders said prices were virtually unchanged during the morning, before slipping at midday as it became apparent that the Federal Reserve had not decided to ease credit conditions as some investors had expected. ""There\'s disappointment that there was no movement out of the Fed,"" said Robert Chandross, a vice president at Lloyds Bank PLC. Some investors thought the central bank might wrap up its two-day Federal Open Market Committee meeting yesterday by signaling a monetary policy easing. Thus, when the Fed did not add reserves to the banking system during its normal pre-noon intervention period, bond prices came under selling pressure. But David Jones, a senior vice president and economist at Aubrey G. Lanston & Co., said such expectations were premature. However, he added, ""the Fed will be scrutinized in coming days to see if a decision to ease was made at the meeting."" Uncertainty about the timing of the Fed\'s next policy move took its toll on the Treasury\'s two-year note sale. Investor participation in the note sale was below par, as evidenced by the low 2.31-to-1 bid-to-cover ratio. The ratio, which reflects the number of bids the Treasury receives for each one it accepted, is used to measure investor demand. The average bid-to-cover ratio at the 12 previous two-year note auctions was 2.72-to-1. Another indication of weak demand was the ""tail,"" or the difference between the average yield and highest yield accepted at the auction. The highest yield was 7.73%, slightly above the average yield of 7.71%. Since there wasn\'t enough demand at the average yield, the Treasury was forced to accept some bids at higher yields to complete the auction, thus accounting for the ""tail,"" analysts said. The average yield at the two-year note auction was the lowest for such a sale since March 1988, explaining why individual inventors turned a cold shoulder to the auction. Non-competitive tenders, which come mainly from individual investors, totaled $609 million. That was the lowest noncompetitive bid at a two-year note auction in over a year. In when-issued trading, the new two-year notes traded at a price to yield 7.72%. Junk, Corporate Issues Junk bonds finished the day about 1/8 point lower while investment-grade corporate issues ended 1/8 point to 1/4 point lower. Junk bond traders said they continued to see selling pressure in selective actively traded retail issues. R.H. Macy & Co.\'s 14 1/2% senior subordinated debentures due in 1998 were being bid for at 92, off 1/2 point, while the retailer\'s 14 1/2% subordinated debentures due in 2001 dropped one point to 85 1/2. Macy bonds have been hurt since the company reported a first-quarter loss of $33.1 million last week. Highly volatile junk bonds of RJR Holdings Capital Corp. have also been battered during the market\'s recent downturn. RJR\'s 13.71% convertible pay-in-kind debentures due in 2009 slipped one point to close at 89, while RJR\'s 13.71% exchangeable pay-in-kind debentures due in 2007 slid 3/4 point to finish at 76. Treasury Securities Treasury bond prices were little changed in quiet pre-holiday trading. The benchmark 30-year bond ended at a price of 103 7/32 compared with 103 6/32 on Monday. The issue\'s yield was unchanged at 7.83%. The latest 10-year notes ended at a price of 100 20/32 to yield 7.76% compared with 100 19/32 to yield 7.77%. Short-term rates rose. The discount rate on three-month Treasury bills ended at 7.66% for a bond-equivalent yield of 7.90% compared with an average discount rate of 7.62% and yield of 7.88% at Monday\'s auction. The discount rate on six-month Treasury bills ended at 7.48% for a bond-equivalent yield of 7.86% compared with an average discount rate of 7.43% and bond yield of 7.83% at Monday\'s auction. Here are details of yesterday\'s auction: Rates are determined by the difference between the purchase price and face value.

Government National Mortgage Association\'s 9% securities for January delivery finished at 99 9/32, up 1/32, after changing hands between 99 6/32 and 99 10/32. Ginnie Mae\'s 10% securities ended at 103 11/32, up 1/32, while Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp.\'s 9% issue was unchanged at 98 4/32. Federal National Mortgage Association\'s 9% issue was quoted at 98 22/32, also unchanged. The Fannie Mae 9% issue was trading at an unusually wide premium above the Freddie Mac issue because of a scarcity of the Fannie Mae issue. Dealers noted a modest squeeze in the Fannie Mae 9% issue last week ahead of the regular December settlement. Foreign Bonds Newspaper reports that the Bank of Japan was planning to raise its discount rate at least half a percentage point to 4.25% slammed the Japanese bond market, but it recovered somewhat by the end after the central bank and Finance Ministry denied the stories. At the Tokyo Stock Exchange close, the benchmark 4.8% issue due in 1999 was trading at 95.46, down 0.65 points, for a yield of 5.64%. Elsewhere: -- In West Germany, prices reverted to their fixing levels after rising 0.10 point in early trading. The 7 1/8% issue due 1999 was unchanged at 99.85 to yield 7.13%. -- British government bonds showed modest gains. The benchmark 11 3/4% bond due 2003/2007 rose 10/32 to 111 6/32 to yield 10.19%. Municipal Issues The tax-exempt market was little changed in a session in which more than $561 million in new debt was priced. In one of the largest offerings of the week, a PaineWebber group tentatively priced $288 million Pennsylvania Convention Center Authority revenue bonds to yield from 6.10% in 1993 to 7% in 2005-2008. On the competitive front, a Citicorp Securities Inc. group had the winning bid for $110 million Build Illinois sales tax revenue bonds, due 1990-2010 and 2019. The issue appeared to be off to a strong sales start, with a balance of about $20 million remaining, according to the lead underwriter. The bonds were reoffered to yield from 5.90% in 1991 to 7.04% in 2019. Bonds due in 1990 were not formally reoffered. A PaineWebber group priced an issue of $88 million New York State Dormitory Authority various bonds. Preliminary pricing set yields between 5.70% for special obligation bonds due in 1990 and 6.90% for FHA-insured bonds due in 2000.']",Yields Soar on Debt of Some Northeastern Banks As Worry Spreads Over Bad Real-Estate Loans,1989-12-19,The Wall Street Journal

Tokyo\'s Nikkei index was up 113.77 points to close at 33423.48. The index gained 119.33 points Wednesday. The Tokyo stock price index of all issues listed in the first section was up 11.29 at 2489.31. First section volume was estimated at 550 million shares, down from 666 million Wednesday. In early trading in Tokyo Friday, the Nikkei index rose another 113.76 points to 33537.24. External factors kept large domestic investors out of the market, brokers said on Thursday. Investors are cautious ahead of U.S. employment figures due out Friday and any change in the interest rate outlook resulting from the Federal Open Market Committee meeting in the U.S. Wednesday and Thursday, brokers said. The stronger yen in Tokyo encouraged investors, but brokers said lingering uncertainty about the direction of the currency market dampened the effect of a firmer Japanese unit. The market opened firmer on the stronger yen, and was bolstered by further index-buying by large investors setting up investment trust funds, brokers said. Brokers characterized morning trading as ""rotational"" as investors shifted attention to lagging sectors and issues. Electrical power, textiles and mining issues were among the laggards sought. These issues remained strong into the afternoon. Buying of large-capitalization stocks such as steels and shipbuilding pushed these issues higher in the morning, but they were sold off in the afternoon, brokers said. Nippon Steel was up 9 yen at 819 yen ($5.91), Kawasaki Steel was down 4 at 903, and NKK was flat at 811. Electrical power issues made strong gains. Tokyo Electric Power was up 270 to 5,890, Chubu Electric was up 90 to 4,090, and Kansai Electric was up 170 to 2,540. London prices sagged in the afternoon to end the session slightly lower, pulled down mainly by the negative influence of Wall Street in a thinly traded market. The Financial Times 100-share index closed 1.7 points lower at 2161.2. The 30-share index was down 3.3 points at 1794.7. Volume totaled a respectable 565.3 million shares, but this figure was inflated by a large morning trade of narrowly capitalized third-line stocks. By comparison, turnover Wednesday amounted to a light 347.4 million. Shares moved up from the outset of trading, buoyed by Wall Street\'s rebound Wednesday from its lowest levels. In addition, unconfirmed takeover rumors, particularly in the food manufacturing sector, injected a bit of enthusiasm into an otherwise directionless trading session. The dollar also made its presence felt, following the U.S. currency\'s sharp slide Wednesday. Despite the dollar\'s slight rebound Thursday, the market took a dim view of internationally oriented stocks, most of which declined on the day. The London market again followed Wall Street on Thursday, rising to its best level after the Dow Jones Industrial Average opened higher but dropping back late in the day as the Big Board moved lower. The U.S. is expected to dominate London trading again Friday, as participants await the release of U.S. employment data for June. The data are being closely watched for signals on the interest rate outlook. The major gaining stock was Ranks Hovis McDougall, which rose 24 pence to 481 pence ($7.82). The stock was bolstered in moderate volume by unconfirmed rumors that Sunningdale Holdings, a group connected to British investors Jacob Rothschild and James Goldsmith, was about to make a bid for the U.K. food manufacturer. Sunningdale already holds 29.9% of Ranks Hovis. Other food stocks were pulled higher by the takeover talk. United Biscuits gained 8 to 381, and Cadbury Schweppes moved up 9 to 373. Frankfurt prices closed narrowly lower after a day of hectic, see-saw trading. The DAX index, which was nearly 11 points lower in the early part of the session, closed down 2.06 at 1493.29. Investors took profits on the strong gains made earlier in the week and drove down the market early in the session, traders said, especially after the federal statistics office published an upward revision in West German inflation figures for June. ""One shouldn\'t overestimate this one figure, but it shows that inflation is still a major issue here,"" one broker at a Frankfurt bank said. The Bundesbank raised its discount rate only last week, but many analysts expect another rate increase this year because of the continued inflationary trend. But buying set in at the lower levels, and following a second wave of profit-taking around midday, the market ended near its day-earlier close. Foreign investors appeared to be interested in German shares in hope that a rise in the mark against the dollar will yield foreign-exchange gains, brokers said. At the end of the day, automobile shares had the largest losses amid worries that the lower dollar will cut into the export earnings of the major car makers. Porsche, which exports half of its luxury sports cars to the U.S., tumbled 14.50 marks to 770 ($409), and Bayerische Motoren Werke dropped 7.5 to 554. Volkswagen slid 5 to 422, and Daimler-Benz eased 0.50 mark to 703. Elsewhere, prices closed higher in Brussels, Stockholm, and Paris, lower in Amsterdam and Zurich and mixed in Milan. Stockholm prices closed at a record high in moderate trading on pent-up buying interest in the major shares. Brokers were surprised by the relatively high volume when they had expected a slow market in the summer doldrums. Among Pacific markets, shares closed higher in Hong Kong, Singapore, Sydney and Manila, were lower in Seoul and Taipei, and little changed in Wellington.

The central bank\'s policy-making committee met Wednesday and again yesterday to set credit policy for the coming weeks. But even before that meeting concluded, the bellwether federal funds interest rate began to drop. That suggests Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan may have used his discretionary authority to bring down interest rates slightly in advance of the policy meeting, laying the groundwork for further Fed easing today. ""I think they are clearly leaning in the direction of ease,"" said Steven Wood, a money market economist at Bank of America. ""I would expect definitive signs of a Fed ease to occur"" today after release of the June employment report, said Donald J. Fine, chief market analyst at Chase Manhattan Bank. The most likely result of the Fed\'s move is that the federal funds rate, which is the rate banks charge on loans to each other, will fall to 9 1/4% from its recent level of about 9 1/2%. But the Federal Open Market Committee also may have given Chairman Greenspan authority to drop the rate another quarter percentage point in the coming weeks if there are more signs the economy is weakening. The Fed began easing its credit policy last month, reversing a year-long drive to push short-term interest rates up more than three percentage points to fight inflation. That move came after a spirited battle between Fed governors who favored an easier policy and several district Fed presidents opposed to easing. In recent weeks, more signs of an economic slowdown have begun to appear, apparently convincing Fed officials that further easing was needed. ""There are a lot of signals around that the economy is softening,"" said Scott Pardee, co-chairman of Yamaichi International (America) Inc. and a former Fed official. Citing slow money growth and falling commodity prices, Mr. Pardee said: ""All these suggest an easing would be in line. The economic figures justify it, the monetary figures justify it, and there\'s been some signs of abatement in inflationary pressures."" Expectations of the Fed\'s move are so widespread in the financial markets that it may prove anticlimactic and have only a small effect on interest rates other than the federal funds rate. Several traders said bond prices already reflect an assumption the Fed will cut the funds rate imminently. As of late yesterday afternoon, Treasury bond prices were up about 1/2 point, or $5 for each $1,000 face amount, to yield 8.09%.']",Greenspan May Have Moved to Ease Credit Before This Week's Fed Meeting,1989-07-06,The Wall Street Journal

35,,2002-09-25 00:00:00,"['NEW YORK -- Small-capitalization stocks fell, but managed to weather the storm in the U.S. stock markets because of strength in biotechnology and other technology shares. Still, the small-cap picture isn\'t much brighter than the large-cap one. The Russell 2000 remains at four-year lows, and the Standard & Poor\'s SmallCap 600 index finished just two points above its one-year low. But market trackers are giving small-caps some credit for holding up on a relative basis in an environment plagued by profit disappointments, a sluggish economy, and the threat of war. The Russell 2000 Index ended down 2.10 points, or 0.59%, at 356.58, while the Standard & Poor\'s SmallCap 600 Index dropped 1.11 points, or 0.6%, to 183.79. The Nasdaq Composite Index of both large and small stocks finished down 2.76 points, or 0.23%, at 1182.17. While most of Wall Street wasn\'t surprised with the Federal Open Market Committee\'s decision to leave the federal-funds rate unchanged at 1.75%, there were hopes that the Federal Reserve\'s comments could provide the market with some optimism. Those hopes were dashed, however, after the Fed acknowledged the deepening slump in the labor market, a continuing decline in stock prices, and added more concern about the heightened geopolitical risk\'s effect on expected pickup in production and employment. While the broader market sold off sharply on the comments, small-caps managed to keep losses relatively small. Michael Sheldon, chief market strategist at Spencer Clarke LLC, said action among small caps is more influenced by their valuation compared with large caps, the strength of the dollar, and whether the economy is coming out of a recession. Biotechs were the strongest performers of the session. Lehman Brothers initiated coverage on the sector with a positive stance, saying the sector has dropped 45% this year and may be heading into a period of heavy product launches by the end of this year or the beginning of next year. Credit Suisse First Boston initiated coverage with an overweight rating. Abgenix jumped $1.02, or 18%, to $6.81, and Cell Therapeutics added 52 cents, or 12%, to 4.86. Precious metals rose as the price of gold climbed on the back of the weak equity markets, a soft dollar, and a rally in oil prices, spurring speculative and safe-haven buying of gold. Meridian Gold gained 23 cents, or 1.2%, to 19.73 as TVX Gold climbed 14 cents, or 0.9%, to 14.89. Semiconductors were also among the session\'s top performers on an oversold bounce. The Philadelphia Stock Exchange fell Monday to levels not seen since 1998, spurring some bargain hunters to come back into chips. Skyworks gained 45 cents, or 10%, to 4.94. Asyst Technologies added 21 cents, or 2.8%, to 7.70. But investors weren\'t so kind to diversified technology-services stocks after analysts downgraded Electronic Data Systems and raised questions about its cash flow and weak earnings outlook. The pessimism spread to smaller-cap stocks in the group, even though analysts said much of EDS\'s problems are company-specific. KPMG Consulting dropped 1.12, or 15%, to 6.24. Airlines stocks fell a second consecutive day. Crude-oil prices rose to their highest level in more than a year, and investors remained cautious about the health of the industry and the possibility that UAL\'s United Airlines will file for bankruptcy-law protection. UAL fell 22 cents, or 9.4%, to 2.12, and Atlantic Coast Airlines shed 64 cents, or 6.9%, to 8.69. U.S. Physical Therapy shares hit a 52-week low, making the company one of the top percentage decliners on the Nasdaq Stock Market after warning that third-quarter earnings would be lower than expected because of a slowdown in patient visits. The stock tumbled 3.99, or 27%, to 10.77. Radiologix of Dallas also fell to a 52-week low, after the company cut its 2002 earnings estimate, citing lower procedure volume in July and August and an unexpectedly high level of physician vacations. Radiologix (AMEX) dropped 3.35, or 41%, to 4.85. Shares of small-cap Newport, which makes semiconductor capital equipment, shed 2.34, or 17%, to 11.56 after Credit Suisse First Boston downgraded the stock to underperform from neutral, saying slower-than-expected semiconductor recovery will affect the company\'s growth. Six Flags fell 27 cents, or 6.5%, to 3.90 after Morgan Stanley downgraded the stock to underweight from overweight. While preannouncement season has been pretty dismal so far, a number of companies bucked the trend by raising their financial forecasts. Marvel Enterprises (NYSE) raised its revenue and earnings forecast for the third quarter and full year, primarily because of a ""substantial"" upfront cash payment and minimum revenue guarantees from a 10-year games contract with Vivendi Universal. The stock gained 68 cents, or 11%, to 6.83. Anadigics gained 20 cents, or 10%, to 2.21 after the company said it is on track to meet its previous third-quarter projection for a loss of 33 cents a share before items, on revenue of $21 million, in line with analysts\' views. The company also plans to lay off 10% of its 450 employees.']","Small-Stock Focus: Abgenix, Meridian Gold and Skyworks Post Gains",2002-09-24,The Wall Street Journal
36,,2002-09-25 00:00:00,"['NEW YORK -- Prices of U.S. Treasury securities settled moderately higher yesterday, with sentiment for government debt buoyed by signs that the door to further rate cuts by the Federal Reserve has opened a little wider. At 4 p.m., the benchmark 10-year note was up 15/32 point, or $4.6875 per $1,000 face value, at 106 1/32. Its yield fell to 3.64% from 3.69% late Monday, as yields move inversely to prices. The 30-year bond\'s price was up 29/32 point at 111 22/32 to yield 4.63%, down from 4.68% on Monday. The trading session focused on the monetary policy meeting of the Fed\'s Federal Open Market Committee. As expected, the FOMC left its target short-term rate unchanged at 1.75% and maintained that risks are still tilted in favor of further economic weakness. However, two members of the FOMC, Federal Reserve Governor Edward Gramlich and Dallas President Robert McTeer, dissented from the decision and sought a rate cut, and the policy statement flagged geopolitical risks. It was the first dissent by a Fed governor since 1995. The news helped to send stocks lower. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 189.02 to 7683.13. Buying in Treasurys was concentrated in the 10-year note, pushing its yield briefly below 3.60%, a level not seen since 1958. Vinnie Verterano, a trader at Nomura Securities International Inc., said heavy buying in the form of short covering was seen from dealers immediately after the Fed\'s announcement, but no retail activity. Mr. Verterano said the market rallied because ""two people wanted to ease"" and a sign emerged that a rate cut is imminent if the economy shows further weakness. Although the market subsequently pulled back from its highs, the move was attributed to profit taking and traders said renewed weakness in stocks and expectations of a rate cut would sustain the overall bid tone for government debt. ""The Fed is keeping the door open to an easing, but they are reluctant to cut rates as long as equities remain unstable,"" said William Strazzullo, market strategist at State Street in Boston. However, the current climate of poor economic data, weakening corporate earnings and geopolitical concerns are likely to force the Fed\'s hand in the coming months, he said. ""They will be dragged to an ease when the market has already priced in such a move,"" he said. Some fixed-income analysts saw the two dissents as a sign that the FOMC itself is heading back toward another round of rate cuts in the months ahead. The dissents are likely to spark a new debate about a renewed rate-cutting campaign by the Fed, said Dominic Konstam, head of interest-rate strategy at Credit Suisse First Boston in New York. ""The point now is no longer if, but when the Fed will cut rates,"" said Mr. Konstam. ""We now expect that when the Fed starts to ease, it will likely be a cycle of several rate cuts."" Mr. Konstam expects to see the two-year Treasury note -- widely seen as a barometer of Fed expectations -- trade below the current 1.75% Fed-funds rate as those expectations get priced into the market. John Ryding, chief market economist at Bear Stearns, said the two dissenting FOMC votes were surprising. However, ""do I think the Fed will be more likely to cut by the end of the year,"" given the two dissents at the FOMC meeting? ""No,"" he said. That will largely rely on the next two unemployment reports, he added.  Agency Securities Fannie Mae\'s repurchase of $846 million in debt securities yesterday will help a bit to correct a large mismatch between its assets and liabilities, but market professionals say it\'s only a drop in the bucket compared with what needs to be done if interest rates don\'t rise. The buyback is Fannie\'s first since June, representing the longest lag between Fannie Mae debt repurchases since the government-sponsored enterprise implemented the program in March 2001. After announcing plans earlier yesterday to buy as much as $1 billion in longer-term debt, Fannie Mae accepted offers totaling $846 million in notes with maturities between 2009 and 2012. Corporate Bonds Consumer-products manufacturer Gillette Co. sold $500 million of five-year notes at a spread of 0.85 percentage point above comparable Treasury securities. The issue was increased in size from an originally planned $300 million. The lead manager was Lehman Brothers. Meanwhile, postage-meter company Pitney Bowes Inc. sold $400 million of 10-year notes at a spread of 1.02 percentage points above comparable Treasurys. The joint lead managers were Deutsche Bank Securities and J.P. Morgan. The issue had been boosted in size from $350 million. Neither Gillette nor Pitney Bowes is a significant issuer of debt, and, as a result, their issues have scarcity value in the eyes of some investors. Meanwhile, El Paso Corp. faces the prospect of downgrades to its investment-grade credit ratings following a judge\'s recommendation on Monday that the company pay penalties for withholding natural-gas capacity during California\'s energy crisis. Moody\'s Investors Service and Standard & Poor\'s put El Paso\'s debt on review, citing concerns about the ruling and declining cash flow at the Houston-based natural-gas producer and pipeline company. --- Tyler Lifton, Julie Haviv and Michael C.

37,,2002-12-11 00:00:00,"['NEW YORK -- Treasurys ended mixed as investors shifted from shorter maturities to 30-year bonds after Federal Reserve policy makers left the target for the overnight borrowing rate unchanged at a 41-year low. Although the Fed\'s action was in line with market expectations, the statement in which it announced the decision didn\'t highlight the economy\'s weakness as much as many had expected, traders and analysts said. At 4 p.m., the benchmark 10-year note was down 4/32 point, or $1.25 per $1,000 face value, at 99 17/32. Its yield rose to 4.058% from 4.042% Monday, as yields move inversely to prices. The 30-year bond\'s price was up 14/32 point at 107 to yield 4.912%, down from 4.940% Monday. Fed policy makers voted unanimously to leave the federal-funds, or overnight lending, rate target at 1.25%. They also left the largely symbolic discount rate unchanged at 0.75%. In a statement, the Fed said the risk of a renewed downturn remains ""balanced"" with the risk of inflation. That was interpreted by people in the market as suggesting no need for additional rate cuts by the Fed. ""The committee continues to believe that this accommodative stance of monetary policy, coupled with still-robust underlying growth in productivity, is providing important ongoing support to economic activity,"" the policy setting Federal Open Market Committee said. ""People were expecting a more accommodative comment from [policy makers] in terms of focusing on the weak economy,"" said Paul Calvetti, head of Treasury trading at Deutsche Bank in New York. ""But they seemed to signal that the current level of rates is enough to get through the soft patches."" But some in the market said there was very little new information in the Fed\'s statement in terms of whether it is done easing. Merrill Lynch fixed-income strategist Jim Caron said there is still a risk the Fed will ease one more time next year if the economy doesn\'t pick up. Michael Cheah, portfolio manager at SunAmerica Asset Management in Jersey City, N.J., said the Fed had missed an opportunity to assure markets that it isn\'t in a hurry to raise rates, given current high labor productivity. The Fed announcement sparked some light selling in Treasurys -- centered on shorter maturities -- while the 30-year bond\'s price gained some. As long-term yields dropped in relation to short-term yields, the margin between short- and long-term rates narrowed. That trend may continue, with more people shifting out along the maturity spectrum to 30-year bonds, some said. Despite talk of hefty fiscal stimulus, which had been pressuring long-term yields higher, tax cuts are a longer-term prospect, said David Ging, fixed-income strategist at Credit Suisse First Boston. Meanwhile, the fact that Fed policy is expected to stay on hold immediately influences where investors are looking to place money, he noted. Anthony Crescenzi, market strategist at Miller Tabak & Co. in New York, said the Fed seemed to be agreeing with sentiment in the markets this fall. ""The two-month rally in equities, the fall in Treasurys, the narrowing of credit spreads and the rise in commodity prices are predicated in part on the notion that the economy is emerging from the slowdown that began in the summer,"" he said. Economic data yesterday had little effect on trading. Wholesale inventories fell 0.3% in October after a revised 0.4% gain in September. Private economists had forecast a rise of 0.3% for October. Separately, the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond\'s index of manufacturing shipments fell to minus-one for November from positive-six in October.  Corporate and Junk Bonds Five of the investment companies in an unofficial group seeking to block Qwest Communications International\'s nearly $13 billion debt exchange offer were identified in court documents filed this week. They are Elliott Associated LP, Franklin Mutual Advisers LLC, Metropolitan Life Insurance, Metropolitan West Asset Management LLC and MFC Global Investment Management, according to an amended complaint filed with the court. The five represent about $773 million of the notes subject to the exchange offer, which would enable Qwest to reorganize about half of its debt without filing for bankruptcy. The group, whose members hold about $3 billion of the bonds subject to the exchange, allege in the complaint that the swap offer and its documents violate securities law and breach the company\'s fiduciary duties to bondholders. ""Other members of the committee for a variety of reasons are not in a position to publicly identify themselves as plaintiffs and have a federal and constitutional right to remain anonymous and to proceed with this litigation as a committee,"" the amended complaint said. ""Defendants have demanded public disclosure of the names solely to harass members of the committee and to interfere with their right to protect themselves from the defendants\' illegal exchange offer and other violations of law and breaches of fiduciary duty."" Qwest spokesman Steve Hammack said: ""We believe we have the right to know the names of the parties who are suing us and we intend to abide by any guidelines the courts put forth with regard to discovery."" Qwest has said it intends to file a motion to dismiss the complaint and believes claims in the complaint ""are without merit.""

38,,2003-03-19 00:00:00,"['Though Vanguard Group continues to warn against piling into bond mutual funds, investors seemingly won\'t be deterred. For more than six months, the second-largest fund group in terms of assets -- after Fidelity Investments -- has repeatedly warned investors not to pile into fixed-income funds. Vanguard\'s worry: Many investors looking for safety and higher returns might falsely assume bonds are riskless investments, not realizing that even a modest increase in interest rates would take a serious bite out of fixed-income values. Safety-seeking fund shareholders have kept throwing money at the firm\'s bond portfolios, anyway. Bonds historically have lower returns than stocks, but bond portfolios have trounced stock funds for three consecutive years, largely thanks to several years of cuts that have dropped interest rates to near historic lows. At their regularly scheduled meeting yesterday, Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan and his Federal Open Market Committee colleagues decided to keep short-term interest rates at their ultralow levels. But it will be painful for bond investors whenever the Fed eventually does reverse field and begins to boost rates. As bond prices and interest rates move in opposite directions, such moves will depress prices of bonds sitting in fund portfolios. A bond-risk primer posted on Vanguard\'s Web site in October warned that the value of a long-term bond fund might fall 20% if rates went up just two percentage points. Earlier, the firm cautioned investors about bond-fund risks in an August article titled ""Irrational Exuberance in the Bond Market."" More recently, Vanguard Chairman and Chief Executive John J. Brennan noted in a January market commentary that interest rates are likely to rise this year. Ian MacKinnon, head of Vanguard Fixed Income Group, chimed in, too, warning that rising rates would hurt current bond values during an October news conference in New York. Bonds might not cool on his watch, though; Vanguard announced yesterday that Mr. MacKinnon will retire June 30 after 21 years with the firm. Mr. MacKinnon will be succeeded by fellow Vanguard veteran Robert A. Auwaerter. In addition, George U. Sauter, leader of Vanguard\'s quantitative equity group and manager of the $65.7 billion Vanguard 500 Index Fund, was given added duties, becoming the firm\'s chief investment officer, a new position. Despite its persistent warnings, Vanguard\'s bond offerings netted more than $23.7 billion last year, compared with $14.3 billion for its stock funds, according to fund consultants Financial Research Corp. The $28.9 billion Vanguard GNMA Fund, for example, netted a combined $11.3 billion in 2001 and 2002, according to FRC. The fund has averaged a 9% annual gain over the past three years, compared with a 15% annual loss for the Standard &Poor\'s 500-stock index, according to researcher Morningstar Inc. Meanwhile, the Vanguard Inflation-Protected Securities Fund, which was launched at the end of June 2000, has already $3.5 billion in assets, nearly three times the size of the average taxable bond fund. The fund returned 16.6% last year. Vanguard, however, isn\'t changing its tune on the risks connected with bond portfolios. ""We\'re feeling that it\'s not the time to encourage investors to make major commitments to bond funds,"" says Vanguard spokesman Brian Mattes. ""We never want people to invest based on past performance that is unlikely to be repeated."" Vanguard watchers note the fund group, based in Malvern, Pa., could do more to discourage investors from putting more money into bond funds if it chose. ""I give them credit for warning people,"" says Dan Wiener, editor of the Independent Adviser for Vanguard Investors, adding that they could shutter the funds to new investors. ""If their convictions were strongly held, they do have a way to deal with it. [But] what they don\'t want to do is send people packing to Fidelity."" Vanguard\'s Mr. Mattes says the firm has no current plans to close any of the bond funds. The firm is used to seeing its admonitions largely falling on deaf ears. Vanguard warned investors that stock gains seemed overheated in a shareholder newsletter at the end of 1999.

Yet the dollar may suffer bouts of weakness in the weeks ahead amid the vicissitudes of war, analysts warned. ""The market is pricing in right now a slam-dunk victory,"" for U.S.-led forces in Iraq, said Andrew Weiss, a strategist with AIG Trading Group in Stamford, Conn. ""But I think there could be plenty of hairy moments ahead that could easily take the steam out of the current dollar rally."" Mounting tension ahead of the expected outbreak of hostilities have swept aside -- for now -- economic factors as a key catalyst for the dollar, although a Federal Reserve policy-setting statement that unusually refrained from offering guidance on the economic outlook could later haunt the U.S. currency, some said. The dollar appeared to take in stride a report showing U.S. housing starts declined by 11% last month to the lowest level since last April. For now, the dollar ""is being driven by the shadow of military activity . . . much more than by the data,"" said Lara Rhame, senior economist with Brown Brothers Harriman in New York. Late yesterday in New York, the dollar was trading at 118.84 yen, up from 118.46 yen late Monday. The euro was at $1.0635, down from $1.0637 late Monday, but well above its next important support level, around $1.0550. Against the Swiss franc, the dollar was at 1.3833 francs, up from 1.3797 francs late Monday. The pound was at $1.5665, down from $1.5710. Sterling\'s retreat came on the heels of the resignation of three of British Prime Minister Tony Blair\'s ministers this week in protest over British involvement in military action against Iraq. ""You\'re starting to see some early signs of political risk premiums coming into sterling,"" said Paresh Upadhyaya, a currency strategist with Putnam Investments in Boston. ""While Blair\'s stature is intact at the moment, his position seems a bit more tenuous.""

40,,2003-03-19 00:00:00,"['WASHINGTON -- The Federal Reserve left interest rates unchanged, but, in an unusual move, declined to give any hint of what it was likely to do next -- a sign of how the conflict with Iraq has muddied the outlook. The Federal Open Market Committee left its target for the federal-funds rate at 1.25%; the rate is charged on overnight loans between banks. But the Fed didn\'t give its usual assessment of whether future risks to the economy were tilted toward inflation, economic weakness, or were balanced between the two. Instead, it said it couldn\'t ""usefully characterize the current balance of risks"" until geopolitical uncertainties lifted. A new Wall Street Journal/NBC poll taken after President Bush\'s speech to the nation on Monday night showed the American public equally uncertain about war\'s economic effects. A 44% plurality said military action in Iraq would have a negative effect on the economy, while 40% said it would have a positive effect. The remaining 16% envisioned no effect or weren\'t sure. The Fed\'s unusual decision reflected the huge role that central-bank officials believe war with Iraq will play in determining how the economy performs. The Fed said in a statement accompanying its decision that economic data have been ""mixed"" and jobs data ""disappointing."" But it stuck to the view it has held since September that it was the Iraq situation that is holding back the economy. ""The hesitancy of the economic expansion appears to owe importantly to oil-price premiums and other aspects of geopolitical uncertainties,"" the Fed said. ""As those uncertainties lift . . . the accommodative stance of monetary policy, coupled with ongoing growth in productivity, will . . . engender an improving economic climate over time."" Last month, Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan told Congress that only after uncertainties related to Iraq lifted would the central bank know if something else was holding back growth, requiring more interest-rate cuts. With war likely at any time, Fed officials apparently decided they could wait a bit longer for an answer. If the war goes badly, stocks plummet, oil prices soar, or a wave of terrorist attacks strike the U.S., the Fed could cut rates immediately. It said that ""in the current circumstances, heightened surveillance is particularly informative."" Still, markets lowered the odds of a rate cut on or before the Fed\'s next meeting on May 6. Economists had expected the Fed to shift the balance of risks toward weakness from neutral, and some expected a quarter-percentage-point rate cut. Many also had expected the Fed to say it would ""closely monitor"" economic developments, words that foreshadowed rate cuts it made between its regularly scheduled meetings in January and April of 2001. The Fed, in effect, signaled its readiness to cut rates without cementing such an expectation. Indeed, officials are far less certain than they were in 2001 that their next move is to lower rates. When the fed-funds rate was cut to 1.25% from 1.75% last November, Mr. Greenspan described it as insurance against the ""quite small"" possibility that the economy was poised for ""significant decline."" Tom Gallagher, policy analyst at investment research firm ISI Group, said the Fed\'s willingness to cut now is much more conditional on events, such as the outcome of war with Iraq. There was also speculation that the omission of the balance of risks reflected disagreement among Fed officials about how weak the economy is and the urgency of rate cuts. Indeed, some Fed officials disagree with Mr. Greenspan that war worries are behind the economy\'s woes; they suspect something else, perhaps the burst stock bubble and excess investment of the 1990s. If the war goes well and the economy still doesn\'t show the expected rebound, officials will be ready to cut rates, and probably by a half percentage point. ""I think there was some disagreement"" on where the risks are, said Deutsche Bank chief U.S. economist Peter Hooper, and the Fed came up with ""an innovative response to a sticky problem."" Indeed, the Fed\'s 12 voting policy makers were unanimous in their decision. But omitting the bias was also a recognition of reality. Ordinarily, policy makers have a forecast and can quantify where and what the risks to that forecast are. With so much riding on the unknown outcome of the war, however, officials evidently didn\'t feel confident about any forecast or the risks to it. --- Journal Link: See the full text of the Federal Reserve\'s statement, in the Online Journal at WSJ.com/JournalLinks.

41,,1989-05-17 00:00:00,"['NEW YORK -- Both the stock and dollar rallies fizzled while bond prices marked time ahead of more inflation data. The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 10.44 points to 2453.45 in moderate trading, ending a three-day rise of more than 97 points. Intervention by the Federal Reserve helped lower the dollar from its 29-month high. Long-term bond prices were up modestly. Traders said they had expected a temporary halt to the stock market\'s feverish rally as some investors took profits. But they pointed out that the decline was held in check by continued buying interest from other investors fearful of missing any further gains. ""People are beginning to look at the market more positively,"" said Harold MacKinney, head of the investment policy committee at Fleet National Bank in Providence, R.I. ""Their cash hoards are making them nervous, and they\'ve been looking for something to buy."" Investors bid bond prices higher despite concern about what the consumer price index will disclose about inflation tomorrow. The average estimate calls for consumer prices in April to have risen about 0.6%, or an annual rate of more than 7.2%. But bond traders hope that the surprisingly low 0.4% increase in wholesale prices in April may set the stage for more modest consumer price increases, too. Bond traders looking for signs the Federal Reserve is easing were disappointed yesterday. Although the Federal Open Market Committee, the Fed\'s policy-making arm, met to set short-term monetary goals, government officials said it is still too early to begin easing interest rates. Most analysts expect the Fed to wait for more evidence the economy is slowing before making any policy change. But the Fed was active in the foreign exchange markets, selling dollars for West German marks and Japanese yen in an effort to drive the dollar down from its recent highs. Traders said the dollar was already weakening before the intervention pushed it lower. The early weakness was attributed to traders reducing their dollar holdings before this morning\'s report on the nation\'s merchandise trade balance in March. The average estimate calls for the trade deficit in March to total about $10.2 billion, down slightly from the $10.5 billion deficit in February. In major market activity yesterday: Stock prices fell. Volume on the New York Stock Exchange totaled 173.1 million shares. Declining issues on the Big Board were ahead of gainers, 791 to 678. Bond prices gained slightly. The Treasury\'s benchmark 30-year bond rose a little more than a quarter of a point, or more than $2.50 for each $1,000 face amount. The yield on the issue was 8.82%. The dollar weakened against most currencies. In late New York trading the dollar was quoted at 1.9368 marks and 136.78 yen, compared with 1.9385 marks and 137.15 yen.']",Rallies Fade For Stocks And Dollar --- Bond Prices Edge Up; Fear of Missing Out Checks Equities' Fall,1989-05-16,The Wall Street Journal
42,,1997-08-20 00:00:00,"['WASHINGTON -- The Federal Reserve left its key short-term interest rate unchanged, amid further evidence that economic growth is moderating and prices are being held down. Yesterday\'s gathering of the Federal Open Market Committee was the third straight time that the policy makers opted not to raise rates, following a quarter-point increase in late March. And while some economists continue to argue that economic conditions -- tight labor markets and signs of greater consumer spending -- could force another rate increase this year, many analysts now believe that the central bank may stay on hold for a time. ""This is a case where the physician, having done the physical exam, finds perfect health and therefore has no need to prescribe any change in medication, diet or exercise,"" said Neil M. Soss, chief U.S. economist for Credit Suisse First Boston Corp. ""You\'ve got growth, you\'re providing jobs, there\'s low inflation -- what more could you ask?"" A string of recent data affirming that perspective has been released in recent weeks, and still more came out yesterday morning. The Commerce Department said housing starts were flat in July, keeping pace with June\'s high level but showing no signs of accelerating. Separately, the Labor Department said prices for imports fell 0.2% last month, after staying flat for two months. Low import prices -- because of the strong dollar and falling energy prices -- have been a big factor in keeping inflation low. Although the Fed decision was long anticipated by analysts, the stock market rose sharply yesterday, seeming to shake off, for now at least, the inflation fears that have dragged down prices in recent days. The Dow Jones Industrial Average ended the day at 7918.10, up 114.74. Following tradition, a Fed spokesman said only that the policy makers met yesterday and had ""no further announcement,"" and Fed officials would give no explanation for their decision. The inaction means that the Fed\'s target for the federal funds rate -- the rate at which banks lend to each other overnight -- remains at 5.5%. The main question likely shaping Fed policy in the coming months is whether economic growth remains around the moderate pace of the second quarter or accelerates again to the rapid levels reached at the end of last year and the beginning of this year. Clear evidence of a pickup, most economists believe, would likely lead to inflationary pressures and force the central bank to raise rates. ""They will have to implement some further monetary restraint to rein in excessively strong demand,"" said Brian M. Jones, an economist at Salomon Brothers Inc. ""We think there will be 3% to 4% growth for the rest of the year, and that renewed acceleration of demand will hit an economy that has little slack."" But others say that, while consumer spending is increasing, companies are likely to cut back inventory spending sharply in the coming months, moderating growth. Besides, ""there are no signs of inflationary pressures"" despite the high growth rates registered earlier this year, said Mickey Levy of NationsBanc Capital Markets Inc. ""Looking forward, I see no need for the Fed to do anything through the first half of 1998."" The Fed\'s open market committee has three more meetings scheduled for this year, the next on Sept. 30. The housing sector ""is almost like the economy,"" said David Seiders, chief economist for the National Association of Home Builders. ""We feel like we\'re moving pretty much sideways at the maximum sustainable pace."" The July and June rate of new home building -- a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1,447,000 units -- marked a rebound from a May dip, but remained a bit below the pace set between February and April. Housing starts in July dipped from June in every region except for the Northeast, where business jumped 41% from the previous month. Excluding oil, import prices declined 0.1%, mainly because of a fall in computer prices. Oil prices fell 0.7%. These figures aren\'t seasonally adjusted. Export prices fell 2.3%, dragged down by a 19% plunge in agricultural exports. Nonagriculture export prices rose 0.1%.

43,,1997-07-03 00:00:00,"['WASHINGTON -- The Federal Reserve left its key short-term interest rate unchanged, confirming that its fears of imminent inflation have subsided. But economists are divided over whether the central bank will still have to tighten monetary policy in the coming months to damp growth. Yesterday\'s meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee was the second consecutive time that Fed officials chose to leave monetary policy alone after pushing through a controversial quarter-point increase in the federal-funds rate in March. The Fed\'s target for the federal-funds rate, or the rate at which banks lend to each other overnight, remains at 5 1/2%. Although the inaction was widely anticipated, the stock market rallied after the decision was disclosed. The Dow Jones Industrial Average, down nearly 20 points just before the 2:15 p.m. announcement, ended the day up 73.05 points to close at 7795.38. The benchmark 30-year Treasury bond gained 12/32, or about $3.75 for a $1,000 bond, to close at 98 27/32. The yield fell to 6.71% from 6.73%. The Fed\'s decision to keep interest rates at current levels stems from two recent economic developments. First, numerous signs indicate that economic growth in the second quarter slowed from the red-hot 5.9% pace of the first period. Just yesterday, for example, the Commerce Department reported that factory orders fell 0.7% in May, reversing a 1.4% jump in April. The second trend giving comfort to the Fed has been inflation\'s moderation, despite strong growth earlier in the year and an unemployment rate below 5% -- a level most mainstream economists consider likely to trigger higher wages and prices. The main questions facing policy makers as they look ahead is how long that environment can last. In his last public comments on the economy, Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan made clear in an early May speech that he felt there was ""little slack in our capacity to produce,"" and any hints of strain on the economy\'s capacity would push him into a more aggressive anti-inflation stance. A raft of data to be released before the Fed next revisits monetary policy on Aug. 19 will help show whether the economy continues to wind down to a level Mr. Greenspan is more comfortable with, or whether it is once again skirting close to what he perceives as the edge. Today, the government gives its first detailed look at the June economy with its monthly labormarket report. A sharp increase in job growth or another drop in the unemployment rate -- now at a quarter-century low -- would likely fuel speculation that the Fed will have to lift rates next month or in September. In a recent survey of Fed watchers by Macroeconomic Advisers LLC, 11 of the 18 participating economists said they expected the Fed to raise rates again sometime during the summer. ""We\'re going to see a good rebound in personal consumption in the third quarter,"" said Chris Varvares, an economist with the St. Louis forecasting firm. ""While it\'s clear the economy has slowed from the first-quarter pace, it\'s still growing at trend or slightly above trend,"" he added. ""There\'s a very good case to be made that more tightening is in order."" Others say that growth is likely to slow enough to prevent overheating. ""I don\'t think there\'s significant pent-up demand for household durables left, and there are signs that capital-goods orders have slowed,"" said Richard D. Rippe, an economist at Prudential Securities Inc. While he doesn\'t think another rate increase is needed, he added that ""it\'s still possible because the Fed has to ask what sort of risk it wants to take."" Some analysts argue that, even if rapid growth resumes, the basic workings of the American economy have changed enough so that conditions that might have sparked inflation in the past are no longer worrisome. Mr. Greenspan himself, despite his constant public warnings of looming inflationary dangers, leans toward this camp. His decision to push up interest rates just once in more than two years shows a greater experimental flexibility than prior Fed leaders would have accepted. ""The economy is now capable of sustaining higher growth rates without higher inflation,"" said William T. Wilson, an economist with Comerica Inc. in Detroit. ""Nobody in manufacturing, nobody in the service industries has any power to raise prices,"" he added. ""Pricing power has reached an all-time low."" The Fed, as is its custom, didn\'t explain the rationale behind yesterday\'s decision. Mr. Greenspan is scheduled to give a public update of his thinking on July 22, when he gives his semiannual economic outlook to Congress. The drop in May factory orders was accentuated by a surprisingly big 0.7% drop in orders for nondurable goods, like food and paper, after a 0.8% rise in April. Orders for durable goods -- products designed to last several years, such as cars and computers -- also fell by 0.7% in May, following a 1.8% jump in April. Earlier, the Commerce Department had estimated durable-goods orders had fallen by 0.6% in May. Unfilled orders were flat in May, indicating that backlogs -- a sign of potentially inflationary bottlenecks -- aren\'t growing. All figures in the report are adjusted for seasonal factors, but not for inflation.  Here are the Commerce Department\'s latest figures for manufacturers in billions of dollars, seasonally adjusted.

The Fed also raised the less-important discount rate, charged on central-bank loans to commercial banks, to 3.5% from 3.25%. Many commercial banks responded by raising their prime rate, a benchmark for many consumer and business loans, to 5.5% from 5.25%. The Fed\'s message yesterday, nearly matching its statements since November, reflects two things. One is that economic growth and inflation have behaved as expected recently. While some Fed officials were alarmed at signs of inflation in December, those fears may have been allayed as the dollar has stopped falling, commodity prices stopped rising, and anecdotal reports of businesses raising prices became less widespread. The second is the importance the Fed has put on being predictable. It has told markets it would raise rates at a ""measured"" pace. As a result, investors expect the funds rate to rise to 2.75% at the Fed\'s March 22 meeting, 3% on May 3 and to about 3.5% by year\'s end. As long as the Fed is satisfied with those expectations, it may be reluctant to change its message unless compelled to by significant shifts in the economy. Economist David Greenlaw of Morgan Stanley said in a note to clients that concerns about inflation and speculative activity are probably growing at the Fed, but ""are not yet sizable enough to alter the gradual tightening approach."" Like other analysts, he said it\'s up to Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan to elaborate on these issues when he testifies before Congress on Feb. 16 and 17. Despite the unchanged Fed statements, some important shifts are under way in how the Fed views the world, though it isn\'t clear how these moves, taken together, will affect interest rates. First, the economic expansion is clearly firmly entrenched, and in as little as a year from now, it may have used up the spare capacity left over from the 2001 recession. In an economy operating at full strength, companies will find it easier to raise prices. That prospect would keep the Fed focused on raising rates. Second, growth in productivity, or output per hour worked, has slowed. That means companies must add more workers than before to boost sales, and may try to pass the added labor cost on through higher prices. Goldman Sachs Group Inc. economist Bill Dudley wrote in a recent report that while such a slowing is normal at this stage of the business cycle, it nonetheless ""would likely lead Fed officials to push up the federal-funds rate target by more than expected."" But against those factors, interest rates are no longer abnormally low. At 2.5%, the funds rate is above inflation of 1.5%, according to the Fed\'s preferred measure (though below the 3.3% rate recorded by the better-known consumer-price index). It\'s also higher than the official rate of many foreign central banks. ""At some point the FOMC will need to alter [its] language to say that policy has become less accommodative or no longer accommodative,"" said David Rosenberg, Merrill Lynch &Co.\'s chief North American economist, in a report yesterday.

45,,2005-02-03 00:00:00,"['NEW YORK -- The Federal Reserve\'s interest-rate increase gave the Treasury market the green light to pursue its favorite activity: flattening the yield curve. This trade favors longer-dated Treasurys such as the 10-year note and the 30-year bond over shorter-dated peers, which are more vulnerable to tighter monetary policy. The Fed\'s quarter-point increase in the federal-funds target rate sent shorter-dated Treasurys lower by the end of active trade, but investor preference for longer-dated securities pushed the 30-year bond into positive territory. Yield on the long bond exited active trade at 4.581%, its lowest closing level since July 2, 2003. Yields move inversely to prices. The similar wording of the statement accompanying the Federal Open Market Committee\'s decision to increase its federal-funds target to 2.5% enhances the popularity of the curve-flattener trade that has ruled Treasurys for months. Not only did the FOMC retain the ""measured pace"" language used to convey its intention to raise rates gradually, but the February statement was nearly identical to the one released at its last meeting in December. For traders, that meant the long end of the market still is the safest place to park funds. Longer-dated securities are more sensitive to the corrosive effects of inflation. At 4 p.m., the benchmark 10-year note was down 2/32, or $0.625 for each $1,000 invested, at 100 27/32. Its yield stood at 4.145% from 4.140% Tuesday. The 30-year bond\'s price was up 9/32 point at 112. After the Fed announcement, some banks, including J.P. Morgan Chase, Bank of America and Wachovia, raised prime lending rates, the base rates for many corporate and consumer loans, to 5.5% from 5.25%. Although many market participants had expected the Fed to stick with its measured outlook on rates, some feared the minutes from the December meeting released last month pointed to an emerging hawkish tone from the central bankers. ""The FOMC statement was more benign than some investors feared,"" said Michael Cheah, portfolio manager at AIG Sun America Asset Management in Jersey City, N.J. Glenn Haberbush, economist at Mizuho Securities in Hoboken, N.J., said additional quarter-point increases ""are to be expected at the March 22 and May 3 FOMC meetings."" With the FOMC meeting over, investors now turn to the other two big events on the calendar: the monthly employment report scheduled for release tomorrow and the bulge of new supply coming down the pipeline next week. A tally of 200,000 new jobs is forecast for January. The average monthly payroll increase for the past 12 months has been 186,000, solid but not enough to push long-dated Treasury yields sharply higher. The Treasury Department announced earlier yesterday it will sell $51 billion of new securities in its quarterly refunding next week to refund $11.44 billion in maturing issues and raise $39.56 billion. The refunding will comprise $22 billion three-year notes maturing Feb. 15, 2008, to be sold Feb. 8; $15 billion of five-year notes maturing Feb. 15, 2010, to be sold Feb. 9; and $14 billion of 10-year bonds maturing Feb. 15, 2015, to be sold Feb. 10.

In late trading, the euro was at $1.3035, from $1.3046 late Tuesday. The euro, which rose to $1.3090 overnight, has been in the $1.2920-$1.3130 range since Jan. 20.

48,,2005-03-23 00:00:00,"['NEW YORK -- The Federal Reserve\'s admission for the first time in years of concern about inflation has solidified a truism in the Treasury market: Higher yields are here to stay. The Federal Reserve raised its key interest rate to 2.75%, and stuck to its intention to keep lifting the rate in ""measured"" increments as the economic recovery gains strength. But Treasury yields, which move inversely to prices, shot higher, spooked by the central bank\'s worry that ""though longer-term inflation expectations remain well contained, pressures on inflation have picked up in recent months and pricing power is more evident."" The statement marked the first formal admission of concern from the Fed about inflation and appears to contrast with remarks from a host of central-bank officials of late. The government bond market\'s reaction was to push prices down and yields higher, with the benchmark 10-year yield breaking above 4.60% for the first time since July 2004, as the market braced for the possibility of the Fed raising rates more aggressively than had been expected. The 10-year yield is now above where it was before the Fed started raising rates last June. The inflation concerns in the statement ""are getting us ready for a change in the risk assessment,"" said Gerald Lucas, head of agency and Treasury strategy at Banc of America Securities. At 4 p.m. yesterday, the benchmark 10-year note was down 25/32 at 95 2/32. Its yield rose to 4.627% from 4.525% Monday. The 30-year bond was down 1 4/32 point at 106 29/32 to yield 4.901% from 4.828% Monday. The warning about inflation didn\'t encourage everyone to sell Treasurys: California-based bond-fund behemoth Pimco picked up $500 million of 10-year Treasurys, managing director Bill Gross told Dow Jones Newswires in an interview. Although the purchase represents only 0.1% of the total $450 billion of assets under management at Pimco, Mr. Gross said ""it still reflects an attitude that things are better than they were."" Pimco has been an opportunistic buyer and seller of Treasurys since last year, using a broad range between 4.0% to 5.0% on the 10-year yield to locate where valuations look more or less attractive. Mr. Gross said he estimates fair value for the 10-year note is around 5.50%, but he says ongoing buying by foreign central banks will prevent the benchmark yield from reaching that mark. In fact, he said investors should brace for a tamer bear market than past experience has taught them as a result of official purchases from Japan and China as well as a Federal Reserve that has kept interest rates accommodative, despite the 1.75 percentage point cumulative rate hikes. Mr. Gross said the influence of the Fed and the Asian central banks on prices cannot be ignored. ""I wish they [Asian central banks] were out of the game and I wish the Fed were back to its standard practice in terms of higher real short term interest rates,"" he said, referring to the fact that inflation-adjusted interest rates remain historically low. The Fed\'s rate hike comes into a bond market that\'s arguably much more reflective of the Fed\'s tightening cycle than at the last policy-setting meeting at the beginning of February. Back then, the 10-year note was yielding around 4.11%; it went as low as 3.98% on Feb. 10. Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan famously dubbed the resistance of long-term yields to the pull of gravity of the Fed\'s rate hike cycle a ""conundrum,"" during Congressional testimony last month. He subsequently explained that it was ""utterly unprecedented"" for long-term interest rates to go down when the Fed was pushing short-term rates higher. The bond market paid attention, and since Mr. Greenspan mentioned his concerns, has pushed the yield on the 10-year note up over 0.6 percentage point. The Federal Open Market Committee\'s statement will likely prompt investors to push yields even higher, arguably rendering returns in the bond market more attractive for money managers who have shunned government bonds for over a year. ""I think there\'s very little doubt Greenspan intends to wake up the bond market,"" said Alan Blinder, a former Fed vice chairman who now teaches economics at Princeton University. The central bank\'s latest statement, Blinder said, ""took a big whack out of the `conundrum.\'"" ""The Fed has launched a wonderfully targeted torpedo at the bond market"" and by extension the housing sector ""in order to resolve the conundrum,"" of low long-term rates, said Dominic Konstam, head of interest-rate strategy at Credit Suisse First Boston in New York. The December three-month eurodollar future contract late yesterday was pricing in a 4.00% federal funds rate by the end of the year, up from a recent estimate of 3.75%. ""Fundamentally, the 10-year is heading above 5%,"" said Mr. Konstam. A test of last year\'s peak for the 10-year yield of 4.90%, could usher in more buyers. ""The bond market is a lot more attractive at that level versus stocks,"" said Jim Cusser, portfolio manager at Waddell &Reed in Kansas City, Mo. ""It might become a more lucrative bond market for investors."" --- Joseph Rebello and Michael Mackenzie contributed to this article. ---   License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service']","Yields Continue Upward March As Inflation Concerns Mount --- Ten-Year Note Tops 4. 60%, A Higher Level Than When Rate Increases Were Started",2005-03-22,The Wall Street Journal
49,,2005-03-23 00:00:00,"['The dollar rose across the board, touching a one-month high versus the euro and a five-week high against the yen after the Federal Reserve lifted rates and issued a moderately hawkish statement. The dollar was modestly lower against the euro and little changed against other major currencies before the rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee announced its decision. Traders had earlier brushed off a slightly above-consensus report for the February producer-price index. Yet although the Fed lifted its target rate by 0.25 percentage point to 2.75% as expected, the dollar rallied sharply after the FOMC statement noted stronger inflationary pressures. In late New York trading, the euro was at $1.3088 from $1.3170 late Monday in New York. The dollar was at 105.56 yen from 105.09 yen Monday. The dollar was fetching 1.1879 Swiss francs from 1.1777 francs. The pound traded at $1.8852 from $1.8987. Versus the yen, the euro was at 138.19 yen from 138.37 yen late Monday. Analysts said the Fed\'s statement, while it maintained its intention to lift rates at a ""measured"" pace, expressed heightened vigilance about inflation. That may increase market expectations of faster rate increases later this year, which is supportive for the dollar. ""It was a more hawkish characterization of the state of the economy, which surprised the market. In addition, the [Fed panel] also seemed to be striving for increased flexibility, as the discussion of the [economic] risk-assessment is less forward-looking than in the past,"" said Sophia Drossos, currency strategist at Morgan Stanley. As a result, Ms. Drossos said the Fed\'s statement is bullish for the dollar, since risk-averse investors are likely to move investments back into dollar assets as a safety measure. Ms. Drossos expects the dollar to rally, causing the euro to test the $1.30 mark in the days ahead. Not all analysts, however, were convinced the dollar was set to extend its gains. ""We are getting this slightly more hawkish message from the Fed on inflation, and that might be driving some of the knee-jerk move higher in the dollar,"" said Todd Elmer, currency strategist at Barclays Capital. ""But ultimately, some of the message it sends -- the jump up in yields and the fact that the Fed might end up behind the curve on inflation, could cause people to rethink what they\'re doing -- that could probably lead to some more dollar weakness,"" he said.

50,,2006-02-01 00:00:00,"['The Federal Reserve reached a turning point in both leadership and interest-rate policy as it raised short-term interest rates for the 14th consecutive time but suggested that further increases are no longer assured. In its last policy meeting with Alan Greenspan as chairman, the Fed yesterday raised its short-term interest-rate target to 4.5% from 4.25% and left a free hand to his successor, Ben Bernanke, for deciding the next move. In a statement accompanying the rate increase, the Fed said, ""Some further policy firming may be needed"" to keep growth steady and inflation low -- a signal that another rate increase is still on the table. But it was less definitive than the statement after the Fed\'s Dec. 13 meeting, which said such action was ""likely to be needed."" The wording change suggests that prospects for an increase at the Fed\'s March 28 meeting and after depend on incoming economic data. The Fed expressed no alarm over a sharp slowdown in economic growth in the fourth quarter of 2005, but it remained wary of inflation. Though economic data have been ""uneven, the expansion in economic activity appears solid,"" it said. Underlying inflation ""has stayed relatively low,"" but ""possible increases in resource utilization, as well as elevated energy prices, have the potential to add to inflation pressures."" The shift in language coincided with the end of Mr. Greenspan\'s 18 1/2-year tenure at the central bank, during which the U.S. economy experienced the longest expansion on record and just two mild recessions. At the start of yesterday\'s meeting, Mr. Greenspan was greeted by a standing ovation by other Fed policy makers. Afterward, he went to a lunch reception attended by 180 Fed staff and policy makers. They presented him with a chair with his nameplate from the Fed\'s board room, a baseball glove signed by each of the 12 reserve-bank presidents, and the Fed flag that had flown over the building during the meeting. ""I know this institution will go on doing extraordinary things, and I will look on from the sidelines and cheer,"" Mr. Greenspan said, according to a Fed official. After that, he went to a reception in the atrium of the Fed with about 1,500 retirees and staff. ""We have a very special mission,"" he told them. ""We are in charge of the nation\'s currency, and the central bank, because of that, is involved in everyone\'s daily lives. We are the guardians of their purchasing power."" The 79-year-old Mr. Greenspan plans to set up a consulting firm in Washington, give speeches and write a book. As the Fed meeting ended, the U.S. Senate voted overwhelmingly to confirm Ben Bernanke to succeed Mr. Greenspan. Mr. Bernanke, 52, was most recently chairman of President Bush\'s Council of Economic Advisers. He was a Fed governor from 2002 to 2005. He is to be sworn in at 9 a.m. today. Yesterday\'s decision to raise the target for the federal-funds rate, charged on overnight loans between banks, was unanimous among the 10 voting members of the 17-member Federal Open Market Committee. (There are two vacancies.) The Fed also raised the less-important discount rate, charged on short-term Fed loans to commercial banks, to 5.5% from 5.25%. In response, many U.S. commercial banks raised their prime rate, the benchmark for many consumer and business loans, to 7.5% from 7.25%. Stock and bond markets showed little reaction to yesterday\'s move, evidence of how transparent and predictable the Fed became in Mr. Greenspan\'s later years. Still, with yesterday\'s statement, the Fed signaled that its recent period of exceptionally clear guidance is ending. When it began to raise the rate from a 46-year low of 1% in 2004, it sought to avoid the turmoil that accompanied its rate increases in 1994 by telegraphing its intentions. Its statements from that May until last November said rates were ""accommodative,"" that is below some neutral level that neither stimulates nor restrains growth, but that rates would rise at ""a pace that is likely to be measured,"" which came to mean no more than a quarter of a percentage point per meeting. That interest-rate guidance eliminated most of the guesswork and volatility that used to accompany Fed rate changes. Some economists say that is one reason investors have been willing to accept very low returns on long-term Treasury bonds. Their yields, at around 4.5%, are about where they stood when the Fed began to tighten monetary policy in 2004. Economists said that by suggesting another rate increase isn\'t automatic, Fed officials have left Mr. Bernanke more latitude on where to direct rates. --- Online Today: WSJ.com subscribers can see how the Federal Reserve\'s statement compares with the one in December, and read the full text of the Fed\'s statement.

51,,2006-02-01 00:00:00,"['Short-term Treasurys exited yesterday\'s session on a weaker footing, while longer-term Treasurys gained after the Federal Reserve raised short-term interest rates. For borrowers with floating-rate debt, such as some types of home-equity loans, the Fed\'s 14th consecutive rate increase spells higher interest payments. Commercial banks yesterday began to raise the prime rate, the benchmark rate for certain types of corporate and consumer credit, to 7.50% from 7.25%. At 4 p.m., the benchmark 10-year note was up 3/32 point, or 93.8 cents per $1,000 face value, at 99 26/32. Its yield fell to 4.523% from 4.533% Monday, as yields move inversely to prices. The two-year note lost 1/32 to 99 23/32 to yield 4.528% as short-term interest-rate futures see odds of 80% that the federal-funds rate will rise to 4.75% from the current 4.50%. In what was Alan Greenspan\'s final day as Fed chairman, the Federal Open Market Committee, as expected, raised the federal-funds rate by a quarter-percentage point. The Senate yesterday confirmed Ben Bernanke as Mr. Greenspan\'s successor. Market attention focused on the changes in the accompanying policy statement, which were in line with expectations. The statement omitted the word ""measured"" to describe future policy changes and said that further rate increases ""may be needed"" to keep inflation in check and growth on track. The policy statement reflects the uncertainty over how the FOMC will end its series of rate increases, which began in June 2004 when the federal-funds rate was 1%. ""They have to tread carefully, they don\'t need to raise rates so they become restrictive as there is no inflation, so they are fumbling for a neutral funds rate,"" said Dominic Konstam, head of interest-rate strategy at Credit Suisse First Boston in New York. Still, with the Fed showing a ""bias to tighten policy,"" the funds rate could easily reach 5% or higher, he added. The FOMC statement changes little in terms of investment strategies, which along with future Fed interest-rate moves will remain highly dependent on coming economic data for direction. ""From the fed funds to the two-year note out to the 10-year note, you\'ve got rates that are virtually on top of each other,"" said Colin Lundgren, a portfolio manager at RiverSource Investments in Minneapolis, which has about $100 billion in fixed income under management. ""As an investor, what attracts you to one versus the other has a lot to do with the economic outlook."" With investors expecting data on Friday to show a healthy gain of 250,000 jobs in January and anywhere from $46 billion to $50 billion in new supply next week, the bias remains to the downside for Treasurys, Mr. Lundgren said. ""I expect it could be some tough sledding here for bond investors,"" Mr. Lundgren said, adding it ""appears the Fed is leaving the door open for another hike on March 28, but beyond that, who knows.""

52,,2008-05-01 00:00:00,"['NEW YORK -- The dollar declined against the euro Wednesday after the Federal Reserve cut interest rates and hinted, but didn\'t directly state, that it plans to take a break from more rate reductions. The Federal Open Market Committee cut its benchmark federal-funds rate by another quarter percentage point to 2.0% after its two-day meeting, which markets were expecting. In a statement after the decision, the FOMC noted ""substantial"" easing of monetary policy to date -- suggesting it is reluctant to cut further. But there wasn\'t a decisive ""all-clear"" announcement on more possible rate cuts, which have been continuing for months and have been a big factor in the dollar\'s sharp declines. The committee noted ""further"" softness in U.S. labor markets and financial markets\'""considerable stress."" ""Our sense is that the market was looking for . . . a stronger signal of a policy pause,"" said Nick Bennenbroek, head of currency strategy at Wells Fargo Bank. ""We suspect it is that lack of that direct signal that is contributing to the dollar\'s dip after the announcement."" The euro climbed to an intraday high of $1.5642 against the U.S. currency after the FOMC statement. Late Wednesday in New York, the euro was at $1.5615, up from $1.5566 late Tuesday, while the dollar was at 104.00 yen, down slightly from 104.02 yen. The euro was at 162.40 yen, up from 161.91 yen. The British pound was at $1.9884, up from $1.9687 late Tuesday, and the dollar was at 1.0361 Swiss francs, down from 1.0375. Despite the dollar\'s modest losses against the euro, the dollar still ended April firmer than where it began, the first month it has done so this year. Joseph Trevisani, chief market analyst at FX Solutions in Saddle River, N.J., said that with no huge surprises in the FOMC statement, currency markets will now turn their attention back to data, including a U.S. jobs report for April due Friday. ""We got a major status quo statement,"" Mr. Trevisani said. ""We\'re now back to looking at economic statistics, and the market wants to sell the euro but they\'re not going to do it until there\'s proof, a change in U.S. economic data."" Prior to Friday\'s jobs report, currency investors will keep their eye on a nationwide U.S. manufacturing report out Thursday. The Institute for Supply Management\'s monthly survey of manufacturing activity is likely to show another modest contraction in April, according to economists\' forecasts. The FOMC\'s rate cut reversed the dollar\'s earlier gains against major rivals on the back of a quarterly U.S. economic-growth report that met expectations and suggested the economy continues to avoid a technical recession. The Commerce Department reported a 0.6% gain in the initial reading for first quarter U.S. gross domestic product. Sterling also rose against the dollar Wednesday as the FOMC statement deflected attention away from data overnight that showed United Kingdom house prices posted their first year-on-year fall for 12 years in April. --- Nicholas Winning in London contributed to this article.

Initially, traders embraced the Fed\'s statement as a signal it was finished cutting rates. The Fed cut its target overnight bank rate to 2%, the lowest since November 2004, in an 8-2 vote by the Federal Open Market Committee. The Fed highlighted the ""substantial easing of monetary policy to date,"" saying that should help spur ""moderate"" economic growth, implying more rate cuts might not be necessary. ""One way to look at this is that the Fed\'s slowly starting to turn this ship around, but it\'s a very, very small increment,"" said Sean Simko, head of fixed income management at SEI Investments. ""They want to note that they\'ve done a lot, and they\'re going to let the data guide them over the next few weeks."" April is the kindest month, at least for the blue chips: The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 4.5% in April, its best monthly percentage gain since last April. The S&P 500 rose 4.8%, its biggest monthly point gain since April 2003 and its biggest percentage gain since December of that year. ""Foods, fuel, inflation, employment, credit are all serious concerns, [yet] optimism is alive and spreading,"" said Howard Silverblatt, senior index analyst at Standard &Poor\'s. Shares of companies sensitive to commodity prices retreated, and Home Depot was one of the weakest performers on the Dow, off 56 cents, or 1.9%, to $28.80. Citigroup fell 1.05, or 4%, to 25.27, the biggest decliner on the Dow, after the largest U.S. bank by assets went back to the capital markets, raising $4.5 billion in a follow-on sale of shares. Altogether, Citi has raised about $40 billion in the recent past from investors as it seeks to shore up reserves against bad loans. General Motors was the biggest percentage gainer on the Dow. GM added 2, or 9.4%, to 23.20 even after swinging to a first-quarter net loss of $3.3 billion as overseas growth offset difficulties in its North American lending and auto business. Another Dow component sensitive to commodity costs, Procter &Gamble added 1.15, or 1.8%, to 67.05 -- well off its high on the session. The maker of consumer staples like Pampers diapers, Gillette razors and Folger\'s Coffee said fiscal-third-quarter profit surpassed the mean analyst estimate. P&G\'s peer Colgate-Palmolive shed 5.08, or 6.7%, to 70.70 despite robust growth in the first quarter. The maker of toiletries and pet food warned margin growth may be flat or only slight, amid rising commodity costs. American depositary shares of German business-software maker SAP declined 2.22, or 4.2%, to 50.23 after it reported a drop in first-quarter profit, hurt by costs associated with its acquisition of French concern Business Objects. Also on Wednesday afternoon, commodity stocks regained some of the momentum lost earlier this week when traders sold them in fear that the Fed would clamp down on inflation. American depositary shares of Harmony Gold Mining rose 47 cents, or 4.2%, to 11.69. International Paper fell 1.14, or 4.2%, to 26.17, however, after the paper maker said higher costs for energy and raw materials drove down first-quarter profit. Lower land sales also hurt results. A trio of food producers topped Wall Street estimates with first-quarter results, in part because they succeeded in passing on higher commodity costs to customers. Shares of Velveeta cheese maker Kraft Foods rose 86 cents, or 2.8%, to 31.63; milk supplier Dean Foods added 72 cents, or 3.2%, to 23.24; and cereal maker Kellogg shed 81 cents to 51.17 after trading higher early in the session. Garmin (Nasdaq) fell 5.54, or 12%, to 40.90 after the maker of global-positioning navigation devices disoriented investors by missing the Wall Street estimate for its first-quarter profit. First Solar (Nasdaq) rose 7.07, or 2.5%, to 291.99 after the maker of ""thin film"" solar panels outshone analyst expectations with its first-quarter profit. Time Warner fell 42 cents, or 2.8%, to 14.85 after the media giant said it would step back from its interest in Time Warner Cable. Growth in that business was solid in the first quarter.

The Federal Reserve\'s explanation of monetary policy yesterday struck the kind of cautious rhetorical balance more often associated with election-year politicking: simultaneous bids to assure both those who worry more about economic growth and those more spooked by inflation. In keeping its benchmark interest rate at the 2% level set in April, the Federal Open Market Committee made the kind of slight linguistic alterations that Fed watchers like to study as closely as Kremlinologists once scrutinized who stood next to whom on May Day. The FOMC still sees U.S. economic activity expanding but views softening labor markets and the persistent ""considerable stress"" in financial markets as potential threats. And FOMC members regard ""tight credit conditions, the ongoing housing contraction, and elevated energy prices"" to be just as burdensome on future economic growth as they did in June. But the FOMC moved a key part of its June and April statements from the section about its policy leanings to the part where it describes its view of the economy: ""Over time, the substantial easing of monetary policy, combined with ongoing measures to foster market liquidity, should help to promote moderate economic growth."" Meanwhile, descriptions of inflation more alarmingly expressed in the present tense in June merited less urgent syntax in yesterday\'s statement. ""Inflation has been high, spurred by the earlier increases in the prices of energy and some other commodities, and some indicators of inflation expectations have been elevated,"" the Fed said. And ""the committee [still] expects inflation to moderate later this year and next year,"" even if ""the inflation outlook remains highly uncertain."" Thus, ""although downside risks to growth remain, the upside risks to inflation are also of significant concern to the committee,"" the Fed said -- straddling the fence of conflicting economic worries as much as at any time in the recent past. Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke and his colleagues -- only one of whom voted against yesterday\'s actions out of preference for an anti-inflationary increase in the cost of borrowed money -- aren\'t alone among the world\'s conflicted central bankers. Elevated energy and food prices have stoked inflation fears everywhere, but few economies are out of the credit-crunch woods or immune to contagion from American economic ills. A German news report suggests official figures due out next week will show that country\'s economy contracted in the second quarter, as the Financial Times reports. A key reading of Japan\'s economic health fell in June, contributing to that government\'s pronouncement of a ""worsening"" view of the economy, as the Nikkei reports. In the U.S., investors nonetheless took heart from the Fed\'s statement and sent the Dow Jones Industrial Average up more than 300 points in hope, as The Wall Street Journal puts it, that ""the worst could be over for stocks."" Of course, ""this was hardly the first time since the bear market began in October that stocks have staged a strong rebound,"" the Journal notes. And it adds that skeptical investors warned ""this could be another false start,"" with a potential recession looming, housing prices continuing to fall and the financial system still in disarray. --- Cracking a Global Identity-Theft Ring U.S. authorities yesterday charged 11 people with stealing more than 40 million credit-card and debit-card account numbers off the computers systems of Barnes &Noble, TJ Maxx, Sport Authority and other retailers, in what Attorney General Michael Mukasey called ""the single largest and most complex identity-theft case ever charged in this country."" The case took three years to crack, and brought investigators to three continents, bringing home what the Los Angeles Times describes as ""the global nature of the Internet\'s underground economy as agents tracked leads from China to Ukraine and picked up suspects in Turkey and Germany as well as the U.S."" One reason it took so long, The Wall Street Journal adds, is that the man identified as the ringleader, Albert Gonzalez of Miami, had been a confidential informant for the Secret Service. ""His indictment states that during the course of his \'cooperation,\' he obtained \'sensitive\' information that he used \'to warn off conspirators and ensure that they would not be identified and arrested in the course of that investigation,\'"" the Journal reports. Mr. Gonzalez and alleged conspirators are accused of locating ""retailers\' wireless networks by driving by with a laptop with Wi-Fi installed,"" and then hacking ""into the networks and [installing] sniffer software to collect payment card numbers as well as password and account information as the data was passing through the retailers\' networks,"" Women\'s Wear Daily reports.

55,,2009-08-13 00:00:00,"['We\'re beginning to wonder if the Ben Bernanke Federal Reserve isn\'t populated with French existentialists. A la Jean-Paul Sartre, they have a ""no exit"" strategy when it comes to unwinding their extraordinarily easy monetary policy. At least they gave no signs of restraint in yesterday\'s statement after their August Open Market Committee meeting, keeping short-term interest rates close to zero and again promising to maintain current policy for an ""extended period."" The Fed is keeping the money pumping even though it also conceded that ""economic activity is leveling out,"" which is an acknowledgment that the recession is all but over. This policy is justified, the FOMC statement said, because the economy still has ""substantial resource slack"" that will keep cost pressures under countrol ""for some time."" Unsaid by the Fed, but understood by everyone, is that Mr. Bernanke isn\'t about to tighten money while he\'s still auditioning for re-appointment to a second four-year term as Chairman. Fed chiefs who tighten money tend to be unpopular with Wall Street and the political class, though not with the middle class. The one hint of discipline was the Fed\'s suggestion that it won\'t expand its program to buy $300 billion in Treasury debt. The Fed will stretch out its purchases for an additional month into October, but this is probably to reduce the chance of market disruptions when it stops its purchases. The good news here is that the Fed seems to be admitting that this decision to directly monetize the national debt by buying long-end Treasurys was a mistake. It failed to keep rates down and may even have helped increase them as holders of U.S. debt wondered about the Fed\'s independence from the politicians at Treasury and on Capitol Hill. Overall, though, the Fed\'s policy is to keep pressing the money accelerator to the floor. We agree it\'s hardly time to put the brakes on. But the Fed would be wiser to at least begin slowing to, say, 160 miles per hour from its present Indy car speed of 200 mph. It\'s a lot safer to slow down gradually than have to screech to a halt to avoid another asset bubble.

56,,1990-12-19 00:00:00,"['NEW YORK -- The dollar fell quickly late yesterday afternoon, when the Federal Reserve announced a long-awaited cut in the U.S. discount rate to 6.5% from 7%. Coming at the end of an otherwise staid trading day, the Fed\'s announcement caused traders to scurry into action, dropping the U.S. currency across the board. Late in New York, the dollar was quoted at 1.4762 marks, down from 1.4870 marks late Monday in New York. The U.S. currency was also changing hands at 132.62 yen, down from 133.15 yen in New York late Monday. Sterling was trading at $1.9430, up from $1.9305 late Monday. In midmorning trading in Tokyo Wednesday, the dollar was trading at 133.20 yen, up from 133.03 yen late Tuesday in Tokyo. The Fed said the reduction was made to address credit constraints in the weak U.S. economy and slow growth in monetary aggregates. It also was taken to realign the discount rate with market interest rates, the Fed said. With federal funds at 7 1/4%, there wasn\'t much leeway for a further relaxation of U.S. monetary policy unless the discount rate was cut. The discount rate is the interest rate the Fed charges member banks for loans, while the federal funds rate is the rate banks charge one another for overnight loans. An eventual drop in the discount rate, therefore, had been widely expected. With the Fed\'s policy-making Federal Open Market Committee meeting Monday and yesterday, many traders commented that a rate cut this week was likely, but few expected it to come yesterday. Fueling speculation of a rate cut during the day was the improved inflation picture shown by the U.S. consumer price index for November. Showing only a 0.3% rise, compared with increases of 0.6% in October and 0.8% in September, the figures were perceived as giving the Fed added maneuverability to lower rates -- leeway that had been narrowed by last Friday\'s disheartening 0.5% rise in November producer prices. Nevertheless, because of the thinness of the market, traders weren\'t bothering to risk the exposure of positioning for a potential rate cut. Before the rate reduction was announced, one New York trader commented that ""people might be thinking about {a discount rate cut} but very few people are acting on"" that suspicion. Because the Fed dropped the news into a calm, highly illiquid market, it\'s hard to gauge how sharp a sell-off the dollar ultimately will suffer, said Al Shealy, foreign exchange manager at Union Bank of Switzerland in New York. ""It\'s certainly bearish news for the dollar,"" but the dollar has withstood bearish news in the past, said Mr. Shealy. Predicting the downside potential of this one impulse is difficult, traders said. If the easier credit conditions stimulate the U.S. economy, they eventually could benefit the U.S. unit. Before the Fed stole center stage with its rate reduction, the market was serene, tucked in tight ranges and already focused on the coming holidays, traders said. The dollar had fallen slightly on an unexpectedly wide U.S. trade deficit but was supported by the market\'s nagging apprehension over a war in the Persian Gulf. ""Nobody wants to be either a hero or a goat . . . squandering everything they\'ve made all year in the last week,"" said Alfonso Alejo, assistant vice president in corporate foreign exchange at Mitsui Taiyo Kobe Bank in New York. Many participants already have closed their books for the year, content to lock in whatever profits or losses they have sustained, rather than risk exposure in the thin illiquid market. On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for current delivery settled at $376.50 an ounce, down $1. Estimated volume was a light two million ounces.

57,,2003-05-07 00:00:00,"['NEW YORK -- The dollar fell hard, with the euro leaping above $1.14 for the first time since January 1999, after the Federal Reserve flagged deflation as a possible risk and Treasury Secretary John Snow appeared to signal a benign policy. In the wake of the Federal Open Market Committee\'s announcement, the dollar stumbled quickly, with the euro shattering resistance around $1.1395. The dollar also hit a four-year low against the Swiss franc, a 5 1/2-year low versus the Canadian dollar and three-year lows against the Australian dollar. It also touched two-month troughs versus the yen and sterling. Comments by Mr. Snow didn\'t seem to slow the dollar\'s decline. In an interview on CNBC, he said that the U.S. administration has had a position ""going back many years to support a strong dollar."" But he added ""we recognize that the dollar\'s value is best set in an open competitive currency market."" The fact that Mr. Snow\'s statement came on a day when the euro hit a fresh four-year high was viewed by some in the market as a significant endorsement of a more benign policy by the Bush administration toward the dollar. Meanwhile, ""the Fed is giving more emphasis to deflation concerns than ever before,"" said Sung Won Sohn, chief economist at Wells Fargo in Minneapolis. ""The Fed believes the economic rebound they see won\'t be strong enough to head off deflation."" Late yesterday, the dollar was trading at 117.52 yen, down from 118.67 yen late Monday in New York but above two-month lows of 117.31 yen hit earlier in the session. The euro was trading at $1.1437, sharply up from $1.1282 late Monday. Against the Swiss franc, the dollar was at 1.3243 francs, down from 1.3425 francs late Monday. Sterling was at $1.6135, up compared with $1.6063 Monday. Some analysts said the euro may not be able to hold on to these gains however, particularly given the speed of its climb. The Canadian dollar hit its highest level in 5 1/2 years after the Fed\'s decision reinforced expectations that the interest-rate divergence between Canada and the U.S. would continue to widen in the Canadian currency\'s favor. Late yesterday, the U.S. dollar was trading at C$1.3924, from C$1.4120 late Monday. --- Robert Flint and Michael Deibert contributed to this article.

58,,2008-03-19 00:00:00,"['The dollar surged after U.S. stock markets cheered the Federal Reserve\'s decision to cut interest rates less than expected. Currency traders weren\'t convinced immediately that the Federal Open Market Committee\'s decision was positive for the dollar. The greenback waffled for a while, briefly dropping below 98 yen. But as U.S. stock markets began to rise after the FOMC\'s decision to reduce its key lending rate by 0.75 percentage point to 2.25%, instead of the expected one percentage point, the dollar also took a liking to the move. As sentiment began to emerge that the Fed perhaps is getting a handle on U.S. economic problems, many investors betting against the dollar didn\'t ""have the mettle to hang in,"" said Jeff Gladstein, global head of foreign exchange trading at AIG. As a result, the euro dropped to an intraday low of $1.5633 after the FOMC decision, while the dollar pushed as high as 99.71. Late yesterday in New York, the euro fell to $1.5636 from $1.5747 late Monday, while the dollar was at 99.56 yen from 97.38 yen. The euro was at 155.67 yen from 153.35 yen. The British pound was at $2.0081 from $2.0007, and the dollar moved up to 1.0017 Swiss francs from 0.9858 franc Monday. In general, lower interest rates by the Fed are a knock on the dollar, because they lower returns on dollar-based investments and lead investors to buy foreign currencies. But yesterday\'s cut was less than forecast, so it was considered positive for the dollar. Perhaps as important to the dollar as the rate cut was the Fed\'s economic-outlook statement that accompanied it, said Michael Woolfolk, a senior currency strategist at Bank of New York Mellon. ""The Fed indicated that it was giving increased attention to elevated inflation levels, thereby signaling that an end to the current rate cut cycle was fast approaching,"" Mr. Woolfolk said. This, he said, lays ""the groundwork for a bottom in the fed funds target rate at 1.75%-2% in the second quarter, and helps to restore stability to the beleaguered dollar by midyear."" The dollar needs any help it can get. In recent days, it has fallen to record lows against the euro and the Swiss franc, and a 13-year trough against the yen as markets fretted over a U.S. economy that may be in a recession. The gains were broad after the FOMC\'s decision, even reversing earlier losses against higher-yielding currencies such as the British pound and the Australian dollar.

59,,2008-03-19 00:00:00,"['Crude-oil futures ended 3.5% higher after the Federal Reserve\'s interest-rate reduction prompted a late-session surge.    Light, sweet crude for April delivery settled at $109.42 a barrel on the  New York Mercantile Exchange, a gain of $3.74 for the day. The contract expires today. The day\'s gains nearly erased Monday\'s drop, which was the biggest one-day percentage loss since August.    Futures rose by about $2 yesterday morning and spent most of the day at that level, with activity light as the market awaited the Fed\'s decision, which came just 15 minutes before the close. The three-quarter pecentage-point cut failed to match widely held expectations of a full-point move. Nevertheless, crude soared above $109 on the news -- in large part because investors drawn to the market by monetary policy had nowhere else to go, said Addison Armstrong, an analyst with TFS Energy in Stamford, Conn.    ""The funds who are clearly in charge of these markets really don\'t have any other way to play it at this point,"" Mr. Armstrong said. ""They can\'t find a return anywhere else other than commodities markets, where there\'s momentum and there\'s liquidity.""    The Fed\'s moves are closely watched by commodities traders for their effect on the dollar. Cuts to interest rates tend to weaken the U.S. currency, which in turn tends to buoy oil prices as investors seeking a hedge flood into commodities.    The dollar weakened slightly against the euro and the yen after the cut was announced, but later strengthened.    The Fed\'s actions may have given the crude-futures market renewed strength, enough to overcome Monday\'s big drop and resume the two-month-old rally, said Peter Donovan, a vice president at Vantage Trading in New York. ""This is definitely going to put [talk of a correction] on the back burner,"" Mr. Donovan said.    The market\'s attention now turns to the Department of Energy\'s weekly oil and product inventory data, which is expected today. Crude-oil and gasoline stockpiles are expected to have increased in the week ended last Friday, while analysts forecast that distillates, which include diesel and heating oil, decreased.

60,,2008-03-19 00:00:00,"['WASHINGTON -- The Federal Reserve continued its two-front attack on the credit crunch with a steep rate cut, and hinted at more to come.     The cut was less than financial markets wanted. But in a sign the Fed\'s prior efforts to boost lending through unconventional means may be getting some traction, stocks soared, buoyed by earnings reports from two big investment banks.     The Fed cut its short-term interest-rate target 0.75 percentage point to 2.25%, not the full point that markets had been expecting. It was the largest disappointment the Fed has delivered to markets since the central bank began cutting rates in September. the move was also a signal that because of the Fed\'s concerns about inflation, it expects its other initiatives to bear more of the burden of stimulating growth.     For at least a day, investors cheered. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 300 points ahead of the rate cut on a growing conviction the Fed\'s prior efforts to funnel cash to credit markets would work. Though stocks lost a chunk of their gains right after the 2:15 p.m. rate-cut announcement, they surged back to close up 420.41 points, or 3.5%, at 12392.66.     Financial stocks did especially well. Shares of   Lehman Brothers Holdings, under sharp pressure lately, soared more than 46%.   Goldman Sachs shares rose over 16%. Both reported first-quarter earnings that, while off more than 50% from a year ago, were better than expected, prompting descriptions of the market surge as a relief rally.     The dollar improved against both the euro and Japanese yen after the Fed announcement. The U.S. currency has fallen sharply in recent weeks as global investors questioned the Fed\'s commitment to resisting inflation, a worry that has sent money pouring into gold, oil and other inflation hedges. Oil sold off briefly after the announcement but then rose to close up $3.74 a barrel at $109.42.     Though less than expected, the interest-rate cut was substantial. Yesterday was only the second time the Fed has cut so much since it began announcing its rate moves in 1994. The central bank now has cut short-term interest rates a full three points since September, the fastest pace of easing in decades.     This reflects the speed with which a slump in housing and subprime mortgages has spiraled into a broad credit crunch, weakening financial institutions and making it harder for a broad swath of businesses and households to borrow. Most economists now think the U.S. is in a recession, with the debate shifting to how deep it will be.     Recognizing that, the Fed signaled in its end-of-meeting statement that the prospect of more rate cuts remains on the table. ""The outlook . . . has weakened further,"" it said. ""Consumer spending has slowed and labor markets have softened. Financial markets remain under considerable stress, and the tightening of credit conditions and the deepening of the housing contraction are likely to weigh on economic growth."" It said ""downside risks to growth remain,"" and the Fed will ""act in a timely manner as needed.""     Nonetheless, the Fed has increasingly come to the view that lower rates alone won\'t restore order to the financial markets and prevent a severe recession. It has rolled out ever more creative and aggressive attempts to infuse cash into market corners where it normally doesn\'t operate, culminating in Sunday\'s decision to lend to investment banks from its ""discount window,"" a privilege previously reserved for commercial banks. Chairman Ben Bernanke also has publicly backed action to use public money to stem a tide of mortgage defaults and foreclosures.     The Fed\'s actions are among several aggressive steps throughout the federal government that are coming to a head this week and could prove critical in combating the crisis. Today the regulator of Fannie Mae and   Freddie Mac, which provide the bulk of funding for home mortgages, is to announce an easing of their capital requirements and the companies are to pledge to raise more capital, people familiar with the matter said. Those steps should enable them to back more mortgages.     Meanwhile, the Bush Administration which has so far resisted using large amounts of public money to save borrowers and lenders from bad loans, may be ready to compromise with Democrats on a more activist approach to the housing crisis. The Fed is ""running out of pages in its playbook to address the growing crisis of credit and confidence,"" Senate Banking Committee Chairman Chris Dodd, who has proposed the Federal Housing Administration insure up to $400 billion in troubled mortgages, said yesterday. Now the Bush administration should be ""equally aggressive.""     Yesterday, the Fed expressed more concern about prices than after its Jan. 30 meeting. ""Inflation has been elevated, and some indicators of inflation expectations have risen,"" it said. While the Fed still expects inflation to ease as commodity prices plateau and as higher unemployment blunts wage and price gains, it said that ""uncertainty about the inflation outlook has increased. It will be necessary to continue to monitor inflation developments carefully.""     With the economy continuing to weaken, the Fed remains concerned about what some officials describe as an ""adverse feedback loop"" of economic weakness, tighter lending and further weakness. It is thus likely to cut interest rates again.     But the elevated concern about inflation in the statement suggests the Fed does think it\'s getting close to the bottom in interest rates. Some analysts speculate the Fed could trim rates before its next scheduled meeting on April 29-30, but many think that\'s unlikely unless the outlook or markets get markedly worse.     The futures markets reduced the expectation they are showing for additional cuts. The futures now see the federal-funds rate, charged on overnight loans between banks, easing to between 1.5% and 1.75% by year\'s end. Before yesterday\'s move, futures investors were betting the rate would fall to 1.25% to 1.5%.     The Fed also lowered the rate charged on direct ""discount window"" loans it makes available to banks and -- since Sunday -- to investment banks. It slashed the rate to 2.5% from 3.25%, keeping it a quarter-point above the federal-funds rate. Commercial banks began lowering their prime interest rates, to which some variable-rate loans are tied, to 5.25% from 6%.     Highlighting the depth of the Fed\'s inflation concerns, two of the 10 voting members of the policy-setting Federal Open Market Committee voted against the 3/4-point cut. Charles Plosser and Richard Fisher, presidents of the Federal Reserve Banks of Philadelphia and Dallas, ""preferred less aggressive action at this meeting,"" the Fed said.     A worsening of both inflation and economic growth in the past month has made FOMC decisions more fractious. Each of the past five rate-cut decisions has triggered at least one dissent -- one favoring a bigger cut and the others favoring less. Yesterday\'s was the first meeting with two dissents since 2002.     Messrs. Plosser and Fisher have been the most outspoken about inflation risks, but most other Fed policymakers are also uncomfortable with the recent deterioration in inflation psychology. The decision to trim the federal-fund rate less than markets expected appears, at least in part, a way to convey both that the Fed isn\'t panicking and that the central bank is weighing consequences of its actions on inflation psychology.     The economy is hardly out of the woods. Investor confidence remains fragile just days after the Fed made an unprecedented loan to prevent the collapse of   Bear Stearns Cos., exposing how deeply the credit squeeze had penetrated the U.S. financial system. Sunday\'s statement that the Fed would lend to investment banks, and on the same terms as to commercial banks, was the boldest step the central bank has taken so far to employ its own balance sheet to take some riskier debt off the hands of financial institutions.     The stresses in the credit markets have kept some of the Fed\'s rate-cutting efforts from filtering through to borrowers. The average rate on 30-year mortgages fell to 5.5% in December from 6.4% in July when the crisis began; but then the rate went above 6% in February, even though the Fed had been cutting short-term rates since September.     After the Fed a week ago said it would lend up to $200 billion in Treasury securities to bond dealers in return for mortgage-backed securities, mortgage rates fell to 5.74% from 6.2%, according to Bankrate.com.     Rates on ""jumbo"" mortgages above $417,000 -- until recently, the biggest that could be guaranteed by Fannie Mae and   Freddie Mac -- are higher now than in July, because banks have trouble finding investors to buy securities backed by such loans. The Fed\'s move a week ago to lend to bond dealers also knocked down rates on jumbo loans, to 7.02%.     Bank Credit Analyst, a financial research service, said a decline in rates other than those on super-safe Treasury bonds ""would be the key indication that conditions are finally improving. If that does not happen, then the Fed will be forced to consider more drastic action, including direct purchases of securities.""

61,,2008-03-19 00:00:00,"['The Federal Reserve\'s three-quarter-point rate cut yesterday was less than some forecasters had predicted, but it was more than some at the central bank were comfortable with. Two of the 10 voting members of the Federal Open Market Committee opposed the cut, preferring ""less aggressive action,"" according to the Fed statement. Those two -- Richard Fisher of the Dallas Fed and Charles Plosser of Philadelphia -- have been warning about inflation for some time. And yesterday, the Fed did at least acknowledge in its statement that ""inflation has been elevated."" No surprise there, since the entire yield curve out to the 10-year bond currently pays less than the inflation rate. The last time the Fed cut rates below 3%, it was October 2001, oil was at $19 a barrel and falling, and a Fed Governor (now Chairman) named Ben Bernanke would soon give speeches about how to prevent a deflation. When it kept going to 1% in June 2003, the Fed created the subsidy for credit that produced the housing bubble. Nobody\'s much worried about deflation today. But the Fed is placing a heavy bet that commodity prices and other leading indicators of inflation will come down on their own, aided by a slowing economy. Yesterday\'s policy statement, while allowing that ""uncertainty about the inflation outlook has increased,"" reiterates Chairman Bernanke\'s view that slower growth and lower ""resource utilization"" will bring inflation back into the Fed\'s comfort zone. Good luck with that. To the extent that the Fed has recently taken extraordinary actions, such as opening up the discount window, to reliquify troubled financial markets, it is doing what is necessary to avoid a financial meltdown. But keeping its eye on price stability is the Fed\'s main obligation. The silver lining in the Fed\'s continued accommodation to easier money yesterday is that at least two Fed Governors behaved as if they still believe that.

63,,2003-01-30 00:00:00,"['NEW YORK -- Disappointment that the Federal Reserve left interest rates and its economic-risk assessment unchanged helped drive prices of Treasurys broadly lower. Some analysts also cited coming Treasury auctions as an important factor in the selling. The Treasury is expected next week to announce sales of five- and 10-year notes. ""In general [the selloff] has not a lot to do with the Fed\'s decision, but an overhang of supply,"" said Jim Caron, fixed-income strategist at Merrill Lynch in New York. In addition, the market was particularly vulnerable yesterday because many people had been purchasers of Treasurys because of rising international tensions, he added. At 4 p.m., the benchmark 10-year note was down 17/32 point, or $5.31 per $1,000 face value, at 99 23/32. Its yield rose to 4.033% from 3.967% Tuesday, as yields move inversely to prices. The 30-year bond\'s price was down 24/32 point at 106 29/32 to yield 4.918%, up from 4.871% Tuesday. Most investors had expected the Fed\'s policy-setting Federal Open Market Committee to leave its interest-rate target unchanged yesterday, at the conclusion of a two-day policy meeting. Still, some thought the Fed might shift its policy stance to an easing bias from neutral. When the Fed stood pat, that triggered some liquidation of so-called long positions, or trades made in expectations that prices would rise, said Paul Calvetti, head of government-securities trading at Deutsche Bank in New York. ""The neutral directive in today\'s policy statement validates the notion that the Fed expects the economy to perform well in the coming months,"" said Tony Crescenzi, chief market analyst at Miller Tabak in New York. So, ""though the Fed may have disappointed some investors by sticking with a neutral directive rather than shifting to an ease directive, the neutral directive is a bullish statement on the economy."" Among those disappointed were some people who had bought two-year notes in a Treasury auction yesterday ahead of the Fed announcement in hope of benefiting from any Treasurys-friendly outcome, analysts said. The Treasury awarded $27 billion of two-year notes at a rate of 1.710%, in line with market expectations. The results of the auction were ""respectable,"" considering that the sale took place just before the Fed announcement, said David Winter, a government-securities trader at Zions First National Bank in Jersey City, N.J. Meanwhile, the Treasurys market faces a spate of economic data today. Those include an advance report on growth in fourth-quarter gross domestic product, which is seen as having slowed to a rate of 0.6% from 4% in the third period. The fourth-quarter employment-cost index is seen up 0.9% after a third-quarter rise of 0.8%. Also crucial to the Treasurys market will be the direction of major stock indexes, analysts said. In recent months, Treasurys frequently have traded inversely to stocks as declines in stock indexes prompted flight to the relative safety of government securities. At the end of this week, if the Standard &Poor\'s 500-stock index isn\'t meaningfully above 860, stocks could see another leg down, pushing Treasurys prices higher, said William Strazzullo, market strategist at State Street Global Markets in Boston.   Corporate &Junk Bonds Crown Cork &Seal Co. plans to sell $1.75 billion in senior secured notes as part of a refinancing of more than $3 billion aimed at pushing back debt maturities. It also hopes to raise an additional $325 million through a sale of convertible bonds and a debt-for-equity swap. Additionally, the company said it was in talks with banks for $1.05 billion in secured credit. Crown Cork &Seal said the package, which it hopes to complete this quarter, would replace a $2.266 billion credit facility and ""result in substantially all of the company\'s debt having stated maturities in 2006 and beyond."" Citigroup and Deutsche Bank are leading the refinancing. Backed by second and third liens, the notes to be sold include a $1.25 billion eight-year portion and $500 million 10-year part.

64,,2003-10-29 00:00:00,"['WASHINGTON -- The Federal Reserve left interest rates unchanged and soothed investors by repeating its inclination to keep them low for a long time, even as new reports showed business investment accelerating and consumers\' job fears easing a bit. The Fed left its target for the federal-funds rate charged on overnight loans between banks at a 45-year low of 1%, as widely expected. It also said risks to economic growth were balanced, but that it was more concerned about a fall than rise in inflation. The risk of falling inflation, which could ultimately lead to deflation, would be the ""predominant"" concern for now, the Fed said in a statement accompanying its decision. Most important, the Federal Open Market Committee, the central bank\'s policy-making body, reaffirmed the commitment that low interest rates could be maintained ""for a considerable period."" Chairman Alan Greenspan first made the commitment in July, and committee statements repeated it in August and September. The latest statement was almost identical to those issued the previous two months, except for a slightly more upbeat assessment of the labor market, which it said is ""stabilizing."" In September, it said the labor market was ""weakening."" The latest statement also said demand is ""firming"" and business pricing power is ""muted."" The Fed\'s cautious tone comes despite expectations that government statisticians will report tomorrow that the U.S. economy grew at a blazing 6.2% annual rate in the third quarter. The Fed is maintaining easy monetary policy in the face of such upbeat data to ensure that the expansion, after a false start last year, uses up the idle business capacity and high unemployment that are now putting downward pressure on wage and price increases. Underlying inflation is running at about 1%, at the bottom of the 1% to 2% range many Fed officials prefer. Some Fed officials have been uncomfortable with making a commitment to low rates for fear that it will be inappropriate if the economy takes off or inflation resurfaces. Indeed, reports of those concerns in The Wall Street Journal, along with upbeat economic data, had prompted some investors to expect the Fed to drop or alter the ""considerable period"" commitment. That it was repeated in yesterday\'s statement shows that most on the committee remain comfortable with the words. Furthermore, the FOMC is generally unified on rates: All 12 voting members agreed to keep the rate unchanged. The lack of any shift in language relieved some investors. Bond yields declined, stocks rallied, and futures contracts based on the federal-funds rate suggest investors pushed out their expectation about the Fed\'s first rate increase to May from March. Even that seems too early, economists at Morgan Stanley said in a note to clients yesterday, given that Fed officials have stressed they don\'t need to pre-emptively tighten monetary policy as in previous expansions. Mr. Greenspan is unlikely to change the ""considerable period"" commitment until he is confident the likely resulting rise in long-term interest rates poses no threat to the expansion. The Fed hasn\'t addressed ""when and how to change the language, but that\'s for another day,"" former Fed Governor Laurence Meyer said. He predicted the central bank could drop its warning of low inflation and the ""considerable period"" language in January or March, although an actual increase in rates may not come until January, 2005. The Commerce Department yesterday said new orders for durable goods, those designed to last three or more years, rose 0.8% in September from August, the fourth increase in five months. An important category of orders, capital goods excluding defense and aircraft, soared 3.9%, the biggest increase since March. They are now up 5% from a year earlier. Business investment has been the primary source of economic weakness since the economy slid into recession in 2001 and struggled out at the end of that year. Economists and the Fed believe the expansion won\'t be assured until business investment takes the burden of growth away from consumers. Fed officials have also worried that lack of job growth this year could weigh on consumer spirits, undercutting spending and the expansion. But in recent weeks, job creation has picked up, and yesterday the Conference Board reported signs that that is lifting consumers\' spirits. The New York business research organization\'s monthly index of consumer confidence rose to 81.1 in October from 77 in September, though it remains in the same narrow range it has been in since April. In October, the proportion of surveyed consumers saying jobs are plentiful rose to 11.8%, the highest since May, from 9.9% in September. The proportion saying jobs are hard to get edged down to a still high 33.8% from 35.1%.

65,,2003-10-29 00:00:00,"['NEW YORK -- Led by short maturities, Treasurys rallied after Federal Reserve policy makers issued an assessment of economic and interest-rate prospects that was very similar to one issued in September. The Fed left its federal funds target rate unchanged at 1.0%, as expected. What did surprise investors was the fact that the Fed changed so little in the wording it used to describe the U.S. economic outlook, particularly its view that falling prices represent a riskto future growth. That phrasing sparked quick buying in Treasurys -- though much was by investors and traders rushing to reverse positions taken in expectation of a different Fed statement, analysts said. At 4 p.m., the benchmark 10-year note was up 16/32 point, or $5 per $1,000 face value, at 100 13/32. Its yield fell to 4.198% from 4.260% Monday, as yields move inversely to prices. The 30-year bond\'s price was up 17/32 point at 103 31/32 to yield 5.103%, down from 5.139% Monday. In its statement yesterday afternoon, the Fed\'s policy setting Federal Open Market Committee said, ""The committee judges that, on balance, the risk of inflation becoming undesirably low remains the predominant concern for the foreseeable future"" even though upside and downside risks for sustainable growth ""are roughly equal."" Bond investors and traders had speculated that the Fed would tone down its worries about disinflation, the slowing of price increases, to signal a subtle change in its thinking on monetary policy, in a sort of ""exit strategy"" from its current accommodative monetary-policy stance. As a result, many people had sold government securities, particularly in the short end of the market, which is the most sensitive to expectations about monetary-policy changes. ""The market had focused on an exit strategy, and in doing that, took its eye off the inflation ball,"" said William Sullivan, economist at Morgan Stanley. Once they saw the Fed statement, investors and traders scrambled to buy shorter maturities. Craig Coats, head of fixed income at Keefe, Bruyette &Woods in New York, said by citing disinflation concerns, the Fed also encouraged investors to undertake another strategy that involves borrowing funds in markets where interest rates are lower and using the money to buy Treasurys. ""People are putting carry trades back on,"" said Mr. Coats. Earlier in the session, Treasurys languished amid stronger-than-expected economic data. The government reported that orders for durable goods, or items meant to last three years or longer, rose 0.8% to $176.26 billion in September. Although the September rise was a little smaller than the 1.3% rise Wall Street had expected, actual shipments of nondefense capital goods excluding aircraft rose a strong 2.5%. Bear Stearns economists noted that for the third quarter as a whole, durable-goods orders increased 14.9% at an annual rate, the strongest quarterly showing since the April-June period in 2000. ""These data represent further evidence of a cyclical upswing in manufacturing,"" the economists said. ""Additionally, regional manufacturing surveys released so far for October point to an acceleration in factory activity at the start of the fourth quarter."" The Conference Board, meanwhile, reported a higher-than-expected consumer-confidence reading for October as modest improvements in the labor market buoyed optimism. The headline index rose to 81.1 from an upwardly revised 77.0 in September.   Foreign Bonds The upgrade earlier this month of Russia to investment-grade standing by Moody\'s Investors Service was justified by the country\'s ""willingness and ability"" to pay off foreign debt, said Jonathan Schiffer, Moody\'s lead analyst on Russia. The upgrade came well before the Russian government last weekend arrested OAO Yukos Chairman Mikhail Khodorkovsky, fanning renewed fears of political risk. News of the arrest hit Russian stocks and the country\'s Eurobonds. ""The consensus view is that structural reforms are moving slowly,"" Mr. Schiffer said. ""But the point is that slow movement hasn\'t undermined the government\'s willingness or ability to pay off its debt."" Moody\'s was the first of the three big international ratings firms to lift Russia\'s foreign debt ceiling to investment-grade, in a two-notch upgrade to Baa3. Standard &Poor\'s rates Russia double-B and Fitch Ratings rates it double-B-plus. Late yesterday in the U.S., Russia\'s issue due in 2030 was quoted at around 94% of face value, about the same as Monday, but down from about 95.5% Friday. --- Emily Barrett, Tom Sullivan and Sonja Ryst contributed to this article.

66,,2005-12-14 00:00:00,"['The prices of Treasury securities strengthened modestly after the Federal Reserve\'s Open Market Committee raised interest rates and altered its policy statement. In a fully expected move, the FOMC raised its federal funds target to 4.25% from 4%, the 13th such increase since June 2004 when the overnight borrowing rate was 1%. In its accompanying statement, the FOMC dropped the phrase that policy remains ""accommodative."" ""They are signaling they are not too far from finishing their tightening by dropping accommodative,"" said Dominic Konstam, head of interest-rate strategy at Credit Suisse First Boston in New York. That was enough to push Treasury prices a little higher, yet the move lacked conviction, as the Fed at the same time affirmed it will continue tightening policy because of concerns about inflation. The market reaction was ""more noise than anything else,"" said Anton Pil, global head of fixed income at J.P. Morgan Private Bank in New York, adding that investors are back to watching economic data for clues as to future policy moves. The FOMC said ""some further measured policy firming is likely to be needed to keep the risks to the attainment of both sustainable economic growth and price stability roughly in balance."" At 4 p.m., the benchmark 10-year note was up 9/32 point, or $2.8125 per $1,000 face value, at 99 26/32. Its yield fell to 4.523% from 4.557% Monday, as yields move inversely to prices. The 30-year bond was up 13/32 point at 109 17/32 to yield 4.723%, while the two-year note, the most sensitive to monetary policy changes, barely budged, adding 2/32 to 99 22/32 to yield 4.413%. Interest-rate futures continued to price in a further quarter-point rate increase at the January meeting of the FOMC, with opinion split as to whether the funds rate will reach 4.75% in March. Commercial banks raised their prime rate to 7.25%, further squeezing borrowers whose interest-rate payments are tied to the prime rate -- for instance, payments on certain types of home-equity loans. Mr. Pil said the FOMC is likely to raise rates to 4.75% by March and then pause at that level, when Ben Bernanke will have taken the reins from retiring Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan. The spread between two-year and 10-year note yields was steady at 0.11 percentage point. Further rate increases should compress this relationship close to zero and possibly invert the yield curve, if the 10-year yield falls below that of the two-year note, Mr. Konstam of CSFB said. ""The curve typically inverts right at the end of the tightening cycle,"" he added. However, a key ingredient for pushing the yield curve into inversion would be a slower economic growth next year -- a pace below 2.5% compared with this year\'s 3.5% pace -- as the Fed continues to tighten policy, Mr. Pil said.   Emerging Markets Brazil said it will pay off loans from the International Monetary Fund two years ahead of schedule, making for the biggest single repayment to the IMF. The government said it will make a $15.46 billion early payment, directly from Brazilian foreign reserves, eliminating Brazil\'s debt with the multilateral lender by the end of the month. The move, the government said, reflects the strength of Latin America\'s biggest economy. According to Finance Minister Antonio Palocci, owing to the early payments, Brazil will save some $900 million in interest expense in 2006 and 2007. Mr. Palocci said Brazil expects to continue ""close and friendly"" relations with the IMF. Risk premiums on Brazil dollar-denominated debt tightened on the news, narrowing 0.10 percentage point to 3.07 percentage points over comparable U.S. Treasurys on the J.P.

67,,2004-07-01 00:00:00,"['WASHINGTON -- The Federal Reserve began the long climb back from a historic period of cheap money by raising its target for short-term interest rates to 1.25% from 1%. In a statement, the Fed suggested it will continue to raise the federal-funds rate a quarter-point at a time, saying it can move ""at a pace that is likely to be measured."" But it included a caveat that policy makers ""will respond to changes in economic prospects as needed to fulfill its obligation to maintain price stability."" That is a warning that the central bank is apt to move to half-percentage-point increases if inflation accelerates. Both the rate increase and accompanying statement were largely as markets expected, thanks to an unprecedented Fed effort to telegraph its plans over recent months and minimize any shock to the markets. It succeeded: Stock and bond prices barely reacted in the first half-hour after the announcement. The Dow Jones Industrial Average, down 17 points just before the announcement, finished the day up 22.05 points at 10435.48. The yield on the 10-year Treasury bond, a benchmark for long-term borrowing, stood at 4.63% just before the 2:15 p.m. announcement, then rallied late in the day to end at 4.59%, down from Tuesday\'s close of 4.69%. The Fed\'s action was as surprising as getting ""a tie for Father\'s Day,"" UBS AG trader Art Cashin said on CNBC. The Fed noted that recent inflation readings were ""somewhat elevated"" but added that ""a portion of the increase in recent months appears to have been due to transitory factors."" It said risks to economic growth and inflation in coming months are balanced. ""Output is continuing to expand at a solid pace and labor-market conditions have improved,"" it said. All 12 voting members of the policy-making Federal Open Market Committee backed the increase in the federal funds rate, which is charged on overnight loans between banks. In a related move, the central bank also raised its discount rate, charged on its short-term advances to commercial banks, by a quarter percentage point to 2.25%, acting on requests from all 12 reserve banks. Several commercial banks responded by raising their prime lending rate, the benchmark for many business and consumer loans, to 4.25% from 4%. Before long, the Fed\'s rate increase should start rippling through to credit-card rates, adjustable-rate mortgages and, for savers, to money-market account yields and CD rates. But for many businesses and consumers, borrowing costs started to rise in April when investors began to anticipate the Fed\'s move to tighter monetary policy. Although bond yields fell yesterday, they are up almost a percentage point from their March lows. Mortgage rates and corporate-bond rates have followed suit. As a result, applications to refinance mortgages -- a major source of extra spending cash in recent years -- have fallen by about three-quarters since March. However, applications to purchase homes, though down a bit from May, remain well above last year\'s levels. Economists consider a ""neutral"" funds rate -- which neither stimulates nor restrains the economy -- to be between 3% and 5%. Investors expect the funds rate to reach 2.25% by the end of this year, and 3.75% by the end of 2005. Having restated its plans to be ""measured,"" the Fed likely will be reluctant to raise rates more than a quarter-point at its next meeting on Aug. 10. Fed officials believe the credibility of their communications strategy depends on matching their words with actions. Abandoning ""measured"" rate increases right after reiterating the policy, even with a caveat, could weaken that credibility. But officials also realize that with inflation near the top of the 1%-to-2% inflation zone they informally define as price stability, they have less margin for error than they hoped for a few months ago. The 12-month inflation rate, by the Fed\'s preferred measure, excluding the more volatile food and energy components, jumped unexpectedly quickly from January to May, to 1.6% from 1.1%. Moreover it is running at a 2.3% annual rate in the last six months. (Inflation as measured by the better-known Consumer Price Index, including food and energy components, is running at 3.1% in the 12 months through May.) Indeed, by noting yesterday that a ""portion"" of the increase in inflation was transitory -- a likely reference to higher commodity prices, which have eased a bit lately -- the Fed implied a portion also reflected changed economic fundamentals, such as job and wage growth. Since the funds rate has a long way to go to reach neutral, the Fed would have to quickly switch to more aggressive rate increases if it discovered it has been too sanguine about inflation. ""We\'re one bad inflation number away"" from the Fed having to raise interest rates by one-half a percentage point in August, instead of a quarter-point, said Mickey Levy, chief economist at Bank of America. The Fed last raised the funds rate in May 2000, to 6.5%, to cool an economic boom fueled by a bubble in stocks and technology investment spending. Over the next three years it cut the rate 13 times to 1%, the lowest since 1958, first in response to those bursting bubbles, then to a wave of corporate-accounting and governance scandals and the build-up to the Iraq war, which restrained business confidence. As those traumas subsided and job creation took off in March after a year of stagnation, the case for easy policy rapidly melted away. Some critics worry the Fed has waited too long. The funds rate has been below the annual inflation rate for 20 straight months. That\'s the longest such stretch of negative ""real"" interest rates since 1974-76, a period in which the Fed is now widely acknowledged to have been too lax, leading to the double-digit inflation of that era. The real funds rate has averaged 1.8% since 1954. Throughout the Fed, a growing number of people have been fretting over these developments. Last month, the Cleveland Fed\'s research director, Mark Sniderman, published alternative lyrics to Bob Dylan\'s ""The Times They Are a-Changin\' "" in a bank publication, titled, ""The Rates They Are A-changin\'."" They began: ""Come gather \'round people wherever you roam/Recognize that inflation around you has grown."" The Fed may get some extra breathing room from signs that economic growth slowed a bit in the last two months, such as an unexpected slowing in manufacturing activity in the Chicago area, according to a purchasing managers\' report yesterday. Still, former Fed governor Laurence Meyer said he doubts the economy will slow enough to prevent an August rate increase. It\'s more likely, he said, that an inflation scare will put a half-point increase on the table. He noted that growth has slowed while job gains have accelerated, which means growth in productivity is slowing and labor costs accelerating -- a trend Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan is watching closely. Anecdotal information also points to continued upward pressure on prices: In May, 28% of restaurants identified rising food costs as their top challenge, up from 22% in April, according to a survey released by the National Restaurant Association yesterday. If the choice between quarter-point and half-point moves is close, election considerations may tip the Fed toward the smaller move, Mr. Meyer said. Fed officials have historically tried to lower their profile in the run-up to elections to avoid being drawn into controversy. In a recent study, New York Fed economist Rebecca Hellerstein looked at FOMC members\' votes from 1973 to 1994, and concluded there is a ""dead spot"" in the year before presidential elections in which FOMC members are 12% less likely to vote to raise rates for a given forecast of the economy. Both parties have begun spinning higher interest rates in their favor -- Republicans as evidence of a healthy economic recovery, Democrats as evidence that President Bush\'s large budget deficits are driving up the cost of borrowing. But neither Mr. Bush nor his Democratic challenger, Sen. John Kerry, is likely to criticize the Fed itself. Mr. Bush just reappointed the 78-year-old Mr. Greenspan to a fifth term. Mr. Kerry backed that decision.

68,,2004-07-01 00:00:00,"['The Federal Reserve\'s first rate hike in more than four years proved to be anticlimactic for financial markets, as it was about as well-advertised as these things can be. The Fed\'s move was anything but trivial, however, as it kicked off a policy transition that gradually will end the Fed\'s sustained stimulus that began back in 2001. There are good reasons to anticipate a relatively muted investor response, however: Market prices already anticipate that short-term interest rates will be pushed back to more normal levels over the coming year. In contrast, the Fed\'s previous policy tightening, in 1994, triggered a massive global bond selloff, as investors were surprised repeatedly by Fed actions in response to an unexpectedly robust economic expansion. --- The market\'s uneventful response to the Fed\'s rate increase makes it easy to miss the key implications of recent developments. In broad terms, the power of monetary policy action to combine both long-term inflation goals with short-term stabilization tasks has been confirmed, even in the context of globalized and deregulated financial markets -- and a series of unusual shocks. It\'s easy to forget that only one year ago, the threat of deflation was judged widely to represent the United States\' most immediate economic danger. In fact, many analysts and investors predicted at that time that the Federal Reserve was about to conduct ""unconventional"" policy easing -- that is, buying securities directly from private investors -- something that had been attempted only once, when the Fed pegged all interest rates during World War II. It didn\'t happen last year, but the worries about low inflation weren\'t illusory -- the core Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) chain price index dipped below 1% last winter on a rolling 12-month basis for the first time since the measure\'s inception in 1959. From today\'s vantage point, the U.S. economy\'s renewed economic vigor is a reminder that monetary policy remains a potent short-term stabilization tool. Not only were deflation worries building a year ago, but many expressed concern that Fed policy would be inadequate to overcome the allegedly irresistible contractionary impact of the late 1990s economic and financial imbalances. The classic skeptics\' image of the Fed pushing on a string once again became cliche. Nonetheless, the current U.S. upturn overcame a series of shocks as potentially threatening as those of the late 1920s. The restoration of robust U.S. growth while avoiding deflation should not obscure the Fed\'s success in reaching its key long-term goal of price stability. Twenty-five years after the Federal Reserve -- under Chairman Paul Volcker -- administered draconian rate hikes to combat double-digit inflation, Alan Greenspan was able to describe the U.S. economy as having entered a ""zone of price stability."" Over most of the intervening span, Fed policy could be described as one of ""opportunistic disinflation."" That is, the Fed didn\'t set out to create downturns. However, when slumps occurred -- thereby ratcheting down inflation -- the Fed would act preemptively to hold onto the inflation gains. In practice, this sustained strategy eventually achieved price stability amidst two long economic booms and an unprecedented bull market in financial assets. Of course, the Fed had no intention of triggering a recession when it tightened cautiously in 1999 and early 2000. In that sense, the 2001 economic downturn was an accident. Presumably, the Fed would not have tightened at that time had policy makers known what was coming. Nonetheless, the result was the final step to price stability, as the economy contracted in 2001, Thus, the Fed\'s task has become one of preserving -- not establishing -- low inflation. By implication, a new policy approach will be needed to supplant opportunistic disinflation. For now, the Fed is on a path to end its current stimulus by renormalizing short-term interest rates. Despite claims by some observers that the Fed has waited too long to begin tightening, the Fed\'s move yesterday marks one of the earliest ever undertaken, when judged using the factors that typically guide such actions, including the current inflation rate and the likely margin of excess capacity. For example, the Fed rarely has begun to withdraw its stimulus before employment has returned to its pre-slowdown peak. Today, however, total employment is 1.3 million lower than at the recession\'s onset in early 2001. In other words, Fed officials appear to be intent on preserving price stability, now that it has been attained. The FOMC\'s policy statement made it clear that the Fed ""will respond to changes in economic prospects as needed to fulfill its obligation to maintain price stability."" Investors may be confused about the Fed\'s intentions, because the earlier cut in the Fed funds rate to 1% was unprecedented. However, the funds rate is no more stimulative today than in other, similar periods when judged in real (that is, inflation-adjusted) terms. For example, today\'s 1.25% nominal funds rate -- with the year-on-year increase in the Fed\'s favored core PCE price index at 1.5% -- is no lower in real terms than the 3% funds rate was a decade ago when inflation was close to 3%. Presumably, the Fed\'s aim is to withdraw its stimulus at a pace that will return short-term interest rates to neutral by the time the economy reaches full employment. That likely will require the funds rate to be raised to around 4%. Even if it takes a year or more to reach that point, the persistence of substantial slack in the economy ought to keep inflation in check. Gradual Fed tightening well ahead of schedule signals that the central bank is moving its sights back to its primary long-term goal of price stability. In practice this is likely to mean keeping inflation in the 1% to 2% band for year-on-year increases in the core PCE deflator that has been maintained since 1996. Although the Fed has never acknowledged any specific target range, by implication a sustained 1% to 2% year-on-year increase in core inflation would represent a fair approximation. Such an outcome likely would match the Fed\'s fundamental goal of keeping inflation low enough that it does not distort investment decisions. If the Fed is successful in allowing the economy to return to full employment while maintaining price stability, the result will be a positive surprise for investors. Although financial market participants appear to have assumed that the Fed will be tolerant if inflation rises into at least a 2% to 3% range -- a conclusion that is consistent with surveys of inflation expectations -- the Fed\'s early transition back to normal short-term rates contradicts that claim. Securing price stability therefore will establish a constructive backdrop for financial assets. Obviously, equity investors are nervous about the prospect of higher Fed interest rates. However, vigorous noninflationary growth creates a more positive environment for corporate earnings than the slower growth that originally motivated the Fed to lower interest rates to emergency levels. Naturally, long-term interest rates would be expected to rise as the economy improves, but long-term rates have climbed significantly in anticipation of Fed tightening. In this context, the Fed\'s resolve to maintain price stability is the best way to keep bond yields relatively low. --- Mr. Lipsky is chief economist, and Mr. Glassman senior economist, at JP Morgan.

69,,2000-11-16 00:00:00,"['NEW YORK -- Bond prices rallied, even as Federal Reserve left interest rates unchanged, amid growing signs the U.S. economy is slowing. Investors have begun to bet that the Fed\'s next move will be to lower rates, as long as the economy keeps cooling off.    In late trading, the 10-year Treasury note rose 11/32, or $3.438 for a bond with $1,000 face value, at 100 7/32. The bond\'s yield, which moves in the opposite direction of its price, fell to 5.702%. The price of 30-year Treasury bonds rose 23/32, to yield 5.765%, while two-year notes was unchanged at 5.885%.    The Fed left the fed-funds rate, or its target Fed funds overnight interbank rate, at 6.5%, and also kept in place it bias toward a ""risk of heightened inflation pressures"" and the higher interest rates that would be needed to fight such pressures.    The Fed\'s decision was widely anticipated, but while some investors were disappointed the Fed kept its so-called bias tilted in favor of further rate increases others took heart by the wording in the Fed\'s statement accompanying its announcements, figuring the chances for a rate cut down the line had been raised.    In its statement, the Fed acknowledged softer ""business and household demand and tightening conditions in financial markets"" over recent months, and said those factors ""suggest that the economy could expand for a time at a pace below the productivity-enhanced rate of growth of its potential to produce.""    ""The FOMC [Federal Open Market Committee] now recognizes that the economy is growing below the speed limit, and it also recognizes the risks of a greater slowdown,"" says Peter Hooper, chief U.S. economist at Deutsche Bank, adding, ""If signs of slowing growth continue and if the labor market begins to loosen up a bit in the next month, we could well see a shift to neutral at the Dec. 19 meeting.""    ""They opened the door"" toward a neutral stance on rates, agreed Henry Wilmore, chief U.S. economist at Barclays Capital in New York, adding, ""They\'ll probably do it in the first half of next year, though lowering rates might be in the second half of the year.""    The federal-funds futures contract for February traded at a yield of 6.43% late yesterday, unchanged on the day. That suggests about a 30% chance that the Fed will lower rates by the end of February, according to traders.    The little-changed outlook for Fed policy makers helped push the yield curve, or the plot of yields compared with maturities in the Treasury market, into a flatter, or more inverted, position.    Traders said the yield-curve flattening was a reversal of steepening trades that had been put on by speculative traders in recent days, in bets that the Fed would somehow alter its outlook for interest rates.    Treasurys across the yield curve got a further modest boost after weaker-than-expected U.S. industrial production data were released at 9:15 a.m. EST, showing output declined 0.1% in October. An afternoon downturn in stocks also was seen as a supportive factor for bonds.    Some traders pointed to a troubling announcement by two big banks, Bank of America Corp. and First Union Corp., that it may classify sizable loans to a single borrower as nonperforming. The move, and a fall in shares of many banks yesterday, could suggest problems below the economy\'s surface that will soon appear. If such problems emerge, it could reduce pressures on inflation, loosen the labor market and encourage the Fed to lower rates.    Indeed, some traders said the Treasury market, which has been strong in the past two days, has more room to rally.    ""A lot of money managers have cash to put to work, and there\'s not a lot of hope for stocks right now,"" said Michael McGlone, market analyst, Aubrey G. Lanston & Co. ""I like the momentum in the market.""    While the primary arena of the investment-grade corporate-bond market was flush with fresh supply, the secondary market remained directionless, with uncertainty weighing on investors\' minds.    Yield spreads to Treasurys ended weaker, with the bank sector hardest hit on the back of concerns over loans by First Union and Bank of America to a company, widely believed to be Sunbeam Corp.    Levels on bonds of Bank of America and First Union gapped wider by as much as 0.20 percentage point during the session, traders said.    The broader market was marginally weaker, but it largely shrugged off the Fed\'s decision to leave interest rates and its bias unchanged, which market observers expected.    In the primary arena, Brooklyn, N.Y.-based utility KeySpan Corp. sold $1.65 billion of debt in three parts.    The $700 million five-year notes were priced at a yield margin of 1.60 percentage points over Treasurys, the $700 million 10-year at 1.90 over Treasurys and $250 million of 30-year debt at 2.15 over Treasurys.    The offering was multiple times oversubscribed, which reflects investors\' preference to stick to high-quality credits in defensive sectors, said Bob LoBue, head of North American high-grade debt syndicate at J.P. Morgan Securities, the book runner on KeySpan\'s deal.    Capital One Bank brought a $1.25 billion offering of asset-backed credit-card securities with some unusual features. Although planned at $750 million, the issue was increased in size because of strong investor demand, said an official at lead manager Chase Securities.    One unusual aspect was a swap transaction in which the issuer exchanged floating-rate for fixed-rate debt. Usually, a seller of fixed-rate debt looks to swap into floating.    A Chase official said in the current market climate, Capital One found it could sell floating-rate notes at more favorable terms.    Alex Roever, head of ABS research as Banc One Capital Markets, which was one of the co-managers, said the swap transaction was included in the issuing trust in accord with requirements of the new accounting standard FASB 133, which deals with gain on sale accounting.    Mr. Roever said the pricing of the three-year triple-A-rated notes was quite good at a spread of 0.10 percentage point over the one-month London interbank offered rate. He noted that last week, a similar transaction from Providian Bank commanded a spread of 0.12 percentage point over Libor.    ---    Shella Calamba and David Feldheim contributed to this article.

70,,2008-01-31 00:00:00,"['The euro shot up to a new two-week high against the dollar, within reach of its historical record, after the Federal Reserve cut its benchmark lending rate by a half percentage point, and ended with a record close.    The euro intraday passed $1.4900 -- an important technical barrier, just more than a half cent shy of its highest-ever $1.4968, reached intraday Nov. 23, 2007. The common currency rose as high as $1.4910 in the aftermath of the rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee\'s decision.    The dollar bounced up and down in a narrow range against the yen in the aftermath of the widely expected decision, in step with volatile equity performance.    The Fed\'s overnight target rate now stands at 3%.    ""While the dollar is down against the euro and the yen, and a return to recent lows remains on the cards, it has proved reasonably resilient considering the 125 [basis points] of Fed cuts in the last [eight] days. A slower pace of Fed easing going forward should prove a less challenging environment for the buck,"" said Nick Bennenbroek, head of currency strategy at  Wells Fargo & Co. in New York.    Yesterday afternoon in New York, the euro was at $1.4882 -- a closing record -- from $1.4773 late Tuesday, while the dollar was at 106.43 yen from 107.08 yen. The euro was at 158.39 yen from 158.19 yen. The British pound was at $1.9912 from $1.9896, while the dollar was at 1.0832 Swiss francs from 1.0929 Swiss francs late Tuesday.    Last week, the Fed enacted an emergency between-meeting rate cut of three-quarters of a point.    In the statement accompanying the FOMC\'s latest decision, Fed officials signaled they are willing to ease still further in coming weeks, although they did suggest that the cumulative 2.25 points of policy easing over the past four months may be enough to keep the economy on track.    Gross domestic product rose at a seasonally adjusted 0.6% annual rate in October through December, the Commerce Department said yesterday in its first estimate of fourth-quarter GDP. The estimate was below the third quarter\'s racing 4.9% growth and economists\' expectations for a 1.2% fourth-quarter increase.    Just prior to that, payrolls titan  Automatic Data Processing Inc. and consultancy Macroeconomic Advisers released a strong labor report that showed U.S. private-sector jobs jumped by 130,000 in January, beating forecasts by big margins.    The net effect of the conflicting reports on the dollar was range-bound trading, especially before the Fed\'s decision.    The job report is a precursor to tomorrow\'s government report on job creation in January. Economists are forecasting nonfarm-payroll growth of 63,000, compared with a slight increase of 18,000 in December.    Overnight, expectations of a FOMC rate cut helped lift the British pound to a fresh high for the year above $1.9950, leaving it poised to reach the psychological $2.00 mark.    ---    Dan Moliski contributed to this article.

71,,2008-01-31 00:00:00,"['Seeking to nip an incipient recession in the bud, the Federal Reserve cut interest rates for the second time in nine days, in one of its most aggressive campaigns in decades to boost the nation\'s economy.    The Fed lowered its target for short-term interest rates by 0.5 percentage point to 3% yesterday, and left the door open to further cuts.    In its statement accompanying the move, the Fed said ""downside risks to growth remain,"" and that the central bank would ""act in a timely manner as needed to address those risks."" Investors widely expect the Fed to lower its benchmark rate again in March by 0.25 percentage point to 2.75%.    Yesterday\'s rate cut comes as the latest news suggests the economy continues to skirt recession despite a steep slump in housing and the continuing credit crunch, but financial markets remain fragile.    Stocks rose on news of the cut, which some investors had expected to be smaller, but the market tumbled late in the day after a downgrade of Financial Guaranty Insurance Co. by Fitch Ratings intensified worries about the credit ratings of bond insurers, which insure about $2.4 trillion of debt. Such downgrades could leave banks exposed to additional losses on the mortgage-backed debt they hold, further eroding their capital and limiting their ability to lend.    The Dow Jones Industrial Average, up as much as 201 points after the Fed announcement, ended the day down 37.47 points at 12442.83.    The government reported yesterday that the economy grew at a slower-than-expected 0.6% annual rate in the fourth quarter of 2007. Most of the weakness stemmed from companies trimming inventories, which makes future production cuts less likely. Consumer spending slowed, though to a still-respectable pace.    A private payroll survey also found employment jumped in January. That led some economists to expect the Labor Department tomorrow to report robust job growth for the month, after a slump in December.    Last week, on the heels of a global stock selloff, the Fed made a surprise 0.75-percentage-point cut in its target for the federal-funds rate, charged on overnight loans between banks. That it went ahead with yesterday\'s rate cut despite some encouraging economic data underlines its worries that slumping housing prices and associated losses on mortgages could yet drag the entire economy down. The Fed\'s 2.25 percentage points in rate reductions since September roughly equal the initial pace of cuts in early 2001 -- following the bursting of the tech bubble -- as the most rapid in two decades.    The big question now facing the Fed is whether it has done enough. Officials yesterday signaled continuing concerns about growth.    ""Financial markets remain under considerable stress, and credit has tightened further for some businesses and households,"" the Fed said in its statement. ""Recent information indicates a deepening of the housing contraction as well as some softening in labor markets,"" it added, echoing previous comments. But yesterday\'s statement also dialed back the sense of urgency, dropping the ""appreciable"" from what it said last Tuesday were ""appreciable downside risks to growth.""    The latest statement included a reminder of how much the Fed has done to date: ""Today\'s policy action, combined with those taken earlier, should help to promote moderate growth over time and to mitigate the risks to economic activity.""    Some analysts took that to mean the Fed doesn\'t expect to cut rates as low as 2.25%, as markets currently anticipate. ""While the Fed certainly left the door open for further action, the policy assessment did seem to tilt toward reining in expectations of significant additional action,""  Morgan Stanley economist Dave Greenlaw said in a note to clients.    But Tom Gallagher, an analyst at brokerage ISI Group, said, ""You can\'t be confident the Fed is done until you feel the market has a good handle on the extent of the financial crisis,"" which it clearly hasn\'t yet.    Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke, who celebrates his second anniversary in the job tomorrow, now faces a delicate challenge. If his policy is successful, the economy will escape recession, few additional rate cuts will be needed and, paradoxically, his actions to date may end up looking excessive.    ""If we end up worrying about inflation later this year that could well be the good outcome for the Fed because odds are it will mean that the economy has stabilized,"" said Peter Fisher, a former Fed official who is now co-head of fixed income for money manager  BlackRock Inc. ""It may end up looking like the pre-emptive easing was unnecessary . . . but that\'s the point of taking out insurance against the downside.""    If so, that would require the Fed to quickly reverse some of its rate cuts. ""They acted aggressively on the way down; that suggests they\'ll act as aggressively on the way up,"" said Vincent Reinhart, a former top Fed staffer now at the American Enterprise Institute, a Washington think tank.    But the Fed, like most of Wall Street, has already been fooled by several false dawns since the current credit crisis began in August. That means it\'s unlikely to sound the all-clear while financial markets remain jittery and credit markets remain tight. Yesterday\'s statement, while less dire than last Tuesday\'s, made it clear the next Fed move is far likelier to be a rate cut than an increase.    Until this month, the Fed had expected the troubles in housing and mortgage markets wouldn\'t spill over to the broader economy, and that inflation pressures would continue to percolate. That led it to release statements that continued to play up the risks of inflation, implying that rates might not fall much more.    That changed in January with news that consumer spending, employment and manufacturing activity had all downshifted. Concerns in the financial markets grew, as signified by the sharp drop in stocks at the start of the year.    The possibility that falling house prices will lead to more defaults and foreclosures, loss of bank capital, tighter lending and yet further declines in prices is now Mr. Bernanke\'s dominant concern. Yesterday afternoon, rating firm  Standard & Poor\'s downgraded or threatened to downgrade more than 8,000 mortgage investments.    Mortgage rates have dropped in the past month, and that has enabled many borrowers with adjustable-rate mortgages either to refinance into fixed-rate mortgages or see their current mortgages adjust to rates one to two percentage points lower than would have been the case several months ago, says Doug Duncan, chief economist at the Mortgage Bankers Association. He said while that means foreclosures may be less than expected, the drop in home prices means many borrowers will be unable to take advantage of lower rates, limiting the benefit.    If home prices fall 10%, a mortgage that was originally 95% of the home\'s value is now about 105%, and ""you may be required to bring some equity to the table in order to refinance,"" Mr. Duncan said.    Yesterday, many commercial banks responded to the Fed\'s action by lowering their prime rate, a benchmark for many consumer and business loans, to 6% from 6.5%. But long-term bond yields rose in anticipation that the rate cut would boost growth and the risk of inflation. That could lead to higher, rather than lower, mortgage rates in coming weeks.    Both last week\'s and yesterday\'s Fed statements played down concerns about inflation. The Fed ""expects inflation to moderate in coming quarters, but it will be necessary to continue to monitor inflation developments carefully.""    That view isn\'t universally shared at the Fed. Nine of the Federal Open Market Committee\'s 10 voting members approved yesterday\'s rate cut; Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas President Richard Fisher dissented, arguing for no cut. Three of the Fed\'s 12 reserve banks didn\'t ask for a corresponding half-point reduction in the discount rate, charged on direct Fed loans to banks, to 3.5%.    Indeed, in the past few weeks, expectations for inflation a few years from now, as measured by the behavior of Treasury-protected bonds, have risen by a quarter percentage point.    While Mr. Bernanke won\'t welcome that, he will likely conclude that the weaker economy he now expects, together with stable to lower energy prices, will help suppress those inflation pressures.

He gets in his race car and accelerates right through the curve. With yesterday\'s 50 basis point interest rate cut, following last week\'s 75 point emergency reduction, we are certainly off to the monetary races.    Readers of these columns know we prefer more careful driving by the Fed, and judging from yesterday so do the markets. The long bond fell more than a percentage point, while every other economic indicator that signals a weaker dollar and higher inflation also rose. Gold hit $942 an ounce, and the dollar fell ever closer to 1.5 euros. But the most intriguing reaction came in equities, which typically cheer a Fed rate cut, but this time sold off on the Fed news.    Perhaps they were reacting to the Fed\'s statement that accompanied the rate cut, which suggested the central bankers stood ready to ease even further if events require. Or perhaps they noticed the jolting inflation numbers in yesterday\'s fourth-quarter GDP report, which had the core price deflator (not counting food or energy) rising by 2.7%, which is well above the 1% to 2% level that the Fed says is (or at least was) its comfort zone.    No worries, added the Fed statement, because, ""The Committee expects inflation to moderate in coming quarters."" We hope it\'s not impolite to point out that this is precisely what the Fed was saying a year ago. Perhaps we need to recheck the definition of ""moderate.""    The Fed is trying to forestall a recession, and what it fears would be the cascading impact of job losses on top of the credit crunch on top of the housing crash. And we\'ll admit Mr. Bernanke is in a fix, partly of the Fed\'s own making. Yesterday\'s report of 0.6% fourth quarter growth was disappointing, though some of the decline was attributable to inventory drawdowns that could be made up this year. In other words, a recession is far from a sure bet.    Mr. Bernanke\'s calculation seems to be that by easing now he can help the financial system ride out the current storm, and then the Fed can pull back on the throttle later this year if growth re-accelerates -- with no harm done. We hope he knows what he\'s doing, but our advice is that everyone bring a crash helmet in case he misses a turn.

Light, sweet crude for March delivery rose 69 cents, or 0.8%, to settle at $92.33 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange. This is the fifth consecutive rise for the front-month contract.    Crude\'s rally began Jan. 24, two days after the Fed orchestrated an emergency three-quarter percentage-point reduction in its benchmark interest rate in the face of a troubling U.S. economic outlook. In cutting its federal funds target rate by another half-percentage point to 3% yesterday, the U.S. central bank signaled it is willing to trim more as necessary.    ""The language is all positive,"" said Tom Bentz, a broker and analyst at  BNP Paribas Commodity Futures in New York. ""It\'s just adding to the upside potential of the oil markets right now.""    Amid concerns an economic slowdown would chill oil demand, Nymex oil futures have eased back from their $100 highs earlier this month. The Fed\'s moves in the last two weeks have since raised hopes that the U.S. may steer clear of a recession.    ""The view is if lower interest rates can help boost the economy in any way, it\'s going to be reflected in more energy demand,"" Mr. Bentz said.    Oil markets rose despite U.S. data released earlier yesterday showing crude and gasoline stockpiles grew more than expected last week.    U.S. and global oil inventories are likely to figure into discussions among Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries delegates when they meet in Vienna tomorrow. OPEC President Chakib Khelil said the group would make the right output decision based on a weakening global economy and second-quarter demand, as well as healthy oil stockpiles.    ""Right now, stocks are at a good level and second-quarter demand is going to be lower and the economy is not doing so well so I think OPEC is going to make the appropriate decision,"" Mr. Khelil said.    The oil minister of Saudi Arabia, Ali Naimi, called current global oil market fundamental forces ""sound,"" offering little indication that the OPEC will alter production tomorrow.

74,,2002-05-08 00:00:00,"['NEW YORK -- Market watchers were holding their breath, hoping against all hope that stocks would actually be able to hold on to some of the sharp gains made in the session. But that was not to be. After climbing more than 110 points, the Dow Jones Industrial Average managed to finish the session just north of the baseline while the Nasdaq Composite Index ricocheted back and forth before settling in negative territory. It was a game of wait-and-see for much of the session on Wall Street as traders kept a close eye on what the Federal Reserve would say about interest rates and the economy. But it turns out the Fed\'s decision to keep interest rates unchanged at 1.75% and its continued cautious stance on the state of the economy could have been a replay from the last meeting. The Federal Open Market Committee maintained its balanced risk assessment and said that the economy has received an upward impetus due to the swing in inventory investment. But final demand continues to be an uncertainty for the economy. Many market watchers said the Fed\'s decision, while positive, was a nonevent for the market and wouldn\'t provide the catalyst needed to boost the indexes out of their funk. ""There had been a bunch of people waiting for Godot in waiting for the FOMC\'s decision,"" said Jeffrey Saut, chief investment strategist at Raymond James. ""But what we\'re seeing is that the strength we have seen in the economy of late was due to an inventory buildup and final demand is still questionable going forward. We\'re not going to double-dip but I think we\'re seeing that recovery will be muted."" But Mr. Saut added that while indications are for a muted recovery, prices for stocks in the aggregate continued to trade at levels suitable for a sharp rebound. For that reason, investors continued to advocate being conservative and as the session wound up, conservative trading turned more to jittery trading, with the Dow closing up 28.51 points, or 0.29%, to 9836.55 while the Nasdaq Composite Index shed 4.66 points, or 0.3%, to 1573.82 and the Standard & Poor\'s 500 Index dropped 3.18, or 0.3%, to 1049.49. The NYSE Composite Index closed at 565.35, down 2.33, or 0.41%. Mr. Saut said some of the jitters, particularly among technology issues, came in anticipation of Cisco Systems\' fiscal third-quarter earnings that were released after the closing bell. Cisco had been trading higher for most of the session as rumors circulated that the company would beat analyst estimates. As it turns out, there was some basis to those rumors. The stock closed up 19 cents to 13.08. After the bell, the company reported third-quarter earnings, before items of 11 cents a share, two cents better than estimates. Blue chips buoyed the Dow yesterday. Honeywell International was the strongest performer on the Dow, rising 1.80, or 5%, to 37.80. Analysts said investors were bidding up shares of Honeywell due to its relatively cheap valuation, as well as the belief that conglomerates might react favorably to the Fed\'s decision to leave interest rates unchanged. United Technologies also was seen benefiting from continued low interest rates due to its economically sensitive businesses. United Technologies gained 81 cents to 68.15. While unchanged interest rates may have played a role in the strength of some conglomerates, it didn\'t do much for others. General Electric fell 32 cents to 30.65 and the much-beaten-down Tyco continued to trail lower, down 35 cents to 19. International Business Machines was active among the Dow 30, although its strength seemed to defy some discouraging words by Chief Executive Samuel Palmisano. He delivered a gloomy outlook for technology spending to employees late last month and suggested there will have to be cost-cutting by Big Blue to adjust to the sluggishness, The Wall Street Journal reported. Still, IBM managed to rise 50 cents to 76.50. The newly merged Hewlett-Packard climbed as the company boasted that it and recently acquired Compaq Computer won $5.3 billion in new contracts in the three months leading up to the deal\'s completion. The announcement yesterday came as the combined company\'s management teams and continuing product lines were presented to employees and customers. H-P gained 19 cents to 18.41. Microsoft was another winner among blue-chip names. The software giant closed higher on word that it offered to buy Danish software company Navision for $1.3 billion. The move would be a significant step into the European enterprise resource planning, or ERP, market for Microsoft. Microsoft rose 85 cents to 49.47. A number of independent power producers were dragged lower as the specter of Enron continued to wreak havoc on the market. News that Enron may have artificially inflated California power prices last year cast doubt on the sector as a whole and investors were not willing to give companies active in the California market the benefit of the doubt. Among the decliners, Williams dropped 1.61, or 8.7%, to 16.90, Dynegy fell 2.59, or 17%, to 12.26 and Mirant shed 1.34, or 12%, to 9.75. Shares of communications chip maker Broadcom also were under pressure on word that one of its customers, Motorola, penned a deal with Broadcom\'s rival Texas Instruments. Motorola announced that it selected Texas Instruments to power its newest cable modem product. Broadcom\'s stock fell 5.22, or 17%, to 24.72 on concerns that if Texas Instruments managed to get all of Broadcom\'s Motorola business, that would have an 8% to 9% impact on Broadcom\'s revenue. Motorola rose 25 cents to 14.69 while Texas Instruments fell four cents to 27.51. Xerox continued to struggle with more worries after Merrill Lynch analyst Shannon Cross downgraded the stock\'s near-term rating to neutral from buy. The analyst said the stock should continue to trade sideways for awhile as the market grapples with the renegotiation of Xerox\'s $7 billion revolver, as well as the filing of its restated financials from 1997 through 2000 and its 2001 10K and first quarter of 2002 results. Xerox shares tumbled 22 cents to 7.50. Insurance company Metlife helped keep the insurance sector among the top decliners of the session. The company reported first-quarter earnings, before items, of 61 cents, three cents better than expectations. But on its conference call, Metlife said its individual business remains under pressure with flat top-line premium growth. In addition, the company said while it expects to cut operating expenses by $200 million in its individual business, it sees increased costs of about $60 million related to its pension and other post-retirement benefit plans. Metlife shed 2.29, or 6.7%, to 31.86. Providian Financial shares climbed higher after analysts increased their 2002 earnings estimates for the company following the news that the credit-card issuer beat first-quarter estimates and was selling some of its high-risk assets. Providian reported first-quarter continuing operations earnings of two cents a share, above the average analyst estimate of a loss. The stock closed up 54 cents, or 8.5%, to 6.89. Apparel retailers were also strong, aided by AnnTaylor Stores. Morgan Stanley upgraded the company to overweight from equal-weight, citing a strong summer line and the possibility of stronger same-store sales comparisons, as well as higher earnings. AnnTaylor gained 3.10, or 7.3%, to 45.40.']","Cisco, Honeywell, United Technologies Notch Gains",2002-05-07,The Wall Street Journal
75,,2002-05-08 00:00:00,"['NEW YORK -- Treasurys, led by short maturities, rose modestly, as a day filled with economic data, Treasury auctions and a Federal Reserve policy meeting ultimately couldn\'t push the market out of its recent trading range. At 4 p.m., the benchmark 10-year note was up 6/32 point, or $1.88 per $1,000 face value, to 98 22/32. Its yield fell to 5.046% from 5.073% Monday, as yields move inversely to prices. The 30-year bond\'s price also gained 6/32 point, to 97 24/32, for a yield at 5.530%, down from 5.545% Monday. The Fed\'s policy-making Federal Open Market Committee left its target for the federal-funds rate at a 40-year low of 1.75% and signaled that it isn\'t inclined to raise that overnight-lending benchmark for a while. In a statement, policy makers cited concern that the rebound is still tentative and could run out of steam. ""The information that has become available since the last meeting of the committee confirms that economic activity has been receiving considerable upward impetus from a marked swing in inventory investment,"" the Fed panel said. ""Nonetheless, the degree of strengthening in final demand over coming quarters, an essential element in sustained economic expansion, is still uncertain."" Bonds reacted little, but already had recovered from early losses. The rebound came as many who had sold Treasurys before the five-year Treasury-note auction made offsetting purchases in expectation of the Fed decision. ""The decision from the Fed had been so widely expected for so long that we didn\'t see much reaction after the fact,"" said Vince Boberski, managing director at RBC Dain Rauscher in Chicago. As part of its quarterly refunding, Treasury sold $22 billion in new five-year notes, a record in the maturity. It will sell $11 billion of 10-year notes today, reopening an issue originally auctioned in February. The five-year note auction was awarded at 4.375%, in line with gray-market trading levels just before. When the jumbo offering came in as expected, it quelled some fears that the auction would send the market into a tailspin. ""At the last minute, people were able to get the auction where they wanted it to be, and that made for a good buying opportunity,"" said Donald Galante, government strategist at Mizuho Securities in Princeton, N.J. Analysts said that recently, five- and 10-year notes had lagged behind a rally in two-year and shorter maturities. That was because of trades that involved selling longer-dated issues and buying short-dated ones, as expectations for near-term Fed rate increases have diminished. Thus, the five- and 10-year notes being sold this week ""look cheap vs. twos and other short instruments,"" said Gemma Wright, head of market strategy at Barclays Capital in New York. ""That is helping to lure investors."" It may bode well for the 10-year note auction today, analysts said. In when-issued trading -- where dealers trade ahead of the auction -- the 10-year note was fetching 5.06%. Early in the day, the Labor Department said nonfarm productivity surged 8.6% in the first quarter, well-above market expectations of 7%, and the fastest rate in 19 years. But the bond market reacted with ambivalence, as people were mostly focusing on the five-year note auction later. The productivity report is ""good news for corporate profitability, but it will take some time before we see the results in terms of better corporate earnings,"" said Kevin Flanagan, fixed-income strategist at Morgan Stanley.  Corporate and Junk Bonds Investment-grade and junk bonds weakened, even though the Federal Reserve left rates unchanged. Investors cited varied concerns, ranging from continued fallout from Enron\'s collapse to worries about whether some companies can maintain access to capital. ""The price of money isn\'t the problem so much as the question, `Can companies roll their debts?\' "" said Vic Thompson, director of global capital markets at State Street Global Advisors. In new issues, Western Resources Inc. sold $765 million of five-year notes under Rule 144a via Salomon Smith Barney. A secured, $365 million part was priced to yield 3.42 percentage points over Treasurys, or 7.875%. It is rated Ba1 by Moody\'s Investors Service and triple-B-minus by Standard & Poor\'s. An unsecured, $400 million part was priced to yield 5.29 percentage points over Treasurys, or 9.75%. Ratings are Ba2 by Moody\'s and double-B-minus by S&P.

76,,1989-02-09 00:00:00,"['NEW YORK -- The dollar finished lower after a second day of narrow fluctuations, inhibited by uncertainty about President Bush\'s budget, concern about interest rates, and fear of central bank intervention. In thin trading, the U.S. currency moved less than a pfennig against the mark and stayed within a very narrow range against the yen. In Tokyo Thursday, the U.S. currency opened for trading at 129.40 yen, down a bit from Wednesday\'s close of 129.50 yen. The dollar drifted lower Wednesday during Asian trading, hitting an intraday low of 1.8667 marks near the close of activity. At the end of European trading, the dollar briefly challenged, but failed to break, resistance of 1.8750 marks. The dollar traded within that tight band for the rest of New York trading, with some dealers citing Mr. Bush\'s budget address, scheduled for late Thursday, as the factor slowing activity. Other dealers said fear of intervention blocked the dollar from reaching its topside, while the possibility of higher U.S. interest rates firmly supported the currency. ""The central banks put a curb on enthusiasm to bring the dollar higher,"" said Francoise Soares-Kemp, vice president at Credit Suisse in New York. Stephen Leach, currency adviser at Chemical Bank in New York, said the central banks ""have put a lid on the dollar, but haven\'t screwed it tight. There\'s a lot of uncertainty in the market where to go from here."" The best news that could come from Mr. Bush\'s address, would be decisive measures to cut the budget deficit, said Earl I. Johnson, vice president at Harris Trust & Savings Bank in Chicago. A clear plan to narrow the deficit would send the dollar soaring, he said. Mr. Johnson said he sees a technical drop to 1.8500 marks, possibly as low as 1.8200 marks. ""Around 1.80 marks is a very solid floor. The dollar is in no danger of collapsing,"" he said. The 1.9000-mark level is widely perceived as the upper limit the central banks will tolerate. Some market participants worry that higher European interest rates might reduce the premium U.S. rates carry, diminishing the attractiveness of the dollar and dollar-denominated assets. However, some dealers caution that a batch of European rate increases combined with a firmer monetary policy from the Fed could lead to a continuing cycle of global rate increases. The Fed\'s policy-making group, the Federal Open Market Committee, concluded two days of meetings yesterday, but until there is a significant move in short-term rates, market participants won\'t know if any policy changes were made. Minutes of the meeting won\'t be released for six weeks. On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for current delivery jumped $3.90 to settle at $396.20 an ounce. Estimated volume was a moderate four million ounces. In early trading in Hong Kong Thursday, gold was quoted at $394.15 an ounce.']","Dollar Is Pushed Lower by Uncertainty About Bush Budget, Fear of Intervention",1989-02-08,The Wall Street Journal
77,,2009-09-24 00:00:00,"['Rising fears of inflation are fueling an investor rush into mutual funds and exchange-traded funds holding Treasury inflation-protected securities. So far this year, more than $17 billion has poured into funds that invest in TIPS, government-issued bonds whose principal grows with rising inflation, according to estimates from research firm Morningstar Inc. That compares with estimated net cash inflows of almost $10 billion for 2008. Their popularity reflects worries that massive U.S. government spending will eventually lead to high inflation, which could erode the value of stocks and ordinary bonds. But if inflation stays at current low levels longer than some investors expect, TIPS may not add much juice to a portfolio -- and could even drop in value. That said, many investors aren\'t in it for the yields, but for the protection they hope the bonds will provide if inflation suddenly surges. For now, TIPS buyers are brushing aside the prospect that the bonds won\'t do well if that much-feared inflation doesn\'t materialize. Indeed, many TIPS have been bid up to prices exceeding their face value. Total net assets for TIPS-focused mutual funds and ETFs were approximately $51 billion at the end of 2008. The mutual funds have gained an average 7.4% total return this year through Sept. 21, according to Morningstar. That showing, while nothing like the dizzying run-up in junk bonds, is much better than that of ordinary government bond funds, which have returned 2.6% so far this year. Richard Seelig, a retired high-school math teacher in Pelham, Mass., bought shares of the iShares Barclays TIPS Bond Fund last December for his Roth individual retirement account. ""I looked at the amount of money the government was spending that it didn\'t have, and I thought, well, that is going to come back to haunt us,"" he says. The Barclays fund, an ETF, has gained 8.2% this year through Sept. 21. TIPS pay a fixed interest rate every six months, known as a ""coupon,"" similar to ordinary Treasurys. But unlike Treasurys, TIPS\' principal value fluctuates with the inflation rate. Over the life of the bond, increases in the value of its principal aren\'t paid out, although investors who own TIPS outside of retirement accounts do pay taxes on any interim gains on the principal, as well as on any interest. When the bond reaches maturity, the inflation-adjusted principal is returned to investors. (If deflation were to occur, the adjustments to the principal would be negative, though a TIPS bond held to maturity will never return less than its original principal.) TIPS mutual funds, by contrast, pay out interest and principal gains on a regular basis. Like Treasurys, TIPS are exempt from state and local taxes. TIPS are issued in maturities of five, 10 and 20 years. A plain-vanilla 10-year Treasury currently yields about 3.5%, while a 10-year inflation-protected security yields about 1.6%, before inflation. The yield gap between 10-year TIPS and Treasurys, now about 1.8 percentage points, is called the break even rate and implies an expected annualized inflation rate of about 1.8% over 10 years. If inflation averages more than 1.8% over the period, then TIPS will outperform standard Treasurys. The lower the break-even rate is, the easier it is for TIPS to outperform the regular variety Treasury. But inflation alone doesn\'t determine how well TIPS perform. Supply and demand also play a role. And demand for TIPS is driven by inflation expectations, rather than actual inflation. Such expectations could drive TIPS prices higher, thereby shrinking yields, since price and yield move inversely. ""There has been a ton of money flowing into TIPS year to date, yet there\'s no inflation,"" says Lawrence Glazer, managing partner at Mayflower Advisors in Boston. Instead, money keeps pouring into the investments based on the expectation that inflation is ahead. If the break-even rate widens, that would imply investors foresee higher inflation. But once the Federal Reserve begins to address inflation, it will raise short-term interest rates, and that would push down the value of existing bonds. In that case, there would be two counterforces acting on TIPS: rising inflation or expectations of inflation pushing up demand and thereby pushing up prices; and rising short-term rates driving down prices. If the Fed pushes rates up faster than inflation rises or raises rates before inflation picks up, TIPS could rack up losses for their owners. They could also decline if inflation turns out milder than investors\' original expectations. Some investors say they want to wait to buy TIPS until they actually start to see the Fed raise interest rates, says Debra Brede, who runs D.K. Brede Investment Management Co., an investment-management firm in Needham, Mass. The risk: If inflation is already escalating when investors decide to buy TIPS, ""the bonds might be more expensive at that point,"" she says. Of course, given the anemic economy and high joblessness, any resurgence in inflation may be distant. ""Certainly not in the next couple quarters,"" says John Canavan, a research analyst at Stone &McCarthy Research Associates in Skillman, N.J. On Wednesday, the Federal Reserve announced that it decided to leave interest rates unchanged. In its accompanying policy statement, the Federal Open Market Committee noted that it ""expects that inflation will remain subdued for some time."" One caveat is that TIPS, which have been around only since 1997, don\'t have a track record during a period of sustained high inflation. Investors do have some other choices. If both inflation and economic growth are high, assets such as commodities and equities could outpace TIPS, says Dan Dektar, chief investment officer of Smith Breeden Associates\' investment management group in Durham, N.C. Investors can buy TIPS directly from the U.S. Treasury at TreasuryDirect.gov without incurring brokerage fees; some brokerage firms also allow clients to purchase new-issue or secondary-market TIPS without incurring fees. The next TIPS auction is for bonds with a 10-year maturity and is scheduled for Oct. 5. Many planners recommend that individual investors hold TIPS in retirement accounts, particularly if the client is in a higher tax bracket. ""TIPS are not tax-friendly,"" said Doug Flynn, a certified financial planner at Flynn Zito Capital Management in Garden City, N.Y. ""You\'re not buying these for tax efficiency, you\'re buying because you\'re scared of inflation."" For those who prefer mutual funds, which provide diversification and professional management, there are a variety of funds that invest in TIPS and a handful of exchange-traded funds. Allianz SE\'s Pacific Investment Management Co., or Pimco, has unveiled three new TIPS ETFs this year, targeting different maturities. One popular TIPS mutual fund is Vanguard Group\'s Inflation Protected Securities Fund, which aims to outdo the Barclays Capital U.S. TIPS Index and has about $25 billion in assets under management. The fund distributes both interest and any inflation adjustment to the principal on a quarterly basis, though most investors choose to reinvest distributions, said Ken Volpert, who heads Vanguard\'s taxable bond group and co-manages the fund. Keep in mind, though, there are circumstances in which an income distribution may not occur, such as when the rate of deflation exceeds the yield before inflation.']",Investors Seek Inflation Haven In TIPS Funds --- But Treasury Securities Tied to Consumer Prices Carry Their Own Risks,2009-09-23,The Wall Street Journal
78,,2009-09-24 00:00:00,"['The Federal Reserve, in a move aimed at keeping interest rates low for home buyers through early next year, decided to extend and gradually phase out its purchase of mortgage-backed securities. The Fed\'s action signals its belief that the economy, while in recovery, remains fragile and that housing, which has seen some improvement in recent months, has only started to pull out of its slump. ""We definitely need help from the government,"" says Lee Barrett, president of Century 21 Barrett, a real-estate brokerage firm in Las Vegas. ""I don\'t think the market can make it on its own."" He also hopes Congress will extend tax credits for home buyers due to expire at the end of November. The central bank left its interest-rate target unchanged at zero to 0.25% and maintained its expectation that the federal-funds rate, or the rate banks charge each other for overnight loans, would remain low ""for an extended period."" ""Economic activity has picked up following its severe downturn,"" the Federal Open Market Committee said Wednesday in a statement after a two-day meeting. Though conditions in financial markets and the housing sector have improved, household spending ""remains constrained by ongoing job losses, sluggish income growth, lower housing wealth and tight credit,"" the Fed said. Treasury bonds and mortgage-backed securities rose in price Wednesday, sending yields lower. Stocks slumped. Although the Dow Jones Industrial Average briefly moved above the 9900 level following the Fed\'s afternoon statement, making some investors think about a possible return to 10000, it sagged late in the day and finished down 81.32 points, or 0.83%, at 9748.55. It was the biggest one-day point and percentage decline since Sept. 1. Mainly because of heavy government intervention in the mortgage market, interest rates remain near their lowest levels in decades. Rates on 30-year fixed-rate conforming mortgages currently average 5.24%, down from a recent peak of 5.81% in June but up from the year\'s low of 4.84% in late April, according to HSH Associates, in Pompton Plains, N.J. Sales have increased in California, Florida and some other areas from the very depressed levels of a year ago, largely driven by investors and first-time home buyers chasing bargains on foreclosed properties. But the market remains weak amid worries that new waves of foreclosures will add to supply as banks sort through mountains of paperwork from distressed borrowers seeking easier loan terms. Not all of those borrowers can be saved. That leaves an unknown number of foreclosed homes -- estimated by some analysts to total several million -- to likely hit the market over the next few years. The risk that those foreclosures will depress prices further may keep some potential buyers on the sidelines. ""Nobody seems to know how big that overhang is,"" says Tom Lawler, a housing economist in Leesburg, Va. Data on existing-home sales for August will be reported Thursday, and Mr. Lawler is bucking the consensus in predicting a decline. He notes tax credits induced many people to buy homes earlier this year, and sales may fall in the near term now that most of those tax-related purchases have been completed. In one sign that the housing market hasn\'t fully recovered, luxury-home builder Toll Brothers Inc. this week announced a nationwide sale on new homes. The specials being offered by Toll include lower prices on options, including custom tile and appliances, and mortgages with initial rates as low as 2.875%. With so many empty houses sitting on the market, some builders say they still have no way to make a profit with new construction. ""Why build new when people can go out and buy for less than it cost?"" says Mark Connal, vice president of realty at Michael Crews Development, a developer and builder in Escondido, Calif. An early end to the Fed\'s purchase program ""could potentially have reduced the demand for housing by 10% to 20% and that could have slowed the recovery,"" says Glenn Boyd, head of U.S. asset-backed securities research for Barclays Capital. ""This is certainly a positive and adds to our confidence in the ultimate recovery for home prices."" The Fed is about two-thirds of the way through its mortgage-purchase program, which was launched late last year to support mortgage lending, housing activity and broader credit markets. The central bank\'s decision to complete the full $1.25 trillion in purchases of mortgage-backed securities -- rather than ""up to"" that amount, as it said in August -- ended speculation that it might stop short, as a handful of policymakers have suggested. The Fed still plans to buy up to $200 billion in debt issued by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. Mortgage rates were expected to rise throughout the fall and winter as the Fed wound down its program to buy the mortgage-related securities. Even if they inch up, now they\'re less likely to increase as sharply, given the Fed\'s longer time horizon that stretches to March. ""The Fed wanted to exit with as little disruption as possible to the market,"" says Peter Hooper, chief economist at Deutsche Bank Securities. ""Doubling the length of time you\'re going to make the purchases allows for a pretty smooth transition."" --- Ruth Simon, E.S. Browning and Conor Dougherty contributed to this article.

79,,2009-09-24 00:00:00,"['The dollar managed to gain against the euro, recovering from a slide to a 12-month low against the common currency in a knee-jerk reaction to the Federal Reserve\'s interest-rate decision. The euro briefly spiked higher after the Federal Open Market Committee announced it wouldn\'t change ultralow interest rates, but painted a somewhat rosier picture of the U.S. economy in the accompanying statement. U.S. stocks initially rallied on the Fed statement, pulling the euro along to a 12-month high at $1.4845 before reversing those gains as stocks fell back in late trading. Late in New York, the euro was at $1.4743 from $1.4800 late Tuesday. The dollar was at 91.31 Japanese yen from 91.20 yen. The euro was at 134.61 yen from 134.97 yen. The pound was at $1.6357 from $1.6371, while the dollar was at 1.0264 Swiss francs from 1.0233 francs. By pledging to keep interest rates low for an extended period, the Fed sustained the dollar\'s use as a currency to fund bets on higher-yielding assets, or the ""carry trade,"" said Tom Fitzpatrick, global head of currency strategy at Citigroup in New York. ""They\'ve reiterated that rates will be exceptionally low for an extended period,"" he said, supporting the very reason the market was short dollars going into the meeting. At the same time, the Fed offered some support of those riskier assets by indicating there are signs the U.S. economy is improving, Mr. Fitzpatrick said. The euro could top out around $1.50, said Win Thin, senior currency strategist at Brown Brothers Harriman in New York. Because the U.S. economy is likely improving at a faster tick than the euro-zone economy, economic fundamentals don\'t support the euro going much higher, he said. Meanwhile, the ruble hit a nine-month high against the dollar as the Russian currency, almost written off by investors at the start of the year, appeared ripe for the carry trade. The ruble pushed through the psychologically important level of 30 rubles to the dollar for the first time since January, strengthening to 29.9586 before slipping back for a New York finish of 30.021. A nascent Russian economic revival is luring cash into local stocks and bonds and easing concerns the government will flood the foreign-exchange market by increasing spending. Elsewhere, the Norwegian central bank left its key rate unchanged at 1.25% Wednesday, as expected, but said it considered raising rates as an alternative. The expectation that Norges Bank would be one of the first central banks to begin raising interest rates has been a factor in keeping the krone strong, analysts said. --- Andrew Langley contributed to this article.

Vanguard has filed with regulators for Vanguard FTSE All-World ex-U.S. Small-Cap Index Fund, which it says is the first mutual fund to track an index of international small-capitalization stocks. The firm will also launch an exchange-traded fund based on the index. Both funds are expected to be introduced early next year. ""From a diversification point of view, it makes sense to have to this exposure,"" said Duane Kelly, co-manager of the new fund. The index will comprise more than 3,300 stocks of companies in 47 countries. The fund will approximate, rather than replicate, the index, Mr. Kelly said, by holding between 1,000 and 1,500 stocks from both developed and emerging markets countries. International-stock funds have been badly hit by both poor performance and heavy redemptions. International funds are down 46.5% so far this year, according to research firm Lipper Inc., and saw net outflows of $22.5 billion through Nov. 30 -- about 2.5% of the category\'s total assets at the start of the year. Small-cap international funds have fared even worse, down 51.9% and suffering $2.5 billion of net outflows, or about 5% of assets, said Lipper. But despite the poor recent results, Mr. Kelly is unconcerned. ""This [fund launch] has been in the works for a while,"" he said. ""Timing isn\'t a factor -- people want access to this asset class."" The fact that the market is down may also work in the fund\'s favor in the eyes of investors. ""I\'d be more concerned about them coming out with a fund like this a year or two ago,"" said Dan Culloton, senior fund analyst at investment researcher Morningstar Inc. ""Then it would have seemed like a crass attempt to gather assets in a hot area."" Mr. Culloton said that while many investors are scared by international stocks right now, ""over the long term it makes sense to have exposure"" to the area. What\'s more, he said, ""this could be a contrarian time to invest in a fund like this."" There aren\'t many options for investors looking for small-cap international index funds. Those available, notably Vanguard International Explorer (VINEX), Oakmark International Small Cap (OAKEX) and Dimensional Fund Advisors\' International Small Company Portfolio (DFISX), are all actively managed, Mr. Culloton said. This year, those funds are down 49.5%, 50% and 46.2%, respectively. The only index-linked offering that has the broad, go-anywhere approach of the Vanguard fund is SPDR S&P International Small Cap ETF (GWX), Mr. Culloton said. ""The hardcore Vanguard investors have been asking for this fund,"" said Mr. Culloton. ""It fills a hole in their lineup."" Rate Cut to Pressure Money-Market Fees The Federal Reserve\'s move to cut a key lending rate to a record-low range will likely put pressure on the fees that money-market mutual funds charge and could force some smaller players to reconsider their money-fund businesses. The Federal Open Market Committee voted Tuesday to cut the target fed-funds rate for interbank lending to a range of zero to 0.25%, the lowest since the Fed started publishing the funds target in 1990, from 1%. Connie Bugbee, managing editor at iMoneyNet, which tracks money-market funds, noted that some money funds that invest in Treasurys have already had to lower their fees. As money has poured into these funds, yields on government debt have fallen dramatically and some funds have barred new investors or waived a portion of their fees so that their expenses don\'t outweigh their income. In fact, Vanguard said Tuesday that it will not open new accounts or accept additional investments in its Vanguard Treasury Money Market and Admiral Treasury Money Market funds from financial advisers, intermediaries or institutions, though existing clients may continue to invest. -- Daisy Maxey License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service']",New Index Fund: Small and Foreign --- Is Vanguard's Offering Novel or Mistimed?,2008-12-16,The Wall Street Journal

The decision from the Federal Open Market Committee fueled a jump in big financial companies, including J.P. Morgan Chase, Citigroup and Goldman Sachs Group, while also driving gains for consumer companies as traders bet that the possible stimulus for banks could find its way into other areas of the economy. The Fed voted to reduce the fed-funds rate from 1% to a range of zero to 0.25%, the lowest since the Fed started publishing the fed-funds target in 1990. The Fed also said it will keep rates ""exceptionally low"" for some time during a period of waning price pressures. ""This will ensure corporate debt and corporate properties won\'t go the same way residential went,"" said Kent Engelke, chief economic strategist at Capitol Securities Management. ""The big movers will be big banks, and that comes from confidence this action will put a stake in the heart of the credit crisis,"" he said. J.P. Morgan closed up $3.72, or 13%, to $32.35, while Citigroup rose 83 cents, or 11%, to 8.23. Goldman Sachs also helped pace the gains for banks, closing up 9.54, or 14%, to 76. Although the bank swung to a fiscal fourth-quarter net loss on broad market declines that hurt investments and trading, its operating business beat expectations, analysts said. Morgan Stanley, set to report its quarterly results Wednesday, rose 2.49, or 18%, to 16.13. Consumer names rallied alongside the banking sector. Helping the gains was a report that U.S. consumer prices posted a second consecutive record decline last month, helping consumers\' purchasing power. Among the gainers was Best Buy, up 4.21, or 18%, to 27.68. The gains came as the U.S.\'s largest consumer-electronics chain became the latest retailer to cut planned store openings and capital expenditures in response to sliding consumer spending after posting a fiscal third-quarter net income drop of 77%. Also helping pace the market\'s gains was a surge by insurers, with some of the more beaten-down names in 2008 leading the pack. Hartford Financial Services Group rose 3.31, or 24%, to 17.28. General Electric rose 97 cents, or 5.7%, to 17.92, after it shelved plans to sell its consumer and industrial unit and dropped quarterly earnings projections as it provided its 2009 outlook. The conglomerate also forecast higher margins next year despite a potential drop in group revenue as it shrinks its financial-services business. On the deals front, Satyam Computer Services, India\'s fourth-largest software exporter by revenue, said it board approved acquisitions of infrastructure-development companies Maytas Infra and Maytas Properties in a move to ""derisk"" its core business of software services for a total cost of $1.6 billion.

The Federal Open Market Committee\'s acknowledgment that the economy is picking up steam partly overshadowed its commitment to keep interest rates near zero ""for an extended period"" in its post-meeting statement. As the FOMC decision and statement were largely in line with market expectations, the dollar\'s rebound was limited and it failed to climb above 90 yen or push the euro below $1.45. ""The Fed was a little more upbeat on the economy than anticipated,"" said Andrew Wilkinson, senior market analyst at Interactive Brokers in Greenwich, Conn. By recognizing the improvement of the labor market, the FOMC did ""tell us that we are a step closer to monetary tightening,"" he said. Late Wednesday, the euro was at $1.4534 from $1.4536 late Tuesday. The dollar was at 89.79 yen from 89.63, while the euro was at 130.50 yen from 130.30. The pound was at $1.6340 from $1.6266.

The FOMC\'s decision came on the heels of interest-rate increases by central banks in Europe, including a surprising hike by Norway, which reinforced investors\' expectation that as the global economy emerges from its worst recession in decades, policy makers will begin to exit some of the stimulus programs that pumped extra liquidity into the markets. Higher-Yield Demand ""We saw the ECB already winding down those liquidity operations, so overall it appears that the Fed is starting to move down the same path,"" said Vassili Serebriakov, foreign-exchange strategist at Wells Fargo in New York, referring to the FOMC\'s statement, which said, among other decisions, that it is working to close temporary liquidity swap arrangements by Feb. 1. Demand for higher-yielding currencies dictated most of the trading session ahead of the FOMC statement, with the euro climbing as far as $1.4591 on the back of economic data Wednesday that showed inflation has returned to the euro zone, as well as an improvement in manufacturing and services activity in the area. Greece\'s Downgrade Greece\'s credit-rating downgrade by Standard &Poor\'s to BBB+ from A- did little to dent support for the euro ahead of the FOMC\'s decision as the downgrade ""was widely expected,"" said Jacob Oubina, currency strategist at Forex.com in Bedminster, N.J. ""The initial put on negative [CreditWatch] earlier last week had more of an impact on the euro than when S&P actually cut the rating,"" he said. The lack of surprises in U.S. consumer inflation and housing starts in November also failed to change investor sentiment. November U.S. housing starts rose 8.9% to a 574,000 annual rate, while U.S. consumer inflation rose 0.4% in November, the Labor Department said Wednesday. That compares with an increase of 0.3% in October. However, one typical beneficiary of better risk appetite, the Australian dollar, was the biggest underperformer among major currencies, dropping 0.6% to $0.9002, after the country\'s third-quarter gross domestic product showed 0.5% growth, much less than the 1.2% implied by the Reserve Bank of Australia\'s own forecast. To make matters worse, RBA deputy governor Ric Battelino suggested that the central bank mightn\'t need to increase rates again in February as many had expected. Meanwhile, the Norwegian krone jumped higher against the euro and dollar after Norway\'s central bank delivered a surprise increase in its benchmark interest rate to 1.75% from 1.5%.

83,,2006-10-26 00:00:00,"['WASHINGTON -- The Federal Reserve held short-term interest rates steady for its third consecutive meeting as it continued to bet on a moderation of both inflation and economic growth. Even as it left rates at 5.25% yesterday, the Fed again warned that it is worried about inflation. Since Ben Bernanke became Fed chairman in February, he has faced, first, the threat of rising inflation and then a housing-led economic slowdown. The latest data, and the statement released by the Fed after its meeting yesterday, suggest that the central bank sees the risks on both sides diminishing. That makes it less likely that rates will change in either direction in coming months. Both the rate action and statement were largely expected. Bond prices rallied and bond yields, which move in the opposite direction to prices, fell, apparently because investors had expected more hints of a possible rate increase. Futures markets\' expectations of Fed actions have swung sharply in the past month, from betting on several rate cuts starting as soon as December to seeing a small probability that the Fed might raise rates. In its statement, the Fed said growth has slowed in part because of a ""cooling"" housing market. ""Going forward, the economy seems likely to expand at a moderate pace,"" it said, a notable addition to its statement released after last month\'s meeting. Core inflation, which excludes food and energy, remains ""elevated"" but inflation pressures are likely to moderate thanks to lower energy prices, ""contained"" inflation expectations, and the impact of previous rate increases, the Fed said. ""Some inflation risks remain,"" the Fed said, but whether rates would rise again depends on the outlook and ""incoming information."" For the third straight meeting, Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond President Jeffrey Lacker cast the lone dissent among the 11 voting members of the Federal Open Market Committee. He argued in favor of a quarter-percentage point rate increase in the target federal-funds rate, charged on overnight loans between banks. (One voting seat is empty and seven other members don\'t vote.) Mr. Bernanke has faced shifting challenges since taking office. Core inflation has risen to 2.9% from 2.1%, the highest level in a decade. Although inflation by the Fed\'s preferred price index is lower, it, too, is above the 2% level many Fed officials have said they are comfortable with. That led the Fed to raise rates at its first three meetings under Mr. Bernanke. Then later economic growth, under the weight of falling home and automobile sales, began to slow, to an estimated annual rate of about 2% in the third quarter. That would be the second-lowest level since 2003. The official growth figure will be reported tomorrow. In recent weeks, though, both inflation and growth worries have eased. Energy prices have plunged, and the Fed expects the indirect impact of that drop to pull down core inflation in the coming year or so. Yesterday\'s Fed statement dropped a reference from the previous month to energy and commodity prices as a source of inflation pressure. There is little sign the economy outside housing and cars has slowed much. Some economists said the housing market has shown tentative signs of hitting bottom. Yesterday, the National Association of Realtors said existing-home sales fell 2% in September to an annual rate of 6.18 million, from August. The inventory of existing homes remained at about 7.3 months of sales for the third consecutive month. ""We might be having what some colleagues have described as a false landing rather than soft landing,"" said Carl Tannenbaum, chief economist at LaSalle Bank. He said growth could rebound to 3% in the current quarter as the housing correction ends and consumers benefit from a 25% to 40% drop in gasoline prices. ""The Fed must ask itself: Did things slow down long enough and far enough to reduce pressure on capacity? I think the next move [on rates] is probably up."" Rajeev Dhawan, director of the Economic Forecasting Center at Georgia State University, predicted the Fed would cut rates by January. With long-term rates well below short-term rates -- a relationship that in the past has foreshadowed recession -- ""the risk factors are too high,"" he said. The shifting momentum of growth from strong to weak and back to moderate reflects the remarkable stability the U.S. economy now enjoys, said John Makin, a scholar at the American Enterprise Institute. ""As has often been the case over the past five years, the slowdown itself has set into motion market adjustments that may mitigate or even reverse it,"" he wrote in a report. For example, the Fed\'s decision to pause as the housing market weakened led investors to drive down long-term rates on bonds and mortgages. That, with a lag, has helped put a floor under housing. Online lender Quicken Loans Inc.\'s pipeline of mortgage applications has grown 20% to 25% since rates began to ease in late June, said the company\'s chief economist, Bob Walters. The increase has been driven mostly by refinancing applications, while the number of applications for new-home purchases remains steady. ""Whether we\'ve seen the bottom or not, remains to be seen,"" he said. --- Online Today: Pimco bond fund manager Bill Gross discusses where rates may be headed next, at WSJ.com/Video.

85,,2007-02-01 00:00:00,"['Cold weather continued to lift crude-oil prices yesterday in New York, helping them steam to a four-week high after government data showed distillate inventories, which include heating oil, fell more than expected. The prospect of fresh Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries production cuts, due to start today, supported prices, as did a Federal Open Market Committee statement that was more upbeat on expansion and inflation than the previous statement. Heating-oil prices led crude higher for most of the session as the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration continued to forecast below-normal temperatures in the Northeast into mid-February. Winter came late to the region, which is the source of 80% of the nation\'s heating-oil use, and an extended cold snap is helping pare early January crude- and heating-oil losses because of low demand for the fuel. The front-month March light, sweet crude contract on the New York Mercantile Exchange rose $1.17, or 2.1%, to $58.14 a barrel, crude\'s highest settlement since Jan. 3, which was the first trading day of the year. ""People are still focusing on distillates and looking ahead to next week, when there will likely be an even-bigger drop,"" said Phil Flynn, an analyst at Alaron Trading Corp. in Chicago. ""The funds sold in early January thinking winter would never start, and now we\'re starting to see a psychological change"" as forecasts for colder temperatures continue, he said. Prices rose after the U.S. Energy Information Administration said distillate stockpiles, which include both heating oil and diesel, fell by 2.6 million barrels last week. Demand for the fuel jumped 11% from a week earlier to the highest since prewinter gains recorded Oct. 27. OPEC is due today to add 500,000 barrels a day of crude-oil production cuts to 1.2 million barrels a day it was supposed to have cut from November 2006. While most analysts and tanker trackers believe the cartel has fallen well short of its first cut, Saudi Arabia added support to prices this week when it said it will cut 158,000 barrels a day starting today. In other commodity markets: COPPER: Prices on the Comex division of the Nymex rallied as gains in precious metals and energy, along with a weak dollar and mine-labor issues, lifted the metal.

86,,2003-08-13 00:00:00,"['NEW YORK -- The dollar ended North American trading higher against most of its major counterparts, remaining bound to recent narrow ranges before and after a closely watched statement on the economy from the Federal Reserve. The decision by the policy-setting Federal Open Market Committee to hold short-term interest rates at a 45-year low of 1% had been widely expected, with analysts focusing instead on the language of the statement accompanying the decision. Saying that ""the evidence accumulated over the intermeeting period shows that spending is firming although labor-market indicators are mixed,"" the Fed gave notice it would keep interest rates low for a ""considerable period."" Following recent U.S. economic data that some market participants viewed as grounds for cautious optimism of a U.S. economic recovery, analysts found little in the Fed statement to warrant a significant readjustment of currency positions. ""The Fed offered no surprises,"" said Ram Bhagavataula, senior economist with Royal Bank of Scotland in New York. ""Even though bond markets have become considerably more anxious, the Fed is telling the same story, which is disinflation, so accommodative policy can be maintained for a considerable period. Their policy hasn\'t changed one bit."" After some knee-jerk buying and selling immediately after the Fed\'s announcement, the dollar returned to pre-FOMC levels, exiting from New York trading at the upper end of the day\'s ranges. ""The currency markets are just chopping around in the ranges we\'ve been in for the past few weeks,"" said Tim Mazanec, senior currency strategist with Investors Bank &Trust in Boston. Analysts will likely watch retail-sales and business-inventories numbers due today for any signs of continued improvement in the U.S. economy. Late yesterday, the euro was trading at $1.1295, off session lows of $1.1282 from early in New York, but down from $1.1361 late Monday. The dollar was at 118.69 yen, virtually unchanged from 118.67 yen late Monday. Against the Swiss franc, the dollar was buying 1.3691 francs, up from 1.3581 francs, while sterling was changing hands at $1.6029, down from $1.6094 late Monday. The European currency seemed to fail to draw much strength from reports that French industrial production proved stronger than expected, rising 1.2% in June after falling a revised 1.3% in May, and by other figures showing that French inflation remained steady over the past two months, at 1.9% in July. Though the yen\'s recent strength would appear to be bolstered by data showing the Japanese economy grew 0.6% in the second quarter of this year, well above the expected rise of 0.2%, many analysts said potential intervention by the Bank of Japan on behalf of Japan\'s Ministry of Finance -- which has repeatedly intervened to weaken the Japanese currency against the dollar -- will continue to put brakes on any appreciable yen gains. Elsewhere, Brazil\'s real softened against the dollar somewhat, as dollar-buying by importers moved an illiquid market. The dollar traded at 3.025 reals late yesterday, compared with Monday\'s 3.005-real close. Argentina\'s peso climbed for a second day against the U.S. currency, as investors bought pesos on rising expectations that the country will reach an agreement with the International Monetary Fund for a new financial aid agreement.

87,,2000-06-29 00:00:00,"[""NEW YORK -- Volatility declined sharply in the options market in reaction to the Federal Open Market Committee's decision to leave interest rates unchanged.    The Chicago Board Options Exchange's Market Volatility Index, or VIX, which measures certain Standard & Poor's 100 option prices to determine investor sentiment, declined 1.30 to 23.52.    When the index declines, it often indicates that traders are optimistic about the stock market, but many options traders refrained from making any major commitments ahead of the coming short week because options lose a little bit of their value each day. The financial markets close early Monday and all day Tuesday in observance of Independence Day.    As expected, the Fed kept its target overnight bank lending rate, or fed-funds rate, at 6.5%. The committee, however, indicated that it may raise rates again to control inflation. Many people on Wall Street expect the Fed will raise interest rates at its next meeting.    The CBOE's equity put/call ratio was 0.40. The ratio is a contrarian sentiment indicator that holds that the smart approach to the market is to do the opposite of the crowd. If everyone is bullish, a contrarian trader is bearish on the assumption that the crowd is always wrong. The ratio is considered bullish above 0.75; neutral from 0.40 to 0.75 and bearish below 0.40.    The CBOE's index put/call ratio was 0.87, but the reading may not be accurate because index-trading volume was low. The ratio, also a contrarian sentiment indicator, is considered bullish above 1.5, neutral from 0.75 to 1.5 and bearish if it is below 0.75. Elsewhere in the market, a trader apparently sold a sizable position in EMC Corp. after CIBC Oppenheimer initiated coverage of the technology company with a buy rating. With the stock up, the July 80 calls gained 7/16 to 2 1/8 on CBOE volume of 6,807 contracts, compared with composite open interest of 14,089 contracts. The majority of the volume was executed on the bid, which generally indicates that a position is being sold.

89,,2009-03-19 00:00:00,"['Gold futures staged an about-face to move higher in thinly traded after-hours screen trading after a surprise statement from the Federal Open Market Committee that pressured the dollar and rekindled longer-term inflation concerns. Gold had settled lower in the open-outcry session, with nearby March gold futures down $27.70 to $888.70 an ounce on the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange. The most-active April contract fell $27.70 to $889.10. The weakness was triggered by an abatement of recent flight-to-safety buying as financial stocks kept improving and by sell stops, preplaced orders triggered when certain chart points are hit. But in electronic trading two hours after gold\'s official close, the April contract had reversed and traded at $940.10, a rise of 5.7% from the session\'s close. The catalyst was steps announced by the Fed in its efforts to revive the economy, including plans to buy long-term Treasurys and more mortgage-backed securities. ""The dollar is getting whacked,"" said Frank Lesh, broker and futures analyst with FuturePath Trading. ""It\'s the fact they\'re going to buy Treasurys. That\'s a surprise to everybody."" Investors often buy gold as a hedge against dollar weakness. Investors also buy gold as an inflation hedge, and that also came into play, said Andrew Montano, director of precious metals at Scotia Mocatta. The market perceived the Fed announcement as a ""massive expansion"" of the Fed\'s balance sheet and a rise in the money supply, he said, adding, ""Inflation worries would be the primary issue."" This prompted heavy buying in gold, with buy stops triggered, he said. George Gero, vice president at RBC Capital Markets Global Futures, also cited short covering, in which traders buy to offset positions in which they previously went short, or sold, the metal. Gold\'s sharp turn around in after-hours trading could make it ripe for a pull back. ""You might need some consolidation,"" said Stephen Platt, analyst with Archer Financial Services. But gold support is coming on expectations of a weaker dollar as the Fed is ""trying to pump as much money into the system"" as it can, Mr. Platt said. ""You would think it would be inflationary."" The gold decline during the regular-hours session was the largest one-day dollar and percentage drop since Jan. 12, and the lowest settlement since Jan. 28. It put gold prices down 11.4% from the exchange-record close of $1,003.20 hit on March 18, 2008. Comex silver for March delivery fell 73.5 cents per troy ounce, or 5.79% to $11.950, down for the third straight session and 9.7% over the past three sessions.

Light, sweet crude for April delivery fell $1.02, or 2.1%, to $48.14 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange. NATURAL GAS: Prices fell to the lowest in over six years, since Sept. 25, 2002, dragged down by slumping oil prices amid ample gas supplies, weak demand and mild temperatures.

90,,1995-08-23 00:00:00,"['WASHINGTON -- Federal Reserve officials left U.S. short-term interest rates unchanged, while separately an unexpected contraction in the German money supply increased speculation that the Bundesbank will cut rates soon. The decision by members of the Fed\'s Open Market Committee, who met yesterday to map out near-term policy, had been widely anticipated in financial markets and came six weeks after the Fed reversed course and pushed down rates by one-quarter percentage point in response to a weakening economy and abating inflationary pressures. The latest decision leaves the target for the important federal-funds  rate, at which banks lend to each other overnight, at 5.75%. Further reductions in interest rates later this year remain a strong possibility and could come as soon as the Fed\'s Sept. 26 meeting. Any move depends on incoming economic data about the pace of growth, the inflation outlook and congressional progress toward reducing the federal deficit. The economy\'s surprisingly swift rebound from its spring-time slump has relieved pressure on the Fed to cut rates to avoid recession and has led some Fed officials to conclude that they need to keep the central bank\'s foot on the brake. By holding short-term interest rates somewhere between 2.75 and 3 percentage points above the inflation rate, the Fed is restraining the economy, economists figure. ""Real [or inflation-adjusted] interest rates remain high at levels historically consistent with slow growth or recession,"" complains Lawrence Chimerine, economist at the Economic Strategy Institute in Washington, a liberal think tank that is calling for further rate cuts. ""They are restrictive, but they need to be,"" counters Michael Moran, economist at Daiwa Securities Inc. in New York. Inflation remains a threat, he says, unless the unemployment rate climbs slightly from current levels. ""If you consider only the economy, we shouldn\'t expect the Fed to ease again [this year]. There\'s one condition that could lead the Fed to ease again: If Congress puts together a credible deficit package and passes it."" But other economists say the receding inflation threat means inflation-adjusted interest rates are too high, and they specu late that the central bank will be looking for an opportunity to bring them down. ""There\'s no urgency here,"" says St. Louis forecaster Laurence Meyer. ""They might say we\'d like to move rates down a little bit."" The latest weekly survey of 16 Fed watchers by his firm, Laurence H. Meyer & Associates, found 10 who anticipate a further cut in interest rates at or before the Sept. 26 meeting of Fed policy makers. Although Mr. Meyer himself predicts a 1/4-percentage-point cut in rates in September, he isn\'t very confident of that. ""The good news is we don\'t have to worry about recession. The bad news is that we\'re coming back to trend [economic] growth, perhaps too quickly,"" and that may make the inflationary-wary Fed reluctant to lower interest rates. As is its current practice when it leaves rates alone, the Fed\'s spokesman said yesterday only that the meeting of its policy-making FOMC ended after 3 1/2 hours at 12:25 p.m. Details of the central bank\'s deliberations and the vote of the current members of the committee won\'t be released until late September. Financial markets didn\'t respond much to word that the Fed was leaving interest rates unchanged. The yield on 10-year Treasury notes was at 6.56% late yesterday, up from 6.52 the day before. But the dollar rallied earlier in the day on prospects for lower interest rates in Germany.   Late yesterday, the dollar was quoted at 1.4860 marks, up from 1.4765, and 96.85 yen, down from 96.90. In Germany, the Bundesbank\'s policy-setting Central Bank Council gathers tomorrow for its fort-nightly meeting. ""If all the information is going in the right direction, I am not excluding some room for maneuver in reducing interest rates in the next time,"" Bundesbank President Hans Tietmeyer said in an interview, which was conducted in English, with a Japanese news agency. A transcript of the interview was obtained by Dow Jones wire services, and the Bundesbank confirmed the accuracy of the remarks. A Bundesbank spokesman stressed that Mr. Tietmeyer\'s use of the phrase ""in the next time"" didn\'t indicate any specific date, implying rather ""in the time ahead."" A German move to lower interest rates would be welcome in the U.S. It probably would be matched by other European countries, spurring economic growth in Europe and with it demand for U.S. exports. Moreover, a German rate cut would make German securities less attractive to global investors, thereby depressing the German mark and lifting the dollar. Boosting the dollar is currently a shared objective of the U.S., German and Japanese governments. The Bundesbank said its broadly defined M3 money supply contracted at a 0.4% annual rate in the first seven months of the year, suggesting a diminishing inflation threat as the German economy slows down. Although the Fed largely disregards money-supply data in its deliberations, the Bundesbank tracks them closely. Many market analysts, and even some Bundesbank officials, had been expecting a mild acceleration in money-supply growth. Growth in M3 has fallen short of the Bundesbank\'s 1995 target of 4% to 6%. The report comes amid a series of gloomy economic indicators, including a 3.5% plunge in inflation-adjusted manufacturing orders in June. ""The M3 figures give the Bundesbank a perfect excuse to sink interest rates -- if that\'s what they want to do,"" said Joachim Fels, an economist at Goldman, Sachs & Co. in Frankfurt. ""If they want to lower rates, it would be to help the real economy. The chance of this happening is bigger now, but it\'s still not certain."" With bad news piling up, many market economists consider a reduction in official Bundesbank interest rates to be imminent. Juergen Pfister, a Commerzbank AG economist in Frankfurt, forecasts a reduction in Germany\'s discount rate to 3.5% from the current 4% by the end of September. ""The inflation outlook is opportune and the economy has been very disappointing,"" Mr. Pfister said. ""Despite some statistical uncertainty, it\'s clear that the economy in the first half was very weak, perhaps little better than stagnation."" In the interim, perhaps this week, the Bundesbank is expected to shave a bit off the interest rate it charges on its 14-day securities-repurchase agreements, a key financing instrument for German money markets, Mr. Pfister said.']","Fed Leaves Interest Rates Unchanged --- Money Supply in Germany Shrinks, and Bundesbank Could Cut Rates Soon",1995-08-22,The Wall Street Journal
91,,2009-06-25 00:00:00,"['A bout of selling hit Treasurys after Federal Reserve policy makers refrained from increasing the size of the Fed\'s asset-purchase programs. Treasury prices had rallied earlier in the session as some investors bet the Fed would boost the size of its $300 billion Treasury-purchase program or alter the mixture of asset buying in favor of Treasurys against mortgage-backed securities. A well-bid $37 billion, five-year-note auction earlier in the afternoon also lent support to government securities. A gauge of demand for the five-year notes from a broad range of investors, including foreign central banks, reached a historical high. ""There was some disappointment in terms of the Treasury-purchases program,"" said James Caron, head of U.S. interest-rate strategy at Morgan Stanley in New York. Bonds are likely to be pressured as investors brace for a $27 billion, seven-year-note auction Thursday, the final leg of this week\'s record $104 billion note supply from the Treasury. The Fed also is set to conduct a round of Treasury buying on Thursday, targeting maturities between 17 years and 30 years. Late Wednesday afternoon in New York, the 10-year note was down 12/32 point, at 95 12/32, to yield 3.687%, up from 3.640% late Tuesday, as bond yields move inversely to prices. The two-year Treasury fell 2/32 point, raising its yield to 1.204%. The yield curve, the spread between the two-year and 10-year notes, flattened to 2.49 percentage points from 2.53 points late Tuesday and 2.58 points Monday. The Federal Reserve made few major changes in its policy statement after officials concluded their latest meeting on Wednesday. Policy makers acknowledged signs of stability in the economy and suggested that price pressure remained contained near term. The Federal Open Market Committee voted, 10-0, to maintain the federal-funds target rate for interbank lending at a range between zero and 0.25%. Fed policy makers reiterated that they are likely to keep the fed-funds target rate at low levels for an extended period, a blow to some traders and investors who had bet on a more-hawkish statement. ""The Fed is reminding the hyperventilating bond market that it needs to relax; inflation will be low for some time because the economic weakness will be with us for a time,"" said Chris Rupkey, chief financial economist at Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ Ltd., based in New York. Mr. Rupkey said Fed policy makers aren\'t about to start thinking about an exit strategy, which would mean raising rates, because the economy won\'t be back to normal for quite some time. Gary Pollack, who helps oversee $12 billion as head of fixed-income trading in New York at Deutsche Bank AG\'s private wealth-management unit, said that he was neutral on the market at this point and expected the 10-year Treasury note\'s yield to trade within the 3.5% to 4% range over the next couple of months. Mr. Pollack said he would be a buyer if the 10-year note\'s yield rises to 4% and would sell if the yield falls back to 3.5%. The Treasury\'s newly auctioned five-year note came in at a yield of 2.7%, compared with the 2.719% just before the auction. The lower yield suggests strong demand, a contrast to market expectations given that the auction came shortly before the FOMC statement. The bid-to-cover ratio was 2.58, the biggest since October 2007, compared with 2.32 for the previous auction in May and the average of 2.16 from the past 10 auctions. The indirect bid -- demand from domestic and foreign institutions, including foreign central banks -- for the five-year Treasury note was a record 62.8%, compared with 30.8% last month.

The lower the trigger rate, the longer the Fed can wait before pushing up interest rates in order to slow economic growth. The policy makers\' immediate problem is that the consensus on the trigger rate has broken down. In perhaps the last major statement of the old established view, the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City published a study in 1994 concluding that a jobless rate held below 6% would result in accelerating wage and price inflation. Few economists disagreed. The consensus rule worked well in the late 1980s. Unemployment fell below 6% in mid-1987, and labor costs began accelerating significantly in 1988. But the policy rule has failed recently. Joblessness has been well below 6% for nearly two years, yet labor costs have remained quiescent. In light of recent experience, nobody knows what the new trigger rate is. Around Washington, the most frequently heard guess is 5.5% -- simply because that is what unemployment has been hovering around since the end of 1994. But more substantial evidence is available. It can be found in the behavior of the Midwestern regional economy, as presented in the nearby chart. During the past two years, unemployment in the Midwest has averaged 4.5%. That is well below almost any expert guess at the trigger rate, yet growth in regional labor costs -- the lion\'s share of business costs, and so the biggest single warning sign of inflation -- has been contained. Interestingly, the table does provide some hint of cost acceleration so far this year. If so, it took a sustained period of 4.5% joblessness to trigger the acceleration. The regional evidence cannot be easily dismissed. The Midwest -- 12 states from North Dakota to Ohio, Wisconsin to Missouri -- is a huge, complex economy. Taken alone, it would be the fourth largest in the world. The 1990s have not seen substantial population inflows from other regions to relieve pressure from low unemployment. It is reasonable, therefore, to conclude that the Midwestern experience can help us understand how the U.S. economy has changed. The message from the Midwest is a substantial, not modest, shift in the unemployment-inflation relationship. Business leaders understand the magnitude of the continuing changes in the economy. For years they have argued to Washington policy makers that widespread cost rationalization (sometimes derided as ""downsizing"") and globalization have altered inflation dynamics, making the economy capable of faster growth and lower unemployment. However, many economists and policy makers are skeptical of business claims, reluctant to assign rationalization an important role in recent economic trends. Indeed, economists find it convenient to assume that the economy always operates close to its maximum efficiency, providing little room for sustained cost-cutting. In this debate, the economists are wrong; the business leaders are right. In ""The Price of Industrial Labor"" (D.C. Heath, 1985), I showed that labor cost inefficiencies accumulated in the 1970s and 1980s. Widespread rationalization today is working to reduce those inefficiencies, pushing costs closer to market realities in a variety of ways: tighter controls on perks (""nonwage benefits""), fewer lockstep salary increases within companies, outright elimination of higher-wage positions (frequently in middle management), a trend away from cost-of-living adjustments, and the replacement (at least in part) of annual wage increases with performance-based awards. The macroeconomic result of the concerted efforts to boost cost efficiency should not be surprising. A high trigger rate of unemployment results from widespread labor-market inefficiency. Europe today, with its chronic double-digit jobless rates, illustrates this point. The higher economic efficiency is, the lower unemployment can be without triggering wage and price inflation. Nor should it be surprising that the Midwest leads the nation in cost rationalization. The one-time Rust Belt, battered by low-cost imports and burdened by high joblessness, had to improve its economic efficiency sharply in order to survive. Once started, institutional shareholders have insisted that the revenue gains continue, making rationalization a continuing process. This process of cost rationalization has spread throughout the whole country, substantially altering the U.S. economy. It has reduced the trigger jobless rate, allowing the Midwest to sustain unemployment well below 5%. The consequences, however, do not stop with lower unemployment. Most notably, efforts to improve cost efficiency have helped push up corporate profits as a share of national income, reversing a two-decade decline. The effect has been dramatic. The four-year growth in inflation-adjusted earnings per share in the S&P 500 has reached a record high. That explains the robust stock market and suggests that equity prices will continue to rise as long as cost rationalization persists. If Washington doesn\'t mismanage the process -- by, for example, adopting any of the anti-downsizing nostrums being bruited around -- today\'s rationalization will provide the foundation for the best sustained performance of the U.S. economy since the 1960s. Like the `60s, this new golden age will be characterized by strong profits, low inflation, modest unemployment, rising financial-asset prices, rapid investment, robust productivity gains and a resumption in the growth of real wages and living standards. Books will be written, and read widely in Europe and Japan, on how to manage like the Americans. --- Mr. Annable is chief economist at First Chicago NBD Bank.']",No Need to Fear Lower Unemployment,1996-08-20,The Wall Street Journal
93,,2007-06-29 00:00:00,"['U.S. Treasury prices dropped as policy makers continued to stress inflation as their primary concern after leaving interest rates steady for the eighth straight meeting. Shorter-maturity issues were the hardest hit after the Federal Open Market Committee left rates at 5.25%, as expected, yet continued to stress worries over price pressures and pointed to an economy likely to continue to expand over the coming quarters. As a result, Treasury investors turned more downbeat on an ease in interest rates in the foreseeable future. The two-year note, the most sensitive to official interest-rate changes, was down 4/32 point to 99 28/32. Its yield rose to 4.950% from 4.879% Wednesday, as yields move inversely to prices. The benchmark 10-year note, the baseline for other types of debt, from fixed home loans to corporate bonds, fell 11/32 to 95 8/32 for a yield of 5.118%. ""The Fed looks hawkish,"" said John Canavan, market analyst at Stone &McCarthy, referring to policy makers\' view that the recent downtrend in price pressures has yet to be established in a convincing fashion. Mr. Canavan expects the two-year yield could head back up to 5% as investors take rate-cut bets off the table. That will flatten the yield curve -- the gap between short- and long-term yields, he added. Late in the session, short-term interest-rate futures contracts were showing 56% odds of a cut in interest rates to 5% by the first quarter of next year, compared with 80% odds before the Fed decision. The statement was ""more hawkish than I thought [it would be] -- it\'s out of left field,"" said Richard Gilhooly, interest-rate strategist at BNP Paribas in New York. ""It shows [the Fed is] running out of patience on inflation,"" he added. With policy makers so focused on inflation -- and barring a serious upset in the U.S. subprime markets -- Treasury yields look set to hover around or above the 5% mark as the summer continues. Drew Matus, economist at Lehman Brothers in New York, is among those who see an upside risk to Treasury yields from here. Mr. Matus said ""it doesn\'t make sense to me why"" the two-year yield ""is as low as it is"" at a time when the Fed looks as if it will stay on hold for a long while yet. And it isn\'t just the Fed stance that will pressure yields. Foreign central banks have recently seemed less eager to buy Treasurys -- another factor keeping yields on an upward path, particularly on the long end of the curve. The suspicion that market rates are unlikely to decline is also fueled by trends outside the U.S. Government-bond yields in Europe, the United Kingdom, Japan and elsewhere have recently hit multiyear highs lifted by stronger-than-expected growth and inflation pressures in many overseas economies as well. Indeed, several overseas central banks -- including those in the U.K. and Australia -- have had to resume increasing rates over the past 18 months, long after economists there thought the tightening cycle was over. Dollar General, CanWest Reconfigure Bond Deals Two high-yield bond deals stumbled, adding to a growing list of issues that have struggled to find buyers in the past week. Issuers accustomed to easily placing bonds and dictating pricing terms are suddenly encountering head winds from investors. Dollar General Corp. sold $1.9 billion of bonds. But it had to shuffle the deal to adjust to resistance to a $725 million tranche of PIK toggle notes -- which give issuers the option to make interest payments with more debt rather than cash. The underwriters handling the deal -- which included Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Citigroup Inc., Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. and Wachovia Corp. -- were forced to keep the PIK toggle notes themselves and plan to sell them to investors in a separate offering in the coming weeks. The other $1.175 billion of the deal had previously been split into $625 million in senior eight-year notes and $550 million in senior subordinated 10-year notes. It was combined into a single tranche of senior eight-year notes noncallable for four years and sold to yield 11%. The bonds, combined with a $2.43 billion loan, will fund the leveraged buyout of Dollar General by Kohlberg Kravis Roberts &Co. Separately, CanWest MediaWorks LP sold its junk-bond offering -- which had been downsized earlier in the day from $650 million to $400 million -- to yield 9.25% via Citibank and Bank of Nova Scotia, or Scotiabank, according to a person familiar with the matter. The maturity of the notes was also reduced to eight years from 10 years. Price guidance for the offering had been in the area of 9% to 9.25%. The deal will finance the company\'s transaction to go private. -- Michael Aneiro and Serena Ng License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service']",Treasurys Fall as Rates Hold --- Fed's Tough Stance On Inflation Leaves Investors Downcast,2007-06-28,The Wall Street Journal
94,,2007-06-29 00:00:00,"['WASHINGTON -- With the nation\'s underlying inflation falling, the Federal Reserve yesterday softened its hawkish inflation stance a bit while squelching any suggestion it might cut interest rates soon. The central bank, in the statement issued at the end of its two-day meeting, sidestepped the question of whether the current inflation rate is low enough. It emphasized that the outlook for inflation -- and not the latest inflation reading -- is now driving its interest-rate decisions. On that score, the Fed reiterated that its ""predominant policy concern remains the risk that inflation will fail to moderate as expected."" As widely expected, the Fed\'s policy-making Federal Open Market Committee left its short-term interest-rate target at 5.25%, where it has been for almost exactly a year. In the accompanying statement, it said, that ""readings on core inflation,"" which excludes food and energy, ""have improved modestly in recent months,"" a more optimistic assessment than at its last meeting, on May 9, when it said ""core inflation remains somewhat elevated."" But it added: ""Sustained moderation in inflation pressures has yet to be convincingly demonstrated. Moreover, the high level of resource utilization has the potential to sustain those pressures."" The statement appears to mean interest rates will remain unchanged for the foreseeable future. Rate cuts appear ruled out by inflation concerns and rate increases are less likely than before thanks to a recent rise in long-term interest rates and continued weakness in housing. Futures markets responded by slightly lowering the odds of an interest-rate cut by year end. Analysts took differing messages from the statement. Thomas Joseph Marta, a fixed-income strategist at RBC Capital Markets, called the statement ""tight lite,"" with the Fed moving more to a Goldilocks scenario: ""growth not too hot, not too cold, and inflation certainly better, but we\'ve got to keep an eye on it."" But others found the statement almost grudging in its acknowledgment of improved inflation. It ""maintains a firm inflation bias and is telling us that this will not change soon,"" Bruce Kasman, chief economist at J.P. Morgan Chase, said in a note to clients. By dropping its description of core inflation as ""elevated,"" the Fed implicitly acknowledged that, at least for some policy makers, the latest inflation rate is no longer undesirably high. Core inflation as measured by the Fed\'s preferred benchmark, the price index of personal-consumption expenditures, dropped to 2% in April from 2.4% in February. Revisions to first-quarter data released yesterday suggest the decline was less pronounced. The May core inflation, to be reported today, may remain at 2% rather than the 1.9% widely expected before yesterday\'s revisions were reported. Even so, that would be at the bottom of the 2% to 2.25% year-end range the FOMC projected in February, meaning inflation is easing ahead of schedule. The Fed doesn\'t have an inflation target. Some Fed officials say their ""comfort zone"" for inflation is 1% to 2% and see a number much above 1.5% as too high. Yet others may think 2% or slightly lower acceptable, noting that is the target chosen by many foreign central banks. The Fed\'s omission of ""elevated"" helps investors ""further pinpoint the higher end of"" Chairman Ben Bernanke\'s preferred range for inflation, argued Jim Bianco, president of Bianco Research, a Chicago financial-research firm. Still, with the FOMC in the midst of a lengthy debate on how to better communicate, yesterday\'s statement was less a wink at an implicit target and more an attempt to sidestep the issue altogether. More importantly, the Fed emphasized that it isn\'t enough for inflation to be low now, it must also remain low for the next few years. On that score, it still sees risks it could move higher. With unemployment hovering near a six-year low of 4.5%, policy makers suspect the economy has little, if any, spare capacity, and firms and workers might have greater than usual ability to raise prices and wages. Yesterday the Labor Department reported that initial claims for unemployment insurance fell 13,000 last week to 313,000, reversing three straight increases, suggesting the job market remains healthy. The Commerce Department yesterday also revised up its estimate of first-quarter growth to 0.7% at an annual rate from 0.6%, primarily due to higher exports than previously estimated. Economists generally expect growth to rebound to above 3% in the quarter now ending. Still, the likelihood of a Fed rate increase also appears to be receding. The run-up in Treasury bond yields, from below 4.7% in May to about 5.1% now, appears driven in part by growing risk aversion by investors previously willing to accept the same return on long-term as short-term bonds. That risk aversion is also evident in corporate debt markets and will likely restrain growth, and housing in particular. Demand for housing also appears to still be falling, posing a continuing risk to the economy.

95,,2007-06-29 00:00:00,"['NEW YORK -- The dollar rebounded from a three-day rally in the yen after the Federal Reserve offered reassuring words on the U.S. economy, which calmed the frayed nerves of yen-funded carry-trade investors. The dollar had already started to reverse the three-day yen rally before the Federal Open Market Committee meeting ended, amid market expectations that the FOMC wouldn\'t make comments that could roil the markets. The FOMC didn\'t disappoint. It left rates on hold at 5.25% for the eighth straight time and continued to say it expects the U.S. economy to see ""moderate"" growth over the next few months. That further eased recent worries among carry-trade investors, who borrow yen at low interest rates to buy higher-yielding currencies such as the dollar, that U.S. subprime mortgage sector problems could spill into the broader U.S. or global economies. ""The fear was that the Fed may be a bit dovish"" on U.S. growth and inflation worries, said Matthew Strauss, senior currency strategist at RBC Capital Markets. ""If they were, that may have reignited recent fears amongst carry-trade investors."" In New York late yesterday, the dollar was at 123.21 yen from 122.65 yen, while the euro was at $1.3438 from $1.3449. The euro was at 165.57 yen compared with 164.96 yen. The dollar was at 1.2318 Swiss Francs from 1.2291, while the British pound traded at $2.0016 from $1.9989.

96,,2007-12-12 00:00:00,"['WASHINGTON -- With a deepening credit crunch threatening to drag the stalled U.S. economy into recession, the Federal Reserve cut interest rates for the third time since August, and left the door open to further cuts. But yesterday\'s moves, at the low end of Wall Street\'s hopes, disappointed investors, who had looked to the Fed to do more to thaw frozen credit markets. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell sharply, undoing about a third of the run-up in stocks triggered in late November when top Fed officials first publicly signaled that another rate cut was likely. The blue-chip average ended the day at 13432.77, down 294.26 points, or 2.1%. The Fed lowered its target for the federal-funds rate, charged on overnight loans between banks, by a quarter percentage point to 4.25%. It also cut the discount rate, at which it lends directly to banks, by the same amount, to 4.75%. Fed officials, however, continue to consider ways of using various tools -- including the discount rate -- to combat banks\' unwillingness to lend even to each other, which they view as a threat to economic growth. The central bank could take action within days. A variety of steps, widely discussed in the markets, are likely to be on the table, including another cut in the discount rate, longer-term loans to money-market dealers, easier collateral rules for loans from the Fed, and other steps last taken in 1999 to alleviate funding pressures ahead of the year 2000, when many feared a ""Y2K"" computer bug would disrupt markets and create economic havoc. Changes in the discount rate can be made by the Fed board in Washington without the approval of the entire 17-member policy-making Federal Open Market Committee, which sets the federal-funds rate target. Some on Wall Street yesterday criticized the Fed\'s actions so far as inadequate. ""From talking to clients and traders, there is in their view no question the Fed has fallen way behind the curve,"" said David Greenlaw, economist at Morgan Stanley. ""There\'s a growing sense the Fed doesn\'t get it."" Markets believe a weakening economy will force the Fed to cut rates even more than they expected before yesterday, Mr. Greenlaw said. Futures markets anticipate another cut in January and a federal-funds rate of 3.25% by next fall. In its statement yesterday, the Fed said that its quarter-point rate cut, which pushed the federal-funds rate a full percentage point below where it stood in early August, ""should help promote moderate growth over time."" In October, the central bank said the risks of weaker growth and of higher inflation were roughly balanced, signaling it didn\'t expect to cut rates again. Yesterday, the Fed declined to give an explicit indication of its next move. It said it will assess financial and other developments and ""act as needed."" The Fed\'s language left its options open for its next meeting in late January. The FOMC\'s 10 voting members approved the rate cut 9-1. Federal Reserve Bank of Boston President Eric Rosengren dissented in favor of a sharper, half-point cut. One FOMC member also dissented in October, but in favor of no rate cut. The shift in the dissents, from wanting less rate cutting to wanting more, shows the turn toward pessimism at the Fed. ""Economic growth is slowing, reflecting the intensification of the housing correction and some softening in business and consumer spending,"" the Fed said yesterday. ""Moreover, strains in financial markets have increased in recent weeks."" Unlike the previous two rate cuts, yesterday\'s wasn\'t portrayed as ""insurance"" against improbable but potentially damaging economic scenarios. That suggests Fed officials view the economy as weaker than they expected as recently as late October. Corporate executives are also signaling a more downbeat outlook. ""I\'m not going to put a happy face on this. Consumers are going to be a challenge in 2008,"" General Electric Co. Chief Executive Jeffrey Immelt told investors yesterday. But global growth is ""as strong as ever,"" he added. When Fed policy makers met in late October, financial markets were in better shape than they had been in August, and the economy had just posted a strong third-quarter performance. They chose to cut rates by a quarter point and concluded that would likely be enough. But in subsequent weeks, markets reversed course as big losses tied to soured mortgage-related investments cut into the capital of major banks and other financial institutions, limiting their ability to lend. Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke and Vice Chairman Donald Kohn signaled their increased concern in speeches in late November, foreshadowing yesterday\'s rate cut. Even so, investors, who have persistently had a gloomier outlook than the Fed, were disappointed the Fed didn\'t cut rates more or signal greater willingness to do so. ""Well, the boys blew it again. You wonder which economy they are looking at and what it is they are thinking about,"" said Alfred Kugel, Chicago-based chief investment strategist for investment-management firm Atlantic Trust of Atlanta. Bond prices shot up yesterday and yields, which move in the opposite direction, fell sharply. The 10-year Treasury note\'s yield dropped to 3.97% from 4.1% just before the announcement, while the two-year note\'s yield, which is especially sensitive to expectations of Fed action, fell to 2.92% from 3.13%. Yields on corporate bonds rose relative to Treasurys. Major banks, meanwhile, lowered their prime lending rates, the benchmark for many consumer and business loan rates, to 7.25% from 7.5%. The Fed has found it especially difficult to discern the economy\'s path and thus the right level for rates because the main threat facing the economy is the reluctance of banks and investors to lend to home buyers, businesses and consumers. That\'s harder to measure than the things that usually drive the business cycle -- such as profits, inventories, employment and the Fed\'s own interest-rate actions. Brian Sack, an economist at Macroeconomic Advisers LLC, said that in 2001 the major shock to the economy was the stock market. ""We have a better shot at trying to calibrate those wealth effects, whereas the credit turmoil has many dimensions to it. Frankly it\'s hard to assess how much economic restraint you get from those various dimensions."" In the past month, data on the so-called real economy have been soft but not dramatically so. Macroeconomic Advisers said yesterday it now expects the economy to shrink marginally during the current quarter, then grow at a 1.8% annual rate in the first quarter of 2008. On the other hand, credit markets have tightened sharply. Since Oct. 31, the yields on securities backed by auto loans have jumped to 6.3% from 5.4%, while yields on securities backed by home-equity loans have jumped to 7.7% from 6.6%, according to J.P. Morgan Chase &Co. Rates on ""jumbo"" mortgages -- those larger than $417,000 -- are around 6.9%, up from 6.6%. The London interbank offered rate, the rate banks charge each other for three-month loans in the offshore market -- is a full percentage point above the expected federal-funds rate; it is typically less than a tenth of a point higher. There isn\'t yet evidence these higher rates have significantly bit into consumer spending, outside of housing, and the rates could drop after year-end funding pressures ease. But investors generally don\'t expect that to happen. A survey by Macroeconomic Advisers of 55 clients, mostly hedge funds and other sophisticated investors, found most expect little retracement of the wide spreads between yields on risky debt and Treasury yields by next year, and most expect banks to curtail lending. ""The possibility of a widespread pullback in credit availability is a significant risk to the outlook,"" the firm said. --- E.S. Browning contributed to this article.

97,,2007-12-12 00:00:00,"['NEW YORK -- The yen bested both the euro and dollar, as risk aversion swept through financial markets after the Federal Reserve announced a third-consecutive cut to interest rates to defend the U.S. economy. The yen surged on a sharp decline in U.S. stocks, with equity investors disappointed by the 25-basis point cut to the fed-funds rate, instead of a 50-basis-point reduction -- although few market watchers actually expected the latter. ""This is the bare minimum that was expected,"" said Marc Chandler, global head of foreign exchange at Brown Brothers Harriman in New York. Consequently, the euro dropped almost three yen from its intraday high and the dollar declined almost 1.5 yen from its intraday high after the announcement. The euro\'s significant fall, just one day after striking a one-month high of 164.58 yen, helped boost the dollar against the single currency. The dollar was also boosted against the euro, said Robert Sinche, head of global foreign exchange at Bank of America in New York, because it is more attractive than it would have been if there was a 50-basis point cut. A cut to the fed-funds rate of any size suggests downside risks for the U.S. currency because lower rates reduce investors\' returns on dollar-denominated assets. However, the dollar\'s reaction wasn\'t as large as seen in the past, perhaps because the Fed itself stressed the current uncertainty. ""For now, the foreign-exchange markets will be taking their cue from other markets, like the commodity and equity markets,"" Mr. Sinche added. The euro was at $1.4653 in New York, down from $1.4717 the previous day, while the dollar was at 110.64 yen, compared with 111.68 yen. The U.K. pound was at $2.0337, down from from $2.0474, while the dollar was quoted at 1.1315 Swiss francs, compared with 1.1278 Swiss francs late Monday. The Federal Open Market Committee voted 9-1 to reduce the federal-funds rate to 4.25% from 4.5%, its third reduction since September totaling 100 basis points. It also cut the discount rate it charges banks that borrow from the Fed by 25 basis points to 4.75%. The market anticipated a cut after statements from several officials early last month, most pointedly by Fed governor Randall Kroszner, who on Nov. 16 said ""the current stance of monetary policy should help the economy get through the rough patch during the next year."" The dollar had retreated from its lifetime lows against the euro following that speech on the positive momentum it created in U.S. equities. ""Incoming information suggests that economic growth is slowing,"" the FOMC said in its statement, reflecting the ""intensification"" of the housing slump and slower business and consumer spending. The statement signaled an about-face from the previous Fed meeting, when the board suggested further easing was off the table. The Fed also dropped its previous assertion that growth and inflation risks were roughly balanced, opting instead for an open-ended view, and pledged to ""act as needed"" to keep the economy growing and inflation in check. The dollar and euro\'s subsequent decline versus the yen followed a typical low-risk appetite trading pattern. The yen benefits during times of risk aversion because Japan\'s ultra-low interest rates make the yen a funding currency for riskier assets when the market has a more positive sentiment. When that perspective shifts, the funds shift back into the yen. A similar pattern often aids the dollar against the euro and currencies like the Brazilian real, as it did yesterday. However, currency analysts say that the Fed\'s downside view of the economy indicates that this is no dollar rebound. Before the FOMC announcement, there was no significant U.S. economic data to sway the market\'s focus from the meeting and the dollar was largely rangebound. Today, the U.S. October trade deficit will be released at 8:30 a.m. EST, at the same time as November import prices. November\'s federal budget will be released at 2 p.m. EST. Late in the evening, Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson will close the U.S.-China Strategic Economic Dialogue in Beijing, during which he had planned to press China to pick up the pace on adopting a more flexible currency policy. --- Dan Molinski in New York and Brian Blackstone and Henry J.

98,,1989-10-04 00:00:00,"['The combined foreign-currency holdings of the Federal Reserve and Treasury totaled $34 billion at the end of July 1989, the latest reporting date. That figure had increased by $23.2 billion in the 13 months since June 1988, mainly by purchases of yen and marks. This activity\'s costs appear to outweigh by far the benefits. The legal basis for the Federal Reserve\'s intervention in foreign-exchange markets is questionable. The Federal Reserve Act provides no general and positive authorization to operate in foreign currencies. However, in early 1962, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC, comprising the Fed board and presidents of the Fed regional banks) approved such operations with the concurrence of top U.S. officials. Congress, in the Gold Reserve Act of 1934, gave the Treasury a limited authority for operations to stabilize the dollar\'s exchange value. In March 1961, with the Federal Reserve Bank of New York as its agent, the Treasury for the first time since the late 1930s entered into foreign-exchange transactions for monetary purposes. The Treasury and the Fed effectively have been coordinating these efforts ever since, except during the the first Reagan administration, when no intervention occurred. Only since the start of 1977, however, has the FOMC approved an overall open position in all foreign currencies. Why do the authorities engage in substantial foreign-currency purchases? Has doing so achieved its objective? What costs are imposed on the economy? The authorities buy foreign currencies when they want to prevent the dollar from appreciating, and sell them when they want to prevent the dollar from depreciating. Ten years ago, foreign-currency reserves were $3.8 billion. The current figure is almost tenfold as large, a far greater increase than in the total assets of the Federal Reserve System, which less than doubled ($160 billion in 1979; less than $300 billion at the end of June 1989). The foreign-currency purchasing binge over the past 13 months has not prevented a sizable appreciation of the dollar. One dollar bought 1.758 marks and 127.5 yen in June 1988, and 1.89 marks and 140.4 yen in July 1989. Intervention has been ineffective because the Fed sterilized the monetary effects of purchases and sales -- that is, it contracted or expanded the domestic money supply to counteract the effects at home of its moves in the foreign-exchange markets. A major source of fluctuations in exchange rates is the change in relative rates of money growth. Differences in money growth rates tend to produce differences in inflation rates. Differences in inflation rates in turn produce either exchange-rate depreciation or appreciation. Since early 1987, with the exception of the months just after the 1987 stock market crash, the Federal Reserve has been restricting monetary growth; Japan and West Germany on the whole have been expansionary. Monetary policy was expansionary in those countries in 1987 and 1988 because they engaged in exchange-rate intervention in the attempt to prevent dollar depreciation and did not fully sterilize their purchases of dollars. As a result, monetary growth has accelerated in Japan and West Germany. A delayed result of these differences in monetary growth rates is that inflation is now trending down in the U.S. and rising in the other countries, with the expected consequences for exchange rates. Central-bank intervention in exchange markets has been a pointless activity that has imposed costs on the countries engaging in such intervention. One cost is an increase in exchange-rate volatility produced by the erratic intervention. A second is that the taxpayer bears a double pecuniary loss. The first arises from the Fed\'s sterilization activity. It offsets open-market purchases of foreign currency with open-market sales of Treasury and federal agency obligations. Although the monetary base grew by $10 billion from June 1988 to May 1989, domestic interest-bearing securities held by the Fed over the period declined on net by $7 billion. Net income of the Federal Reserve Banks, which is normally rebated to the Treasury, has accordingly been reduced. That is one part of the loss sustained by taxpayers, offset to an extent that is not reported by the interest earned on foreign-exchange holdings. The second loss relates back to exchange-rate volatility and the risk to which the taxpayer is exposed as foreign-currency assets held by the Fed and the Treasury balloon. By acquiring $34 billion of foreign currency, the monetary authorities have taken a speculative position that yen, D-marks and other currencies will appreciate in relation to the dollar. The Fed and the administration assert that the elimination of inflation is a major goal of policy. Yet in their foreign-exchange operations, the U.S. authorities are gambling that their own anti-inflationary policies will fail. The Fed publishes a quarterly report on its foreign-exchange operations three months after their conclusion. The report details the dates of purchases and sales, but not the prices at which it executed the transactions. In 1988, the latest year for which information is available, the realized and unrealized loss on foreign-exchange-rate transactions by the Fed was $511 million. The Treasury\'s losses, approximately equal, are not reported. No benefits offset the losses. Sterilized intervention has only temporary effects on exchange rates. The public has a right to insist on a full accounting of the realized and unrealized losses on official intervention in foreign-exchange markets. Is any congressional committee paying attention to these losses? Is there any other mechanism in existence for making the Treasury and the Fed accountable for their speculation in foreign exchange? --- Ms. Schwartz, co-author with Milton Friedman of ""A Monetary History of the United States,"" is affiliated with the National Bureau of Economic Research.']",The Fed's Costly Trips to the Market,1989-10-03,The Wall Street Journal
99,,2004-01-29 00:00:00,"['NEW YORK -- The Federal Reserve\'s surprise deletion of a key phrase from its official statement on monetary policy sent shock waves through the bond market, with Treasury prices falling sharply. While investors had expected the Fed\'s decision to keep short-term interest rates on hold at 1%, the absence of the ""considerable period"" phrasing, used since August 2003 to describe how long the bank would keep rates low, caught market participants off guard. Many believe the removal of the phrase and its replacement with somewhat vaguer language signals that an eventual increase in the federal-funds target rate will come sooner rather than later. Prices plummeted in the immediate aftermath of the Fed\'s decision and the yield on the 10-year note shot up to 4.26%, a level not seen since the soft December jobs report encouraged investors to buy government securities. ""This was clearly a wake-up call for the market,"" said Craig Coats, head of fixed income at Keefe, Bruyette &Woods in New York. ""The Fed is seeing improvement or they wouldn\'t have done this,"" he added. Prices recovered from their worst levels in late trading, however. At 4 p.m., the benchmark 10-year note was down 26/32 point, or $8.125 per $1,000 face value, at 100 18/32. Its yield rose to 4.177% from 4.078%% late Tuesday, as yields move inversely to prices. The 30-year bond\'s price fell 31/32 point at 105 14/32 to yield 5.006%, up from 4.943%. In its statement, the central bank\'s policy-making Federal Open Market Committee said ""it can be patient in removing its policy accommodation."" While the change to ""patient"" from ""considerable period"" may seem like a subtle one to those outside of the bond markets, traders believe the shift indicates that the Fed will raise rates sooner than had been expected. Federal-funds futures contracts now indicate a roughly 72% chance of a 0.25 percentage point rate increase in June, compared with previous expectations for an increase in late September. ""I think it\'s basically telling the market that they may raise rates before they actually see a confirmation of growth in terms adding jobs,"" said Jim Caron, bond market strategist at Merrill Lynch. Some of the losses were reversed as the knee-jerk selling moderated once investors realized that just because the ""considerable period"" phrase is gone, it doesn\'t mean the Fed will raise rates at its next meeting. ""The FOMC now has the flexibility to raise rates this year, but they still have to remove the hurdle of `patience\' before they do,"" said Dominic Konstam, head of interest-rate strategy at Credit Suisse First Boston in New York. Rather than the bond market wondering whether the FOMC will adopt a bias toward raising rates at its next meeting in March, traders will wonder whether it will drop the term ""patience,"" he added. The change in the statement also cast doubt on the safety of the so-called carry trades in which leveraged investors borrow at short-term rates and buy longer-dated securities. These trades have helped keep Treasury yields at their historic lows in recent months. Now that the timing of a Fed rate increase appears to be closer than many thought, investors who have favored these trades ""are going to think a little bit harder"" about staying in them, said J.P. Marra, head of U.S. government trading at Lehman Brothers in New York. The yield curve, which measures the difference between shorter-dated and longer-dated securities, flattened dramatically as the spread between the two-year and 10-year notes narrowed by 0.06 percentage point to 2.37 percentage points. Municipal Bonds Citing New York City\'s progress in reducing budget imbalances, Moody\'s Investors Service raised its outlook on the city\'s ratings to stable from negative. New York City\'s general-obligation bond rating is A2. In changing the outlook, Moody\'s noted that the city expects to balance its budget in fiscal 2004 and has proposed ""a reasonable and achievable fiscal plan for fiscal 2005,"" which begins April 1. --- Tom Sullivan contributed to this article.

100,,2004-01-29 00:00:00,"['NEW YORK -- The dollar surged across the board after currency dealers read a more hawkish stance into Federal Reserve policy makers\' outlook for interest rates. While the Fed\'s Open Market Committee left its benchmark interest rate unchanged at a 45-year low of 1%, it surprised markets by dropping the closely watched phrase that monetary policy would remain accommodative for a ""considerable period"" of time, replacing it with a pledge to be ""patient"" before tightening. Even though most banks don\'t think the Fed will lift interest rates until later this year, or even 2005, the nuanced shift in language was taken as a signal that the central bank has gone one step further down that road and that was a clear boon for the dollar. Late yesterday, the euro was trading at $1.2488, around session lows and well below $1.2640 late Tuesday. It was also lower against the yen at 132.42 yen from 133.50 yen. Against the Swiss franc, the dollar rose to 1.2552 francs from 1.2404 francs, while sterling fell to $1.8220 from $1.8277. The dollar rose to 106.02 yen from 105.64 yen late Tuesday. That the dollar clawed back so much ground after the FOMC was all the more impressive given that it had been under pressure for much of the day. The pound led the onslaught on the dollar earlier in the session, benefiting from a British judge\'s report clearing Prime Minister Tony Blair\'s government of a BBC report claiming a dossier on Iraq weapons had been ""sexed up."" Meanwhile, not to be outdone by the Fed, the Reserve Bank of New Zealand made a surprise rate increase, lifting its official cash rate 0.25 percentage point to 5.25%. The New Zealand dollar, which had traded higher ahead of the decision, was sold modestly afterward, trading at 67.72 U.S. cents yesterday afternoon in New York, little changed from 67.81 U.S. cents late Wednesday in Wellington. Elsewhere, Norges Bank, the Norwegian central bank, met market expectations and cut its key deposit rate by 0.25 percentage point to 2.0%, in effect today. In its statement, the bank said it took into account the fall in the kroner against the euro since December as well as a continued rise in equity prices at the end of 2003 and into 2004. Market expectations of a rate cut in neighboring Sweden influenced its decision, as did the lack of signs of a rise in global consumer price inflation. The euro rose sharply in New York trading, peaking at 8.7410 kroner, but then fell back to end North American trading at 8.7020 kroner, still up significantly from 8.6160 kroner late Tuesday. --- Jamie McGeever in New York and Magnus Hansson in Stockholm contributed to this article.

101,,2004-01-29 00:00:00,"['WASHINGTON -- The Federal Reserve has freed its hands for a future increase in interest rates. The central bank left its short-term interest rate target at a 45-year low of 1%. But the bigger action was in its language, which it uses in addition to rate changes to guide the markets and economy. In an important tactical move, its policy panel dropped the commitment it first made five months ago to keep interest rates low for ""a considerable period."" Instead, the Federal Open Market Committee said after its first two-day meeting of this year that it can be ""patient"" in raising rates because inflation is low and the economy still hasn\'t fully recovered. Investors interpreted the omission of ""considerable period"" as a signal that the Fed is closer to raising interest rates than many thought. The 10-year Treasury bond yield leapt to 4.17% from 4.08% Tuesday. Futures trading on the Chicago Board of Trade suggests traders have moved up the month when they think the Fed will start raising rates to June from August. The prospect of higher interest rates damped the relative attraction of stocks, which compete with interest-bearing investments. The Dow Jones Industrial Average, up almost 50 points earlier in the day, plunged after the Fed\'s announcement, closing down 141.55 points at 10468.37. The dollar rallied against the euro, since higher rates would improve the return on dollar-denominated loans. The announcement doesn\'t seem to suggest an interest-rate increase is imminent. Rather, it appears the central bank wants the freedom to raise rates if the economy continues to improve, without worrying about violating a perceived commitment to keep them down. ""This is tactical,"" said Richard Berner, chief U.S. economist at Morgan Stanley. ""It serves as a reminder that monetary policy will not stay on hold forever."" The rest of the statement suggested the Fed\'s economic outlook hasn\'t changed significantly since it last met in early December. ""Output is expanding briskly,"" it said. While ""new hiring remains subdued, other indicators suggest an improvement in the labor market."" Meanwhile, excluding food and energy prices, inflation is ""muted and expected to remain low."" It said upside and downside risks to economic growth were ""roughly equal,"" while the risk of ""an unwelcome fall in inflation"" was ""almost equal"" to the risk of an increase. Economic reports yesterday suggested the expansion may have slowed in December though it doesn\'t appear to be in trouble. New-home sales fell 5.1% in December from November to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.06 million units, while new orders for durable goods -- those meant to last at least three years -- were unchanged in December from November. Fed officials feel underlying inflation, at about 1%, is already at the bottom of their preferred range, and with businesses operating with a lot of spare capacity and unemployment high, there is little prospect that inflation will rise from that level. Still, in recent months they have grown more confident that the economic expansion is unfolding as expected. Some officials think upward pressure on consumer prices and wages could develop before the end of 2005, and they would like to start raising rates ""well in advance of that point, rather than slamming on the brakes in the middle of 2005,"" said Michael Prell, an economic consultant in Arlington, Va. ""This gets the market into better alignment with their thinking."" The FOMC, made up of seven governors in Washington and 12 regional bank presidents, of whom five vote, agreed unanimously to leave the federal-funds rate at 1%. The rate, charged on overnight loans between banks, has stood there since last June after 13 successive cuts beginning in January 2001. With its shift in language, the Fed has exited from an unusual experiment with verbal monetary policy born of last year\'s brush with deflation, or generally falling prices. Last summer, markets assumed the Fed would quickly raise interest rates to snuff out inflationary pressure, as in prior recoveries. In fact, with inflation so low and deflation still a risk, the Fed was prepared to wait much longer. But as long as markets believed otherwise, long-term interest rates would be pushed up, undermining the recovery. To alter their expectations, the Fed began saying in August that rates could stay low for a ""considerable period,"" departing from its historic practice of letting the markets decide for themselves what it would do. The commitment was almost immediately controversial inside and outside the Fed. Some policy makers thought it dangerous to constrain their future actions, when inflation could surge unexpectedly. Some Wall Street analysts meanwhile thought the Fed had encouraged rampant speculation in the stock and bond markets with an open-ended promise of cheap financing. Still, the commitment worked: It has held down long-term interest rates, such as on mortgages, supporting home sales and other interest-sensitive purchases at a critical juncture for the economy. Some analysts saw little change with the alteration of the language. Daiwa Securities economist Michael Moran said, ""The phrases `considerable period\' and `patient\' should be viewed as near-perfect substitutes,"" noting that Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan has used the word ""patient"" before. But for the Fed, the difference is crucial. With the change, it is now freer to act solely on economic data, rather than on any perceived commitment to keep rates low. The change in language appears to be the only result so far of a lengthy internal review of communications policy. Prompted by a series of controversies last year, the Fed\'s Federal Open Market Committee in October formed a working group headed by Gov. Roger Ferguson to study how it speaks to the public. The entire FOMC spent most of Tuesday discussing the issue. A Fed spokeswoman said Mr. Ferguson\'s group has completed its work. She said that while FOMC members aren\'t announcing any specific changes, ""they decided to gradually adapt their statements as needed and in response to changing economic circumstances."" She added that no decision has been made about releasing meeting minutes earlier. Currently, there is a wait of about six weeks. Analysts had speculated the Fed might start releasing minutes before, rather than after, its next scheduled meeting. In yesterday\'s economic reports, the Commerce Department said new orders for durable goods such as cars and computers were flat in December, after falling 2.3% in November from October. Excluding defense and aircraft, capital goods orders -- a barometer of business spending -- slipped 0.4%. The data may be distorted by statistical difficulties related to communications-equipment orders. Other data show a manufacturing and technology rebound, and tech executives are relatively optimistic. In a separate report, the department said while new-home sales fell in December, sales during the previous two months were revised higher. Homebuilders had on average 4.3 months of supply of homes, up from a low of 3.5 months during August. Mortgage rates have declined in recent weeks, which could provide a new lift to sales in the new year. --- Jon E.

102,,2005-11-02 00:00:00,"['The Treasury market took the 12th consecutive quarter-percentage-point rate increase by the Federal Reserve in stride, settling modestly lower after the central bank raised the federal-funds target rate to 4% from 3.75%, while confirming that more increases are to come. ""The implication"" of the Federal Open Market Committee meeting is that the Fed ""is showing no sings they are wavering"" in the rate-increase campaign, said Anthony Karydakis, chief U.S. economist at J.P. Morgan Asset Management in New York. With yesterday\'s rate increase, the federal-funds rate stands at its highest level since May 2001. Most major banks raised their prime rate to 7%. The accompanying policy statement was largely unchanged from that of the late September meeting, reiterating that the risks between rising prices and economic growth remain balanced. While policy makers noted caution about inflation and spikes in energy prices, they said that underlying inflation and inflation expectations remain contained. At 4 p.m., the benchmark 10-year note was down 3/32 point, or 93.75 cents per $1,000 face value, at 97 15/32. Its yield rose to 4.573% from 4.563% Monday, as yields move inversely to prices. The 30-year bond was down 4/32 point at 108 29/32 to yield 4.765%, up from 4.757%. The Federal Open Market Committee\'s statement confirmed what the futures markets have been pricing of late: Two more quarter-percentage-point increases are likely, which would bring the federal-funds rate to 4.5% by the end of January. ""The FOMC meeting is totally irrelevant,"" said Stan Jonas, head of interest-rate strategy at Fimat USA in New York, adding the ""only uncertainty is what happens post January."" Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan retires at the end of January. Former Fed governor and current presidential-economic adviser Ben Bernanke will succeed him, pending a Senate confirmation hearing. For the Treasury market, the latest FOMC decision and statement is unlikely to push yields much in either direction, said Kevin Flanagan, fixed-income strategist at Morgan Stanley in Purchase, N.Y. ""The bond market, like the Fed, is data dependent,"" he said, ""and it will take some surprising numbers to merit a breaking of the current range in yields."" Surprises on the data front have been more to the upside than the downside -- the economy expanded at a faster-than-expected 3.8% rate in the third quarter, despite soaring gasoline prices and the damage caused by two hurricanes. The Institute of Management Supply\'s index of national manufacturing activity was stronger than expected, coming in at 59.1 in October from 59.4 in September. Some economists said the fourth quarter could see growth slow from the rapid pace in the third quarter, as consumer spending is likely to slow from the third quarter\'s 3.9% increase. Commercial banks are raising their prime lending rate to 7% -- adding to the interest-rate burden of some homeowners with home-equity lines of credit, which are typically tied to the prime rate. A year ago, the prime rate stood at 4.75%. As of June 30, the home-equity line of credit debt at banks, thrifts and credit unions totaled $628 billion, up from $486 billion a year earlier and $136 billion at the end of 1999, according to George Yacik, vice president of SMR Research, a financial-research firm in Hackettstown, N.J.   Junk Bonds Moody\'s Investors Service cut General Motors Corp.\'s ratings deep into speculative-grade territory yesterday, saying that the auto maker\'s continuing recovery plan faces significant hurdles. Moody\'s cut GM\'s long-term credit rating two notches to B1 from Ba2 -- a middling, speculative-grade rating -- and left the outlook negative. The ratings firm cited a familiar litany of troubles for the auto maker, including a recovery plan that seems to have stalled as car and truck sales continue to slide. --- Simona Covel and Danielle Reed contributed to this article.

103,,2005-11-02 00:00:00,"['WASHINGTON -- The Federal Reserve raised short-term interest rates for a 12th consecutive time, and will probably have to keep raising them until the economy slows, to keep inflation from rising. The Fed, as expected, increased its target for the federal-funds rate, charged on overnight loans between banks, to 4% from 3.75%. Its accompanying statement showed optimism on economic growth and concerns about inflation. ""Elevated energy prices and hurricane-related disruptions in economic activity have temporarily depressed output and employment,"" the Fed said yesterday in the statement accompanying its decision. In spite of the damage and disruptions caused by hurricanes Katrina and Rita, the U.S. economy grew at a 3.8% annual rate in the third quarter, its eighth consecutive quarter at about that pace. That\'s above what most economists consider the economy\'s potential growth rate -- that is, what it can produce with existing capital and labor. Moreover, the Fed appears to see that continuing, thanks to relatively low interest rates, robust productivity growth and ""planned rebuilding in the hurricane-affected areas."" At the same time, the Fed warned that, although oil and gasoline prices have fallen from their levels in the immediate aftermath of the storms, the ""cumulative rise in energy and other costs have the potential to add to inflation pressures."" So far, though, ""core"" inflation -- which excludes food and energy prices -- has ""been relatively low"" and ""longer-term inflation expectations remain contained."" The Fed suggested it will continue to raise rates, albeit at a ""measured"" pace, which has come to mean a quarter percentage point per meeting. All 10 voting members of the policy-setting Federal Open Market Committee agreed on yesterday\'s increase, unlike Sept. 20 when Fed governor Mark Olson dissented, favoring no increase. (There are normally 12 voting members but two governors\' seats are vacant.) All 12 regional reserve banks agreed to the accompanying increase in the less-important discount rate, charged on short-term Fed loans to commercial banks, to 5% from 4.75%. Many commercial banks raised their prime rate, the benchmark for many business and consumer loans, to 7% from 6.75%. With the economy running out of spare capacity and showing no signs of slowing, Fed officials have concluded they need to boost rates further than they previously thought to keep higher energy prices from triggering a price-wage spiral. That will likely require the economy to slow down noticeably in the next year or two. That may happen on its own. There are scattered signs that the housing market is beginning to cool, and high oil prices have eroded consumer confidence. But without evidence of a slowdown, the Fed is likely to keep raising rates until it induces one. Last month, Fed governor Donald Kohn said that ""the economy would still seem poised to expand more quickly than the rate of growth of its sustainable potential unless monetary policy accommodation is removed further."" Markets expect the Fed to raise the funds rate to 4.25% on Dec. 13 and 4.5% on Jan. 31, Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan\'s last day before retirement. Ben Bernanke, chairman of President Bush\'s Council of Economic Advisers, has been nominated to succeed Mr. Greenspan. Markets see approximately 50% odds Mr. Bernanke will raise the rate at his first meeting, on March 28, to 4.75%. Since the Fed began raising the funds rate from a 46-year low of 1% in June last year, it has described rates as ""accommodative"" -- in other words, below some neutral level that neither stimulates nor restrains growth. Fed watchers had assumed that at some point the Fed would conclude the rate is at neutral and drop ""accommodative."" Some Fed officials have recently pressed to drop the description. But it now appears the Fed will keep calling the rate accommodative as long as it expects to raise it further, even if it has passed most estimates of neutral, into ""restrictive"" territory. Peter Hooper, chief U.S. economist at Deutsche Bank, thinks the Fed has to get the federal funds rate to 5% because the economy is running out of spare capacity, which heightens the risk that companies and workers will be able to boost prices and wages in response to the jump in energy costs. Inflation excluding food and energy prices -- the Fed\'s preferred price index -- was 2% in August and September, near the top of many officials\' ""comfort range."" Mr. Hooper expects inflation to go above that range, forcing the Fed to slow the economy down, to 3% or slower by 2007. In economic reports yesterday, the Institute for Supply Management said its monthly index was at 59.1% for October, down from September\'s 59.4% and contrary to expectations for a plunge. With the index continuing to exceed 50 -- seen as an indication that the sector is expanding -- and with new orders and employment continuing to show strength in the report, analysts are optimistic about the sector\'s future. The Commerce Department said total U.S. construction spending rose 0.5% in September for a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $1.12 trillion. --- Joi Preciphs contributed to this article.

104,,2001-08-22 00:00:00,"['NEW YORK -- The dollar moved lower against the euro and yen despite brief gains after the Federal Reserve acted to boost the U.S. economy. The Federal Open Market Committee cut the federal-funds rate (which governs overnight loans between banks) to 3.5% from 3.75%, marking the seventh cut this year and bringing interest rates to their lowest level in seven years. Within one hour of the news, the dollar was at its intraday lows against its major counterparts. As active trading wound down in New York, the dollar continued to hover at or near intraday lows against the yen, euro, sterling and Swiss franc. The U.S. currency was poised for further losses as today\'s global session got under way in Asia. Currency trading hit a 10-minute lull immediately following the widely expected cut, as market watchers rushed to assess the Fed\'s accompanying statement, which noted a good a long-term economic outlook, but said ""the risks are weighted mainly toward conditions that may generate economic weakness in the foreseeable future."" While the initial interpretation was favorable for the dollar, the realization that the U.S. economy remains mired in the same uncertain scenario appeared to outweigh the brief optimism for the dollar. ""This was bang in line with expectations,"" said Tim Fox, currency strategist at Standard Chartered in New York. ""The statement didn\'t give any particular new insights,"" but just helped consolidate the trend that was under way immediately prior to the announcement, he said. Indeed, the euro shakeout to an intraday low of 90.81 U.S. cents during the dollar\'s short-lived rally ""pushed some stops on the downside"" and ""leads me to believe the risk is to the top side in an attack of 92"" cents, a strong resistance level, said Thom Worden, senior vice president of foreign exchange at HSBC New York. Market focus is now firmly on the Aug. 30 European Central Bank meeting. A rate cut from the ECB could restore market confidence in the euro zone and support the euro further, analysts said. Meanwhile, capital-flow data continue to present signs of wavering foreign support for the dollar. UBS Warburg weekly equity-flow analysis showed net inflows to both the U.S. and continental Europe last week, but the U.S. saw net outflows to Europe. The Asia-Pacific region saw its ninth straight week of net inflows. Late yesterday, the euro was at 91.70 cents, up from 91.30 cents earlier in London and from 91.42 cents late Monday in New York. The dollar was at 119.59 yen, down from 119.90 yen in London and from 120.70 yen late Monday in New York. The dollar was at 1.6558 Swiss francs, down from 1.6616 Swiss francs late Monday. Sterling was at $1.4523, up from $1.4449 Monday in New York. In European data, Italian cities\' consumer prices for August came in at a rise of 0.1% on the month, and Swedish June retail sales rose 0.4% compared with a 0.3% fall in May. Swedish July unemployment came in unchanged from 4.2% in June. The krona has weakened sharply against the euro and dollar in the last few days, and traders believe more weakness is in the cards despite yesterday\'s positive sales data.']",Dollar Slips Against the Yen and Euro In Wake of Fed Interest-Rate Reduction,2001-08-21,The Wall Street Journal

106,,2001-08-22 00:00:00,"['NEW YORK -- Technology issues fell again and consumer names retreated as investors interpreted the Federal Reserve decision to cut interest rates again as a signal that economic trends remain weak. A host of telecommunications-gear makers fell during trading. Communications-chip maker Broadcom shed $4.73, or 13%, to $33.06 in Nasdaq Stock Market trading. Optical-equipment maker JDS Uniphase, which hit a 52-week low Monday, fell further, dropping 44 cents, or 5.9%, to 7.07. Cellphone-chip maker RF Micro Devices slid 2.02, or 7.9%, to 23.54. Storage-software developer Brocade Communications retreated 1.60, or 5.9%, to 25.47. All trade on Nasdaq. The weakness came after the Federal Reserve voted to lower interest rates to 3.5% from 3.75%, marking the central bank\'s seventh rate cut this year. Market averages, which had moved slightly higher, albeit in thin trading, ahead of the release of the Fed\'s decision, veered lower. The Nasdaq Composite Index finished down 50.05, or 2.7%, at 1831.30, the lowest the index has finished since April 9. Technical analyst Peter Green of Gerard Klauer Mattison speculated the Nasdaq composite could fall another 4% during the short term, given the recent technical patterns. The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed down 145.93 points, a 1.4% drop, at 10174.14, its lowest finish since April 12. Though Wall Street accurately anticipated the result of the Federal Open Market Committee ruling, investors clearly saw the decision, as well as the accompanying commentary, as an indication that the economy hasn\'t responded to the Fed\'s attempts to stimulate growth. Abby Joseph Cohen, market strategist at Goldman Sachs, highlighted the state of corporate profits in a report released yesterday before the Fed\'s ruling. In the report, titled ""Closing the barn door on second-quarter earnings,"" Ms. Cohen reduced the firm\'s earnings estimates for the S&P 500, saying ""our original estimates for 2001 earnings were too high, given the weaker-than-expected economic environment and the aggressive charges taken by many companies."" Separately, Ms. Cohen said the deterioration of corporate profits had largely run its course, adding, ""This is a great time for investors with longer time horizons to rebuild portfolios,"" because valuations remain attractive, despite the weak earnings backdrop. Much of the selling pressure during the session was on stocks in technology, manufacturing and financial-services sectors, which have shown weakness in profit performance for the first two quarters. Dell Computer eased 71 cents, to 22.01 in Nasdaq trading, while Honeywell slid 85 cents, to 37.25, and Merrill Lynch declined 1.63, to 49.85, near the 52-week low of 49.66 set during the past week. The weakness in some tech stocks whose market performance has been the worst since the Fed started this cycle of rate reductions in January got even worse yesterday. Ciena, which set a 52-week low Monday, fell 1.04, or 5.7%, to 17.05; Tellabs hit a 52-week low, falling 26 cents to 13.61; and Nortel Networks dropped 38 cents, or 5.7%, to 6.23, another 52-week low. Disturbing signs in the actions of stocks exposed to consumer spending suggest investors are worried those consumers may not continue to hold fast in the face of economic fallout. Credit-card lender Capital One Financial eased 2.47, to 59.37. Americredit, a Fort Worth, Texas, financial-services company that specializes in servicing auto loans slid 7.40, or 14%, to 45.05; since reaching a 52-week high of 64.90 three weeks ago, the stock has declined 31%. Home-builder Centex fell 86 cents to 40.24. In a tough session for retailers, Home Depot fell 1.70 to 48.10, while Bed Bath & Beyond slipped 1.04 to 28.64. ""I think the market\'s performance has begun to tell you that consumer spending has become a definite worry,"" Bob Basel, a Salomon Smith Barney senior trader, said. Agilent Technologies fell to a 52-week low intraday but recovered by the close, gaining 36 cents, to 26.45. The Palo Alto, Calif., producer of semiconductor-making hardware posted a loss for its fiscal third quarter, and said it will cut 4,000 jobs. Macrovision gained 3.39, or 7.8%, to 46.60 on Nasdaq. Thomas Weisel Partners, in a research note, said the Sunnyvale, Calif., developer of copy-protection technology could benefit from indications that the price of digital-video-disk players, which use Macrovision technology, will decline further, spurring demand. Computer Associates fell 1.28 to 32.44, amid indications that a dissident-shareholder group, led by investor Sam Wyly, has gained momentum in its bid to unseat four directors from the Islandia, N.Y., software developer. Mr. Wyly\'s group won the backing of Institutional Shareholder Services, a shareholder-advisory service. Cypress Semiconductor eased 1.01 to 22.36. The San Jose, Calif., maker of integrated circuits, trading in a tough session for chip stocks, agreed to acquire In-System Design, a closely held semiconductor-design company, for $45 million. Medtronic rose 87 cents to 45.55. The Minneapolis medical-device maker reported fiscal first-quarter results late Monday that topped Wall Street\'s forecasts. Guidant added 3.40, or 11%, to 35. The Indianapolis medical-device maker reached an agreement with closely held Cook Inc. for exclusive world-wide marketing rights for Cook\'s drug-coated stent for coronary-artery disease. American Eagle Outfitters tumbled 9.06, or 28%, to 23.21. The Warrendale, Pa., apparel retailer reduced its fiscal third-quarter growth estimate because it is having trouble selling jeans. In a difficult session for retailers, Target declined 1.74 to 35.36, after the Minneapolis discount retailer said its fiscal third-quarter earnings will come in at the low end of Wall Street\'s forecasts. Talbots shed 3.87, or 9.5%, to 36.68. The Hingham, Mass., apparel retailer posted stronger-than-expected fiscal second-quarter results, but cautioned that comparable-store sales figures for September and October will decline from year-earlier totals. Alcoa fell 40 cents to 37.40. The aluminum giant\'s Alcoa Fujikura unit acquired Laser Armor Tech, a developer of stainless-steel tubes for optical fibers, from closely held Cook Group. Immunex added 64 cents to 16.86 on Nasdaq. The Seattle drug developer reported encouraging results from a preliminary clinical study of its Enbrel, which is used to treat psoriasis. Enzon rose 1.6% to 65.45 on Nasdaq. The Piscataway, N.J., drug developer posted fiscal fourth-quarter earnings that matched Wall Street\'s forecasts. BJ\'s Wholesale fell 2.53 to 52.74. The Natick, Mass., warehouse-discount retailer declined despite reporting fiscal second-quarter earnings that matched Wall Street\'s forecasts. Calpine gained 1.63, or 5.8%, to 29.90, after hitting a 52-week low Monday. The San Jose, Calif., energy company said Monday it will abandon plans to issue new stock during the first half of next year if the share price stalls at its current level.']","JDS Uniphase, Brocade Tumble As Rate Cut Reinforces Pessimism",2001-08-21,The Wall Street Journal
107,,2001-08-22 00:00:00,"['WASHINGTON -- The Federal Reserve, citing continued weakness in business investment and profits and slowing growth abroad, cut interest rates by a quarter of a percentage point to their lowest level since 1994. The cut, the Fed\'s seventh this year, lowered the federal-funds rate, charged on overnight loans between banks, to 3.5% from 3.75%. The Fed also cut its largely symbolic discount rate to 3% from 3.25%, prompting major commercial banks to follow suit by cutting their prime lending rates to 6.5% from 6.75%. The statement accompanying the Fed\'s action suggested that policy makers see the economy much as they have for the past few months: torn between weak business spending and foreign growth on the one hand and continued demand from consumers on the other. ""Household demand has been sustained, but business profits and capital spending continue to weaken and growth abroad is slowing, weighing on the U.S. economy,"" the Fed said. The Fed also indicated it was more likely to lower than raise rates in the future, saying risks were ""weighted mainly toward . . . economic weakness"" rather than inflation. However, with some signs of stability emerging and the full impact of interest-rate cuts and tax rebates yet to be felt, some economists saw hints that the Fed would pause now in its rate-cutting campaign. In its statement, the Fed alluded to monetary stimulus already in the pipeline, noting that yesterday\'s action ""brings the decline in the target federal-funds rate since the beginning of the year to 300 basis points,"" or three percentage points (though it said something similar in June). Its reference to ""sustained"" household spending was more positive than the ""weak expansion of consumption"" it talked about in June. ""They have acknowledged that there are some elements of firmness in the economy but that they may not be sufficient to restore the kind of growth that they feel is appropriate,"" said Michael Prell, an economic consultant in Arlington, Va., and former senior Fed staffer. The downbeat tone of the Fed\'s statement helped send the Dow Jones Industrial Average down 145.93 points, or 1.4%, to 10174.14, its lowest level since April. Futures markets put the odds of a quarter-point cut at the Fed\'s Oct. 2 meeting at 70%, up from 62% Monday. Whether that happens depends mostly on developments in the interim. Merrill Lynch chief economist Bruce Steinberg said, ""The Fed\'s view of the economy was not as dire as in July but still gave no sense that the Fed saw an imminent turnaround,"" suggesting that a cut is likely in October. Recent signs have been mixed. Most manufacturers\' orders still are falling, according to surveys, and profit projections remain in free-fall. Some areas of previous strength, like commercial construction and auto sales, are also weakening. Foreign economies are slipping. But new claims for unemployment insurance have stopped going up and aggregate manufacturing output held steady in July for the first time since last fall. Retail sales appear to be getting a lift from tax rebates. Furthermore, while the impact of the Fed\'s earlier easing had been diluted by the failure of longer-term rates or the dollar to fall, both have dropped recently. Bill Dudley, head of U.S. economic research at Goldman Sachs and one of Wall Street\'s gloomiest prognosticators, thinks the Fed will cut rates again this fall but not necessarily at its October meeting. He expects tax rebates to sharply boost August retail sales, but that will make it hard for the Fed to know what the underlying trend is. ""I can imagine a scenario where the Fed saw the recovery in retail spending and decided in October to wait for more evidence"" before cutting rates again, he says. In yesterday\'s statement, Fed officials said slackening in job and product markets ""is expected to keep inflation contained."" That\'s the same language they used in their June statement. Still, in recent months, some members of the Federal Open Market Committee, made up of Fed governors and regional-bank presidents, have raised concerns about cutting rates so much that inflation becomes a problem next year. For that reason, Mickey Levy, chief economist at Bank of America, said that unlike in previous economic cycles when the Fed cut rates until economic conditions improved, it may stop sooner this time. ""One reason they may want to be a little more cautious this time is that over the last year, as the economy has slumped, core inflation has drifted up a bit,"" he said. Though Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan has been consistently optimistic about the inflation outlook, Mr. Levy said ""there are different members who are probably keeping a closer eye on the inflation numbers, and that concern, I believe, will mount and spread once we\'re into the economic rebound."" Only seven of the Fed\'s 12 regional reserve banks had requested yesterday\'s quarter-point interest-rate cut, the same as in June. That suggests ""some possible dissension,"" said Peter Hooper, chief U.S. economist at Deutsche Bank, surmising that most if not all of the other five would have preferred no cut. However, the Richmond, Va., and Kansas City, Mo., Feds, two hawkish banks that didn\'t originally request the June quarter-point cut, did request yesterday\'s, suggesting some hawks have become either more worried about the economy or less worried about inflation during the past two months. --- Journal Link: Read the Fed\'s latest policy statement and see background information on interest rates, in the online Journal at WSJ.com/JournalLinks.']","Fed Cuts Rates to Lowest Level Since '94 --- Quarter-Point Reduction Tied to Slump Overseas, Weak Business Climate",2001-08-21,The Wall Street Journal
108,,2001-08-22 00:00:00,"['NEW YORK -- The dollar moved lower against the euro and yen despite brief gains after the Federal Reserve acted to boost the U.S. economy. The Federal Open Market Committee cut the federal-funds rate (which governs overnight loans between banks) to 3.5% from 3.75%, marking the seventh cut this year and bringing interest rates to their lowest level in seven years. Within one hour of the news, the dollar was at its intraday lows against its major counterparts. As active trading wound down in New York, the dollar continued to hover at or near intraday lows against the yen, euro, sterling and Swiss franc. The U.S. currency was poised for further losses as today\'s global session got under way in Asia. Currency trading hit a 10-minute lull immediately following the widely expected cut, as market watchers rushed to assess the Fed\'s accompanying statement, which noted a good a long-term economic outlook, but said ""the risks are weighted mainly toward conditions that may generate economic weakness in the foreseeable future."" While the initial interpretation was favorable for the dollar, the realization that the U.S. economy remains mired in the same uncertain scenario appeared to outweigh the brief optimism for the dollar. ""This was bang in line with expectations,"" said Tim Fox, currency strategist at Standard Chartered in New York. ""The statement didn\'t give any particular new insights,"" but just helped consolidate the trend that was under way immediately prior to the announcement, he said. Indeed, the euro shakeout to an intraday low of 90.81 U.S. cents during the dollar\'s short-lived rally ""pushed some stops on the downside"" and ""leads me to believe the risk is to the top side in an attack of 92"" cents, a strong resistance level, said Thom Worden, senior vice president of foreign exchange at HSBC New York. Market focus is now firmly on the Aug. 30 European Central Bank meeting. A rate cut from the ECB could restore market confidence in the euro zone and support the euro further, analysts said. Meanwhile, capital-flow data continue to present signs of wavering foreign support for the dollar. UBS Warburg weekly equity-flow analysis showed net inflows to both the U.S. and continental Europe last week, but the U.S. saw net outflows to Europe. The Asia-Pacific region saw its ninth straight week of net inflows. Late yesterday, the euro was at 91.70 cents, up from 91.30 cents earlier in London and from 91.42 cents late Monday in New York. The dollar was at 119.59 yen, down from 119.90 yen in London and from 120.70 yen late Monday in New York. The dollar was at 1.6558 Swiss francs, down from 1.6616 Swiss francs late Monday. Sterling was at $1.4523, up from $1.4449 Monday in New York. In European data, Italian cities\' consumer prices for August came in at a rise of 0.1% on the month, and Swedish June retail sales rose 0.4% compared with a 0.3% fall in May. Swedish July unemployment came in unchanged from 4.2% in June. The krona has weakened sharply against the euro and dollar in the last few days, and traders believe more weakness is in the cards despite yesterday\'s positive sales data.']",Dollar Slips Against the Yen and Euro In Wake of Fed Interest-Rate Reduction,2001-08-21,The Wall Street Journal

110,,2000-08-23 00:00:00,"['WASHINGTON -- Acknowledging that recent economic data point to a cooling economy, the Federal Reserve held interest rates steady again, although policy makers said they remain concerned about inflation. The central bank\'s policy-setting Federal Open Market Committee left the target for the federal funds rate -- used by banks for overnight lending -- unchanged at 6.5%, a nine-year-high that it reached after a half-point increase in May. In a statement accompanying the decision, the Fed said growth is moderating toward a pace closer to the economy\'s ""potential,"" while continued gains in work-force efficiency are ""containing costs and holding down underlying price pressures."" The closely watched decision marks the second time in a row that central-bank officials have met and decided against boosting interest rates. Many analysts now think the Fed is likely to stay on the sidelines until at least mid-November. The Fed\'s next meeting is scheduled for Oct. 3, and policy makers are believed to be reluctant to take action so close to an election. The decision came as little surprise to many analysts and market-watchers, who had grown increasingly confident the Fed would decide to sit back and watch the effects of its six interest-rate increases since June 1999. In recent weeks, a range of data -- from moderating consumer demand numbers to a job market that shows early signs of softening -- painted a picture of an economy that continues to work toward a ""soft landing"" of slower growth and almost nonexistent inflation. Yesterday\'s statement was noticeably more optimistic than the one the Fed issued after deciding to keep rates steady in June. When explaining the June decision, the central bank cautioned that signs the economy was slowing to a sustainable pace were ""tentative and preliminary,"" a qualification the Fed elected not to repeat. This time, the statement also suggested many Fed officials are increasing their estimate of the economy\'s speed limit. It said that ""more rapid advances"" in productivity have been ""raising"" the economy\'s ""potential growth rate."" Still, yesterday\'s statement leaves little doubt officials from Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan on down remain wary about a pickup in inflation. It points out that imbalances remain between the levels of demand and supply in the economy amid one of the tightest job markets in decades. It also emphasizes that the Fed worries that the risks facing the economy continue ""to be weighted mainly toward conditions that may generate heightened inflationary pressures in the foreseeable future."" Despite widespread anticipation by markets of the announcement, the Fed\'s decision pushed the stock market higher as investors concluded that the central bank\'s rate-increase campaign would for all intents and purposes be put on hold until year end. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 59.34, or 0.54%, to 11139.15, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq composite index was at 3958.21, up 5.06, or 0.13%. While Fed officials would be reluctant to acknowledge that they pay much attention to politics, the November elections make it less likely that the central bank will raise rates in October. The last time the Fed raised rates in the meeting close to a presidential election was in 1980, when the economy was in the throes of stagnant growth and rampant inflation. This year, analysts say they are hard-pressed to think of a scenario in which future data would be worrisome enough for the central bank to conclude that it couldn\'t wait until its Nov. 15 meeting to take action. ""The Fed would have to perceive that the cost of not going would be greater than the cost of going. It would have to be a situation where the Fed\'s concerns about its own credibility or the risk of inflation overrode its sensitivities to the political process,"" said Robert DiClemente, an economist with Salomon Smith Barney in New York. ""But it\'s difficult to imagine the kind of circumstances emerging that couldn\'t wait six weeks."" Mr. DiClemente speculated that the type of worst-case scenario that could persuade Fed decision-makers to move again in October would include further declines in the unemployment rate alongside a pickup in the pace of job creation and sharp increases in commodity prices, import prices or prices for goods still in the pipeline. ""So far,"" he added, ""there are no signs whatsoever that that\'s where things are heading."" Several analysts said gains in work-force productivity -- which rose 5.3% in the second quarter, posting its largest yearly gain in nearly 17 years -- were the biggest factor keeping the Fed from raising rates. --- Journal Link: Read the Fed\'s latest policy statement and see background information on interest rates, in the online Journal at WSJ.com.']",Federal Reserve Leaves Rates Unchanged --- Specter of Inflation Remains A Concern as Economy Grows More Moderately,2000-08-22,The Wall Street Journal
111,,2000-08-23 00:00:00,"['NEW YORK -- While options traders let out a collective yawn yesterday in response to news that the Federal Open Market Committee left rates alone, the rate-sensitive financial sector extended early-morning gains. Citigroup Inc. and Chase Manhattan Corp. traded strongly. With Chase Manhattan\'s stock up $1.56 at $52.50, the September 55 calls gained 0.50 to 1.125 on American Stock Exchange volume of 2,865 contracts, compared with composite open interest of 6,067 contracts. With Citigroup\'s stock up 0.56 at 78, the September 80 calls gained 0.18 to 1.31 on Chicago Board Options Exchange volume of 2,404 contracts, compared with composite open interest of 6,829 contracts. Overall, rather than greeting the news as a buying opportunity, options trading patterns shifted into neutral territory. ""Boring,"" is how one trader described the session. ""I don\'t think anyone\'s around,"" he added. Many senior traders and money managers are traditionally on vacation for the last two weeks of August. The option market\'s fear gauge, the Chicago Board Options Exchange Market Volatility Index, or VIX, rose 0.06 to 19.62. When the index rises, it generally means that traders are getting uptight about the stock market. When the index declines, it often indicates that traders are optimistic about the stock market. The CBOE\'s equity put/call ratio was 0.48. The ratio is a contrarian sentiment indicator, which holds that if too many traders are bullish, then the smart approach is to be bearish. The index is considered bullish above 0.75; neutral from 0.40 to 0.75 and bearish below 0.40. The CBOE\'s index put/call ratio was 1.41.

112,,2006-09-21 00:00:00,"['What started out as a pause in rate increases last month began to look more like a full halt yesterday. The Federal Reserve left its short-term interest rate target at 5.25% for a second consecutive meeting. It also warned that it remains concerned about inflation, and thus if it changes rates soon, it is more likely to raise them than lower them. The statement accompanying yesterday\'s decision suggested that, since pausing in its two-year string of rate increases last month, the Fed has become more confident that standing pat is justified. In explaining yesterday\'s decision, it cited the quickening decline in housing activity and easing inflation pressure from energy. Investors, however, increasingly expect the Fed not just to remain on hold, but to cut rates at least once by next June and again by December 2007. Ten-year Treasury bond yields have fallen, ending yesterday at 4.73%, down from 5.25% in late June. Those expectations may not match the Fed\'s, at least for now. Indeed, its statement did little to hint a rate cut would be on the table in the near term and financial markets pulled back slightly in their anticipation of one. Stocks, meanwhile, which have been rallying because of falling oil prices and on hopes the Fed is finished raising rates and the economy escapes recession, extended their winning streak. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 72.28 points yesterday to 11613.19, just 110 points short of its January 2000 record. In its statement, the Fed said growth is moderating, ""partly reflecting a cooling of the housing market."" By discarding last month\'s characterization of housing as ""gradually cooling,"" the Fed acknowledged the slide in home construction, sales and, in some regions, prices has picked up speed. It said that while the ""core"" measure of inflation, which excludes food and energy, remains ""elevated,"" it was likely to moderate in part because of ""reduced impetus from energy prices."" Oil and gasoline prices have fallen sharply in recent months. Oil futures on the New York Mercantile Exchange fell $1.20 yesterday, or nearly 2%, to settle at $60.46 a barrel -- their lowest level in six months and down 22% from the nominal high reached July 14. In theory, such a decline has mixed implications for the Fed. Lower energy prices reduce inflationary pressure, which would call for the Fed to lower rates. They also boost consumer purchasing power, which can improve growth prospects and would call for an increase in rates. The Fed statement suggests it considers the former effect as more important. While economists differed on what the Fed\'s next action is likely to be, they agreed that the small changes in its statement signaled greater comfort with leaving rates where they are, despite its stated bias toward raising rates. ""We see these wording changes (and absence of other potential changes) as a step in the direction of a neutral balance of risks,"" Peter Hooper, chief economist at Deutsche Bank Securities, wrote in a note to clients. He predicted the Fed would drop its bias to higher rates either at its next meeting, on Oct. 24-25, or in December, and would cut rates by March. The Fed\'s statement conveys ""more of a sense of comfort of being on hold,"" agreed Bruce Kasman, head of economic research at J.P. Morgan Chase. He noted that inflation remains the Fed\'s paramount concern. He also expects another rate increase by March. Ten of the 11 voting members of the Federal Open Market Committee agreed to yesterday\'s decision not the change the federal-funds rate, which is charged on overnight loans between banks. The Fed had increased that rate at 17 consecutive meetings before pausing last month. As in August, Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond President Jeffrey Lacker dissented, preferring a quarter-point increase. It was the first time in eight years an FOMC member dissented at two consecutive meetings in favor of higher rates, said David Resler of Nomura Securities. The last time, he said, the Fed\'s next move was to lower rates. The Fed remains focused on inflation risks in large part because core inflation is above the 1% to 2% ""comfort zone"" of many Fed officials, including Chairman Ben Bernanke. In the 12 months through August, core inflation was 2.8%, up from 2.7% in the 12 months through July. Using a lesser-known price index that the Fed prefers, core inflation was 2.4% in the 12 months through July. Fed officials expect core inflation to move back below 2% over the next two to three years as energy prices stop boosting the prices of other goods and services and the economy cools. If that forecast doesn\'t unfold, it could pose a threat to the Fed\'s credibility that would require higher interest rates. The Fed\'s continuing concern about inflation seems at odds with investor expectations of rate cuts. Thomas Joseph Marta, fixed income strategist at RBC Capital Markets, says that while the Fed and his own firm\'s economists are optimistic the housing slump won\'t significantly hurt the rest of the economy, market participants are far more pessimistic. ""I\'ve heard traders say, \'Look, the Fed\'s wrong,\'"" he said. ""Traders are reacting viscerally to housing. Housing is something you see when you\'re driving home from the train station; it\'s very obvious, very visible."" Mr. Marta added, ""In terms of inflation, I keep whispering in the traders\' ears, \'Look, core [prices], hourly wages, unit labor costs, they\'re all at dangerous levels.\' They don\'t care."" Still, some economists say the bond market will be proven right. Paul Ashworth, senior U.S. economist at Capital Economics of London, said if housing construction\'s share of economic output falls to the same level it hit in the early 1990s, after the last housing boom, ""you\'ll get a substantial drag on growth."" He expects growth to slow to 1.5% next year from a projected 3.3% this year, and the Fed cutting its rate target to 3.5% by mid-2008. Another reason for the disconnect could be anticipation of easier credit conditions globally. The U.S. bond market is increasingly linked to its foreign counterparts, and there have been signs of slowing growth in Germany, Japan and China in recent weeks. --- Online Today: Journal editors David Wessel and Dave Kansas analyze the Fed\'s decision, at WSJ.com/Video.

In a knee-jerk reaction, the greenback fluctuated in narrow ranges as investors digested the Fed policy statement that accompanied the decision. The dollar exited active New York trading slightly higher versus levels immediately before the release of statement, but still down on the day. With few changes to the central bank\'s Aug. 8 statement, the Fed signaled little new to the currency market, analysts said. Prior to the release of the Fed\'s decision, investor concerns had ebbed about contagion from Tuesday\'s bloodless military takeover of the government in Thailand. The Thai baht stabilized and spillover effects to other emerging markets were insignificant, causing the dollar to give back its day-earlier gains. Late in New York, the euro was at $1.2687 from $1.2679. The dollar was at 117.45 yen from 117.61 yen. ""The dollar is pretty much where it was before,"" said Daniel Katzive, currency strategist at UBS in Greenwich, Conn. ""Right now we\'re just going sideways."" Indeed, though analysts pointed to some minor changes in the wording of the Fed\'s statement, the modifications weren\'t enough to move the greenback out of its recent ranges. The ""tacit message"" is that the Fed ""is increasingly acknowledging that the slowdown is proving more severe than they assumed a few months ago,"" said Naomi Fink, currency strategist at BNP Paribas in New York, and ""that the downside risks to growth that the [Federal Open Market Committee] has acknowledged all year have begun to crystallize to a greater extent."" --- Dan Molinski contributed to this article.

114,,2009-04-30 00:00:00,"['The Federal Reserve signaled it has no intention of pulling back from its aggressive efforts to revive the financial system, even though it acknowledged that the intensity of the recession has eased in recent weeks. The Fed said in a statement after its regular policy meeting that it would push forward with plans to substantially increase its holdings of mortgage-backed securities and Treasury securities in the months ahead, and suggested it could increase those purchases if markets and the economy veer further off track. The policy-making Federal Open Market Committee reiterated that it will keep its target for its key short-term interest rate -- the federal-funds rate at which banks lend to each other overnight -- near zero for an extended period. ""Although the economic outlook has improved modestly since the March meeting, partly reflecting some easing of financial market conditions, economic activity is likely to remain weak for a time,"" the Fed said. It noted that household spending ""has shown signs of stabilizing"" while businesses have cut inventories, investment and staffing. Still, officials are in no hurry to pull their foot off the monetary accelerator. The latest data have reassured officials that the economy is performing as their forecast anticipated, namely modest recovery in the second half of the year, with unemployment continuing to rise for several months. Considering the amount of slack built up as unemployment has risen and factories have curtailed output, officials see inflation as a remote risk, giving them a cause to continue to support the economy with low interest rates and aggressive purchases of assets. By purchasing Treasury notes, mortgage-backed securities, and debt issued by mortgage-finance firms Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the Fed is trying to push down a broad array of long-term interest rates, particularly those that affect the housing market. As of Tuesday, the Fed had purchased $74 billion of Treasury securities, a quarter of the $300 billion it has said it expected to purchase by September. It had purchased or committed to purchase a net $381 billion of mortgage-backed securities, roughly a third of the $1.25 trillion in such purchases it plans. ""They\'re in the implementation stage,"" said Laurence Meyer, vice chairman of Macroeconomic Advisers LLC, a forecasting firm. Some economists, including Mr. Meyer, believe the Fed might eventually need to ramp up purchases of Treasury notes, in light of the enormous amount of slack still in the system and the risk that inflation could become too low. The Fed has not bought as much of them as it has of mortgage-backed securities. Treasurys are a liquid market that could be easy to exit when the Fed feels the need to reverse its easy-money policies. The Fed left itself a lot of maneuvering room. In its statement, the Fed said it ""will continue to evaluate the timing and overall amounts of its purchases of securities in light of the evolving economic outlook and conditions in financial markets.""

Setting off the Wednesday session was a report from the Commerce Department that gross domestic product fell for three consecutive quarters for the first time in 34 years. Later, in an afternoon statement, the Fed\'s Federal Open Market Committee voted unanimously to keep the federal-funds target rate in a range near zero and reiterated its pledge to keep rates ""exceptionally low"" for an extended period. Together, a weak domestic outlook and concerned Federal Reserve would normally lead to a sliding market. However, investors looked past the economic malaise, as they have done in recent sessions, and bet the reports signaled a trough. ""We\'ve moved from a max defensive position to a little less of one,"" said Gary Flam, a portfolio manager with Bel Air Investment Advisors. ""That said, we\'re not going out into the deep end, just moving out of the kiddie pool.""

116,,2001-02-01 00:00:00,"['With yesterday\'s half-point interest rate cut, Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan is hoping to lift the nation\'s economic spirits before they pull the economy into recession. Together with another half-point cut earlier this year, the Fed\'s actions mark the central bank\'s most aggressive easing move since 1982. But there\'s a key difference between now and 19 years ago. Back then, the central bank was struggling to revive an economy that had fallen into deep recession, with unemployment rates near the double digits. This time around, Mr. Greenspan is administering medicine to a patient who\'s still showing remarkable health, including a jobless rate that, at 4%, is near a 30-year low. More than usual, the Fed chief appears to be engaged in a game of psychology, struggling less to revive a moribund economy than to restore a sense of confidence to the nation\'s consumers and businesses. He remains convinced that the New Economy is for real, and that it promises above-average economic growth in the years ahead. But recent surveys show that many consumers and businesses have lost that faith. New evidence of their gloom came on Tuesday, when the Conference Board reported that consumer confidence had slid to a four-year low, taking its biggest hit since the 1990-91 recession. The survey showed that consumers have yet to actually feel much pain. But they fear worse times ahead. The week before, the same New York-based research group reported that business confidence had hit its lowest point since 1980. ""Consumer and business confidence has eroded further, exacerbated by rising energy costs that continue to drain consumer-purchasing power and press on business profit margins,"" the Federal Open Market Committee said, in a statement that accompanied yesterday\'s cut to 5.5% from 6% in its target for the federal-funds rate. ""Partly as a consequence, retail sales and business spending on capital equipment have weakened appreciably. . . . Taken together, and with inflation contained, these circumstances have called for a rapid and forceful response of monetary policy."" The Fed\'s actions are aimed at Americans like Tim Bice, who owns his own small construction firm in Waseca, Minn. Mr. Bice has been contemplating starting a new business that doesn\'t experience the winter lulls that construction does. He\'s thinking about manufacturing homes indoors that can then be transported to a home site, in any season. He even located a place to start his business -- an empty radio factory. But in recent months, his enthusiasm for the project has waned. Business remains good, he says; if anything, he got to bid on building more new houses than was usual for January. But the outlook, he fears, is bleak. ""On the news every night, all these layoffs, people downsizing, everybody is talking recession, recession,"" he says. Fear of a recession can quickly bring on the real thing. ""Animal spirits,"" the British economist John Maynard Keynes once wrote, can hold the key to important economic variables, such as business investment. And new numbers out yesterday show that investment did drop in last year\'s fourth quarter. The government reported that the quarter\'s real, or inflation-adjusted, growth in gross domestic product slipped to an annual rate of 1.4%, its slowest pace since 1995. Household consumption, which makes up two-thirds of total economic spending, advanced at a respectable 2.9%. But business investment on equipment and software actually fell at a 5% rate -- a dramatic reversal from 21% growth in the first quarter of 2000. A big December drop reported last week in orders for capital goods, excluding aircraft and defense, suggests the capital retrenchment isn\'t over. That\'s being felt by companies like Cisco Systems Inc., the giant Internet-gear maker in San Jose, Calif. ""In November, when we first started to see a slowdown, we thought it would be a blip -- it looked like it wouldn\'t affect us,"" Cisco Chief Executive John Chambers said yesterday, according to Dow Jones Newswires. ""But then in early December it was obvious that things were slowing down with many of our customers much faster than people anticipated. I became concerned when the Fed didn\'t move, but now they\'re moving."" The slowdown in investment is troubling for three reasons, says Joshua Feinman, chief economist at Deutsche Asset Management in New York. First, it subtracts directly from total spending in the economy. Second, as companies cut back, suppliers of capital goods slash output and jobs, and their stock prices fall -- unsettling both employees and consumers. Third, and perhaps most important, if businesses slow their investment spending, that could undercut the rapid growth in productivity that has fueled hopes for above-average economic growth in the decade ahead. Many economists, including William Dudley, head of U.S. economic research at Goldman Sachs in New York, think Mr. Greenspan\'s rapid action now means a recession is less than a 50% probability. The Jan. 3 surprise cut -- which came between meetings of the FOMC, instead of at one of the committee\'s regularly scheduled gatherings -- helped stocks and corporate bonds turn in a healthy January performance. That makes it easier for companies to issue securities to fund new investment, and it makes holders of the securities feel wealthier and more inclined to spend. ""You don\'t want [confidence] to break,"" says Mr. Dudley. ""But the financial markets suggest we\'re not at that breaking point."" Mr. Dudley argues that maintaining confidence is the key to keeping a temporary slowdown from snowballing into a more serious recession. Since World War II, the unemployment rate has never gone up more than 0.33 percentage point during any period of economic growth, except during one strike-affected period, he notes. But in a recession, it has never gone up less than 1.9 percentage points. Once unemployment starts rising, it can be hard to stop. For all the talk of consumer confidence, business confidence may be just as critical at this juncture, and it is eroding even faster. When the key decision makers at the nation\'s largest corporations are feeling pessimistic, outlays by businesses for new equipment -- once a major driver of growth -- suffer. Last week, the Conference Board said that in the fourth quarter of 2000 CEO confidence plunged by its largest amount ever -- to levels not seen since 1980. CEOs\' expectations for conditions in their own industries six months from now fell to the lowest level since the survey began in 1976. Lynn Franco, who oversees the survey, says executives are quicker to shift their views on the economy than the average consumer. ""They generally tend to be a little more pessimistic,"" she says. ""The economy has decelerated so rapidly it has created enormous uncertainty in the minds of CEOs"" and chief financial officers, says Richard Berner, chief U.S. economist at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter. That\'s prompted belt-tightening at many companies. At discount brokerage firm Charles Schwab Corp., for instance, where sagging revenue has taken its toll, that means a cutback in all planned discretionary expenses. Among its cost-cutting measures, Schwab, which is based in San Francisco, already has announced a hiring freeze, and has told some employees to take several Fridays off as vacation days. ""We had to look at all nonessential projects and other areas within the company where we could either delay or put off costs,"" says spokesman Greg Gable. ""We\'re looking at the more mundane areas, too, like limiting travel wherever possible."" Similar cutbacks are happening in other industries. Jerry Jasinowski, president of the National Association of Manufacturers, says capital spending is one of the first lines of defense against falling profitability: ""Once businesses get in the mindset of cutting capital spending one quarter, they\'re not going to turn around on a dime the next quarter, particularly in view of the inventory overhang and high energy prices."" In recent weeks, the European Central Bank has constantly spoken of ""increasing uncertainty"" from the U.S. economic slowdown and its impact on the rest of the world. Its governing council gathers for a regular meeting today, though it hasn\'t indicated any plans to change rates. ""There are no signals yet that we should change our monetary policy,"" Ernst Welteke, an ECB council member, told reporters over the weekend, but an additional half-percentage-point Fed cut ""would certainly trigger a very diligent discussion and evaluation."" Yesterday, the Fed also cut the largely symbolic discount rate by half a point to 5%, for a total reduction of one percentage point since the start of the year. In its statement, the Fed said that ""the risks are weighted mainly toward conditions that may generate economic weakness in the foreseeable future,"" which means rates are more likely to fall soon than to rise. Some analysts think the next cut could happen before the FOMC meets again March 20. While there\'s been little hard data yet on how the economy performed in January, Mr. Greenspan may already have gotten a glimpse of a report coming out today from the National Association of Purchasing Management, which conducts a monthly survey of manufacturing activity. A former Fed insider says the central bank often gets an early look at that report. The Fed chief also may have gotten an early look at some of the data in the January employment report, due out tomorrow. The pace and magnitude of cuts show a shift in tactics by Mr. Greenspan, who has generally preferred to move in small, quarter-point steps in order to avoid startling the markets. The half-point Jan. 3 cut took markets by surprise, and even yesterday\'s cut, though less than the three-quarters point some had hoped for, was more than the consensus expectation just a few weeks ago. Former Fed Vice Chairman Alan Blinder says Mr. Greenspan is moving more aggressively because ""he sees a more pressing need than is normal. Second, the market has gotten better at thinking ahead to what the Fed is going to do. The result is that his previous worry -- that if you move too much at once you\'ll unsettle the markets -- isn\'t a worry any more."" Whether the Fed\'s action will be sufficient to revive the economy\'s sagging spirits remains to be seen. But some were optimistic yesterday. ""This half-point cut is exactly what was needed to brake our descent into a general downturn,"" says Mr. Jasinowski, the NAM president. ""The astute timing of the Fed\'s last two interest-rate moves . . . probably has prevented an economy-wide recession."" --- G.

117,,2007-09-19 00:00:00,"['NEW YORK -- The dollar hit a series of fresh record lows against the euro yesterday, after the Federal Reserve sliced a half a percentage point from its benchmark lending rates to counteract the effects of credit-market woes on the U.S. economy. A cut by the Federal Open Market Committee was widely expected, but a unanimously voted 50-basis-point reduction was at the high end of currency analysts\' expectations and caught some off guard. The result was a spike higher for the euro to an intraday top at $1.3983, the single currency\'s peak level since its introduction in January 1999. ""It\'s broadly negative for the dollar, because of the lower interest rates and the outlook for rate differentials,"" said Rebecca Patterson, global currency strategist at J.P. Morgan Chase &Co. The Fed explicitly said that the cut was required as a result of developments in the financial market, said Todd Elmer, currency strategist at Citigroup Inc. That ""degree of responsiveness"" took the market by surprise, he said. Now, higher-yielding currencies, like the euro, are going to show gains, because the Fed has, at least temporarily, ""alleviated some concern among investors that these trades are going to see further pressure,"" Mr. Elmer said. The upshot is a re-emergence of the carry trade, which involves investors borrowing currencies with low interest rates, such as the yen, to finance the purchase of currencies with higher returns. The dollar rose versus its Japanese counterpart after the FOMC announcement, exiting from active North American trading up more than a yen on the day. In late trading in New York, the euro was at $1.3970, up from $1.3867 late Monday, while the dollar was at 116.23 yen, up from 115.17 yen. Also, the euro was at 162.35 yen, up from 159.70 yen. The British pound was at $2.0120, up from $1.9956 late Monday. The dollar was quoted at 1.1827 Swiss francs, down from 1.1868 Swiss francs late Monday. The FOMC also lowered by 50 basis points to 5.25% the discount rate it charges banks that borrow directly from the Fed. Last month, officials cut the discount rate by 50 basis points in a rare inter-meeting move and modified rules to encourage use of that facility. ""Today\'s action is intended to help forestall some of the adverse effects on the broader economy that might otherwise arise from the disruptions in financial markets, and to promote moderate growth over time,"" the Fed said in the statement accompanying its decision. It also said that core inflation has improved ""modestly,"" but that some risks remain, and that it will monitor price developments ""carefully."" In a departure from previous statements, the Fed didn\'t cite high capacity utilization, a nod to tight labor markets, as an inflation risk. It didn\'t refer to a balance of risks between economic growth and inflation either. But the worry is clearly on the economy. ""Given that Fed rate moves only tend to really take effect six months to a year after the fact,"" noted Naomi Fink, currency analyst at BNP Paribas, its decision means ""this may not be the end of the financial-market moves that we\'ve seen. . . . It\'s only a matter of time before the euro clears $1.40."" The yen could lose ground to the euro and the dollar as investors adjust to lower U.S. interest rates. ""Real money investors are still in risk-averse mode, trying to digest the impact"" of the announcement, said Samarjit Shankar, director of global strategy at Bank of New York Mellon, immediately after the Fed release. When the dust settles, he said, expect fresh carry trades to come with a renewal of risk appetite, in light of a favorable reaction by the U.S. equities market, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average gaining 335.97 points by the end of trading yesterday. Elsewhere, Canada\'s dollar touched a fresh 30-year high again yesterday on the Fed\'s decision, with the greenback dropping to $1.0139 after the FOMC made its announcement. The Fed cut, said market strategist Stewart Hall of HSBC Securities Canada in Toronto, has worked to the Canadian dollar\'s advantage by underscoring the monetary-policy divergence between the U.S. and Canadian central banks. Canada\'s central bank has suggested that it is unlikely to adopt any rate-changing policies in the near term. The Canadian dollar had surged earlier this week, as oil prices continued to rise. --- Paul Evans in Toronto contributed to this article.

118,,2007-09-19 00:00:00,"['Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke moved aggressively to stop the spreading credit crunch from sinking the nation\'s economy with a surprising half-percentage-point cut in interest rates, casting aside for now worries about appearing to bail out investors. The cut, which exceeded the quarter-point reduction most economists had expected, signals that Mr. Bernanke, fearing broad damage from the market turmoil that erupted a month ago, preferred to risk doing too much rather than too little. The move came amid a sizable drop in home sales, construction and prices that could send mortgage defaults higher and damp consumer spending. With yesterday\'s move, Mr. Bernanke may have shown himself closer in style and tactics to predecessor Alan Greenspan than some market watchers had suspected. That carries risks: Critics may start referring to the ""Bernanke put,"" as they once spoke of the ""Greenspan put"" under the former Fed chairman. (A put option protects its holder from a loss on an investment.) Yet Mr. Bernanke has shown that giving the impression he might be shielding investors matters less than keeping the economy out of recession. That\'s how Mr. Greenspan interpreted the Fed\'s action. ""The question they had to weigh was, \'Was punishing those [speculators] more important than doing something that they perceived to be in the greater good?\'"" he said in an interview yesterday with Fox News Channel\'s Neil Cavuto. The Fed cut its target for the federal-funds rate, charged on overnight loans between banks, to 4.75% from 5.25%. It also cut its discount rate, charged on direct loans to banks, by the same amount, to 5.25%. The cuts sparked a rally on Wall Street. The Dow Jones Industrial Average, up just 70 points before the decision was announced, soared 335.97 points, or 2.5%, to 13739.39, its biggest percentage gain since 2003. But in a sign some investors fear that the cut could also foster inflationary pressures, the dollar fell sharply, long-term Treasury-bond yields rose, and oil prices also jumped. Crude-oil futures surged 94 cents a barrel to $81.51, a second consecutive record on the New York Mercantile Exchange but still well short of the inflation-adjusted high of $101.57 hit in April 1980. In a break from the past, the Fed did not say whether higher inflation or weaker growth was its greatest worry or whether those worries were equal; it thus gave no hint about what its next move would be. ""Some inflation risks remain,"" it said. But ""developments in financial markets . . . have increased the uncertainty surrounding the economic outlook."" Markets put high odds on a quarter-point cut at the Fed\'s next meeting, on Oct. 30. The half-point cut put an exclamation point on a drama that began more than a month ago. At its last meeting, Aug. 7, the Fed left the federal-funds rate, its main target for short-term interest rates, at 5.25% and signaled continued worries about inflation. Days later, credit-market concerns erupted in Europe over losses in bank-linked hedge funds and off-balance-sheet investment vehicles that had purchased U.S. subprime mortgages. In the following weeks, investors and lenders became increasingly suspicious of each other and unwilling to lend, driving up interest rates for all sorts of borrowers. On Wall Street, cries soon rose for the Fed to cut rates immediately. Instead, the Fed on Aug. 17 cut its discount rate by half a percentage point and eased terms on direct loans from its discount window in hopes banks would use the Fed\'s cash to restore liquidity to credit markets. The aim, Fed officials said at the time, was to make a distinction between the Fed\'s role of keeping the financial system functioning normally, and its responsibility for economic stability. By contrast, Mr. Greenspan tended to treat financial stability and economic stability as inextricably linked, and saw a rate cut as the best way both to restore investor confidence and cushion the economy. His critics say those cuts over time emboldened investors to take on ever more debt and drive asset prices -- first stocks, then houses -- to ever-loftier levels, making the ultimate correction more painful. That criticism has intensified both with the turmoil in housing and the recent release of Mr. Greenspan\'s memoir. Mr. Bernanke heard that criticism, but ultimately has shown himself of much the same mind as Mr. Greenspan: the Fed can\'t take responsibility for asset prices, only for growth and inflation. ""Economic growth was moderate during the first half of the year, but the tightening of credit conditions has the potential to intensify the housing correction and to restrain economic growth more generally,"" the Fed said in a statement accompanying yesterday\'s decision. ""Today\'s action is intended to help forestall some of the adverse effects on the broader economy that might otherwise arise from the disruptions in financial markets."" Fed officials had been leaning toward a rate cut in recent weeks, but the case for the larger move may have been sealed by a report two weeks ago revealing that employment declined in August for the first time in four years. That showed the economy had slowed markedly even before the full force of the market turmoil had been felt. As recently as July Fed officials had expected the economy to grow around 2.5% this year. While the Fed has lowered that forecast, the size of its rate cut was motivated more by the wide range of possibilities around that new forecast, due to the still-unknown reaction of business and households to tighter credit markets. The larger-than-expected cut represents insurance against more catastrophic scenarios. The market turmoil is likely to hit housing first and hardest. Investors have grown wary of holding loans from all but the safest borrowers. That has led to a sharp jump in rates on ""jumbo"" mortgages -- those above $417,000 -- which can\'t be sold to federally chartered mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. The ranks of home buyers have thinned, especially in high-priced markets, and borrowers with shaky credit have difficulty finding a mortgage at any rate. The lack of buyers will likely drag down sales, make it even harder for home builders to trim bloated inventories, and force them to drop prices further. John Makin, a scholar at the American Enterprise Institute, said even with the rate cut, the economy will probably shrink in the fourth quarter of the year, though by less than if the Fed hadn\'t acted. ""If the economy continues to weaken, credit conditions will weaken again because [of] falling housing prices. You\'ve got to break that cycle, where you have bad credit, bad economy, bad credit, bad economy. They\'re taking a first step to break that cycle."" David Seiders, chief economist at the National Association of Home Builders, said even though Treasury-bond yields -- the main determinant of mortgage rates -- rose slightly yesterday, the rate cut might boost credit market confidence and lead to a narrowing in the spread between mortgage rates and Treasury yields, allowing mortgage rates to fall. Several banks announced they were cutting their prime rates, the benchmark for many consumer and commercial loans, to 7.75% from 8.25%. It was only a month ago the Fed declared it was still more worried about higher inflation than weaker growth. Those concerns haven\'t entirely ebbed: yesterday the Fed said that while underlying inflation had ""improved modestly this year . . . some inflation risks remain."" Allan Meltzer, a Fed historian at Carnegie Mellon University, said the cut was a mistake, reminiscent of the 1960s and 1970s, when the Fed put more emphasis on unemployment and less on inflation in its actions. That caused inflation to ratchet higher over the years until Fed Chairman Paul Volcker brought it down again. ""What\'s the market saying?"" Mr. Meltzer said. ""That this is an expansive move that will bail out the economy."" He added: ""I never believed in the \'Greenspan put.\' But the market believes it, and now it will certainly believe there will be a \'Bernanke put.\'"" Some Fed officials may have shared similar concerns either about inflation or about the risk of stoking further speculation. Only seven of the Fed\'s 12 reserve banks requested the half-point cut in the discount rate. Four of the five absent banks are headed by presidents who have raised such concerns. None of the four, however, have a vote on the Fed\'s policy-making Federal Open Market Committee this year, and that may be why the vote to cut the federal-funds rate was unanimous.

119,,2005-07-01 00:00:00,"['The Federal Reserve raised interest rates for the ninth time in a year, signaling confidence in the economy and concern about inflation -- even as bond investors worry that a downturn is in the offing. The Fed, as widely expected, raised its target for the federal-funds rate, charged on overnight loans between banks, to 3.25% from 3%. Yesterday\'s increase came exactly one year after the Fed began to lift rates from an extraordinary low level. But in that time, long-term interest rates, which are determined by market forces and are the benchmark for mortgages and corporate loans, have actually declined. That decline has fueled a debate over whether the Fed is going too far or hasn\'t gone far enough. Some say the Fed should pause in its rate increases because the decline, together with a downdraft in stock and commodity prices, foreshadows slower economic growth. Others say short-term rates should keep rising because low long-term rates have given an extra boost to the economy -- in particular housing. For now, the Fed is in the latter camp. In the statement accompanying its decision, the Fed said, ""Although energy prices have risen further, the expansion remains firm."" That\'s a more upbeat assessment than the statement after its May 3 meeting, which observed that growth had ""slowed somewhat."" Yesterday\'s statement said ""pressures on inflation remain elevated,"" though it dropped its May 3 assessment that ""pricing power is more evident."" The Fed said interest rates are ""accommodative,"" i.e. low enough to stimulate economic activity, and will likely rise further at a ""measured"" pace. ""Measured"" has come to mean a quarter percentage point per meeting. The Fed funds rate has risen from 1% to 3.25% in the last year, but at the same time, the 30-year fixed rate mortgage has fallen to 5.6% from 6.3% while the one-year adjustable rate mortgage has edged up only to 4.2% from 4.1%. Low mortgage rates have lifted housing construction, sales and prices to levels many Fed officials worry are unsustainable. Housing was the subject of a special discussion at the Fed\'s two-day meeting this week, according to several private economists close to the Fed. As they did with stocks in the 1990s, Fed officials disavow any responsibility for reining in a potential real-estate bubble. But they do believe housing activity and prices are fueling economic growth, adding to inflation pressures, all of which are reasons to keep tightening. Fed officials have also warned the banks they regulate against lax mortgage lending. All 11 voting members of the 18-member policy-making Federal Open Market Committee agreed to yesterday\'s rate increase. (One voting seat is vacant.) The Fed also raised its lesser-used discount rate, charged on Fed advances to commercial banks, to 4.25% from 4%. Commercial banks raised their prime rate to 6.25% from 6%. Laurence Meyer, a former Fed governor and now an analyst at Macroeconomic Advisers LLC, a forecasting firm, predicted the Fed will raise the funds rate one or two more times, to 3.5% or 3.75%, then pause to ""take stock."" If inflation creeps higher, even dovish Fed officials will support further increases, he said. Paul McCulley, a fund manager and economist at Pacific Investment Management Co., a big bond fund manager, said yesterday\'s rate increase ought to be the Fed\'s last. He said declines in manufacturing activity surveys and global freight rates are ""screaming, unambiguously"" that the global economy is decelerating. But Jan Loeys, global markets strategist at J.P. Morgan in London, says long term rates have been depressed because corporations around the world are investing and borrowing less than normal, and the extra capital has poured into the U.S., where investment is relatively firm. This means the U.S. is ""stronger than it otherwise would be,"" and the Fed should raise its short-term interest rate target to 4.5% by early next year. --- Journal Link: WSJ.com subscribers can see how mortgage rates have moved in the past year, plus search current rates on consumer loans, at WSJ.com/PersonalJournal.

120,,2005-07-01 00:00:00,"[""The dollar slipped against the euro but touched to a 39-week high versus the yen, as reshuffling of investors' bets continued to drive activity amid a muted reaction to an interest-rate increase from the Federal Reserve. The policy-making Federal Open Market Committee adjusted its benchmark target rate by a quarter percentage point to 3.25%. The FOMC has raised rates for nine consecutive meetings and indicated that it will continue to do so. However, the Fed decision did little to affect either the dollar's modest decline versus the euro or the sharp rally versus the yen that had come earlier in the session. Some analysts suggested that the yen's losses represent a continuing pullback in expectations for a revaluation of the Chinese yuan. The yen's fortunes in recent months have ebbed and flowed along with speculation over China's currency policy, since many Asian currencies are expected to appreciate if China does allow the yuan to strengthen. U.S. pressure on China to revalue its currency eased somewhat, when Sen. Charles Schumer (D., N.Y.), and Sen. Lindsey Graham, (R., S.C.), said they had agreed to delay a vote on their proposed legislation to put a 27.5% tariff on Chinese imports to offset the impact on trade of China's currency peg. The news came following a closed-door meeting in Washington with Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan and U.S. Treasury Secretary John Snow. In late New York trading, the euro was at $1.2102, up from $1.2064 late Wednesday. The dollar was at 110.91 yen, just off the 39-week high of 110.99 yen it hit earlier in the session and compared with 110.55 late Wednesday. Versus the Swiss franc, the dollar was at 1.2817 Swiss francs, down from 1.2829 francs late Wednesday. The euro was at 134.23 yen, up from 133.33 yen late Wednesday, and the pound was at $1.7917, down sharply from $1.8045 late Wednesday. Traders will be looking to see whether the euro's rebound versus most currencies, as well as the broad weakness in the yen and the pound, are going to continue, said Grant Wilson, senior foreign-exchange trader at Mellon Bank in Pittsburgh. In general, the session was marked by weakness in both the yen and the pound, and by a technical bounce back in the euro which lured an array of buyers. The euro's advance versus a number of currencies, including the pound and the yen, helped lift the common currency versus the dollar. The yen's decline led to a fresh five-week low versus the euro and a 39-week low versus the dollar. Just days after the dollar pushed through the key 110.00-yen level, it was now knocking on the 111.00-yen level with an intraday high of 110.99 yen.

121,,2005-07-01 00:00:00,"['The high-stakes game of poker between the Federal Reserve and the Treasurys market continued, with bond investors still calling the central bank\'s bluff over the extent of future rate increases. The Fed yesterday raised its federal-funds target rate by another quarter percentage point to 3.25%, and gave no sign that a pause in tightening is imminent. In reaction, long-dated Treasurys rallied strongly. This test of wills is the basis of a bet that could make or break many fixed-income investors during the second half of the year. It revolves around whether the Fed will halt its monetary tightening when the federal-funds rate reaches the area around 3.5% or 3.75%, or keep adjusting the cost of overnight borrowing in measured steps toward or beyond the 4% threshold. For now, the Fed\'s policy-setting Federal Open Market Committee, in its role as the ultimate judge and jury of the bond market\'s various swings in sentiment, is keeping its options open. At the conclusion of its two-day policy meeting, the FOMC not only met the expectations of a rate hike, it also released a statement similar in substance to the one from its May meeting. ""Although energy prices have risen further, the [economic] expansion remains firm and labor-market conditions continue to improve gradually,"" the FOMC said. ""Pressures on inflation have stayed elevated, but longer-term inflation expectations remain well-contained."" Dominic Konstam, head of interest rate strategy at Credit Suisse First Boston in New York, said, ""The Fed is not giving any ground on the idea among many investors that a pause is around the corner. Even if they do decide to pause tightening policy in a couple of months, the Fed wants to maintain a restrictive face for the bond market."" The six-week hiatus before the next Fed meeting provides the market with some breathing room. But it\'s walking a very fine line. ""There is no longer much of a margin for error,"" said Stephen Stanley, chief economist at RBS Greenwich Capital in Greenwich, Conn. He noted that current market forecasts for the year-end federal-funds rate and Treasurys out to 10 years in maturity are all below 4%. Despite the current debate over the economy\'s growth prospects, some investors believe things are much better than low Treasury yields imply. Economic factors ""will ultimately prevail, and rates are likely to move meaningfully higher than they are today,"" said Colin Lundgren, head of institutional fixed-income at American Express Asset Management Group in Minneapolis. He expects rate hikes beyond the 3.75% expected by the market, subject to future economic data. Aside from data, the test of wills between the bond market and the FOMC may be resolved to some degree by Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan\'s semiannual address before Congress on July 20. ""Greenspan will be able to flesh out in great detail policy makers\' thinking on the outlook and the stance of policy,"" said RBS Greenwich\'s Stanley. This has the bond market prepared for another increase of a quarter percentage point, and some language that hints at a pause after one more increase to 3.75%. Should the Fed ultimately pause, one big change in Treasurys would be a widening in the difference between short- and long-term yields -- in market terms, a steepening yield curve -- as investors build an inflation premium into longer-dated Treasury yields. For now, flattening remains the driving trend. And in post-FOMC trading, the margin between two- and 10-year note yields continued to shrink, falling below 0.3 percentage point for the first time since the start of 2001. ""Most of the rally in bonds is explained by the compression of inflation,"" said Eric Hiller, head of derivatives interest rate strategy at Bank of America. ""The curve is certainly flatter, with some room to continue."" At 4 p.m., the benchmark 10-year note was up 17/32 point, or $5.31 per $1,000 face value, at 101 21/32. Its yield fell to 3.922% from 3.986% Wednesday, as yields move inversely to prices. The 30-year bond was up 1 7/32 points at 118 15/32 to yield 4.193%, down from 4.263% Wednesday.

122,,2007-05-10 00:00:00,"['The dollar rose against the euro and the yen after the Federal Reserve left interest rates unchanged and maintained an optimistic outlook on the U.S. economy. The policy-setting Federal Open Market Committee kept rates steady at 5.25% for the seventh straight meeting. It made no significant changes to its statement compared with the statement from its previous meeting in March, saying the economy is ""likely to expand"" moderately in coming quarters. While the Fed acknowledged weak first-quarter growth rates -- which last month helped send the dollar to a record low against the euro -- it didn\'t dwell on the fact as some currency investors feared. This suggests the Fed saw those weak growth rates as the ""bottoming out"" of the economy, and expects stronger growth going forward, said David Powell, currency strategist at IDEAGlobal. ""The big message [for currency markets] is that the Fed didn\'t have greater acknowledgment of slow first-quarter growth,"" he said. ""As a result, the dollar has rallied."" Late afternoon, the euro was trading at $1.3526 from $1.3543 late Tuesday, while the dollar was at 120.05 yen from 119.93 yen. The euro was at 162.38 yen from 162.45 yen late Tuesday. The dollar was at 1.2185 Swiss francs from 1.2180 Swiss francs, while the pound gained against the dollar at $1.9938 from $1.9894 late Tuesday. The Fed\'s decision to shrug off the weak first-quarter growth rates is likely due to strong April activity readings on the manufacturing and services sectors, traders said. Those reports last week suggest higher growth rates in the second quarter, they said. Analysts also noted that the Fed repeated that its top worry remains the risk of a surge in inflation rather than continued slow growth. This helped the dollar because inflation can lead to higher interest rates and thus higher returns on dollar-based assets. ""The second big element behind the dollar\'s rally is the lack of acknowledgment that core inflation slowed in the last report,"" Mr. Powell said. Traders said the statement, while expected, bodes well for yen carry trades, where investors borrow yen at low interest rates to buy dollars or other higher-yielding currencies. Carry trades do well in low-volatility environments because investors can reap profits from interest-rate differentials without worrying about sharp changes to the exchange rates that may erase these profits. The Fed\'s near copy of its previous statement kept expectations for future rate adjustments little changed, suggesting the dollar\'s knee-jerk gains are unlikely to be sustained.

123,,2007-05-10 00:00:00,"['They wanted change and got it, but nowhere near enough. Despite a tweak in its language on growth, the Federal Open Market Committee\'s decision to reiterate that inflation risk remains its ""predominant"" concern leaves the Treasury market stranded where it has stood for weeks now -- range-bound and uncertain where to turn forsome clear direction. As expected, the FOMC kept rates on hold at 5.25% for the seventh meeting running, extending to 11 months the period in which the Fed hasn\'t adjusted rates. In its statement, the Fed budged not an inch on inflation, repeating that price pressures excluding energy and food remain ""somewhat elevated."" The market\'s reaction said it all. From little-changed before the meeting, Treasurys sold off across the curve. The two-year note, which was unchanged for a yield of 4.67% before the statement, fell 3/32 point, or $0.9375 per $1,000 face value, to 99 19/32. Its yield rose to 4.726% from 4.671% Tuesday, as yields move inversely to prices. The new benchmark 10-year note stood at 98 21/32 to yield 4.669% late in the afternoon. ""I think that as much as anything it\'s a positioning trade . . . . A lot of speculative money was focused on the fact that five of the last six times when the Fed left rates on hold, the front end had gone on to rally"" after the meeting, said Jason Evans, head of government trading at Deutsche Bank in New York. ""The vast majority of people were long in anticipation of the meeting"" -- betting on price gains -- and had to reverse their bets after the statement, he added. For T.J. Marta, rates strategist at RBC Capital Markets, the most significant aspect of the statement was ""the pulled punch"" on inflation, which leaves market bets on a third-quarter rate cut precariously balanced. ""The fact that they could have downgraded their inflation assessment but didn\'t"" was what pushed the market lower, he said. For Treasury traders, the May FOMC meeting now passes onto a lengthening list of missed opportunities for the market to break out the ranges it has been stuck in. The statement reiterated the Fed\'s view that the economy will likely ""continue to expand at a moderate pace,"" even as it acknowledged that recent growth has slowed. Despite the weak first-quarter growth data, the tame March inflation readings and last Friday\'s softer nonfarm-payrolls growth, the 10-year yield has been stuck in a 4.60%-4.70% range for three weeks. It has been in a 4.58%-4.78% range for the last 5 1/2 weeks and in a 4.44%-4.78% range for almost three months. While the market has put a slate of bond issuance behind it and Treasury debt paydowns will soon leave investors flush with cash, there is fresh inflation data in coming days that could renew the pressure on Treasury prices if they don\'t conform to March\'s weakness.

124,,2007-11-01 00:00:00,"['NEW YORK -- The dollar dropped to its seventh straight record low against the euro yesterday, a response to the Federal Reserve\'s cut in U.S. interest rates. The dollar also lost heavily against its Canadian counterpart, touching its lowest level in modern times. The dollar maintained gains on the yen, after the Bank of Japan voted to keep interest rates on hold during Asian trading. The euro broke the $1.45 barrier to $1.4508 after the Federal Open Market Committee announced its interest-rates cuts. At 4 p.m., the euro was at $1.4486, up from $1.4436 late Monday, while the dollar was at 115.35 yen, up from 114.69. The euro was at 167.10 yen, up from 165.67 yen. The United Kingdom pound was at $2.0793, up from $2.0683. The dollar was quoted at 1.1581 Swiss francs, down from 1.1590. The Canadian dollar extended its gains to C$0.9422, its modern-day high against the U.S. dollar. At 4 p.m., the U.S. dollar was trading at C$0.9448, down from C$0.9529 Tuesday. The C$0.9422 level dates from Aug. 21, 1957. It represents the strongest level reached by the Canadian dollar since the Bank of Canada was established and charged with managing the currency in the 1930s. Earlier versions of the Canadian currency reached their strongest level versus the U.S. dollar in the early 1860s, when the U.S. was still embroiled in the Civil War and issues of legal tender in Canada were fixed to the gold standard. Yesterday\'s late gains for the Canadian dollar were an extension of the rally set off following the Fed\'s cuts in interest rates. The Fed\'s quarter-point trimming of its benchmark rate eliminated the long-standing U.S. rate premium and brought administered U.S. and Canadian rates into alignment at equivalent 4.50% settings. ""As long as the Fed is the only central bank in the G-10 cutting rates, the U.S. dollar is going to underperform,"" said Sophia Drossos, a currency strategist at Morgan Stanley in New York. ""People are contrasting the path for Fed and ECB [European Central Bank]."" After euro-zone data confirmed rising inflation, it is becoming clearer that the ECB will keep its rate on hold when it meets Nov. 8, analysts said. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority intervened in currency markets five times yesterday, selling 7.828 billion Hong Kong dollars to defend the local currency\'s peg to the U.S. dollar. Authorities in South Korea, the Philippines and India bought dollars, traders said, to limit the damage a strong local currency inflicts on their export-reliant economies.

125,,2007-11-01 00:00:00,"['The Federal Reserve cut interest rates by a quarter point, but with an eye on surging energy prices and other inflationary threats, it strongly discouraged expectations of further cuts. The decision, following a half-point cut six weeks ago, shows Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke is grappling with risks on two fronts: Plunging home construction and eroding real-estate values could hit the broader economy, while rising oil and commodity prices, combined with a falling dollar, could spoil the Fed\'s hopes to contain inflation. Developments yesterday underlined the tension. Though data showed the U.S. economy growing at a faster-than-expected 3.9% annual rate in the third quarter, a purchasing managers\' survey showed weak manufacturing in the Midwest in October, the latest in a series of such reports. At the same time, crude-oil futures prices jumped $4.15 to $94.53 a barrel, a nominal record, and gold futures settled at $792.00 an ounce, a 27-year high. For now, though, investors appear to believe neither of those scenarios will materialize. Stocks initially fell after the announcement dashed expectations of more rate cuts, but then recovered, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average climbing 137.54 points, or 1%, to 13930.01, less than 235 points from its record. The Fed cut its target for the federal-funds rate, charged on overnight loans between banks, to 4.5% from 4.75%, after cutting it half a point in September. The combined cuts were designed, it said in the accompanying statement, to ""help forestall some of the adverse effects on the broader economy"" from the summer credit crunch that drove up interest rates paid by many homeowners, corporations and banks. Growth was solid in the third quarter but likely to slow with the ""intensification of the housing correction,"" the Fed said in its statement. Core inflation, which excludes food and energy, has improved, it said, ""but recent increases in energy and commodity prices, among other factors, may put renewed upward pressure on inflation."" As a result, the Fed said, ""after this [rate cut], the upside risks to inflation roughly balance the downside risks to growth."" In the weeks leading up to the meeting, Fed officials saw their choice as no cut or a quarter-point ease. But their room to maneuver was limited by the fact that markets had become certain there would be a cut and, by last week, perhaps even a larger, half-point cut. Many on Wall Street justified their predictions on the grounds that Fed officials hadn\'t publicly countered them. Fed officials don\'t like to do something just because the markets expect it. But with futures markets assigning a 92% probability yesterday morning to a cut, a failure to deliver would have been the biggest surprise in the 14 years for which comparable data is available, according to Bianco Research LLC, a Chicago financial-research firm. Many predicted that would have led to a stock selloff and increased reluctance to lend. Alan Blinder, a former Fed vice chairman who teaches at Princeton University, said, ""The Fed did not make their views very clear to the markets for about a three-week period in October when they could have. As a result, they wound up being pushed by the market. The Fed has a communications problem when the market\'s thinking diverges from the Fed\'s and the Fed doesn\'t say anything to get back in line."" But Mr. Bernanke has been less inclined than his predecessor Alan Greenspan to try to steer market expectations. And in any case, officials also saw good economic reasons to ease borrowing conditions. Markets remain unsettled and the housing slump could yet spill over more broadly to consumer spending, already weighed down by high energy costs. By some estimates a 4.75% funds rate is high relative to inflation and growth, implying the Fed was likely to ease eventually. Doing so now rather than later bought insurance against worst-case scenarios. There were hints the decision was a close call. Federal Open Market Committee members voted 9 to 1 to cut, the first time this year a vote hasn\'t been unanimous. Thomas Hoenig, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, dissented, preferring no cut. Just six of the 12 reserve banks requested the parallel decrease in the discount rate, charged on direct Fed loans to banks, to 5% from 5.25%. That suggests presidents of some of the other banks also would have preferred to stand pat. Just five of the 12 bank presidents have a vote on the FOMC in any given year. Perhaps mirroring the differing views inside the Fed, outsiders criticized the decision from both sides. Some said the Fed is underestimating the risks posed by the housing bust and credit crunch and will have to ease monetary policy again before long. ""The bursting of the housing bubble and strains in parts of the credit markets are profoundly deflationary events, and the Fed\'s concerns seem out of place,"" Bank Credit Analyst, a financial research service, said. But others say the Fed, despite yesterday\'s promise to monitor inflation pressure, risks stoking it. ""The Fed has to walk the walk as well as talk the talk,"" said John Ryding, an economist at Bear Stearns. ""They have to, should the numbers demand it, be willing to reverse the rate cuts. With gold up sharply and the dollar down, the market is still questioning the Fed\'s commitment to do what it says."" The expected inflation rate as implied by trading in inflation-protected Treasury bonds also rose yesterday, though that may reflect short-term trading dynamics. Despite the rhetoric, the Fed\'s leadership probably isn\'t too worried about inflation. Officials believe the tendency of a lower dollar or higher energy prices to become embedded in underlying inflation has declined significantly in recent decades. Their principal source of inflation concern -- the low level of spare capacity in the economy -- has waned as the unemployment rate rises and the economy slows. Wage and benefit costs rose at a subdued rate in the third quarter, the Labor Department said yesterday. The economy is expected to slow sharply in the fourth quarter as high energy prices bite into consumer spending and housing construction tumbles further. On the other hand, the Fed doesn\'t see the self-reinforcing dynamics that lead to recession, such as in 2001, when it had to cut rates repeatedly. Rather, it sees the economy as sagging temporarily, as the pool of potential homeowners shrinks to match the tightened terms of credit and the inventory of unsold new homes is worked down, after which it expects growth will return to a normal rate.

126,,2004-03-17 00:00:00,"['NEW YORK -- The dollar hit a three-week low against the yen, but was little changed against the euro after Federal Reserve policy makers signaled no shift in the outlook for interest rates. The Federal Open Market Committee not only left its key interest rate at a 46-year low of 1%, as expected, but also reiterated its stance that inflationary pressures are low enough that it ""can be patient in removing its policy accommodation."" Fed officials also acknowledged the recent batch of disappointing employment reports, noting in their postmeeting statement that, ""Although job losses have slowed, new hiring has lagged."" The statement reaffirmed market expectations that the Fed would hold off from raising rates until at least late 2004, which may continue to weigh on the dollar. Low U.S. rates have been a major factor in the dollar\'s long-term downtrend because it makes it more difficult to attract enough foreign investment to fund the U.S. current-account deficit. However, the dollar was mostly directionless in choppy trading against most currencies after the Fed\'s decision. ""The dollar consequences will be marginal at best,"" said Jason Bonanca, director and currency strategist at Credit Suisse First Boston in New York. ""The Fed\'s still not talking about removing policy accommodation, [so] this is not dovish enough to reignite dollar bearishness."" Marc Chandler, chief currency strategist at HSBC Bank in New York, agreed that the statement included ""nothing really new substantially to elicit much of a response in the forex market."" Instead, the biggest moves in the dollar came against the yen amid continued speculation that the Bank of Japan would ease up on large-scale intervention. The dollar fell as far as 108.65 yen, a level not seen since late February. The dollar\'s slide against the yen started a chain reaction during the New York session, pushing European currencies down. That, in turn, helped the dollar recoup most of its overnight losses against the European currencies, which were due in large part to continued jitters about an increase in global terrorism. Late yesterday afternoon, the dollar was trading at 108.84 yen, down sharply from 110.31 yen late Monday in New York. The euro was at $1.2264, down slightly from $1.2271, and was lower against the yen at 133.40 yen from 135.40 yen. Against the Swiss franc, the dollar was at 1.2784 francs, up from 1.2752 francs, while sterling remained higher on the day at $1.8110 versus $1.8057 late Monday. In recent weeks, the Bank of Japan, which intervenes on behalf of the Ministry of Finance, had apparently switched tactics by buying dollars even when the U.S. currency was rallying. The more aggressive stance was viewed as a move to push down the yen ahead of the March 31 fiscal year end to assist Japanese exporters and others that need to repatriate money. --- Jamie McGeever contributed to this article.

127,,2004-03-17 00:00:00,"['NEW YORK -- Indications that the Federal Reserve will remain very patient before raising interest rates triggered a strong afternoon rally in Treasurys. The Federal Open Market Committee, the Fed\'s rate-setting arm, kept official interest rates at a more-than-four-decade low of 1%. The FOMC said the odds of an ""unwelcome"" fall in inflation are ""almost equal"" to the risk of inflation. The Fed also noted that new hiring has ""lagged"" -- a less upbeat view on labor markets than it expressed in late January -- and that it can remain patient in removing its policy accommodation. The statement turned around the bond market, which had traded lower in price prior to the FOMC decision, and pushed yields down to near eight-month lows. Traders had worried that the Fed would adopt a neutral stance on inflation risks and perhaps pave the way for higher rates later this year. ""It\'s a major statement of where the Fed is leaning. . . . Rates are really on hold at least through the end of this year, if not well into the beginning of next year,"" said Mary Ann Hurley, vice president of fixed-income trading at D.A. Davidson in Seattle. Some traders said the outlook for U.S. rates to remain low likely will encourage continued ""carry trade"" activity -- a popular strategy that involves borrowing in low-yielding securities and investing in markets with higher yields. Craig Coats, head of fixed income at Keefe, Bruyette &Woods in New York expects the exuberance in Treasurys to be short-lived. ""I think we\'ve probably seen the bulk of the rally, and we\'ll be here for the next couple of weeks until we get the next payroll number,"" he said. The next Labor Department report on monthly nonfarm payrolls growth is slated for April 2. The Fed\'s patience on monetary policy comes despite continuing signs that the economy is growing in the 4%-to-4.5% range, which could eventually trigger price pressures, some investors believe. ""Longer term, we think that rates are fundamentally too low relative to the prospects for economic growth and the potential that we could see inflation pass through from higher commodity prices,"" said John Miller, portfolio manager at Nuveen Investments. Economic reports yesterday were mixed. The Commerce Department reported that housing starts fell by 4% to a seasonally adjusted 1.855 million annual rate in February, well below the 1% increase expected by economists. However, a retail-chain-store sales index from the International Council of Shopping Centers and UBS rose by 0.5% in the week ended March 13, compared with the week before, on a seasonally adjusted, same-store basis. At 4 p.m., the benchmark 10-year note was up 20/32 point, or $6.25 per $1,000 face value, at 102 18/32. Its yield fell to 3.689% from 3.762% Monday, as yields move inversely to prices. The 30-year bond\'s price was up 30/32 point at 111 2/32 to yield 4.650%, down from 4.706% Monday.   Corporate &Junk Bonds High-yield bonds fell around 1/2 point, and Tenet Healthcare Corp.\'s 7 3/8% bonds due 2013 fell one point to 86.5 bid after the company said it anticipates negative cash flow, renegotiations of credit facilities and a credit downgrade. Standard &Poor\'s and Moody\'s Investors Service recently cut Tenet\'s ratings. S&P rates its senior unsecured bonds single-B-minus, and Moody\'s rates them single-B3. Elsewhere, terms were revised for Nextel Communications Inc.\'s $500 million deal via Credit Suisse First Boston and J.P. Morgan. It initially had been priced at 97.243 with a 5.875% coupon to yield 6.25% -- terms that posed tax concerns, people familiar with the deal said. Revisions increased the price to 97.795 and the coupon to 5.95%, but kept the yield at 6.25%, according to IFR Credit. The bonds were up slightly in the secondary market at 98 bid. A $6.7 billion deal by the Pacific Gas &Electric unit of PG&E Corp. is expected to be priced today. It would be the largest issue by an electric utility in the U.S. dollar market, according to Dealogic data. --- Liz Rappaport and Mara Lemos contributed to this article.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 76.11 points, or 0.72%, to 10481.52, and is down 2.8% for the year. The policy-making Federal Open Market Committee raised its overnight lending rate target a quarter percentage point to 3.75%, the 11th such increase in 15 months. In an accompanying statement, the Fed said that it didn\'t expect the destruction wrought by Hurricane Katrina to ""pose a persistent threat"" to the U.S. economy, and that it could continue to raise interest rates at a ""measured"" pace. Rising short-term interest rates can keep inflation in check, but can also stifle economic activity and corporate earnings -- a concern that weighed on stock investors, along with worries about U.S. fuel supplies as Rita strengthened to a Category 2 hurricane and threatened Texas oil-refining areas. ""It\'s a very skittish time for investors,"" said Liz Ann Sonders, chief investment strategist for Charles Schwab Corp. Meanwhile, the Fed\'s move helped to quell bond investors\' fears that inflation will accelerate amid high fuel prices and heavy federal spending to rebuild areas hit by Katrina. The difference in yield between two-year and 10-year Treasury notes fell to 0.26 percentage point, from 0.32 percentage point Monday -- a sign that investors in long-term bonds are demanding less compensation for the risk of inflation. ""They\'re buying into the Fed statement, which is that inflation is well contained,"" said Steve Rodosky, a Treasury portfolio manager at Pacific Investment Management Co., or Pimco. Responding to the rate increase, most major banks yesterday raised their prime rate one-quarter point, to 6.75%. The Standard &Poor\'s 500-stock index fell 0.79%, or 9.68 points, to 1221.34, still up 0.8% this year. The Nasdaq Composite Index fell 0.65%, or 13.93 points, to 2131.33, down 2% on the year. Outside the U.S., stocks rose in dollar terms, including a surge in Japanese stocks to their highest close since June 2001. The Dow Jones World Stock Index, excluding U.S. stocks, advanced 0.62%, or 1.16 points, to 187.25. Including U.S. stocks, the index fell slightly, down 0.06%, or 0.14 point, to 225.01. In major U.S. market action: Stocks retreated. On the New York Stock Exchange, where 1.72 billion shares traded, 1,031 stocks rose and 2,259 fell. Bond prices were mixed. The 10-year Treasury note fell 2/32, or 62.50 cents for each $1,000 invested, pushing the yield up to 4.255%. The 30-year bond was up 11/32 to yield 4.529%. The dollar strengthened.

129,,2005-09-21 00:00:00,"['The dollar moved higher, rising late in the session after the Federal Reserve raised interest rates for the 11th consecutive meeting and gave no signal of an imminent break in rate tightening. The Fed\'s decision to increase its key rate to 3.75% from 3.5% and what the market considered to be a hawkish-leaning policy statement boosted the dollar to a six-week high against the yen and pushed the euro down to near the five-week low versus the dollar it tapped Monday. Analysts interpreted the statement as indicating a pause in Fed rate increases isn\'t imminent. Late yesterday afternoon in New York, the euro was at $1.2127, down from $1.2151 late Monday. The dollar was at 111.91 yen, up from 111.48 yen, and at 1.2809 Swiss francs, up from 1.2768 francs. The pound was at $1.7996, down from $1.8044, while the euro was at 135.73 yen, from 135.46 yen. Noting elevated energy prices, the policy-setting Federal Open Market Committee voted 9 to 1 in favor of a rate increase in a widely anticipated move that put the Fed\'s key rate at its highest level in over four years. Fed Governor Mark Olson dissented, advocating no change in the federal-funds target rate (which governs overnight interbank loans) at the meeting. The FOMC said that although Hurricane Katrina and resulting damage have raised near-term uncertainty in the economy, they don\'t ""pose a more persistent threat."" Monetary-policy ""accommodation"" and robust productivity growth continue to support the economy, even as higher energy prices and other costs have added inflation pressures, it said. The Fed again said that ""policy accommodation can be removed at a pace that is likely to be measured."" Elsewhere, the Canadian dollar ended little changed in a session of consolidation. The U.S. dollar was trading at C$1.1699 late in New York from C$1.1686 late Monday.

130,,2005-09-21 00:00:00,"['The Federal Reserve\'s decision to stay on a steady course of interest-rate increases answered a key question for the bond market: Hurricane Katrina will not derail this tightening cycle. The Fed\'s 11th consecutive quarter-point interest-rate increase put the monetary-policy-sensitive two-year Treasury note under mild pressure and supported government bonds with longer maturity dates, which are most vulnerable to inflation. By extension, the Fed\'s statement that it may continue to raise interest rates at a ""measured"" pace gave renewed appeal to a flatter yield curve, whereby yields on shorter-dated maturities rise faster than those on long-dated peers. Noting elevated energy prices, the Federal Open Market Committee voted 9 to 1 to lift its target on the key federal-funds rate a quarter percentage point to 3.75% in a widely anticipated move that put the rate at its highest level in more than four years. Fed Governor Mark Olson dissented, advocating no change in the federal-funds target at this meeting. ""The Fed is giving no indication they are close to finishing their rate-hike cycle,"" said Dominic Konstam, head of interest-rate strategy at Credit Suisse First Boston in New York. ""They clearly want to get ahead of inflation risks and it makes 4.25% a likely year-end level for the [federal] funds rate."" Interest-rate-futures contracts forecast a 4% federal-funds rate for the end of the year. Meanwhile, a Dow Jones Newswires/CNBC survey of primary dealers -- banks that deal directly with the Fed -- found a strong majority looking for the nudge to 4% at the FOMC\'s next meeting Nov. 1, with the short-term rate expected to reach 4.25% in December. Mr. Konstam said the selling pressure in Treasurys, led by the two-year note, was an understandable reaction. ""The yield curve is flattening and that should continue as the Fed keeps raising rates."" After Hurricane Katrina sparked widespread damage across three states, some market participants expected the Fed might hold rates steady, or at least indicate it was prepared to do so. The Fed acknowledged the risks from the hurricane, but in a key statement, it suggested the unfortunate developments and disruption in energy markets ""do not pose a more persistent threat,"" to growth. Indeed, the jump in energy prices because of Katrina was the focus of the FOMC\'s concerns. Although policy makers said ""core inflation has been relatively low in recent months and longer-term inflation expectations remain contained,"" they cautioned ""higher energy and other costs have the potential to add to inflation pressures."" With those words, the Fed helped breathe life into the flattening of the yield curve, which had succumbed in Katrina\'s wake to a steepening trend. In late trade, the spread between the yields of two- and 10-year notes had narrowed to 0.26 from 0.32 percentage points before the Fed decision. Further flattening of the curve is expected to be propelled by a rising two-year yield and a steady 10-year yield. ""As long as the Fed is viewed as being more concerned with inflation than with growth, the 10-year should remain in a 4% to 4.38% range,"" said Andy Brenner, head of institutional fixed income at Investec in New York. ""This will force in more buying over the rest of the month"" for the 10-year, he added. Treasury Bonds At 4 p.m., the benchmark 10-year note was down 2/32 point, or $0.625 per $1,000 face value, at 99 31/32. Its yield rose to 4.255% from 4.25% Monday. The 30-year bond was up 11/32 point to 112 22/32, with its yield falling to 4.529% from 4.55%.   Corporate Bonds Telecom Italia is planning a $2.5 billion three-part note offering, split between five-year fixed- and floating-rate notes and 10-year notes, according to an investor. J.P. Morgan and Lehman Brothers will jointly lead the offering, which will be sold this week following a teleconference call with investors today.

131,,2009-11-05 00:00:00,"['After months of subsisting on close-to-zero yields and watching assets bleed away, money-market mutual funds may have reason to hope that a little relief isn\'t far off. Many economists are predicting a Federal Reserve rate increase in 2010, and the central bank is considering how to take cash out of circulation. In addition, government support programs for the funds and the assets that they buy, put in place after the Reserve Primary Fund dipped below its $1 net asset value and sparked panic in the industry, are starting to unwind. That combination may bring slightly higher yields, which would be a welcome break for fund companies that have been waiving fees on their funds to maintain investors. ""These rays of hope may just be enough to give you courage,"" said Peter Crane, president of Crane Data LLC, of struggling money-market fund providers. ""It could make you walk a couple more miles in the desert, but you need that Fed-hike oasis to really survive."" Fed watchers had waited Wednesday for a change, even a subtle one, in the central bank\'s commitment to keep borrowing costs at record lows for ""an extended period."" Even though the Fed didn\'t remove the word ""extended"" from its new statement, Mr. Crane saw signs of hope in the Fed\'s expanded discussion of the economy. He noted, too, that the Fed said economic conditions are likely to warrant ""exceptionally low levels"" of the federal-funds rate for an extended period. ""They didn\'t say an \'exceptionally low level,\'"" which could possibly indicate room for some change, he said. Mr. Crane believes one of the most important moves the Fed could make to affect rates is to engage in reverse repurchase agreements to drain liquidity from the financial system. The Fed last month said it was testing the use of these ""reverse repos,"" in which it sells securities to market participants with a commitment to buy them back at a higher price. In a statement Tuesday, Debbie Cunningham, chief investment officer for taxable money markets at Federated Investors, said some Federal Open Market Committee members seem to be hedging on their pledge to keep benchmark rates exceptionally low for an extended period. Ms. Cunningham said she expects the Fed ""in the near future"" to begin conducting reverse repos with nontraditional market participants, possibly including money-market funds. She wasn\'t available for comment after the Fed\'s statement Wednesday. Barry Benjamin, U.S. leader of PricewaterhouseCoopers\'s Investment Management and Real Estate Industry Group, said it is important to determine whether money-market funds will be able to continue with stable $1 net asset values. To sustain that, some system of support is needed to handle any possible run on money-market funds, he said. Discussions about an industry-sponsored liquidity bank are still under way. ""As the government programs are wound down, what\'s going to replace them?"" Mr. Benjamin asked. Value Line Case Settled for $45 Million New York investment adviser Value Line Inc., its chief executive and former chief compliance officer settled civil charges with the Securities and Exchange Commission over claims they charged more than $24 million in bogus brokerage commissions on mutual-fund trades funneled through Value Line\'s affiliated broker dealer, Value Line Securities Inc. Value Line, CEO Jean Buttner, former Chief Compliance Officer David Henigson and Value Line Securities agreed to pay nearly $45 million to settle the charges. ""Value Line misappropriated millions of dollars from the mutual funds they managed by artificially allocating fund trades and then charging the funds for phantom brokerage services,"" said Robert Khuzami, director of the SEC\'s enforcement division. Value Line proposed the settlement in September to avoid protracted litigation. Value Line officials weren\'t available for comment. -- Fawn Johnson']","For Money Funds, Wait Till Next Year --- Rate Relief Seen in '10 as Fed Stands Pat",2009-11-04,The Wall Street Journal

Yesterday\'s Federal Open Market Committee statement after its two-day meeting declared that the economy has improved but that this is still no reason to stop driving its monetary engine like an Indy race car. The Fed has been running full throttle for an entire year, while the financial panic has subsided, credit markets are healing, and third quarter GDP growth was 3.5%. The Fed is nonetheless focused principally on the ""output gap,"" by which it means ""low rates of resource utilization"" and the high jobless rate. As long as the economy isn\'t going at full capacity, the governors believe, there\'s no danger of price increases and thus we need ""exceptionally low levels of the federal funds rate for an extended period."" English translation: The Fed is going to maintain zero interest rates for as long as the political eye can see. In our oft-repeated view, this policy ignores the Fed\'s role as the central bank not merely for the U.S. domestic economy but also for the large chunk of the world known as the dollar bloc. The Fed\'s irrationally exuberant ease is clearly showing up around the world in a very weak dollar, asset bubbles in the likes of Asian property, and rising commodity prices that include $80 oil despite weak global energy demand. This risks creating new monetary excesses that will eventually have to be corrected in ways that could jeopardize the global and U.S. recovery. We\'d prefer more cautious policy now to avoid more trouble later, but this Fed is clearly on autopilot.

Outside the larger economies, emerging-market currencies continued to be in the spotlight, several of which were initially hurt by renewed fragility in the Brazilian real following a credit-rating agency downgrade late Monday. Moody's Investors Service cut Brazil's country ceiling for foreign-currency bonds and notes to single-B-2 from single-B-1, and the country ceiling for foreign-currency bank deposits to single-B-3 from single-B-2. Regardless of which candidate wins Brazil's autumn presidential election, the new administration will face growing fiscal pressures that could translate into risks in the external sector, especially as currency depreciation increases the burden on dollar borrowers, Moody's said.

135,,2002-08-14 00:00:00,"['Markets had to absorb a welter of news yesterday. President Bush held his Waco gabfest, with Treasury Secretary Paul O\'Neill remarking afterward about the participants\' ""passion."" The Federal Open Market Committee refrained from cutting its target interest rates, but changed what Fed-watchers call its ""bias,"" hinting that it may cut rates further in the future. Last and probably least, companies are stirring themselves to vouch for their earnings to meet today\'s deadline established by the SEC. The net verdict was, down 206 points on the Dow Industrials. Investors, or that is traders, evidently expected more from the Fed. We didn\'t, for there is a limit to monetary policy, and interest rates are at or near historic lows. Everyone\'s sisters, cousins and aunts expected absolutely nothing from Waco, at least in the short run, and early reports suggest they were right. President Bush came out for restraint on government spending, saying he would not release $5.1 billion in counter-terrorism funds because Congress lumped in unrelated pork. Maybe he can even manage to veto something or other. Which brings us to the certification circus. Embattled SEC Chairman Harvey Pitt decided that because some CEOs did wrong, all must be patted down and made to take an oath that they are not currently committing fraud. August 14 is the day when CEOs at the biggest 947 companies are supposed to ""certify"" that their financial results are correct or to explain why they can\'t. Most executives already had assumed they were vouching for something when their companies issued their quarterly reports and seem appropriately mystified by the demand for an additional ""certification."" Sun\'s Scott McNealy briefly threatened to call the agency\'s bluff until his PR handlers calmed him down. In the past week the trickle of certifications has become a flood, as executives from J.P. Morgan Chase, Foot Locker, Kellogg and others have filed. In each case, CEOs swallowed hard and submitted to the SEC\'s self-administered lie detector test. This was supposed to ""reassure"" the markets, which yawned, or yesterday, swooned. Throughout it all, indeed, you have to give credit to the stock market, which unlike Mr. Pitt or the media, has behaved as if distinctions are worth making. Enron\'s stock price dropped precipitously for months before the press began asking intelligent questions about Enron\'s accounting. WorldCom had fallen from $65 to less than $1 before accounting fraud was even whispered. The certifications will no doubt provide ammunition for class-action lawyers, who are in the habit of suing companies whose share prices fall regardless of whether any management misbehavior was involved. But, then, creating new opportunities to sue has been the practical thrust of all the ""reforms"" that have made it out of a Senate controlled by Tom Daschle Democrats. In the meantime, we suspect that the market has already gotten over any systemic ""crisis of confidence"" in accounting and returned to worries about whether the folks in Washington know how to keep our nascent recovery going. In this respect, we\'d like to offer one post-Waco suggestion. To wit, that President Bush convene a more workable forum and think seriously about economic policy. We\'d suggest he lock himself in a room with Larry Lindsey from the White House, Glenn Hubbard from the Council of Economic Advisers and John Taylor from the Treasury. Then he could reach out to Stanford University to add Michael Boskin, John Cogan and Martin Anderson. In case you\'re wondering, this is not our list. It was the economic brain trust announced back during the last presidential campaign by candidate George W. Bush. They did pretty well then, it seems to us, but economic policy has pretty much been on hold since except for the intrusion of short-term politics. It\'s time to reconvene the brain trust and pass around the thinking caps.']",After Waco,2002-08-13,The Wall Street Journal
136,,2002-08-14 00:00:00,"['NEW YORK -- Prices of U.S. Treasury securities rallied, pushing yields toward historical lows, after Federal Reserve policy makers left rates unchanged but acknowledged  the downside risks to the economy are outweighing its potential upside. The rally pushed the yield on the benchmark 10-year note to its lowest level in 39 years. Treasury securities had been mostly higher before the decision, with long-dated securities outpacing shorter-dated issues. That trend quickly reversed after the Fed\'s decision, as short-dated Treasurys benefited most from the Fed\'s acknowledgment it might need to cut interest rates if economic weakness persists. At 4 p.m., the benchmark 10-year note was up 1 2/32 point, or $10.63 per $1,000 face value, at 102 13/32. Its yield fell to 4.083% from 4.207% late Monday, as yields move inversely to prices. The 30-year bond\'s price was up 1 18/32 point at 106 5/32 to yield 4.973%, down from 5.070% on Monday. Late in the session, a large drop in major stock indexes helped bolster the rally in Treasurys. The Dow Jones Industrial Average ended down 206.50 points at 8482.39, while the Nasdaq Composite Index was down 37.56 at 1269.28. The policy-setting Federal Open Market Committee voted to leave the key federal-funds rate unchanged at 1.75%, a 41-year low. But the panel altered its assessment of the economic outlook, saying risks to the economy no longer are ""balanced."" The risk of too-slow economic growth is again greater than the risk of higher inflation, the committee said. The language implied the Fed is prepared to cut interest rates, possibly as early as Sept. 24. ""The softening in the growth of aggregate demand that emerged this spring has been prolonged in large measure by weakness in financial markets and heightened uncertainty related to problems in corporate reporting and governance,"" the FOMC said, after a unanimous vote. That prospect ""makes it very difficult for anyone to be underweight Treasurys at this point,"" said Sadakichi Robbins, head of global fixed-income trading at Bank Julius Baer in New York. Still, that doesn\'t mean that investors will remain nervous about owning Treasurys near historically low yields. ""People look at absolute yield levels and say that it\'s scary, but we are in an atypical situation here, with renewed economic risks, global event risk, mortgage prepayments, and a poor functioning of the corporate bond market,"" Mr. Robbins said. Following the Fed\'s announcement, Treasurys quickly reversed much of the curve-flattening trend -- in which investors had been favoring long-dated securities -- that has marked the past several sessions. Instead, investors piled into short-dated Treasurys since they stand to benefit most if economic conditions warrant another rate cut. Besides the economy, market-watchers will also look for how the corporate-bond market fares. In recent weeks, the corporate-bond market has become increasingly illiquid as many investors avoided all but the safest credits. If the Fed\'s implied willingness to act on further problems in the bond market does indeed calm some nerves, it might help to mitigate the so-called credit squeeze that has been going on. In the short term, however, some said the change in the Fed\'s bias toward lower growth might alarm markets, since it suggests the Fed\'s economic outlook has worsened since Chairman Alan Greenspan offered a cautiously upbeat assessment of the economy in congressional testimony in mid-July and other central bank officials echoed that sentiment. Prices of long-dated Treasurys had been higher early in yesterday\'s session, when a particularly weak economic report in Germany sent U.S. and European investors flocking toward the safety of U.S. government securities.  Corporate Bonds The Fed\'s action had little effect on the corporate-bond market since it was widely expected, market participants said. Instead, the market was more affected by movements in equities and concerns about particular sectors, he said. One of those sectors was telecommunications where SBC Communications had its Aa3 senior unsecured long-term credit rating placed on review for possible downgrade yesterday by Moody\'s Investors Service. The announcement wasn\'t unexpected after Moody\'s last week said it was re-examining the Regional Bell Operating Companies, or RBOCs, on a number of industrywide pressures.

137,,2006-12-13 00:00:00,"['WASHINGTON -- The Federal Reserve signaled that while the economy looks a bit weaker than a month ago, its forecast and concerns about inflation are unchanged, and thus interest rates are still more likely to rise than fall. The Fed yesterday left its short-term interest rate at 5.25%, where it has stood since late June. In the statement accompanying its decisions, the Fed downgraded its assessment of the housing market and acknowledged ""mixed"" signals on growth. But its forecast of moderate growth is unchanged. Inflation remains its principal focus, and it still says its choice is whether to raise rates -- not to lower them. Bond yields declined and stocks retraced most of their early losses as investors interpreted the statement as a concession by the Fed to markets\' gloomier forecast of growth and more sanguine outlook on inflation. That, however, might turn out to be an overreaction. Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke has emphasized that rate actions depend on where the Fed thinks the economy and inflation will be in the future, not where they are today. And that hasn\'t changed. The Fed said that ""growth has slowed . . . partly reflecting a substantial cooling of the housing market."" Its last statement, in October, didn\'t include the word ""substantial."" ""Although recent indicators have been mixed, the economy seems likely to expand at a moderate pace on balance over coming quarters,"" it said. Inflation remains ""elevated,"" and though expected to moderate, ""inflation risks remain."" Whether rates rise again will depend on new data, it said, in words identical to those used in October. ""The very fact that not even a comma was altered in the discussion of inflation and the outlook for policy should be taken as a strong sign that the Fed does not see \'recent indicators\' as altering their fundamental outlook for the economy,"" said Michael Feroli, economist at J.P. Morgan Chase &Co., in a note to clients. The Fed and the markets have starkly different views of the path of interest rates, with the former maintaining a bias to raise them and the latter anticipating cuts of half to three-quarters of a percentage point in the coming year. Yesterday\'s statement did little to close the divide. Indeed, investors raised the probability of rate cuts a bit. David Greenlaw, an economist at Morgan Stanley, said markets were reacting to ""the insertion of the word \'substantial\' to describe the cooling in the housing market,"" but he argued this was off the mark, as it was a backward-looking description. Indeed, the Fed for some months has expected housing to be a sizable drag on the economy. Its statement first acknowledged a ""gradual cooling"" in August, and since then, reported housing starts have fallen 19%. In early October, Mr. Bernanke said housing was undergoing a ""substantial correction."" The insertion of ""substantial"" in yesterday\'s statement was mostly an acknowledgment that the housing correction has advanced. Fed officials consider the decline in construction necessary to clear inventories of unsold homes. That said, they acknowledge housing remains a risk factor: Sales of homes are still falling, albeit more slowly, and eroding house prices could yet damp consumer spending more broadly. Ten of the 11 voting members of the Federal Open Market Committee voted to keep the target for the federal-funds rate, charged on overnight loans between banks. For the fourth-consecutive meeting, Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond President Jeffrey Lacker dissented, favoring a quarter-percentage-point increase. Mr. Lacker won\'t be a voting FOMC member next year. One seat on the committee is vacant. Laurence Meyer, vice chairman of Macroeconomic Advisers, says the divide between the markets and the Fed is likely to be resolved one month at a time. If the data continue to support the Fed\'s stance, the Fed\'s language will remain the same, and markets will adjust their expectations as each Fed meeting approaches. Richard DeKaser, chief economist at National City Corp. in Cleveland, predicted the Fed would stay on hold through all of next year. He attributed recent weakness in manufacturing to firms reacting to a buildup of inventories. Businesses are ""not hunkering down and playing defense,"" he said, adding that his bank continues to see healthy loan demand from businesses. But economists at UBS AG predicted rates will be cut a full percentage point next year as growth remains subpar, unemployment rises and inflation edges down. --- Online Today: The Journal\'s Greg Ip talks about what the Fed\'s policy statement suggests about future rate decisions, at WSJ.com/Video.

138,,2006-12-13 00:00:00,"['The dollar fell against its rivals after the Federal Reserve kept interest rates steady and took baby steps away from its rate-tightening cycle and possibly toward rate cuts. The Federal Reserve Open Market Committee kept rates on hold for the fourth straight policy-setting meeting and continued to name inflation as a worry. But the FOMC also made slight adjustments to its postmeeting statement compared with previous statements, which investors pounced on as another reason to sell the embattled dollar that is 11% lower versus the euro this year. Late afternoon in New York, the euro stood at $1.3280 from $1.3239 late Monday, while the dollar was at 116.80 yen from 116.99 yen. The euro was at 155.11 yen from 154.86 yen. The dollar stood at 1.2000 Swiss francs 1.2028 francs, while the pound was at $1.9708 from $1.9567. Referring to the U.S. housing slowdown, for example, the FOMC referred to a ""substantial cooling"" of the market, whereas previous statements simply said the sector was simply ""cooling,"" leaving out any ominous modifier. This change surprised a market that expected the FOMC would essentially just cut and paste its previous statement and use it as the new one. ""Since [that] didn\'t materialize, we\'re seeing the dollar lose some ground,"" Brian Dolan, head of currency research at Forex.com, said just as the dollar began slipping. Chances that the Fed may begin cutting rates before too long has been hurting the dollar, because lower rates tend to send investors looking for higher returns elsewhere. Indeed, the market odds of a rate cut increased slightly following the FOMC less-hawkish-than-expected statement. Eurodollar futures priced in a 56% chance for a rate cut to 5% within the first three months of 2007, versus 52% before the FOMC announcement. --- Isabelle Lindenmayer, in New York and Campion Walsh and Benton Ives-Halperin in Washington contributed to this article.

139,,1999-05-19 00:00:00,"['WASHINGTON -- The Federal Reserve decided to leave benchmark interest rates unchanged, but said it is so ""concerned about the potential for a buildup of inflationary imbalances"" that it is leaning toward raising rates in the coming months for the first time in nearly a year. Although inflation remains ""generally . . . quite subdued,"" the Fed said in a 134-word statement, ""domestic financial markets have recovered and foreign economic prospects have improved"" since it slashed rates by three-quarters of a percentage point last fall. It also suggested that demand in the U.S. economy is growing faster than the economy\'s ability to supply goods and services, despite gains in productivity. The Fed\'s decision to adopt an end-ofmeeting statement, or directive, that says a rate increase is more likely than a rate cut doesn\'t mean that higher rates are a certainty. Rather, it is a clear statement that Fed officials at this moment see a much greater risk of accelerating inflation than of a worrisome slowdown in the economy. In March 1998, for instance, the Fed adopted a directive that said it was leaning toward higher rates. But after Russia\'s default and devaluation shook global financial markets in August of that year, the Fed actually ended up cutting rates. According to a tally by economists at Goldman, Sachs & Co., the Fed under Chairman Alan Greenspan has ended 29 of its policy meetings with a bias toward higher rates. In half the cases, rates were lifted within six months, and in the other half rates weren\'t. Financial markets reacted negatively to the news. The Dow Jones Industrial Average, which had been up nearly 70 points before the 2:15 p.m. Eastern time announcement, quickly reversed course and ended the day down 16.52 points at 10836.95. Treasury bonds, which also had been higher during the day, fell after the announcement and ended the day little changed. The yield on 30-year Treasury bonds was 5.88%. The reaction might have been sharper if not for a May 6 speech by Mr. Greenspan and last Friday\'s unanticipated uptick in consumer prices, both of which led many Fed watchers to predict yesterday\'s outcome. The decision leaves the Fed\'s target for the federal funds interest rate at 4.75%, the level at which it has been since November. The Fed manipulates the fed-funds rate, at which banks lend to each other overnight, by buying and selling government securities. The Fed yesterday left unchanged the discount rate, at which it lends directly to banks. The Fed\'s policy-making Federal Open Market Committee traditionally ends each session with a statement on where it believes rates are headed in the weeks ahead. In the past, the statement was supposed to be kept confidential for six weeks, although the press sometimes reported it earlier and Fed officials sometimes gave away the secret in speeches. But the Fed has moved slowly toward more openness. In 1994, it began announcing changes in its target for the fed-funds rate, but it offered explanations only when changing the target. Then in February, it said it would reveal the directive and explain its thinking ""when it wanted to communicate to the public a major shift in its views about the balance of risks or the likely direction of policy."" Yesterday\'s statement was the first use of that new tool. When they met in early February, according to a summary of the meeting released subsequently, some Fed officials were already prepared to undo some of the rate cuts implemented last fall amid turmoil in the global economy and financial markets. Since then, the economy has proved much stronger than expected, the stock market has continued to climb and foreign economies have improved. Except for one month of bad consumer-price numbers, tangible signs of inflation have yet to emerge. Yet the much-forecast slowing of U.S. economic growth has yet to arrive, causing concern at the Fed that the inflationary good luck may be running out. The Fed statement is a sign that, with the jobless rate already at a 29-year low, FOMC members won\'t wait forever for the slowdown to materialize. The decision to hold rates steady for now, and the statement\'s reference to the possible need for action in the ""coming months,"" suggests the Fed is willing to wait a little while longer, though. ""Against the background of alreadytight domestic labor markets and ongoing strength in demand in excess of productivity gains,"" the Fed statement said, ""the Committee recognizes the need to be alert to developments over coming months that might indicate that financial conditions may no longer be consistent with containing inflation."" Richard Berner, chief U.S. economist at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter & Co., said the statement is the first step toward tighter monetary policy. ""The basic point is that the inflation risks, while relatively small, are rising. Last fall\'s easing was put in place as we witnessed a drying up of liquidity in domestic financial markets and prospects for the global economy were deteriorating."" With both those concerns abating, ""it\'s appropriate for the Fed to take back some of the easing that they put in place last fall."" Economists at the Paris-based Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development urged the Fed to ""respond cautiously to developments until they can be interpreted with greater confidence."" The OECD foresees growth of 3.5% in the U.S. this year and 2% growth next year. With inflation low, the Fed can wait for the economy to slow on its own, the OECD\'s top economist, Ignazio Visco, said yesterday. After cutting rates in November, the Fed adopted a directive saying that higher or lower rates were equally likely in the ensuing weeks. It maintained that stance in meeting in December, February and March. The last time the Fed ended a meeting with a directive tilted toward higher rates was in early July 1998.

140,,2002-01-31 00:00:00,"['NEW YORK -- The bond market moved lower, pushed down by the combination of stronger equity markets, improved economic data, and Federal Reserve policy makers\' decision to leave interest rates unchanged. Treasury securities had been lower for most of the session, spurred mostly by the release of positive U.S. fourth-quarter gross domestic product data and the Treasury\'s quarterly refunding announcement. Then a late-day rally in stocks, which followed the Fed\'s interest-rate decision, pushed the debt market down further. At 4 p.m. EST, the benchmark 10-year Treasury note was down 8/32 point, or $2.50 per $1,000 face value, at 100. Its yield rose to 5.000% from 4.966% late Tuesday, as yields move inversely to prices. Meanwhile, the 30-year Treasury bond\'s price was down 12/32 at 99 8/32 to yield 5.426%, up from Tuesday\'s 5.401%. The central bank\'s Federal Open Market Committee voted to hold its main federal-funds rate at a 40-year low of 1.75%, pausing to see whether the economy will strengthen as businesses start rebuilding inventories they depleted last year. The Fed\'s message was ""almost perfectly in line with what the market expected,"" said David Ging, government bond strategist at Credit Suisse First Boston in New York. That means the bond market will need to take a wait-and-see stance in coming weeks, as participants focus keenly on the performance of the U.S. economy, corporations and stock markets. Earlier in yesterday\'s session, government debt fell when the market got a dose of improved economic data. Prices slipped further when the Treasury Department announced a $29 billion refunding package, consisting of $16 billion in reopened November five-year notes to be auctioned Tuesday and $13 billion in 10-year notes to be sold Wednesday. The Treasury Department also revealed it is considering ending its current pattern of alternating new issues and reopenings, and that it would conduct $3 billion to $5 billion in buybacks in three operations after the April tax deadline. In general, the Treasury Department\'s news contained no surprises for a market warily awaiting details of the February refunding. ""The Treasury signaled this, and the Treasury is definitely trying to get more predictable. And what I like about this refunding is that they are telling the market what they are thinking,"" said Gerald Lucas, senior government-bond strategist at Merrill Lynch in New York. Still, the announcement helped to lay to rest recent speculation that the Treasury Department would move to a monthly five-year note auction schedule. Speaking to reporters, Treasury Assistant Secretary for Financial Markets Brian Roseboro said the government isn\'t ""actively considering"" such a move. Many market participants have been clamoring for the Treasury Department to move to monthly five-year note auctions due to recent imbalances in the government repurchase agreement market, where dealers go to borrow securities. For nearly eight weeks, the November five-year note has been extremely scarce in the government repurchase agreement market, allowing lenders of the note to command zero-rate financing from those who need to borrow it. In many cases, the note has been so elusive that borrowers haven\'t been able to return it to the lender, a situation known as a fail. Corporate Bonds The corporate bond sector was quieter compared with Tuesday, with little reaction seen to the Fed\'s announcement. ""If anything, not cutting sends the message that the Fed sees the economy bottoming or improving and that their job is pretty much done,"" said Steve Nelson, portfolio manager at Advantus Capital Management. ""Things should improve, which means things will get better in the corporate world as it relates to earnings."" Tyco International\'s debt got an initial bounce yesterday but fell back after it experienced some extremely wide swings. The company\'s 10-year paper started the day priced at 2.7 percentage points over comparable Treasury securities and moved as wide as 3.5 before coming back in to 2.5. Williams Communications\' bonds, which also took a hit Tuesday, rallied a bit as well. The 7.125% paper due 2011 closed Tuesday at 3.3 percentage points higher than Treasurys after having widened from 2.6 higher. Late yesterday, they were trading around 2.85 above comparable Treasurys.

142,,2006-05-11 00:00:00,"['THE FEDERAL RESERVE has often sent markets spiraling or rallying. Yesterday it froze them. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is still about 80 points from its record high, after finishing the day only slightly above where it began. The benchmark idled because investors couldn\'t wring enough optimism out of a statement from the Fed, which raised its short-term rate target to 5% as expected. Many hoped the central bankers would signal a pause in its rate-raising campaign in its statement. But the Fed failed to provide investors with a straight answer. Further rate hikes ""may yet be needed to address inflation risks"" the Federal Open Market Committee said, adding the word ""yet"" to its previous statements on rates. And doubts about that single word left stocks treading water. ""The Fed was the story of the day and `yet\' was the key word,"" said Ted Oberhaus, director of equity trading at Lord Abbett Funds. The key question: Does the inclusion of ""yet"" indicate a pause is more likely -- or less? The Dow edged up 2.88 points, or 0.02%, to 11642.65. It is up more than 8.6% this year and one good day from its highest close, 11722.98, set on Jan. 14, 2000. The Standard &Poor\'s 500-stock index finished down 2.29 points at 1322.85, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite slid 17.51 points to 2320.74. Those indexes are much further from their all-time highs also set in 2000. Doreen Mogavero, a floor broker at the NYSE, predicts the Dow will hit a new record soon and then shoot higher. ""There will be a lot of woo-wooing and throwing paper,"" she said. Others worry that psychologically important milestones, like the Dow\'s record, can distort investor sentiment, leading to irrational buying. ""It\'s close enough that I have a hard time believing they, whoever they are, won\'t push this thing up to a record soon,"" said Jeffrey Saut, chief investment strategist at Raymond James, who says stocks are expensive at today\'s levels. ""People will be excited, but I don\'t understand it and I don\'t trust it."" Treasury bonds, whose prices tend to weaken when short-term interest rates are on the rise, fell after the Fed\'s statement but finished up a whisker on the day. The dollar continued its slide. After the Fed\'s move, major U.S. banks raised their prime rates, the basis for many consumer loans, by one-quarter point to an even 8%. Fueling inflation concerns, oil futures rose $1.44 to $72.13 a barrel and gold jumped $4.30 to $703.70 an ounce, its high since Sept. 25, 1980.

143,,2006-05-11 00:00:00,"['As it raised interest rates by a quarter-point for the 16th consecutive time, the Federal Reserve, in its accompanying statement, struck a careful balance between concern about inflation and a willingness to consider pausing in its two-year rate-raising campaign. The Fed, as expected, boosted short-term rates to 5% from 4.75%. In its statement, it laid out a rationale for a pause in the series of rate increases that began in mid-2004, while signaling such a break need not be a halt. In recent weeks, Fed officials, led by Chairman Ben Bernanke, have tried to signal that they are less certain of where rates are going and that while they may pause soon, they could raise rates again later. But those signals have come while recent data have shown that the economy remains strong and inflationary pressure is growing. Markets have questioned the wisdom of the Fed\'s game plan by showing greater concern about inflation. Yesterday\'s statement was less explicit than Mr. Bernanke\'s Congressional testimony two weeks ago on the prospects of a pause. It restated the Fed\'s bias to raise interest rates further because of the risk of higher inflation. But it also laid out a forecast of slowing growth that would allow it to pause on rate increases. Growth has been ""quite strong,"" the Fed said, but will ""likely . . . moderate to a more sustainable pace, partly reflecting a gradual cooling of the housing market and the lagged effects of increases in interest rates and energy prices."" Inflation expectations are ""contained,"" but tightening capacity usage and high commodity prices could add ""potential"" inflation pressure. Further rate increases ""may yet be needed to address inflation risks,"" the Fed said, slightly tweaking the guidance it gave on interest rates after its previous two meetings. But it added that it ""emphasizes that the extent and timing of any such firming will depend importantly on the evolution of the economic outlook as implied by incoming information."" That wording suggests that the Fed still sees a reasonable chance of having to raise rates again this year, but without the predictability of the past 23 months. Stock and bond markets weakened following the Fed\'s statement, and finished mixed on the day, while futures markets raised to 40% from 38% the odds of a quarter-point increase in rates at the Fed\'s next meeting on June 28-29. The dollar recouped some of its losses against the euro, but remained lower on a day when the highlight was a Treasury report that criticized China for holding down the value of its currency but stopped short of calling it a currency manipulator. All 11 voting members of the 18 member Federal Open Market Committee voted to raise the target for the federal-funds rate, charged on overnight loans among banks. (One FOMC seat is vacant.) The Fed also raised the less-important discount rate, charged on central-bank loans to commercial banks, to 6% from 5.75%. Eleven of the Fed\'s 12 regional banks requested the increase; the board of the Kansas City Fed did not, just as in March. In response, U.S. commercial banks raised their prime rate, a benchmark for many business and consumer loans, to 8% from 7.75%. The Fed and its new chairman are at a delicate juncture. At 5%, short-term rates are now about neutral -- neither so low that they stimulate spending, nor so high that they restrain it. And there are signs that, after two years, the Fed is having an impact: Long-term rates have started to rise, and home sales and price appreciation have slowed. But the overall economy grew at a robust 4.8% annual rate in the first quarter, and though it\'s expected to slow to between 3% and 3.5% in the second quarter, the latest data have been strong. Moreover, underlying inflation recently ticked up to the top of the Fed\'s comfort zone of 1% to 2%. Thus, Mr. Bernanke is caught between the risk of appearing soft on inflation and the risk of raising interest rates too much and triggering a serious slowdown. They are ""concerned with the lagged impact of earlier tightening on economic activity -- it\'s the reason the [notion of a pause] has been introduced,"" said Al Broaddus, former president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond. ""But . . . they mustn\'t give anyone the idea their ultimate focus on inflation has diminished. It\'s very tough to walk this fine line."" Robert Parry, former president of the San Francisco Fed, thinks the Fed will likely have to raise rates further this year, in part because it usually has to raise them above neutral to get the economy to slow to a desirable rate and keep inflation in its preferred zone. Even so, he said the Fed would be justified in pausing at its next meeting because after several years in which the direction of rates was straightforward, ""it\'s much more complex, and one has to be careful and also circumspect."" Mr. Bernanke seems more willing than his predecessor Alan Greenspan to lay out his forecast for the economy to justify the Fed\'s rate actions. Edward Gramlich, a former Fed governor who is now interim provost at the University of Michigan, said ""it\'s inevitable"" that the Fed must now rely on forecasts. The only reason it can consider a pause, he said, is that it believes rates at current levels ""have already dampened spending enough to bring [inflation] under control."" However, that forecast may not yet ring true with people in the markets who still see a strong economy, buoyant financial markets and inflation signals, such as gold prices hitting a 25-year high. Hank McKinnell, chief executive of Pfizer Inc. and chairman of the Business Roundtable, an association of chief executives, said yesterday: ""Interest rates aren\'t at a point where they\'ve started to bite into financing capability.

Along with a quarter-percentage-point increase in the federal-funds rate to 5%, the Federal Open Market Committee kept the idea of another rate increase in June alive, saying ""some further policy firming may yet be needed to address inflation risks."" It also emphasized that any further rate increases will depend ""importantly"" on the incoming data. The market sold off in an initial response to the statement, and yields -- which move inversely to prices -- rose, as bond investors had pegged the odds of a pause in June around 65% before the FOMC statement was released. But prices exited from active trade little changed, and the two-year note\'s yield failed to move beyond the 5% mark. At 4 p.m., the two-year note was down 1/32, or 31.3 cents per $1,000 face value, at 99 25/32 to yield 4.992%, compared with 4.975% Tuesday. The 10-year note rose 2/32 to 95 7/32 to yield 5.128%. The odds of a rate increase in June are ""now close to fifty-fifty,"" said Jim Caron, fixed-income strategist at Merrill Lynch &Co. in New York. That is also reflected in short-term interest-rate futures, which show the odds of a June increase at 44%, compared with 50% odds just after the FOMC statement was published. Scott Gewirtz, head of Treasury trading at Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. in New York, said the statement itself was neutral and that explained the modest nature of the selloff. ""I think they avoided overtly signaling a pause but they left themselves a huge amount of flexibility,"" Mr. Gewirtz said. Policy makers also highlighted inflation risks in their statement -- and that was the trigger for the market\'s biggest move in the wake of the statement\'s publication -- a flatter yield curve, said Richard Gilhooly, senior interest-rate strategist at BNP Paribas. Longer-term yields are sensitive to inflation expectations, while short-term yields react most to official interest-rate changes. In recent trade, the yield curve as measured by the difference between two-year and 10-year yields had flattened to 0.13 percentage point, its lowest level since April 26, the day before Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke made his comments about a possible pause in rate increases to Congress. How far the flattening goes will now be determined by the reception given to today\'s auction of $13 billion in new 10-year notes. ""A good auction will help rally the back end,"" Mr. Gilhooly said. In the wake of the Fed\'s rate move, commercial banks are raising their prime rate to 8% from 7.75%. Many consumer-lending rates, such as interest on credit cards and home-equity loans, are tied to the prime rate. Municipal Bond The Government Development Bank for Puerto Rico has delayed today\'s planned sale of $800 million bonds, a GDB spokeswoman said. The sale, which would have been the largest this week in the tax-exempt bond market, has been put off at least temporarily because of a downgrade Monday by a major ratings firm of $25 billion of the commonwealth\'s debt, said spokeswoman Maria Rosario. The island territory has been in the grips of a fiscal crisis that has partially closed its government, as well as eroded its shaky credit rating and that of the GDB, which has made extensive loans to the government. Impatient about a budget impasse that has kept the Puerto Rican government in a partial shutdown since May 1, Moody\'s Investors Service Monday took its rating on the commonwealth\'s general obligation bonds down one peg to Baa3, the firm\'s lowest investment-grade rating and just one step above junk-bond status. It also cut its ratings on Puerto Rico\'s appropriations debt to Ba1, its highest junk-bond rating. The company said it was keeping Puerto Rico on a watch list for possible further downgrades. Corporate Bond Embarq Corp. is shopping a $4.485 billion three-part debt offering this week and investors are already lining up for the deal. A person familiar with the offering said roughly $17 billion in orders have poured in for the offering, which is expected to price this week. This deal comes after $4 billion in new debt from Abbott Laboratories in the investment-grade market on Tuesday. Embarq is Sprint Nextel Corp.\'s local land-line phone business that is being spun off to Sprint shareholders May 17. It has garnered the lowest possible investment-grade ratings of triple-B-minus from Standard &Poor\'s, Fitch Ratings and Moody\'s Investors Service. S&P has a negative outlook on the company, while Fitch and Moody\'s are stable. The business has ""lots of cash"" that is expected to be used to pare down debt, said Eric Geil, credit analyst at S&P. But ""beyond the next couple of years, we\'re really unsure where the business may go,"" he said. That is because the land-line sector of the telecommunications market is shrinking, while the wireless and cable sectors are expanding. Yield-starved investors, however, are willing to overlook the gloomy outlook. GM Bonds Shift Out of Reverse General Motors Corp.\'s bond ratings are on review for yet another downgrade by both Moody\'s Investors Service and Standard and Poor\'s, but that hasn\'t stopped investors from snapping up the debt securities lately. The company\'s 8.375% bonds due in 2033 have risen over the past few trading sessions and yesterday hit 76.5 cents on the dollar, representing a yield of about 11%. That is much improved from a low of about 66 cents on the dollar at the end of December 2005, according to data from MarketAxess. Earlier this week, GM revised its first-quarter results to a profit from a loss effectively ending a five-quarter streak of reported losses. ""We are putting our vote in the constructive outcome column,"" wrote analyst Glenn Reynolds of independent bond-research firm CreditSights Inc., in a report out late Tuesday, when he raised his rating on GM\'s bonds to ""overweight"" from ""underweight."" --- Serena Ng contributed to this article.

145,,2008-06-26 00:00:00,"['The dollar declined versus the euro after the Federal Open Market Committee voted to keep interest rates unchanged Wednesday and gave no signal of a near-term rate increase. The dollar fell to a 12-session low against the euro, which rose as high as $1.5687. Wednesday breaks the Fed\'s string of seven straight cuts between September and April totaling 3.25 percentage points, during which the European Central Bank stood firm. The euro zone\'s higher interest rates help make assets denominated in the euro more attractive to investors. With the ECB widely expected to raise rates at its meeting next week, currency analysts said the dollar will stay under pressure from the euro\'s advances. Wednesday afternoon in New York, the euro was at $1.5676 from $1.5572 late Tuesday, according to EBS. The dollar was at 107.77 yen from 107.79 yen, while the euro was at 168.95 yen from 167.80 yen. The U.K. pound was at $1.9758 from $1.9697, and the dollar was at 1.0351 Swiss francs from 1.0412 francs Tuesday. The FOMC voted 9-1 to keep its benchmark lending rate at 2%. It also took no action on the discount rate charged for Fed loans to banks and brokers, which stands at 2.25%. In the policy statement, officials signaled that while the economy still faces headwinds, the chances of a severe slowdown or recession have receded. They also said, ""Upside risks to inflation and inflation expectations have increased."" ""People in the currency market may have been looking for a more hawkish stance from the FOMC,"" said Adam Boyton, currency strategist at Deutche Bank AG in New York. ""What we\'ve seen is a shift in that direction, but no explicit tightening bias. That\'s allowed the euro a little bit of a relief rally."" Jens Nordvig, currency strategist at Goldman Sachs in New York, explained that given currency market expectations for a more aggressive stance, the FOMC\'s change in language will now take a second-seat to U.S. economic data. After falling off, the dollar ended the afternoon Wednesday little changed against the yen from a day earlier as stocks stayed up. The next U.S. report, nonfarm payrolls, will be released the same day as the ECB\'s rate decision: July 3. Overnight, as earlier in the week, the dollar was stuck in range-bound trading versus its rivals. The euro was able to earn a narrow lead after ECB President Jean-Claude Trichet said the governing council may raise the ECB\'s main refinancing interest rate ""by a small amount"" to 4.25% from 4% to anchor inflation expectations. Mr. Trichet also said the ECB governing council is in a state of ""heightened alertness,"" against a backdrop of significant upside risks to price stability in remarks to the European Parliament Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs in Brussels. The risks of triggering a wage-price inflation spiral currently ""is particularly acute,"" he said. The euro found some additional support from news that the ECB will hold a monetary policy meeting and press conference in August, a month when members are normally on holiday.

146,,2006-03-29 00:00:00,"['At his first policy meeting as Federal Reserve chairman, Ben Bernanke picked up where predecessor Alan Greenspan left off: with another quarter-point boost in interest rates, and a hint of more to come. But Mr. Bernanke put a modest stamp of his own on the Fed\'s closely watched postmeeting statement, by including a more explicit view of where the nation\'s economy is headed. The statement\'s forecast that economic growth appears likely ""to moderate to a more sustainable pace"" may be an early, though small, sign of his efforts to make the central bank\'s thinking more transparent. The Fed raised its target for the federal-funds rate, charged on overnight loans between banks, to 4.75% from 4.5%. In its statement released after the two-day meeting, the Fed said ""some further policy firming may be needed to keep"" the risks to growth and of inflation ""roughly in balance."" The language was identical to that used in the statement released after Mr. Greenspan\'s last meeting, on Jan. 31. Fed officials have indicated that saying policy firming ""may be needed"" simply keeps their options open on whether to raise rates again, and implies no commitment to do so. Nonetheless, financial markets, which had already thought it highly likely that the Fed would raise rates to 5% at its May 10 meeting, became even more convinced it would do so after reading the statement. The Dow Jones Industrial Average, which had been up about 19 points before the Fed\'s afternoon announcement, finished the day down 95.57, or 0.9%, at 11154.54. The yield on the 10-year Treasury bond rose to 4.78% from 4.71% Monday. Yesterday\'s move was the Fed\'s 15th consecutive quarter-point rate increase since June 2004, when it began to raise rates from a 46-year low. The increase reflects a continuing view at the Fed that robust growth abroad and an economy near full capacity at home create a risk that inflation, though tame, could rise. The Fed said that while energy prices could boost underlying inflation, so far they have not, in part because of brisk productivity growth. ""Still, possible increases in resource utilization, in combination with the elevated prices of energy and other commodities, have the potential to add to inflation pressures,"" it said, in words similar to its Jan. 31 statement. The similarity of the policy-setting Federal Open Market Committee\'s words and actions to those of Mr. Greenspan\'s on Jan. 31 may have reflected Mr. Bernanke\'s stated desire to maintain ""continuity."" But in one respect, the statement did break some new ground. It said the slowing growth of the nation\'s gross domestic product in the fourth quarter was due to ""temporary or special factors. Economic growth has rebounded strongly in the current quarter but appears likely to moderate to a more sustainable pace."" The inclusion of an explicit forecast differed from previous statements, which generally stuck to a snapshot of current economic conditions. Its reference to ""real GDP growth in the fourth quarter"" was also far more specific than previous statements, which seldom specified what data they were referring to. Mr. Bernanke has suggested that more discussion of the forecast would help markets more accurately predict the central bank\'s actions. ""What does it mean when the Fed is data-dependent?"" Mr. Bernanke said after a speech in New York last week. It means, he said, that with each new economic report, the Fed reconsiders ""where the economy is going to be a year down the road. The key statistic is the forecast."" Changes in the forecast, he said, drive rate decisions. In his earlier career as an academic, Mr. Bernanke worked extensively on economic modeling, which is used to make forecasts. And as a Fed governor from 2002 to 2005, he often met with Fed staff to discuss their forecast, dubbed the ""green book."" While Mr. Greenspan also considered forecasts important, he generally was reluctant to issue one, and often disagreed with the green book. Mr. Bernanke has argued for more transparency at the Fed and suggested the FOMC should release forecasts more often than twice a year, the current practice. The modest change in yesterday\'s statement suggests Mr. Bernanke may pursue his transparency initiatives in small, incremental steps. Other changes in the FOMC\'s communications and deliberations processes may have been considered at the meeting. Minutes of the discussion will be released April 18. Laurence Meyer, a former Fed governor who now analyzes the Fed for Macroeconomic Advisers, a St. Louis forecasting firm, said the statement reflected ""continuity in policy and innovation in communication."" While the forecast of moderating growth wasn\'t news, its inclusion in the statement served to temper potential market overreaction to the Fed\'s upbeat assessment of current conditions, he said. Fed officials have said their actions increasingly are driven by new economic data, which means they probably will soon stop giving hints about their next action on interest rates. David Greenlaw, an economist at Morgan Stanley, said more information on the Fed\'s forecast could help make up for such a loss of guidance on interest rates as markets try to figure out what the Fed will do next. The decision by the FOMC\'s 11 voting members was unanimous. Departing Federal Reserve Board Vice Chairman Roger Ferguson didn\'t attend. It is customary for departing FOMC members to skip their last meeting. Eleven of the Fed\'s 12 regional reserve banks asked for the accompanying increase in the little-used discount rate, charged on short-term Fed loans to commercial banks, to 5.75% from 5.5%. The exception was the Kansas City Fed. Many commercial banks yesterday raised their prime rate -- a benchmark for many consumer and business loans -- to 7.75% from 7.5%. Economists generally said that how much higher rates go depends mostly on whether the risk of inflation becomes reality. Ethan Harris, chief U.S. economist at Lehman Brothers, said, ""I think you\'re going to see both . . . tightening capacity and some kind of pickup in inflation."" He predicted the Fed will eventually lift its key rate to 5.5%. Larry Kantor, co-head of research at Barclays Capital, said, ""The financial environment is still stimulative: high stock prices, relatively low bond yields."" He predicted that even if the Fed paused soon it would have to resume raising rates shortly afterward. But Maury Harris, chief U.S. economist at UBS, said the Fed should stop raising rates now, arguing that the economy is already slowing. He noted that new-home sales and capital-goods orders, excluding aircraft and defense, dropped in February. Mr. Harris predicted growth will slow to an annual rate of 2.5% by the second half of the year from the current rate of about 4%. If the Fed raises rates further, it risks overshooting and making the slowdown worse, he said. However, he added that inflation is low enough that it is unlikely any such overshooting would trigger a recession. --- Online Today: WSJ.com subscribers can see how the Federal Reserve\'s statement compares with the previous one and read the full text of the Fed\'s statement.

147,,2006-03-29 00:00:00,"['Treasurys prices fell across maturities after the Federal Reserve raised its benchmark interest rate and -- to the disappointment of some investors -- indicated it wasn\'t finished raising rates. In late trading, the 10-year note was yielding 4.79%, up from 4.71% late Monday. The two-year yield was at 4.80%. When short-term rates are higher than long-term rates, it is known as an inverted yield curve, and has previously signaled a slowing economy. But the Fed wasn\'t deterred by the yield curve as officials, led by Chairman Ben Bernanke, have disputed that interpretation of the inverted yield curve. They argue that this time, other factors are at work, including strong demand by overseas investors for U.S. assets. The Federal Open Market Committee raised its target for the federal funds rate -- which is what banks charge each other on overnight loans -- by a quarter percentage point to 4.75% at the end of its two-day meeting. Some bond investors were surprised by the Fed\'s apparent intention to keep raising rates. ""People in the bond market were hoping the statement would indicate the FOMC was close to being finished. But there is no sense that the next meeting will be the last rate hike,"" said Anton Pil, global head of fixed income at JP Morgan Private Bank in New York. At 4 p.m., the benchmark 10-year note was down 20/32 point, or $6.25 per $1,000 face value, at 97 24/32. Its yield rose to 4.788% from 4.707% Monday, as yields move inversely to prices. The 30-year bond shed 1 2/32 points to 95 9/32 to yield 4.80%. ""One more rate hike is what investors should be gearing their strategies toward,"" said Kevin Flanagan, fixed-income strategist at Morgan Stanley in Purchase, N.Y. Alex Li, bond strategist at Credit Suisse in New York, said he expects selling pressure to continue in maturities of two years and five years. The five-year note sustained the largest losses, with its yield rising more than 0.09 percentage point to 4.78%. The Treasury will sell $14 billion new five-year notes later this week, which hampered prospects for the maturity. After the Fed\'s move, banks raised their prime rates -- the base for many consumer loans -- to 7.75% from 7.50%.   Emerging-Market Bonds Brazil\'s debt sold off as investors digested the resignation of Finance Minister Antonio Palocci late Monday.

148,,2006-03-29 00:00:00,"['Options traders spent yesterday in much the same fashion as their stock-market cousins -- waiting for the Fed. Options players were looking ahead to the Federal Open Market Committee\'s interest-rate announcement, which was delivered in the afternoon. ""The activity this morning was quiet, because there was a lot of wait-and-see,"" said Frederic Ruffy, an analyst at Optionetics, shortly after the Fed announcement. With stocks selling off in the wake of the Fed\'s decision to raise rates again and keep the door open to future increases, volatility readings moved higher in the options market. The Chicago Board Options Exchange\'s market-volatility index, or VIX, climbed 0.12 to 11.58. Not all was quiet in the hours before the Fed spoke. Options in Nucor Corp. saw action, as shares of the Charlotte, N.C., steel company fell 55 cents, or 0.5%, to $103.77. Traders focused on Nucor\'s call options, such as April-expiring contracts with strike prices ranging from 40 to 85. The April 65 calls, for example, were up $3.80 at $40.60 as of late yesterday, with 26,169 contracts changing hands against open interest of 1,740 contracts. Michael Schwartz, Oppenheimer &Co.\'s chief options strategist, said the activity may have been related to a dividend play. In May, Nucor plans to pay a cash dividend of 70 cents a share to shareholders of record as of Friday. There was also some trading in Best Buy Co.\'s options. The home-electronics retailer is expected to announce fiscal fourth-quarter results tomorrow; yesterday, Best Buy shares rose 41 cents, or 0.7%, to $55.16. Some analysts are optimistic ahead of Best Buy\'s earnings report. But Mr. Ruffy noted that options trading has been ""cautious."" He pointed to renewed activity in Best Buy\'s puts. The April 50 and April 55 puts were particularly active. As of late yesterday, the April 50 puts had traded 7,090 contracts, compared with open interest of 8,025 contracts.

149,,2006-03-29 00:00:00,"['The dollar made impressive gains late in the session, rallying in the wake of the Federal Reserve\'s interest-rate increase and hints of more increases to come. As expected, the Federal Open Market Committee raised the key federal-funds rate by 0.25 percentage point to 4.75%, the 15th consecutive rate increase by that amount since June 2004. The meeting was the first FOMC meeting overseen by Ben Bernanke as Fed chairman. At late afternoon in New York, the euro was at $1.2009 from $1.2069 prior to the Fed announcement and from $1.2011 late Monday. The dollar was at 117.98 yen from 117.26 yen pre-FOMC and from 116.70 yen late Monday, up more than a yen on the day. The dollar was changing hands at 1.3096 Swiss francs from 1.3094 francs late Monday, and the pound fetched $1.7435 from $1.7474. Although the rate increase had been universally anticipated, investors were relieved that the statement implied additional rate increases may be needed. ""It\'s not a particularly hawkish statement, but some people were expecting something overly dovish, and when that didn\'t happen the market responded"" by buying dollars, said Jens Nordvig, global markets economist at Goldman Sachs in New York. Expectations of higher U.S. interest rates have been supportive of the dollar in recent months because dollar-denominated assets thereby become more attractive to investors. The statements that accompany FOMC decisions have come under close scrutiny for clues as to a possible end to the tightening cycle. During the market lull that customarily precedes FOMC rate decisions, several U.S. senators made announcements regarding U.S. efforts to encourage China to adopt a more flexible currency regime. Two longtime critics of China\'s yuan policy, Sens. Charles Schumer (D., N.Y.) and Lindsey Graham (R., S.C.), said they would delay a vote on a bill they sponsor that could impose punitive tariffs of 27.5% on imports of Chinese goods if China fails to allow its currency to appreciate significantly. Also, Senate Finance Committee leaders said they would introduce a bill directing the Treasury Department to take a tougher line in dealing with currency manipulation by trading partners. --- Azam Ahmed in New York, Elizabeth Price in Washington and Alastair Stewart in Sao Paulo contributed to this article.

150,,1998-05-20 00:00:00,"['WASHINGTON -- The Federal Reserve again decided to hold short-term interest rates steady, even though an amazingly strong U.S. economy has pushed the unemployment rate well below the level some inflation-fearing Fed officials consider wise. The decision to keep the key federal-funds rate at 5.5% was widely expected on Wall Street both because new turmoil in Asian financial markets make them particularly vulnerable to a surprise Fed move and because Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan had said nothing in public to prepare the markets for a rate increase. Some Fed watchers expect the Fed to raise shortterm rates later this year, unless the depressing effect of Asia\'s financial crisis or something else slows the economy from its robust pace. Seven of the 18 economists surveyed weekly by Macroeconomic Advisers, a St. Louis forecasting company, expect a 1/4 percentage point rate boost before Labor Day. Indeed, going into yesterday\'s meeting, some Fed officials were ready to raise rates as insurance against an acceleration of inflation from the current historical low level. But Mr. Greenspan apparently was not. The Fed won\'t disclose until early July whether any members of its policy-making Federal Open Market Committee formally dissented from yesterday\'s decision. However, economic forecasters suggest that economic growth may slow significantly in coming months from the better-than-3% pace of the past six quarters without a Fed rate boost. ""For the Fed to remain on hold, significant moderation of economic activity . . . needs to be seen . . . certainly by the Aug. 18 meeting,"" Merrill Lynch & Co. economist Bruce Steinberg said. ""We expect such moderation."" Even with last month\'s uptick in consumer prices, the government\'s consumer price index has risen just 1.4% during the past 12 months, equal to the lowest reading since December 1988 when falling oil prices damped inflation -- and close to the Fed\'s long-stated goal of ""price stability."" With inflation so low, some Fed officials have argued, the Fed can afford to take a wait-and-see stance. Business and labor groups that have been urging Mr. Greenspan to keep his hands off the interest-rate trigger greeted the Fed decision warmly. ""The wisest course is inaction,"" the National Association of Manufacturers said. ""The risk of doing it [raising rates], given Asia and the stock market, exceeded the risk of not doing it,"" said the National Federation of Independent Business. The stock market declined after the widely expected decision. A survey of 35 Wall Street economists by Dow Jones Newswires and CNBC found 33 of them predicted no change in rates. The Dow Jones Industrial Average, which had been up more than 50 points just before the Fed announcement, gave back nearly all the day\'s gains to finish up 3.74 to 9054.65. The bond market had little reaction. In late trading, the benchmark 30-year bond was down 6/32, or $1.875 for a bond with a $1,000 face value, at 102 17/32. The bond\'s yield rose to 5.933%. The Fed doesn\'t give any explanation when the committee maintains its current target for the federal-funds rate, at which banks lend money to one another overnight. Yesterday was no exception. The Fed simply said at about 2:15 p.m. EDT that its committee meeting had ended at 1:35 p.m. The committee next meets in a two-day session on June 30 and July 1. The Fed\'s summary of its March 31 meeting will be released tomorrow and closely scrutinized for clues to the Fed\'s thinking. The Fed changed its stance in March and concluded that rates were more likely to rise than fall in the near future. The summary will explain the reasons for that shift. The voting members of the Federal Open Market Committee include the seven Fed governors in Washington and the presidents of five of the 12 regional Fed banks.']",Fed Again Decides to Hold Rates Steady,1998-05-19,The Wall Street Journal
151,,2002-06-27 00:00:00,"['NEW YORK -- Whacked by the disclosure of a major accounting fraud at WorldCom Inc., the dollar tumbled against its key counterparts, at one point coming within striking distance of parity with the euro and prompting talk of a major meltdown in the U.S. currency. The dollar did regain some lost ground later in the session in line with gains in U.S. stocks, but the currency still ended New York trading around nine-month lows against the yen, a 28-month trough against the euro and at its weakest mark against the Swiss franc in close to three years. At one point, the euro traded as high as 99.45 cents, stoking talk that the common currency could reach the elusive bar of parity with the dollar as early as this week. Meanwhile, the dollar shrugged off a low-key monetary-policy statement from the Federal Open Market Committee, after the U.S. central bank left its key interest rates unchanged for the fourth time this year. The Fed said the economic outlook remains foggy, with risks ""balanced"" between inflation and too-slow economic growth. The message implied the Fed isn\'t preparing to raise or lower interest rates. As well as being sold off heavily on the Worldcom scandal, market participants also took comments from President Bush as an effective green light to sell the currency. Signaling that the U.S. won\'t likely step into the foreign-exchange market and try to prop up the flagging dollar, Mr. Bush said late Tuesday that market forces and economic fundamentals will determine the dollar\'s exchange rate, in the process casting doubt about the very existence of a so-called strong-dollar policy. Treasury officials scrambled to mop up any confusion sparked by Mr. Bush\'s rare foray into foreign-exchange policy, insisting that there was no change to the Bush administration\'s commitment to a strong currency. ""Nothing new. No change in dollar policy,"" a Treasury spokesman said. But currency-market participants viewed Mr. Bush\'s statement as a sign that the government won\'t stand in the way of a falling dollar, certainly as long as the decline in the currency doesn\'t transform into a straight-line plunge. ""The price of explicitly abandoning [the policy] is very high,"" said Jason Bonanca, vice president and foreign-exchange analyst at Credit Suisse First Boston in New York. He said Mr. Bush\'s remarks were ""one of many pieces of commentary that suggest that there is significant dilution of exactly what it means."" Late yesterday, the euro was at 98.20 cents, well off its intraday high of 99.45 cents, but still stronger than 97.85 cents late Tuesday in New York. The dollar was at 119.99 yen, again off its lows for the day near 118.98 yen, but still weaker than 121.38 yen late Tuesday in New York. The dollar was also at 1.4949 Swiss francs, down from 1.5006 francs late Tuesday in New York. Sterling was at $1.5259, up from $1.5066 late Tuesday. While the selloff in the dollar might have been overdone -- on an intraday basis, the euro jumped as much as 1. 5%, sterling by 1. 4% and the yen by 2% -- the WorldCom fraud nonetheless focused attention on the deep doubts hanging over what had been a covenant of faith between U.S. corporations and shareholders. It also raised the question of how many other U.S. companies might have engaged in similar practices. ""This brings attention to speculative excesses that bloated values in the telecommunications sector,"" said John Lonski, chief economist at Moody\'s Investors Service. As a result of WorldCom, ""investors will be increasingly wary of building up further positions within U.S. equities,"" which in turn is expected to ""speed up the pace of dollar\'s decline,"" said Michael Woolfolk, currency strategist with the Bank of New York. There were already key signs that the retreat from U.S. assets -- in particular equities - was gaining pace, which has already been weighing on the dollar. But the prospect of a rapid withdrawal from U.S. asset markets raises an additional raft of fears for the currency, which has effectively metamorphosed into a barometer of global risk. ""If the dollar\'s decline turns explosive, this could compound the problems of the U.S. asset markets as currency losses raise fears of a massive capital flight out of the U.S.,"" said Mark Cliffe, chief economist at ING Barings. The dollar failed even to get lasting respite from several rounds of intervention by the Bank of Japan, which is keen to stop a strong yen from derailing Japan\'s frail economic recovery. There were some silver linings for the dollar, however. The dollar gained against many of the key peripheral currencies -- including the so-called commodity bloc of the Australian, New Zealand and Canadian dollars as well as most Latin American currencies. At one point the Mexican peso, which tends to trade in tandem with the dollar, saw its rate against the dollar drop as far as 10.0725 pesos, a two-year low and well down from late Tuesday\'s 9.9010 pesos. But the peso also recovered some ground as the dollar clawed back, ending the day at 9.9575 pesos to the dollar. --- John Parry and Kristyne Demske contributed to this article.']","Currency Trading: Dollar Falls Against Key Rivals, Amid Fallout From WorldCom",2002-06-26,The Wall Street Journal
152,,2009-01-29 00:00:00,"['The Federal Reserve inched toward a new program to purchase long-term U.S. Treasury securities, possibly the next step in the central bank\'s battle against a recession that it said has only deepened in recent weeks. ""Industrial production, housing starts and employment have continued to decline steeply, as consumers and businesses have cut back spending,"" Fed officials said Wednesday in a policy statement following a two-day meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee, which sets the central bank\'s direction. ""Furthermore, global demand appears to be slowing significantly."" The Fed has already pulled its main lever for managing the economy as far as it can. Its benchmark short-term interest rate -- the federal-funds rate -- hovers near zero, and policy makers reiterated the rate would remain low ""for some time."" With the funds rate about as low as it can go, officials are focused on developing new lending and asset-purchase programs to bring down an array of other interest rates and boost the economy. On the list of next steps could be an effort to buy long-term government debt, which could in effect lower rates on mortgages and other debt. But the Fed is taking a slow path toward embracing the idea, something that has unsettled some investors. Disappointed that the central bank didn\'t take a more decisive step toward buying government bonds, investors sold Treasury bonds Wednesday. An effort to buy long-term government bonds could help the economy broadly because many kinds of debt -- from mortgages to corporate bonds -- are benchmarked to Treasury yields. Fed purchases could raise Treasury prices, which would reduce their yields and thus yields on other kinds of debt. Still, it would be a controversial move at a time when government budget deficits are soaring. Some might see it as an inflationary move to finance deficits by printing money. With economic slack building so abruptly around the world, Fed officials don\'t see inflation as a worry now. In their statement, they pointed to a different worry: that inflation would fall below their comfort levels, believed to be roughly between 1% and 2%. An abrupt fall in inflation raises the inflation-adjusted cost of borrowing, which could be a new hindrance to growth and recovery. Two other programs geared toward the credit market are still in the process of being ramped up. Officials have high hopes they will more directly ease strains afflicting consumers and businesses. In one, the Fed is buying $600 billion of securities issued or guaranteed by government-linked mortgage-finance companies like Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. In the other, which won\'t be operational until February, it will provide up to $200 billion of financing to investors buying securities tied to consumer debt like car loans or credit cards. ""There are lots of channels through which the Fed is working hard and using its balance sheet to ease financial conditions,"" said Richard Berner, chief U.S. economist with Morgan Stanley. ""Buying Treasurys is only one of those."" Operationally, buying Treasurys would be easy for the Fed after a year of complicated efforts to revive markets. It has clear legal authority to buy government debt and the markets desk of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York has a long history of trading bonds with securities dealers. The approach is favored by some members of the Fed\'s policy-making arm, the Federal Open Market Committee. Dissenting from the Fed\'s latest policy statement Wednesday, Jeffrey Lacker, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, said purchasing Treasury bonds was preferable to the Fed\'s many other new lending programs. Moreover, Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke has highlighted the possibility of Treasury purchases twice in speeches since December. In its statement Wednesday, the central bank said it ""is prepared"" to take such a step, stronger language than it has used before. But the Fed said it depended on ""evolving circumstances,"" and whether such a move would translate into help for private-sector debt markets. It offered no plan for moving forward on such purchases. The market sold off sharply on the hesitant approach. The 10 and 30-year Treasury bonds fell on the day by 1 9/32 points and 4 11/32 points, respectively. Treasury yields are still very low. The yield on a 10-year note hit 2.66% Wednesday. Still, they have pushed higher in recent weeks, from just above 2% in December. Uncertainty about the Fed is one factor pushing yields up recently. A range of other factors are at play, from the mountain of supply hitting the market as deficits rise, to concerns that foreign buyers may back away as the global economy contracts. Many estimates put the Treasury\'s borrowings this year at $1.5 trillion to $2 trillion. In recent years, $300 billion was considered a large amount. Peter Hooper, chief economist for Deutsche Bank, said the Fed hasn\'t felt much pressure to begin the program because Treasury yields have been so low. But ""if Treasury yields rise appreciably,"" he said, then the program ""becomes a more important part of the picture."" The economic backdrop is souring fast. Economists believe the nation\'s gross domestic product contracted at an annual rate of 5% or more in the fourth quarter.

153,,2000-10-04 00:00:00,"[""NEW YORK -- The specter of slower corporate earnings growth smashed into the options market, but traders seemed unfazed. They plowed deeper into the largest blue-chip stocks, treating Xerox Corp.'s third-quarter warning as a company-specific problem. Cisco Systems Corp., Intel Corp., Nortel Networks Corp. and Oracle Corp. traded actively in the session, though traders were reluctant to remain fully committed to their positions. Recent patterns in the options and stock markets indicate that traders are selling rallies and buying declines. The Standard & Poor's 500 futures contract was meaningfully higher before the financial markets opened, and into the first hours of trading, but the futures ultimately sold off, which led traders to take some profits out of winning positions that were established at the opening. The decline, however, ultimately reignited another wave of buying. The option market's fear gauge, the Chicago Board Options Exchange Market Volatility Index, or VIX, rose 0.96 to 24.39. An increase in the VIX generally means that traders are getting nervous about the stock market. When the index declines, it often indicates that traders are optimistic, or complacent, about the stock market. Traders spent the day with one eye on their trading monitors and the other on the clock in anticipation of the end of the Federal Open Market Committee's meeting. The committee wasn't expected to raise interest rates, but the lack of certainty was enough to restrain traders from establishing overly long or short positions in their portfolios. The CBOE's equity put/call ratio was 0.70, indicating that 70 defensive puts traded for every 100 bullish calls. While the ratio showed that traders were trading puts because they were concerned about the sustainability of the Dow Jones Industrial Average's advance yesterday, the put activity wasn't enough to telegraph a buying opportunity. The index is considered bullish above 0.75; neutral from 0.40 to 0.75 and bearish below 0.40. Elsewhere in the options market, the CBOE's index put/call ratio was 1.55. The ratio, also a contrarian sentiment indicator, is considered bullish if the ratio is above 1.5; neutral from 0.75 to 1.5 and bearish below 0.75.""]",Options Traders Appear Unfazed in the Face Of Specter of Slowdown in Corporate Earnings,2000-10-03,The Wall Street Journal
154,,2000-10-04 00:00:00,"['WASHINGTON -- The economy will continue to glide toward a soft landing with slower growth in the months to come, new economic data show. The Conference Board\'s Index of Leading Economic Indicators, designed to predict economic conditions in the next six months, fell 0.1% in August, after dropping 0.2% in July. The index has been flat or declining for all of 2000 except for a 0.1% increase in March. The data suggest the economy is likely to continue slowing into the early part of 2001 before stabilizing. The economy expanded at a surprising 5.3% annual rate in the second quarter, but many analysts expect the pace of gross-domestic-product growth to drop to between 3% and 3.5% for the rest of 2000, and remain at about that level for much of 2001. ""The days of 5% GDP growth are behind us,"" said Ken Goldstein, an economist at the Conference Board, a New York-based market-research firm. The report was good news for the Federal Reserve, which has raised interest rates six times since June 1999 to cool the economy and stave off inflation. Yesterday, the Federal Open Market Committee held rates steady. For much of the year, the housing sector offered some of the clearest evidence of a cooling economy, as rising interest rates, which make housing more expensive, hampered sales. But the sector has begun to show some signs of a resurgence. The Commerce Department reported that new-home sales fell 3% in August to a seasonally adjusted rate of 893,000 units a year, but that came after a huge 11.8% rise in July. All told, new-home sales remained 2.3% lower than the torrid pace a year earlier. Meantime, existing-home sales surged 9.3% in August, while overall construction spending grew 1.4%. All three measures have largely reversed their earlier declines. One reason: lower mortgage rates. The interest rate for a 30-year mortgage was 7.88% last week, a notch higher than the 7.63% level of June 1999, but well off the recent high of 8.64% in May, according to Freddie Mac, the mortgage purchaser. In the Conference Board report, six of the leading index\'s 10 components -- including manufacturing hours and consumer expectations -- declined. A sustained decrease signals weaker economic conditions, though Mr. Goldstein predicted the slowdown wouldn\'t be severe. The economy, he said, is like ""a hurricane with 115-mile-per-hour winds that slows to 75 miles per hour: It still packs a lot of wallop.""

155,,2000-10-04 00:00:00,"['NEW YORK -- Big technology stocks suffered as worry spread that the profit problems of technology companies had spread to the market leaders.    Shares of Oracle fell $9.25, or more than 11%, to 69.50 on the Nasdaq Stock Market, after an analyst at Merrill Lynch shared cautious comments with the firm\'s sales staff following a meeting Oracle officials held with analysts. Oracle shares had been edging lower throughout the session, then fell sharply in the final hour of trading.    At the same time, shares of International Business Machines dropped in the final hour, as fears that the company would issue an earnings warning spread throughout Wall Street. The stock finished down 7.25 at 110.56.    Investors initially had pushed some stocks up, allowing market averages to post modest gains. Even an earnings warning from copier maker Xerox was considered a company-specific, rather than sectorwide, problem. Xerox shares fell 3.94 to 11.38, a 52-week low. However, the optimism withered in the face of speculation about further earnings warnings.    The Dow Jones Industrial Average ended the session at 10719.74, up 19.61, or 0.18%. IBM\'s decline shaved 42.19 points off the average.    The Nasdaq Composite Index fell to 3455.83, down 113.07, or 3.2%.    ""There is so much negative sentiment out there in the market,"" Adam Weisman, a trader at Wit SoundView, said. ""The last thing people want to hear is bad news about leadership names.""    Several stocks whose high valuations had remained intact coming into this week despite selling elsewhere came under pressure. I2 Technologies dropped 17.88 to 152, while Ciena sank 11.25 to 110.13. Ariba fell 14.58 to 112.48, and PMC-Sierra slid 13.50 to 199.25, all on Nasdaq. Commerce One, hurt by pessimistic comments from an analyst at Jefferies, which lowered its rating on the stock, declined 13.69, or nearly 19%, to 58.88.    The sell-off came in another session of vigorous trading. Nasdaq trading totaled 1.90 billion shares, up from the 1.72 billion that changed hands Monday, while action on the New York Stock Exchange amounted to 1.09 billion, up from 1.02 billion Monday.    The technology sell-off came at the same time the Federal Reserve released a statement saying it left interest rates unchanged at its Federal Open Market Committee meeting. But that outcome had been widely expected.    Shares of several blue-chip names thrived during the session. Minnesota Mining & Manufacturing gained 2.31 to 94, Alcoa added 2.44 to 26.94 and International Paper rose 1.63 to 29.63. Those names, though, had been coming off relatively low bases. Both Alcoa and International Paper reached 52-week lows last week, suggesting some bargain-hunting was at work.    Meanwhile, money-management firm Neuberger Berman rose 3.63, or 5.6%, to 68.38 on speculation the firm would be taken over by a large financial conglomerate. Jeffrey Lane, president and chief executive of Neuberger, said he ""won\'t comment on rumors."" Analysts say banks, insurers and brokerage firms have been eyeing asset-management businesses with particularly wealthy clients such as those of Neuberger, New York. The stock rose 3.25 Monday.    Investors, hesitant to own technology shares, gravitated to other sectors. Media stocks found a following. Shares of Cox Communications added 2.38 to 41.94, while Time Warner rose 1.15 to 81.01. Cablevision Systems added 1.44 to 70.44, and Adelphia Communications rose 1.13 to 28.81.    Shares of home builders also gained ground, with several names reaching 52-week highs. Economic data released during the session showed that new-home sales slid in August following a sharp gain in July, but nevertheless reflected healthy demand for housing. Shares of Lennar gained 1.06 to 31.25, reaching a 52-week high. Pulte, helped by comments from Goldman Sachs, which started coverage of the stock yesterday, gained 56 cents to 33.56. Centex moved up 1.38 to 34.38. Goodyear Tire & Rubber fell 1 to 17.29, near its 52-week low. Lehman Brothers lowered its earnings forecast for the Akron, Ohio, tire maker, and said it expected the company to reduce its dividend.    Raytheon\'s class B shares moved up 1.75 to 29. Striking workers at the Lexington, Mass., defense contractor voted to accept a four-year agreement Monday, ending a monthlong strike against the company.    Electronics For Imaging fell 4.19 to 20.50, a 52-week low, on Nasdaq, caught in Xerox\'s profit warnings. Analysts said that about one-third of sales at the Foster City, Calif., maker of printer components are made to Xerox. Morgan Stanley Dean Witter cut its rating on the stock yesterday.    Covad Communications fell 2.09 to 9.91 on Nasdaq, pulling back even though the Santa Clara, Calif., provider of Internet access services said it expected to meet its third-quarter earnings targets.    Equifax rose 3.25 to 29.94, reaching a 52-week high in intraday trading. Bear Stearns raised its rating on the Atlanta provider of information services about consumer credit, following the company\'s announcement Monday that it wants to separate into two businesses, spinning off its payment-services division to shareholders.    Intersil gained 25 cents to 41.81 on Nasdaq. Lehman Brothers issued an upbeat research note on the Palm Bay, Fla., semiconductor maker, saying the stock is undervalued, and that it expected strong third-quarter numbers from the company.    Mentor Graphics fell 2.19 to 20.44 on Nasdaq. Credit Suisse First Boston issued a research note in which it recommended that investors take some profits in the stock, adding that it wasn\'t enthusiastic about the company\'s fundamentals.

156,,2004-12-15 00:00:00,"['The Federal Reserve raised its key interest-rate target for the fifth time this year, giving no signal it would either speed up or slow down the pace of rate changes next year. As widely expected, the Fed raised its target for the federal-funds rate to 2.25% from 2%. It was the fifth consecutive policy meeting at which the central bank raised the target a quarter of a percentage point. In language almost identical to what it said after its November meeting, the Fed said the economy is growing at a ""moderate pace"" despite high energy prices, the job market continues ""to improve gradually,"" and both inflation and longer-term inflation expectations remain ""well contained."" The Fed also reaffirmed its intention to raise rates at a ""measured"" pace, interpreted as no more than a quarter point per meeting. Investors trading futures contracts based on movements in the fed-funds rate currently put a near 100% probability that the Fed will raise the rate to 2.5% at its meeting Feb. 1-2, but are split on the likelihood the Fed will repeat that step at the March 22 meeting. Economists said the 19-member Federal Open Market Committee shed no new light on its inclinations. ""The outlook is now data-dependent,"" said Lou Crandall, chief economist at Wrightson Associates, a money-market research firm in New York. ""The world could change over the next few weeks and they\'re not prejudging it."" There was one slight hint of less inclination to pause in its rate increases. All 12 of the Fed\'s regional banks had submitted requests to raise the discount rate, up from 10 in November. That little-used levy on central-bank advances to commercial banks moves in lockstep with the more important fed-funds rate, charged on overnight loans between banks. Several commercial banks raised their prime rate, a benchmark for many business and consumer loans, to 5.25% from 5%. The Fed said, as it has since March, that there are ""roughly equal"" risks of the economy growing faster or slower than its ideal rate, and of inflation going too high or too low. Markets, relieved that the Fed gave no sign of greater concern on inflation, pushed down long-term interest rates. Stocks rose. Laurence Meyer, a former Fed governor and a Fed analyst at St. Louis forecasting firm Macroeconomic Advisers LLC, said the Fed is torn between data that show the economy to be strong and expectations that a widening trade deficit, high energy prices and less fuel from tax cuts will weigh on growth in the coming year. He predicted the Fed, after raising interest rates in February, would slow the pace of increases thereafter, so that the funds rate reaches about 3.5% by year end. Separately, the FOMC said it would begin releasing minutes to its deliberations three weeks after a policy meeting, instead of the Thursday after the subsequent meeting five to seven weeks later. It is the latest move by the Fed to become more transparent. The earlier release should give the public a better understanding of what drove a particular decision, and more appreciation of any divergence of views within the Fed. Under the old schedule, issues raised in the minutes often had been superseded by intervening developments by the time the public read them. ""In the current environment, where the Fed is being so predictable and there are so few surprises, it won\'t add or subtract that much,"" said Ken Kuttner, an economist at Oberlin College who worked on communications issues while a staff economist at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. ""But when the turning point in interest rates comes, having the minutes available [sooner] will make some difference."" The FOMC had been considering earlier release for at least a year, but officials first had to reassure themselves it wouldn\'t distract from the Fed\'s postmeeting statement. Another concern was whether the central-bank staff could prepare the minutes, which are based on a full meeting transcript, and circulate them for approval in time. The Fed\'s first rate increases were driven primarily by the need to lift the rate from extraordinary lows appropriate only when the economy faced the risk of deflation. With yesterday\'s increase, the rate is firmly above the underlying inflation rate -- 1.5%, according to the Fed\'s preferred measure -- and the Fed is keying its moves more to the ebb and flow of data on growth and inflation. While all 12 voting FOMC members were unanimous in yesterday\'s action, there is growing divergence on the outlook for growth and inflation. Some officials are becoming more wary on the outlook for inflation. Productivity growth -- which enables firms to become ever more efficient -- has slowed, and firms are trying harder to raise prices in response to higher material costs and the lower dollar. In a survey of 185 chief financial officers released yesterday, 56% said their companies have felt rising producer prices and of those, 77% plan to pass along between half and all of that increased cost to consumers. The survey was conducted by Financial Executives International, a trade association, and Baruch College in New York. But other Fed officials think inflation will remain tightly under wraps. They note with factories operating below normal capacity and unemployment still relatively high, businesses will remain hard-pressed to raise prices and workers will struggle to win pay increases.

Traders held their powder before the Federal Reserve\'s Open Market Committee announced it would raise its target short-term interest rate to 2.25%. But after the statement, which included reassurances that the central bankers would maintain a ""measured"" pace of monetary tightening, investors got busy. Stocks pushed higher despite a 2% gain in oil, a record trade gap and somewhat subtle indications from the Fed that the soft labor market just isn\'t firming up. Could the fabled ""Santa Claus"" rally finally be under way? Blue chips have advanced four out of the past five sessions and are up 2% for the month, with only seven more trading days before the Christmas holiday. The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished up 38.13 points, or 0.4%, at 10676.45 -- the average is now just 60 points off the 2004 high. Alcoa weighed on the industrials, slumping 1.7% after J.P. Morgan downgraded the aluminum company on concerns of higher costs and declining demand, among other reasons. But Intel, another Dow component, gained 2.7% on a broad rally in the technology sector. That helped carry the Nasdaq Composite Index up 0.5%, or 11.34 points, to 2159.84. Reports of merger talks between security-software makers Symantec and Veritas Software helped prop up the tech sector. The broad Standard &Poor\'s 500-stock index added 4.7 points, or 0.4%, to 1203.38, padding its three-year high. While investors held their collective breath until the Fed announcement, the rate increase wasn\'t a surprise. The economy ""appears to be growing at a moderate pace, despite the earlier increase in energy prices, and labor-market conditions continue to improve gradually,"" the policy makers said. The ""gradually"" caveat -- a concession to a soft job market -- was the only alteration from the FOMC\'s last statement, in November. ""There had been some talk about more recognition of inflation risk, given [Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan\'s] observations in Frankfurt a few weeks back,"" said Peter Hooper, chief U.S. economist at Deutsche Bank, referring to concerns Mr. Greenspan expressed about trade and current-account deficits. But there was no such recognition, and stocks celebrated. In addition to the Dow\'s move closer to its 2004 high, which puts it up 2% for the year so far, the Nasdaq composite, up about 8% for the year, ended at a more-than three-year high. The S&P 500 closed above 1200 for the first time since August 2001, before the 9/11 terrorist attacks; it also is up 8% for the year. Merrill Lynch analysts weighed in with a bullish call for stocks in 2005, citing unleashed corporate cash that has boosted merger activity. Stocks ""offer more compelling risk-adjusted returns relative to their bond counterparts,"" the bank\'s global equity research department said. While the Fed may be conceding jobs are in short supply, U.S. consumers continue to skew global trade balances. A report of a surprisingly sharp jump in the U.S. trade deficit showed that it swelled 8.9% to $55.46 billion in October -- the widest gap since June, when it hit $55.34 billion. While record-high oil prices played a part, the voracious demand for cheap consumer goods from China also was to blame. The trade deficit with China ballooned 8% to $16.8 billion for the month, a record high. It\'s a record that comes amid a tacit U.S. policy to drive down the dollar to help offset the nation\'s trade and budget deficits. Treasury Secretary John Snow has left it for the market to sort out the greenback\'s value. Mr. Greenspan\'s comments to foreign bankers in Frankfurt last month about the threat of the twin deficits were interpreted by many as an endorsement of a weak-dollar policy. The dollar, however, held its ground against the euro yesterday while gaining on the yen as currency traders seemed to have discounted the exploding trade deficit into the greenback.

158,,2004-12-15 00:00:00,"['KANSAS CITY, Mo. -- A U.S. Commerce Department move to reduce countervailing and antidumping duties on imports of Canadian softwood lumber surprised futures traders, who had expected deeper cuts, and led to minimal gains in lumber futures. The Chicago Mercantile Exchange\'s January lumber contract rose 90 cents a thousand board feet to $331.40, and the March position rose $1.40 to $345.50. The Commerce Department announced shortly after noon CST that it was lowering the countervailing duty to 17.18% from 18.79% and the antidumping duty to 4.03% from 8.4%. Before the announcement, traders said they were expecting a combined reduction of about 9% rather than the 6% that was announced. ""The news was a little less bearish than anticipated,"" said Sandi Castillo of Rosenthal Collins Group LLC. Prices settled higher, but since the duty reductions were less than expected, the reaction was minimal and disappointing, traders said. Lumber prices opened narrowly mixed but declined quickly on follow-through selling from Monday\'s inability to hold a rally attempt and on anticipation of a reduction in the Canadian lumber duties, said Bob Book, senior lumber analyst at TJ&R Trading Corp., Chicago. The sharp pullback from Monday\'s high made traders nervous about betting prices would rise, especially since there were no early reports of cash markets making any kind of a rally attempt. As prices were falling, however, word filtered into the pit that one large British Columbia spruce-pine-fir lumber producer found a price at which lumber would move in quantity, Mr. Book said. This price was well below other mills\' quotes, and though the other producers weren\'t selling much, the fact that one was having a good day persuaded traders that maybe the market was finding some firm footing. In addition, at the lows, the January contract fell below even that major producer\'s low prices, and commercial traders stepped in to cover their needs, Mr. Book said. Another broker said rumors began seeping into the pit that the duty announcement would be less of a cut than expected. That prompted local and outside investors to cover earlier bets that prices would fall, and the market began to rise to the day\'s highs, where the buying interest ran out, Ms. Castillo said. HEATING OIL: Futures prices on the New York Mercantile Exchange rose as the first wave of cold weather spread across the U.S. midsection and the Atlantic Coast region. Some weather forecasters are also calling for colder temperatures to persist for a couple of weeks. Heating oil for January delivery rose 4.75 cents a gallon to $1.3045.

159,,1990-03-28 00:00:00,"['Several rounds of computer-guided buy programs put a shiny gloss on an otherwise lackluster stock market, while bond prices eased a bit and the dollar climbed sharply. The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 29.28 points to 2736.94 in light trading, but only after being pushed to and fro by various buy or sell programs. At one point the Dow Jones industrials slipped under the 2700 mark before rebounding in late afternoon trading. Analysts said stock market investors are frozen by uncertainty, which was reflected in the low volume yesterday and Monday. Only 131.6 million shares changed hands on the New York Stock Exchange yesterday. Monday\'s volume was even lower at 116.1 million shares. ""The whole mood is very uncertain,"" said Laszlo Birinyi, a market strategist who owns his own firm. ""There is no reason for people to do anything at this point. The feeling is that we\'re not going to have any real breakout. With very few exceptions, if you missed something earlier this year, you had a chance to do it again later."" He said that with relatively few shares offered for sale or sought for purchase, buy or sell programs can have exaggerated effects on stock prices. He said a buy program early yesterday afternoon effectively swept up shares offered for sale and subsequent buy programs then drove prices up. Other analysts cited growing worries that disappointing first-quarter earnings may deal stocks a harsh blow. That\'s offsetting any temptation money managers may have to engage in end-of-the-quarter ""window-dressing,"" in which they attempt to be holding winning stocks in their portfolios when they report to clients. ""The earnings do spook people, and you just can\'t get around that,"" said Marshall Acuff, a portfolio strategist at Smith Barney, Harris Upham & Co. Stock investors got little leadership from the bond market. Despite a powerful dollar rally, which often provides a foundation for higher bond prices, the Treasury\'s benchmark 30-year bond barely budged. Fixed-income investors are still without a clear sense of direction for the economy and monetary policy. The Federal Reserve\'s Federal Open Market Committee, which sets monetary policy, met yesterday, but traders said they don\'t expect the Fed to make any changes until March employment and inflation data are available. Currency traders noted that while the dollar staged healthy rallies against the mark and yen, the U.S. currency isn\'t likely to continue strengthening against the mark. They said underlying demand for the German currency will halt its slide. But the dollar\'s upward trend against the yen may continue because it appears to be resulting mostly from the fundamental weakness of the Japanese currency. In major market action: Stock prices shot up in thin trading. Advancing issues on the New York Stock Exchange outnumbered decliners 889 to 569. Bond prices edged lower. The Treasury\'s benchmark 30-year issue slipped less than an eighth of a point, or less than $1.25 for each $1,000 of face amount. The yield on the issue stood at 8.46%. The dollar climbed. In late New York trading, the currency was quoted at 1.7135 marks and 157.74 yen, compared with 1.6910 marks and 156.70 yen.']",Programs Help Stocks Post Gains --- Prices of Bonds End Down a Bit Despite Dollar's Sharp Rise,1990-03-27,The Wall Street Journal

The evidence accumulated over the intermeeting period confirms that spending is firming, although the labor market has been weakening. Business pricing power and increases in core consumer prices remain muted.The committee perceives that the upside and downside risks to the attainment of sustainable growth for the next few quarters are roughly equal. In contrast, the probability, though minor, of an unwelcome fall in inflation exceeds that of a rise in inflation from its already low level. The committee judges that on balance, the risk of inflation becoming undesirably low remains the predominant concern for the foreseeable future. In these circumstances, the committee believes that policy accommodation can be maintained for a considerable period.Voting for the F.O.M.C. monetary policy action were: Alan Greenspan, chairman; Ben S. Bernanke; Susan S. Bies; J. Alfred Broaddus Jr.; Roger W. Ferguson Jr.; Edward M. Gramlich; Jack Guynn; Donald L. Kohn; Michael H. Moskow; Mark W. Olson; Robert T. Parry; and Jamie B. Stewart Jr.

161,,2003-09-17 00:00:00,"The Federal Reserve retained its cautious outlook for the economy today, leaving short-term interest rates unchanged at 1 percent.The decision was not a surprise as Fed officials announced a month ago that they were prepared to keep the benchmark federal funds rate at its current low levels ''for a considerable period.''If there was an added nuance to the decision today by the Federal Open Market Committee, which sets monetary policy, it was in its slightly more pessimistic tone about unemployment. In its statement accompanying today's decision, the Fed noted that the labor market had been weakening. That reflected the continued loss of jobs last month and several unexpected jumps in the number of people seeking unemployment claims. By contrast, the Fed described labor conditions last month as mixed.The wording suggested that Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve, was more worried than before that a continuation of the relatively high unemployment rate -- slightly above 6 percent of the work force -- could affect economic growth in the months ahead.

Prices of Treasury bonds and notes moved lower yesterday, with the bulk of the losses recorded among long-term issues.The Commerce Department's merchandise trade data, which showed only a marginal narrowing of the deficit in October from September, were in line with market expectations.Nevertheless, the figures, which showed that the deficit fell to $10.35 billion in October from a revised $10.67 billion for September, were a disappointment to many traders.''The Street was secretly thinking that the deficit figure would be $9 billion or lower,'' one government securities trader said. ''Also, the number we got told us that we will not be getting any further improvement, that with the dollar where it is we may continue to run monthly deficits in the $10 billion to $11 billion range.'' $1 Billion Bond Sale While the trade data provided an early impetus to sell, the bulk of the downward move in bond prices was provided by what market participants described as a huge move out of 30-year bonds and into 10-year notes. According to some traders, the transaction, which was done for a domestic account, involved the sale of $1 billion worth of bonds.

The nation's trade deficit narrowed modestly in October to $10.3 billion, as imports declined twice as much as exports, the Commerce Department reported today.It was the second straight month in which the deficit has narrowed, but the $400 million improvement, though about as expected, was far less than in September. Economists and other experts were divided on whether the latest trade figures represented a positive development.Some economists said the slower pace of both imports and exports indicated a welcome slowdown in the economy that might relieve some pressure on the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates further to counter a possible speed-up in inflation. 'A Little Moderation'''It does suggest we're seeing a little moderation,'' Evelina M. Tainer, a senior economist at the First National Bank of Chicago, said of the trade numbers. She added that ''there still is an improving trend'' in trade.

Other analysts disagreed. Even though the economy showed signs of settling back into a more sustainable growth path during the summer, this now appears to have been only a temporary lull partly as a result of the drought. Most of the recent indicators, including stunningly strong November employment growth reported on Dec. 2, have been buoyant to strong.

Following is a transcript of President-elect Bush's remarks and some of Clayton Y. Yeutter's remarks at a news conference in Washington yesterday, as recorded by The New York Times through the facilities of ABC Radio News:  OPENING STATEMENTSMR. BUSH: Well, I'm pleased today to announce another Cabinet selection and a very, very important one. It is my intention to nominate Clayton Yeutter to serve as Secretary of Agriculture. His wide knowledge of the issues, obviously demonstrated skill and broad experience make him quite simply the best man for this very important job. He himself has worked in farming. He's a noted scholar of agricultural economics and he's twice before held sensitive regulatory and trade posts in the Department of Agriculture. And for many years now he's served the nation with highest distinction as trade representative and international negotiator.Since 1985, Clayton has served in the Cabinet as U.S.T.R. - United States Trade Representative - the man principally responsible for the development and execution of American trade policy. And in that office he's accomplished much in the way of notable work for our country on a number of fronts. Our new and historic free trade agreement with Canada is as much as anything the product of his personal dedication and his personal diplomacy. He's the man who persuaded Congress to remove dangerous protectionist provisions from the omnibus trade and competitiveness bill of 1988, and then his ongoing work in international trade will make a perfect jumping-off point for the important work that lies ahead in American agricultural policy.Ambassador Yeutter has just returned from Montreal where the 96 member nations of GATT completed this midterm review of the Uruguay round of multilateral trade negotiations. Now President Reagan's objectives in these negotiations are mine, and I know they're Clayton Yeutter's as well - a comprehensive reform of world agricultural trade rules by 1990. And I'm confident that Ambassador Yeutter will continue to ably pursue this goal in his new post, and that our shared national goal of free agricultural trade and expanded agricultural exports abroad will have no better spokesman, no greater advocate. So he knows foreign policy domestically, he knows it internationally, and I am just delighted to think that I will be serving with him as our new - when he becomes our new Secretary of Agriculture.

You're entitled to equal time:MR. YEUTTER: Well, thank you Mr. Vice President. I won't take equal time, because that was a very eloquent statement. I would simply say, Mr. Vice President, as you already know, that I really had intended to return to the private sector at the conclusion of the Reagan Administration, and as I said to you this morning there are only a few people in the world who could convince me to carry forward in another stint in Government, but you're one of those few. And I am deeply honored to serve you, Mr. Vice President, in the coming years, and I hope we'll have a lot of fun in dealing with some very difficult issues - difficult and challenging issues in agriculture. But those are the kinds of issues that make life interesting and rewarding. Continue reading the main story",Transcript of Bush's Remarks on Domestic and Foreign Issues,1988-12-14,The New York Times
165,,2009-11-05 00:00:00,"The Dow Jones industrial average erased almost all of a 156-point rally after the House of Representatives passed a bill to curb rate increases on credit cards, touching off concern about bank earnings. The news outweighed investor optimism after the Federal Reserve said it planned to keep interest rates at a record low, Bloomberg News reported.
“Businesses are still cutting back on fixed investment and staffing, though at a slower pace,” the Federal Open Market Committee said in a statement on Wednesday after meeting in Washington. “Activity in the housing sector has increased over recent months.”
Gold surged, settling at $1,092.20 an ounce, after the Fed announcement. The dollar, meanwhile, slipped as much as 1 percent against a basket of six currencies.
This year, gold has soared 24 percent, heading for a ninth annual gain, as the dollar fell 6.8 percent. Gold has climbed on speculation that central banks and investors will buy more metal to hedge against a falling dollar. India’s central bank said this week that it bought 200 metric tons of gold from the International Monetary Fund last month.
“With interest rates so low, money is seeking markets that have an upside,” Leonard Kaplan, the president of Prospector Asset Management in Evanston, Ill., told Bloomberg News. “Momentum is crucial, and gold has a lot of momentum.”
The Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index wiped out most of a 1.5 percent rally that began after the Fed said it would leave interest rates at “exceptionally low” levels for an extended period.
“If you’re going to limit how much banks could charge in their credit cards, that’s going to limit profits,” said Art Hogan, the chief market analyst at Jefferies & Company. “So it’s certainly another source of pressure.”
At the end of the day, the S.& P. 500 added 0.1 percent, or 1.09 points, to 1,046.5. The Dow increased 30.23 points, or 0.3 percent, to 9,802.14. About five stocks fell for every four that rose on the New York Stock Exchange.
Wells Fargo, JPMorgan Chase and Citigroup led financial shares to the steepest loss among 10 industries. The House legislation would move up the start date of many rule changes that will make it more difficult for banks to increase rates on credit cards.
The S.& P. 500 rallied in morning trading after the Institute for Supply Management’s report on nonmanufacturing businesses showed 1.4 percent growth in new orders and a 2 percent increase in the backlog of orders. The main index in the report fell to 50.6, below analysts’ estimates but still signaling growth.
Some traders may have sold shares in anticipation of the Friday report on the job market in the United States. Economists on average are estimating that the unemployment rate increased to 9.9 percent in October, according to a Bloomberg survey.
The Treasury’s 10-year note fell 16/32, to 100 26/32. The yield rose 3.52 percent, from 3.47 percent late Tuesday.

Eleven Senate Democrats today brought out a $22 billion package of bills that they said would revive the nation's competitiveness in international markets.Competitiveness and trade policy have faded as issues in the Presidential campaign, as have unsuccessful candidates in both parties who focused on them. And the senators, led by George Mitchell of Maine, the majority leader, conceded that many of the 30 proposals in their package were not new. But they contended that the presentation of their ideas as a package would dramatize the Bush Administration's reluctance to pursue an industrial policy.They called the plan a comprehensive strategy to maintain American technological leadership, rebuild manufacturing, create high-wage jobs and tighten trade laws. At its core is a trade bill with two central provisions.  Reviewing Foreign TradingOne would allow industries to force the Administration to review foreign compliance with trade bills. The other would revive Super 301, a section of American trade law, much criticized by foreign governments, that would force the United States trade representative to challenge foreign trade barriers on a faster and more rigid schedule. The bill would not include restrictions on car imports from Japan.

167,,1999-08-25 00:00:00,"Following is the statement by the Federal Open Market Committee, the Federal Reserve's monetary policy panel, after its decision yesterday to raise short-term interest rates:The Federal Open Market Committee today voted to raise its target for the Federal funds rate by 25 basis points, to 5.25 percent. In a related action, the board of governors approved a 25-basis-point increase in the discount rate, to 4.75 percent.With financial markets functioning more normally, and with persistent strength in domestic demand, foreign economies firming and labor markets remaining very tight, the degree of monetary ease required to address the global financial market turmoil of last fall is no longer consistent with sustained, noninflationary economic expansion.Today's increase in the Federal funds rate, together with the policy action in June and the firming of conditions more generally in U.S. financial markets over recent months, should markedly diminish the risk of rising inflation going forward. As a consequence, the directive the Federal Open Market Committee adopted is symmetrical with regard to the outlook for policy over the near term.In taking the discount rate action, the Federal Reserve Board approved requests submitted by the boards of directors of the Federal Reserve Banks of Boston, New York, Philadelphia, Cleveland, Richmond, Atlanta, Chicago, St. Louis, Kansas City and San Francisco. The discount rate is the interest rate that is charged depository institutions when they borrow from their district Federal Reserve Banks.

Prices of Treasury bonds and notes were little changed yesterday in trading ahead of today's vote on the North American Free Trade Agreement in the House of Representatives.The outlook for approval of the trade treaty linking the United States, Canada and Mexico is still unclear. But some traders said yesterday that they were a little more confident that the Clinton Administration could win approval. A vote is not expected until after trading is finished in New York today.In a separate development, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York said that it had requested data on the trading of the 30-year bond from the primary dealers that are at the center of trading in the bond market.The request confirms that the Fed is looking into what the market already knows: there is a shortage of the 30-year bond, which could be pushing price artifically higher. What could happen next is that the Treasury could decide to issue more of the same bond in an effort to relieve the shortage. The speculation in the market yesterday was that this increase could occur even before the next scheduled 30-year auction, which is in Feburary.

170,,2005-09-21 00:00:00,"Following is the text of a statement released by the Federal Reserve yesterday after the Fed's monetary policy panel, the Federal Open Market Committee, decided to raise its benchmark interest rates a quarter-point:The Federal Open Market Committee decided today to raise its target for the federal funds rate by 25 basis points to 3 3/4 percent.Output appeared poised to continue growing at a good pace before the tragic toll of Hurricane Katrina. The widespread devastation in the gulf region, the associated dislocation of economic activity and the boost to energy prices imply that spending, production and employment will be set back in the near term. In addition to elevating premiums for some energy products, the disruption to the production and refining infrastructure may add to energy price volatility.While these unfortunate developments have increased uncertainty about near-term economic performance, it is the committee's view that they do not pose a more persistent threat. Rather, monetary policy accommodation, coupled with robust underlying growth in productivity, is providing ongoing support to economic activity. Higher energy and other costs have the potential to add to inflation pressures. However, core inflation has been relatively low in recent months and longer-term inflation expectations remain contained.The committee perceives that, with appropriate monetary policy action, the upside and downside risks to the attainment of both sustainable growth and price stability should be kept roughly equal. With underlying inflation expected to be contained, the committee believes that policy accommodation can be removed at a pace that is likely to be measured. Nonetheless, the committee will respond to changes in economic prospects as needed to fulfill its obligation to maintain price stability.Voting for the F.O.M.C. monetary policy action were: Alan Greenspan, chairman; Timothy F. Geithner, vice chairman; Susan S. Bies; Roger W. Ferguson Jr.; Richard W. Fisher; Donald L. Kohn; Michael H. Moskow; Anthony M. Santomero; and Gary H. Stern. Voting against was Mark W. Olson, who preferred no change in the federal funds rate target at this meeting.In a related action, the board of governors unanimously approved a 25-basis-point increase in the discount rate to 4 3/4 percent. In taking this action, the board approved the requests submitted by the boards of directors of the Federal Reserve Banks of Boston, New York, Philadelphia, Richmond, Chicago, Minneapolis and Kansas City.

171,,2005-09-21 00:00:00,"WASHINGTON, Sept. 20 - Saying that Hurricane Katrina was unlikely to pose a ""persistent threat"" to the economy, the Federal Reserve raised interest rates on Tuesday for the 11th time in a row and signaled that more increases were on the way.In an unusually long statement, the central bank acknowledged that the hurricane's devastation was likely to cause higher energy prices, higher joblessness and greater uncertainty in the months ahead.But it said the hurricane had not shaken its confidence about longer-term growth, and it left little doubt that its top priority was still to head off inflationary pressures.The decision lifted the federal funds rate on overnight loans between banks by a quarter-point, to 3.75 percent, the 11th rate increase since the central bank began raising rates in June 2004.

While some inflation risks persist, they are diminished by the more moderate pace of economic activity and by the absence of any indication that longer-term inflation expectations have increased. The committee will continue to monitor closely the evolving economic situation.Against the background of its long-run goals of price stability and sustainable economic growth and of the information currently available, the committee consequently believes that the risks are weighted mainly toward conditions that may generate economic weakness in the foreseeable future.

Business equipment spending and industrial production have weakened in recent months, and slowing economic activity in many foreign economies is damping the prospects for United States exports. Moreover, the intensification of financial market turmoil is likely to exert additional restraint on spending, partly by further reducing the ability of households and businesses to obtain credit.In light of the declines in the prices of energy and other commodities and the weaker prospects for economic activity, the committee expects inflation to moderate in coming quarters to levels consistent with price stability.

175,,2008-10-30 00:00:00,"For a few moments, Wall Street seemed on track for its most encouraging two-day performance in a month.
But then the sellers rushed in, The New York Times’s Sharon Otterman reports. Within 13 minutes, the momentary upswing that had followed the Federal Reserve’s Wednesday afternoon announcement of a half-point cut in interest rates was gone, and the market’s volatility was back.
The late-day decline echoed other final-hour moves in the market in recent weeks, indicating to investors that the combination of forced selling, profit taking and fear that has kept the market on edge since the start of the financial crisis had not yet resolved into a more reassuring stability.
The Dow Jones industrial average closed down 0.82 percent, or 74.16 points, to 8,990.96. The broader Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index declined 1.1 percent, or 10.42 points, to 930.09 and the Nasdaq finished slightly higher at 1,657.21. All three markets rose 10 percent or more on Tuesday.
“We’ve seen this before. Any time you have a market like this, you are setting yourself up for people to sell and take advantage of these profits,” Ryan Larson, head equity trader at Voyageur Asset Management, told The Times. “The short-sellers came in, and the profit takers came in, and they came in hard.”
Meeting in Washington, the Federal Open Markets Committee decided unanimously on Wednesday afternoon to cut the benchmark federal funds target rate to 1 percent. It was the latest of a series of moves by the Fed to try to encourage the flow of credit to ease the downturn in the broader economy.
Stocks initially lost ground after the Fed announcement, as some investors had predicted even a larger rate cut. The major indexes then reversed course, with the Dow soaring more than 200 points before the final losses.
Some uncertainty may have been because of varying readings of the statement issued by the Fed along with the rate cut, analysts said. The statement said the central bank would “act as needed to promote sustainable economic growth and price stability,” but did not explicitly outline any additional moves to shore up the economy.
“I think some investors were disappointed that the statement didn’t indicate that the Fed was poised to do more,” said Jane Caron, chief economic strategist at Dwight Asset Management.
After Tuesday’s rally had sent the Dow soaring 889 points, helped by expectations of the interest rate cut, stocks opened lower Wednesday. They then staged a midmorning rally, a hopeful indication for investors that most of the gains would hold.
“There was a very tepid response in terms of a sell-off in the morning, so that’s a healthy sign,” said Michael Holland, the chairman of Holland & Company.
New economic data released may have also brought the markets some short-lived optimism. In one economic report released Wednesday, the Commerce Department reported that orders for durable goods rose 0.8 percent, surprising economists who had expected a decline. Orders fell 5.5 percent in August in the biggest setback in nearly two years.
Lending between banks also continued to ease. The government’s plan to assist businesses by buying commercial paper – the short-term i.o.u.’s that companies issue to borrow money for payroll and other immediate needs – began to have some impact, with the volume of commercial paper issued rising by nearly 50 percent since the program began on Monday. The closely watched three-month Libor rate was down, indicating an increase in trust between banks.
“Right now, it looks as if some of the remedies are taking hold,” Mr. Holland said. “Confidence is returning to the credit markets.”
The benchmark 10-year Treasury note fell 6/32, to 101 5/32. The yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, was 3.85 percent, up from 3.83 percent late Tuesday.
The dollar was weaker against major currencies, falling to 97.47 yen, down from 97.63 yen late Tuesday.
Crude oil for December delivery settled at $67.50 a barrel in New York trading.
Overseas, stocks were mostly higher in Europe and Asia as investors focused on the prospect of additional interest rate cuts. The European Central Bank and the Bank of England are expected to cut rates next week.
The markets in Asia were higher on Thursday morning. The Nikkei 225 rose 3.38 percent in early trading in Tokyo as investors speculated that the Bank of Japan might cut rates as well. In Australia, the S.& P./ASX 200 index was up 3.14 percent. In a bid to spur growth and shore up exports, China cut key interest rates for the third time in six weeks on Wednesday.
Despite the recent rallies, major stock market indexes globally remain 30 percent to 65 percent down so far this year.
“I think that uncertainty and volatile trading will continue to be the rule until we rehabilitate the years of excess in the credit markets,” Douglas M. Peta, a market strategist at J.& W. Seligman, told The Times. “It’s hard to know how long that is going to take, but we know it’s going to take a while.”

Prices of Treasury securities moved higher yesterday despite a signal from the Federal Reserve Board that it had not yet decided to reduce short-term interest rates.Credit market participants said they were surprised when the Fed chose to drain reserves from the banking system when the overnight Federal funds rate was trading at 4 3/8 percent, just under the 4 1/2 percent level that is widely seen as the Fed's target.Prices of short-term notes and bills fell in the wake of the Fed's move, but recovered later on.""They clearly are telling us that they haven't eased yet,"" one trader said. ""But that doesn't mean they won't do it tomorrow. That is how the market is interpreting what happened.""The Fed's Open Market Committee met yesterday to consider whether it should make any adjustments in monetary policy.  What the Economy Needs

""There is no question but that the economy needs the Fed to do more,"" said Joseph Liro, a senior vice president and money market economist at S. G. Warburg & Company.

Evidence mounted today that the economy has halted its slide and that the improvement already under way in housing may have begun to spread.The Government revised its retail sales figures for March to show a rise of four-tenths of 1 percent instead of an eight-tenths drop and it said sales essentially held this gain in April.""It certainly is going in the direction of an upturn,"" said Rosanne M. Cahn, an economist at the First Boston Corporation, citing recent increases in industrial production, consumer sentiment and corporate purchasing as well as housing. ""Perhaps the economy bottomed in April, but, if not, it will probably be May or June.""The relative strength in retail sales disclosed today by the Commerce Department appeared to touch off declines in both the bond and stock markets, reflecting diminished chances that the Federal Reserve will need to cut interest rates again to arrest the economic decline and spur a recovery. Stocks, which have been anticipating a recovery since early in the year, are now taking their cue from interest rates. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 37.57 points to end at 2,886.85.

The Consumer Price Index rose by four-tenths of 1 percent in November, as food and shelter grew more costly while energy prices edged down, the Labor Department said today.The increase, which was a bit more than expected, was believed to have been of some concern to those participating in an important Federal Reserve strategy meeting today.With the economy generally seen as sluggish, the Fed has allowed interest rates to decline slightly, but an inflation signal viewed as too strong could give the Fed pause in easing further. The dominant view among economists, however, was that the rise in inflation last month was not high enough to prevent the Fed from easing credit some more in coming days or weeks. Pressure on Credit MarketsStill, the Fed, whose Open Market Committee completed two days of meetings today, did not enter the credit markets, disappointing those who had hoped for an immediate move toward lower interest rates. As a result, traders said, the markets for Government securities, particularly short-term instruments, were under pressure.  [ Page D16. ]  Major parts of the economy, including automotive and other manufacturing sectors, are in the doldrums, economists noted. The housing market is also in a downturn, with the Government reporting today that housing starts dropped by 4.7 percent last month.  [ Page D8. ]  And last Friday's Government report on prices received by producers showed small declines at both the finished goods and intermediate goods levels, indicating that down the road consumer prices should follow suit.

''Inflation remains under control,'' Marlin Fitzwater, the White House spokesman, said today, with recent results holding ''some promise'' of lower interest rates. The Bush Administration has throughout the year been dropping hints that it would like to see the Fed become somewhat more accommodative in supplying the banking system with credit.

Prices of Treasury securities were narrowly mixed in light trading yesterday. Dealers sold some securities when it became apparent that the Federal Reserve Board was not prepared to ease credit conditions immediately.The Fed, whose Open Market Committee completed two days of meetings yesterday, refrained from conducting open-market operations.As a consequence of the Fed's inaction, ''the front end of the market is under a great deal of pressure,'' one trader said, referring to short-term securities. ''We are torn between people's perceptions that the economy is slipping into recession and a Fed which seems to disagree with that analysis.''Economists at MMS International, an economic information and consulting firm, said in its daily commentary that ''the lack of Fed intervention severely reduces the chances of a pre-1990 easing, according to our forecasts.''

180,,1998-11-18 00:00:00,"The Federal Reserve cut interest rates again by a quarter of a percentage point today to help keep a gradual economic slowdown from turning into a recession, but the central bank signaled it might hold off on further reductions in coming months.The cut was the third in seven weeks, and like the previous two it was driven by the concern that the global financial crisis was making it hard for companies to raise money, threatening the long expansion in the United States.In reducing rates but suggesting that investors should not count on further cuts, the Federal Reserve was walking a line between calming Wall Street's fears of global turmoil and giving too much stimulation to an economy that has shown surprising resilience in the face of shocks from abroad.With the outlook for further rate cuts now uncertain, the markets reacted with ambivalence. Down 75 points just before the Fed's announcement at 2:20 this afternoon, the Dow Jones industrial average pushed 75 points into positive territory after the announcement, then fell back again and closed at 8,986.28, off 24.97 points for the day.

181,,2009-01-29 00:00:00,"Following is the full text of the statement by the Federal Reserve on Wednesday announcing it was holding its base federal funds target rate at a record low between zero and 0.25 percent:The Federal Open Market Committee decided today to keep its target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to  1/4 percent. The committee continues to anticipate that economic conditions are likely to warrant exceptionally low levels of the federal funds rate for some time.Information received since the committee met in December suggests that the economy has weakened further. Industrial production, housing starts and employment have continued to decline steeply, as consumers and businesses have cut back spending. Furthermore, global demand appears to be slowing significantly. Conditions in some financial markets have improved, in part reflecting government efforts to provide liquidity and strengthen financial institutions; nevertheless, credit conditions for households and firms remain extremely tight. The committee anticipates that a gradual recovery in economic activity will begin later this year, but the downside risks to that outlook are significant.In light of the declines in the prices of energy and other commodities in recent months and the prospects for considerable economic slack, the committee expects that inflation pressures will remain subdued in coming quarters. Moreover, the committee sees some risk that inflation could persist for a time below rates that best foster economic growth and price stability in the longer term.The Federal Reserve will employ all available tools to promote the resumption of sustainable economic growth and to preserve price stability. The focus of the committee’s policy is to support the functioning of financial markets and stimulate the economy through open market operations and other measures that are likely to keep the size of the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet at a high level. The Federal Reserve continues to purchase large quantities of agency debt and mortgage-backed securities to provide support to the mortgage and housing markets, and it stands ready to expand the quantity of such purchases and the duration of the purchase program as conditions warrant.The committee also is prepared to purchase longer-term Treasury securities if evolving circumstances indicate that such transactions would be particularly effective in improving conditions in private credit markets. The Federal Reserve will be implementing the Term Asset-Backed Securities Loan Facility to facilitate the extension of credit to households and small businesses. The committee will continue to monitor carefully the size and composition of the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet in light of evolving financial market developments and to assess whether expansions of or modifications to lending facilities would serve to further support credit markets and economic activity and help to preserve price stability.

182,,2009-01-29 00:00:00,"For one day, at least, battered bank stocks actually helped the markets.
Reports that the government was considering a deal to set up a “bad bank” to absorb toxic assets ignited a broad rally on Wednesday, with financial companies leading the way, The New York Times’s Jack Healy reports. It was Wall Street’s third consecutive day of gains, which reached across all sectors.
The Obama administration did not announce formal plans to absorb billions of dollars in toxic assets still lingering on the balance sheets of banks. But the Treasury secretary, Timothy F. Geithner, has confirmed that officials were considering such a system, to be run by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.
“Investors are concluding that if the F.D.I.C. is going to run the bad bank and take on all the bad assets of the commercial banking system, then they will suddenly be transformed overnight into good banks,” Ed Yardeni, president of Yardeni Research, told The Times,  adding, “which is a bit of a stretch.”
Stocks rose to their highest point in two weeks, injecting a note of cheer into markets that have been stricken by new fears about the scope of the economic downturn.
The Dow Jones industrial average rose 200.72 points, or 2.46 percent, to 8,375.45, while the broader Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index jumped 28.38 points, or 3.36 percent, to 874.09. The technology-heavy Nasdaq composite index increased 53.44 points, or 3.55 percent, to 1,558.34.
Once again, investors watched developments in Washington as the House prepared to vote on an $825 billion stimulus plan that contains a combination of tax cuts and new spending.
And a statement released by the Federal Open Market Committee indicated that interest rates would stay near zero in the face of the persistent recession. The Fed indicated it was growing more concerned about deflation and the health of the economy and said it was willing to expand programs to buy mortgage-backed securities, which are aimed at unfreezing the credit markets.
“The Federal Reserve will employ all available tools to promote the resumption of sustainable economic growth and to preserve price stability,” the committee said in a statement.
Wells Fargo posted a fourth-quarter loss of $2.55 billion, its profit hurt by mortgage assets that it assumed after it took over Wachovia. But the results were better than some analysts had expected, sending the stock up $5, or 30.88 percent, to $21.19.
Financial companies including Citigroup, Bank of America, Morgan Stanley and JPMorgan Chase rose by double digits. Citigroup gained 66 cents, or 18.59 percent, to $4.21. Bank of America jumped 89 cents, or 13.69 percent, to $7.39. Morgan Stanley rose $3.48, or 17.83 percent, to $23. JPMorgan jumped $2.60, or 10.38 percent, to $27.66.
Shares of banks and brokerage firms were pummeled in 2008 as the credit crisis unfolded and troubles in mortgage-backed assets came to light.
“I would not be backing up the truck to financial stocks just yet,” Stephanie Giroux, chief investment strategist at TD Ameritrade, told The Times.
And analysts said that the gains in financial shares could quickly evaporate.
“A lot of these bank stocks are getting awfully close to zero,” Mr. Yardeni told The Times. “I don’t think you’re seeing buyers. I think you’re seeing short-covering.”
Treasury prices fell as the Fed provided little new guidance on whether it would buy government debt to keep borrowing costs low as the government embarks on broad new deficit spending. The Fed said it was “prepared” to buy longer-term Treasuries if such an action would be “particularly effective” in aiding the credit markets.
The Treasury’s 10-year note fell 1 9/32, to 109 9/32. The yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, rose to 2.67 percent, from 2.53 percent late Tuesday.

185,,2009-01-29 00:00:00,"As lawmakers pressed the Obama administration for details of how it would assist financial firms that have been rapidly deteriorating, Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner said Wednesday the administration is working on a comprehensive plan to “repair the financial system.”
Mr. Geithner declined to provide any specific details or to address rising calls for the creation of a government institution to buy or guarantee the declining assets at several of the nation’s largest banks, The New York Times’s Stephen Labaton and Edmund L. Andrews reported. He discouraged speculation that the plan would include the nationalization of some banks.
“We have a financial system that is run by private shareholders, managed by private institutions, and we’d like to do our best to preserve that system,” he said.
But bank stocks surged on hopes the government was moving toward creating a “bad bank” to purge toxic assets from balance sheets that are rapidly deteriorating as the economy worsens. On Wednesday, the Federal Reserve cautioned that the economy was still spiraling downward on many fronts.
According to several Wall Street officials, senior administration members spent the weekend and the last few days reaching out to top bankers for their views on how a bad bank should be structured. Lawrence H. Summers, head of the White House’s National Economic Council; Sheila C. Bair, the Federal Insurance Deposit Corporation chairwoman; and Mr. Geithner have been involved in the talks, the Wall Street officials told The Times.
Federal policy makers are discussing how to use the second $350 billion portion of bailout funds. About $50 billion to $100 billion is expected to be allocated to stave off home foreclosures. That would leave up to $250 billion available for the banks, with the bulk going to buying troubled assets.
On Wednesday, the head of the Congressional Budget Office told lawmakers that weakening banks would probably need hundreds of billions in additional funds beyond the Troubled Asset Relief Program, or TARP.
But administration officials believe that trillions of dollars more may be needed to buy the majority of bad assets from banks.
“The size of the problem is so large that no one knows if you just wiped out all the assets, how much it would cost,” Senator Charles E. Schumer, Democrat of New York and vice chairman of the Joint Economic Committee, told The Times. He added that a number of officials estimate it may take up to $3 trillion to $4 trillion to buy the bad assets.
Federal officials are trying to find a delicate balance between stabilizing banks and keeping the nation’s finances steady. Mr. Summers privately expressed concern last week that spending too much to buy bad assets could cripple the dollar, according to a person who spoke with him.
Administration officials are also worried that lawmakers might reject the high price tag. At the same time, spending too little may not provide enough to plug the deepening hole.
“None of the solutions are very easy,” Mr. Schumer told The Times. “All of these proposals sound very appealing until you start to examine them in detail. And then you find that all of them have problems. The good bank-bad bank idea — the problem, first and foremost, is how do you value the assets? No one knows how to do that.”
Lawmakers have complained that the $350 billion already spent under TARP has failed to prevent institutions from continuing to decline. On Wednesday, several senior members of Congress, including Christopher J. Dodd, chairman of the Senate Banking Committee, and Barney Frank, chairman of the House Financial Services Committee, urged the administration to detail swiftly how it will run the assets program.
Administration officials have been moving with some caution. They say that they hope to avoid the spectacle of the last administration, which lurched from policy to policy, and in the process lost some credibility in Congress.
Senior officials including Ben S. Bernanke, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, and Ms. Bair have recommended that the new administration consider a so-called aggregator bank that would relieve banks of their worst assets. Such a move, they contend, would restore investor confidence in the banks and encourage investors to provide them with fresh capital.
One version of the plan being floated by bankers would have the F.D.I.C. take the lead in running the “bad bank” and buying the toxic assets for a combination of cash and notes backed by the bad bank.
In return, the government would demand some sort of equity stake. The banks would still be responsible for collecting payments on the loans that they sold, according to bankers briefed on the situation.
Other issues still need to be resolved, including how the government would determine what to pay for the toxic assets, which assets would qualify, and what conditions might be attached. Also under discussion was whether to require banks that dump their assets into the fund to separately raise private capital. That could put pressure on weaker banks.
Government officials are considering other ideas for stabilizing the financial system. Those include expanding the types of government guarantees given to Citigroup and Bank of America to cover more assets at more financial companies. Another idea is to pour even more federal money into the banks, possibly in return for common stock.
In a sense the debate over creation of an aggregator bank or nationalization is really a discussion over how much to expand policies begun during the Bush administration, officials said on Wednesday.
The government in effect has already nationalized several large institutions, including the American International Group, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, when it seized control. And it has taken the same steps as creating a bad bank when it took $29 billion in assets held by Bear Stearns and guaranteed more than $300 billion in declining assets at Citigroup.
Officials said the debate within the administration was over how much and under what terms to extend those programs to other institutions. Compounding the complexity is the fact that the administration is simultaneously asking for a stimulus package of more than $800 billion.
Moreover, as the excesses of Wall Street — from expensive corporate jets at Citigroup to huge bonuses and extravagant renovations at Merrill Lynch — ring through Capitol Hill, the idea of a large bailout that does not penalize shareholders and senior executives becomes a tough sell.
The concept of a bad bank has gained momentum in the financial industry as the economy deteriorates, slashing the value of risky assets on banks’ books and increasing the need for banks to hold capital against those losses.
Shares in Citigroup and Bank of America, which both recently received a second taxpayer lifeline, surged 19 percent and 14 percent respectively as the stock market rose on optimism that the administration would relieve banks of money-losing assets.
The Fed said Wednesday the economy remained gloomy, and vowed to use “all available tools to promote the resumption of sustainable economic growth and to preserve price stability.” Its Federal Open Market Committee voted to keep the federal funds target rate at zero to 0.25 percent.
Analysts estimated that the economy contracted by more than 5 percent in the fourth quarter, one of the sharpest quarterly drops in decades. Employers eliminated two million jobs from September through December.
In the past, the Fed has tried to steer the overall economy almost entirely through the federal funds rate, the rate that banks charge each other to lend overnight reserves. But because banks remained reluctant to lend, even after the Fed lowered the overnight rate time after time, the central bank began creating new programs last fall in which it stepped in as a lender itself.
To push down interest rates on mortgages, the Fed began a program this month to buy $500 billion in mortgage-backed securities issued by Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and the federal agencies. Buying large volumes of a security pushes up its price in the market, which leads to lower yields or interest rates.
Thus far, the Fed has bought about $53 billion of the securities. But rates for the kind of traditional mortgages that Fannie and Freddie guarantee dropped sharply and stayed low as soon as the Fed announced plans for the program in late November.
The committee also served notice that it might purchase longer-term Treasury bonds, a move that would drive down long-term interest rates of all types.
In the next several weeks, the Fed expects to start a $200 billion program to finance securities backed by consumer loans, including car loans and credit card debt. This month, the Fed started a program to buy $500 billion in mortgage-backed securities.
Wednesday’s policy vote was not unanimous. Jeffrey M. Lacker, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, in Virginia, voted against the decision.

186,,2009-01-29 00:00:00,"When close allies of Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg banded together last summer to create a political organization to push for the renewal of a 2002 state law that gave New York City’s mayor control over its public schools, the initial buzz was that it would become a powerhouse lobbying group, raising as much as $20 million and helping shape the debate over the year.
 Instead, the group, called Learn NY, has raised less than $3 million from several foundations. Rather than producing flashy television announcements, it has placed simple ads on Web sites of news organizations and urbanbaby.com, and has tried to spread its positions by posting on education and community listservs and blogs.
At times, such efforts have backfired, with parents calling the posters puppets of the mayor and suggesting that they take their suggestions elsewhere.
With the first of five public hearings on mayoral control by the Assembly’s Education Committee scheduled for Thursday in Queens, the group has lined up supporters to testify about what they see as Mr. Bloomberg’s successes and how the school system is better off now than when the initial legislation took effect.

Some had counted on selling their hoards to investors fleeing the stock market, but a calm day there created no appetite for bonds.The sharp selloff reflected some traders' beliefs that Fed policy makers, who met yesterday, might not lower their rates as soon, or as much, as had been expected.The Fed has already cut its discount rate, which it charges for loans to banks, seven times in less than two years, leaving it at 3 percent, about the same low level as inflation.

Interest rates plunged sharply yesterday, after the Federal Reserve broke precedent for the second time in two months and announced its intention to raise short-term interest rates.In a short statement released in the afternoon, the Fed's chairman, Alan Greenspan, said the Federal Open Market Committee -- the central bank's policy-setting arm -- had ""decided to increase slightly the degree of pressure on reserve positions."" He added, ""This action is expected to be associated with a small increase in short-term interest rates.""Within minutes of the statement, bond prices rose a half-point on the long end, with rates on shorter-maturity bills dropping sharply. The 30-year bond's yield -- which moves in the opposite direction of its price -- fell as low as 6.83 percent and by late in the day the price was up 110/32 , to 92 18/32 , for a yield of 6.84 percent. The drop of 11 basis points was the largest one-day yield decline in two and a half months. A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point. Rally in Short-Term BillsShort-term bills also rallied strongly, with the rate on three- and six-month bills down 11 basis points as well, to 3.50 percent and 3.79 percent, respectively.

203,,1996-11-14 00:00:00,"Government bond prices were little changed yesterday, despite relief that the Federal Open Market Committee left interest rates unchanged.The benchmark 30-year bond was off 3/32, to a price of 100 23/32, for a yield of 6.45 percent. The yield, which moves in the opposite direction of the price, was up from 6.44 percent on Tuesday. Prices of some securities with shorter maturities rose slightly.Prices generally fell in early trading, despite a favorable report on producer prices for October, which would normally help the bond market. That hesitation, before today's report on consumer prices and retail sales, left many market participants wondering what it would take for bond prices to continue their recent move higher. Yields have been at their lowest levels since March.The October Producer Price Index showed that the core rate, which excludes volatile food and energy prices, down three-tenths of 1 percent, after analysts expected it to be up. The overall index was up four-tenths of 1 percent, more than expected. Traders said the market nevertheless elected to focus on the core inflation rate instead.

Jack Ablin, director of fixed-income activities and senior fund manager at the Private Bank of the Bank of Boston, said he thought that traders saw the higher energy prices as a sign of inflation. Still, he said, companies might have to absorb those higher prices, rather than passing them on to customers, thus helping keep consumer prices stable. ''While oil prices are indeed higher,'' he said, ''we see it more as a tax than an inflation factor.''

204,,1996-11-14 00:00:00,"The Federal Reserve voted to keep interest rates unchanged today, as the Government's report on producer prices provided the latest evidence that inflation remained quiescent despite a surge last month in food and energy costs.With both the Fed and financial markets scrutinizing data for signs that inflation may be infecting the economy, the Labor Department's Producer Price Index showed that prices at the producer level actually fell by three-tenths of 1 percent last month when food and energy, which are notoriously volatile, were excluded. The decline in the so-called core component, while driven in part by technical factors, was the steepest in two years.Including food and energy, the index told a very different story: a rise in producer prices for finished goods of four-tenths of 1 percent, the biggest increase since March. But food prices are already showing signs of leveling off after surging in recent months, and the outlook is for energy prices to continue increasing but at a more moderate pace. Producer prices are the prices that manufacturers and farmers charge for the products they sell to retailers, distributors or other buyers.Indeed, the markets, many economists and presumably the Fed concentrated on the decline in the core rate to conclude that despite steady growth and low unemployment in the sixth year since the end of the last recession, the economy is showing no sustained signs of slipping into the kind of upward wage-price spiral that typically derails expansions.

Investors reacted with relief, only three weeks after global stock markets were embroiled in turmoil.The Dow Jones industrial average jumped 159 points, or  1.3 percent, within minutes of the Fed announcement and stayed at the level, erasing nearly all of its losses for the year so far.

There is no further announcement,"" Joseph R.

Authorities Try to Unravel How Daiwa Trader Hid Loss  Japanese and American authorities tried to unravel how a Japanese-born bond trader working for Daiwa Bank in New York lost $1.1 billion over the last 11 years, without raising the suspicions of regulators in either country or of his employer.The trader, Toshihide Iguchi, an executive vice president, was arrested Saturday. A complaint filed in Federal court in Manhattan charged that he maintained a false set of books enabling him to cover his losses, chiefly in United States Treasury securities.  [ Page A1. ] Mr. Iguchi was an unlikely candidate to rise to executive vice president of a major Japanese bank. He majored in psychology at Southwest Missouri State University, and his first job was at a car dealer.

But it is possible that is a bargaining stance for better terms.  [ D2. ] Nearly 10 Million Cruise Cyberspace  A report to be published today by O'Reilly & Associates, a publisher of computer books and Internet software, states that 5.8 million American adults are connected directly to the Internet and an additional 3.9 million adults use commercial on-line services like America Online, Compuserve and Prodigy.

Prices of Treasury securities were mixed yesterday, after the Federal Reserve's Open Market Committee left interest rates unchanged at its policy meeting.Bonds were initially higher in early trading after the Conference Board reported its consumer confidence reading had fallen in September to 97.4, below the average trade forecast of 100. In August it was 102.4. Analysts said the report suggested signs of waning consumer optimism that could restrain growth. People buy things when they feel confident; when they do not, manufacturing slows and inventories rise.The 30-year Treasury issue gained 2/32 of a percentage point, to 103 30/32; its yield, which moves in the opposite direction from its price, slipped to 6.57 percent, from 6.58 percent on Monday. But shorter-maturity bills, because they are more sensitive to monetary policy, were down sharply. The rate for a three-month bill was up 10 basis points, or hundredths of a percentage point, to 5.27 percent.Anthony Dwyer, chief market strategist at Josephthal, Lyon & Ross, said he was sure that some of the early price gains were tied to the hopes of some who still believed that there was an outside chance the Fed would ease rates. ""But those hopes did not come to fruition, and bonds relinquished those gains,"" he said.

""I expect the bond market to remain in a narrow trading range over the short term until more evidence regarding the strength of the economy comes forth,"" Mr. Dwyer continued.

Currency traders often watch the performance of the bond market to gauge foreign investors' appetite for American assets, and the dollars needed to buy them.Both bonds and the dollar steadied later in the day because many investors suspected that Fed policy makers had given Alan Greenspan, the Fed chairman, authority to raise rates at his discretion before the next policy meeting on Nov. 15, said David Durst, a currency-options trader at Bear, Stearns & Company.In late New York trading yesterday, the dollar fell to 1.5417 marks, from 1.5527 marks on Monday.

Prices of Treasury long-term securities fell yesterday after the Federal Reserve left interest rates unchanged.The 30-year bond fell 18/32 , to a price of 962/32 , for a yield of 7.84 percent, up from 7.79 percent on Monday and the highest since June 23, 1992. The rates on shorter-term Treasury bills fell, however, as investors sold long-term notes and bonds into less volatile three-month and six-month bills.The market moved after the Fed announced in the afternoon that its Federal Open Market Committee has decided not to raise its target for short-term interest rates, which is now 4.75 percent. An increase would have been the sixth of this year as the Fed sought to fight future inflation by slowing economic growth.Donald Fine, chief market analyst for Chase Securities, said because the Fed did not tighten yesterday doesn't mean that it will not happen. ""I suspect they'll hike rates a few more times,"" he said. ""The last time the Fed raised rates was on Aug. 16, and they said then it would suffice for a time.""

And there is unlikely to be much upward pressure on prices as long as labor costs do not accelerate significantly and Europe and Asia remain in the economic doldrums.''I am sure most members of the committee think everything is going rather beautifully,'' said Alan Blinder, a Princeton University economist and a former Fed vice chairman. ''They have not allowed themselves to be provoked into some sort of pre-emptive action against inflation and, in hindsight, their patience has proven to be correct.''In the past, the Fed sometimes raised interest rates before any rise in the inflation rate, contending that an increase was necessary to discourage borrowing and thus slow a strong economy before companies raised prices in response to shortages and rising wage pressures.

However, the ebbing of geopolitical tensions has rolled back oil prices, bolstered consumer confidence and strengthened debt and equity markets. These developments, along with the accommodative stance of monetary policy and ongoing growth in productivity, should foster an improving economic climate over time.Although the timing and extent of that improvement remain uncertain, the committee perceives that over the next few quarters the upside and downside risks to the attainment of sustainable growth are roughly equal. In contrast, over the same period, the probability of an unwelcome substantial fall in inflation, though minor, exceeds that of a pickup in inflation from its already low level. The committee believes that, taken together, the balance of risks to achieving its goals is weighted toward weakness over the foreseeable future.

The chief danger facing the economy, the Fed said, is that inflation, which is already low, will fall further as demand for new products remains weak. Many economists say they believe that deflation can cripple an economy by effectively increasing debt levels and causing consumers to reduce their spending in anticipation of future bargains. Low inflation, on the other hand, is widely considered to be the ideal situation. Continue reading the main story","Fed Worries About Prices, But Holds Rate",2003-05-06,The New York Times

THE connection between a nation's internal and external deficits is clear: If a nation invests more than it saves and consumes more than it produces - as the United States has been doing - the excess must be covered by an inflow of foreign capital. The greater the internal budget deficit, the lower the rate of national savings and the greater the dependence on foreign capital.The persistent United States budget and trade deficits have lessened the ability of the nation to control its economy and hampered its leadership of the non-Communist world. Among American politicians and economists alike, there is now a consensus that to remedy the nation's external weakness the structural budget deficit must be reduced, and if possible eliminated, in the next four or five years.But there is no consensus on how to do it. The conflict between Republicans and Democrats on that issue has been widened by Vice President Bush's pledge not to raise taxes, while Gov. Michael S. Dukakis of Massachusetts has left open the option of raising taxes if expenditures cannot be cut enough to close the budget gap. Mr. Dukakis asserts he would raise taxes only ''as a last resort,'' but said in an interview with Business Week, ''No serious candidate for the Presidency can guarantee that he wouldn't raise taxes.''Mr. Bush portrays the Dukakis position as a ''fundamental'' difference with his own and apparently means to make his no-tax-increase pledge the centerpiece of his conservative campaign, following the strategy President Reagan devastatingly used against Walter F. Mondale in 1984. This week President Reagan gave strong support to Mr. Bush's assault on Governor Dukakis as a high-taxing, high-spending liberal who had just approved tax increases in Massachusetts.

Highly sensitive to the way Mr. Reagan used the tax issue to crush Mr. Mondale, the Dukakis camp was in a state of anxiety this week on how to parry the Republicans' attack. Until now Mr. Dukakis has been vague on how he would eliminate the budget deficit. He has said it would be irresponsible for him to get too specific before gaining the Presidency.

222,,1997-11-13 00:00:00,"For the most part, Treasury securities again danced the dance with stocks yesterday, gaining as stock prices retreated in response to further erosion in the Asian markets.Although traders were watching Federal Reserve policy makers closely yesterday, the decision to keep short-term interest rates unchanged for the fifth time this year was what most bond market participants were expecting. Short-term rates have not changed since March 25, when the Federal Open Market Committee increased the Federal funds target rate, which is the rate that banks charge one another for overnight loans, to 5.50 percent from 5.25 percent.Kim Rupert, economist at Standard & Poor's MMS, a market research and analysis firm in San Francisco, said, ''The Fed makes policy decisions on a risk-to-reward trade off, and currently the risks favor a steady stance.''The strength in the October employment report on Friday, which showed joblessness at 4.7 percent, a 24-year low, would have been sufficient for the Fed to push rates up, Ms. Rupert said, but global instability argued against it. Also, she continued, given the lack of domestic prices pressures and the belief that recent turmoil could slow growth slightly, the Fed can afford to wait.

Nevertheless, there is concern among some participants that yesterday's inaction increases the chance that the Fed is slowly losing its opportunity to slow economic growth before it accelerates further and causes inflation to gain a foothold.

223,,1997-11-13 00:00:00,"Torn between fear of incipient inflation at home and concern about unsettling financial markets around the world, the Federal Reserve voted today to leave interest rates unchanged and ride out the storm for a while longer.The decision had been widely expected by economists and investors, who saw little chance that the central bank would risk upsetting the global markets by raising rates, even though there is mounting evidence that inflationary pressures are building in the American economy.But it highlighted the delicate situation faced by the Federal Reserve chairman, Alan Greenspan, as he sought to keep the long economic expansion enjoyed by the United States on track while also taking account of his vast influence over markets and economies in the rest of the world.As if to illustrate just how volatile an environment Mr. Greenspan faces, markets tumbled once again today. Sharp declines in Asian and Latin American markets caused jitters on Wall Street, where investors appeared increasingly convinced that slowdowns in foreign economies would hurt profits of multinational companies and slow growth in the United States.

Investors have now turned their attention to tomorrow's June employment data, which are expected to help determine the Fed's next move on interest rates.The price of the 30-year Treasury bond rose 2/32 , to 8812/32 , leaving its  yield unchanged from Tuesday at 6.93 percent.Prices were weaker before the Fed's policy-making group, the Federal Open Market Committee, ended a two day meeting without raising short-term interest rates.

Bond prices bounced off their lows on news of the Fed's inaction.Gary Thayer, senior economist at A. G. Edwards & Sons in St. Louis, said that by not raising rates the Fed was telling the market that the economy was fine and that it was willing to wait and see if growth would begin to accelerate inflation. Donald Fine, chief market analyst at Chase Asset Management, said the Fed's decision not to raise rates gave the board another seven weeks to analyze  more data. ""But unless the upcoming data shows a significant weakening of the economy, the Fed is very likely to tighten by Aug. 20,"" he said.

225,,2003-03-19 00:00:00,"Following is the text of a statement released by the Federal Reserve yesterday after the Fed's monetary policy panel, the Federal Open Market Committee, decided to leave interest rates unchanged:The Federal Open Market Committee decided today to keep its target for the federal funds rate unchanged at 1 1/4 percent.While incoming economic data since the January meeting have been mixed, recent labor market indicators have proven disappointing. However, the hesitancy of the economic expansion appears to owe importantly to oil price premiums and other aspects of geopolitical uncertainties. The committee believes that as those uncertainties lift, as most analysts expect, the accommodative stance of monetary policy, coupled with ongoing growth in productivity, will provide support to economic activity sufficient to engender an improving economic climate over time.In light of the unusually large uncertainties clouding the geopolitical situation in the short run and their apparent effects on economic decision making, the committee does not believe it can usefully characterize the current balance of risks with respect to the prospects for its long-run goals of price stability and sustainable economic growth. Rather, the committee decided to refrain from making that determination until some of those uncertainties abate. In the current circumstances, heightened surveillance is particularly informative.Voting for the F.O.M.C. monetary policy action were Alan Greenspan, chairman; William J. McDonough, vice chairman; Ben S. Bernanke; Susan S. Bies; J. Alfred Broaddus Jr.; Roger W. Ferguson Jr.; Edward M. Gramlich; Jack Guynn; Donald L. Kohn; Michael H. Moskow; Mark W.

226,,2003-03-19 00:00:00,"The Federal Reserve left interest rates unchanged today, but it also departed from its standard practice by saying that the uncertainties about Iraq were so great that it could not assess the risks of an economic downturn.It was the first time that the Fed has refused to comment on the ''balance of risks'' between inflation and recession since February 2000, when it began announcing the assessment after every decision on monetary policy.The decision leaves the benchmark federal funds rate on overnight loans between banks at 1.25 percent, the lowest in 41 years. But many analysts and traders had been expecting a broad hint about the Fed's willingness to pump money into the system if the economic news did not improve.In a statement after the meeting of its Federal Open Market Committee, the Fed said, ''In light of the unusually large uncertainties clouding the geopolitical situation, the committee does not believe it can usefully characterize the current balance of risks.''

233,,2002-08-14 00:00:00,"The Federal Reserve left interest rates steady today but downgraded its view of the economy and signaled that it would consider cutting rates if the recovery from last year's recession continued to lose steam.Abandoning its previous optimism that the economy would gradually bounce back, the Fed emphasized that the decline of the stock market and disclosures of corporate wrongdoing had prolonged a sharp deceleration that became apparent in the spring.The Fed had suggested for several months that it expected its next move to be to raise rates from their current 40-year-low levels to keep the economy from overheating. But it adopted a policy stance today that is often a precursor to a rate cut, saying that the main risk now is that the economy will stall.In a sign, however, that it did not want investors, consumers and businesses to think that it would definitely cut rates -- and in a possible indication of uncertainty or disagreement within the Fed about how to proceed -- the central bank also noted that interest rates are already so low that they should eventually help get the economy going again.

240,,2000-08-23 00:00:00,"Following is the text of the statement by the Federal Open Market Committee, the Federal Reserve's monetary policy panel, after its decision yesterday to leave short-term interest rates unchanged:The Federal Open Market Committee at its meeting today decided to maintain the existing stance of monetary policy, keeping its target for the federal funds  rate at 6 1/2 percent.Recent data have indicated that the expansion of aggregate demand is moderating toward a pace closer to the rate of growth of the economy's potential to produce. The data also have indicated that more rapid advances in productivity have been raising that potential growth rate as well as containing costs and holding down underlying price pressures.Nonetheless, the committee remains concerned about the risk of a continuing gap between the growth of demand and potential supply at a time when the utilization of the pool of available workers remains at an unusually high level.Against the background of its long-term goals of price stability and sustainable economic growth and of the information currently available, the committee believes the risks continue to be weighted mainly toward conditions that may generate heightened inflation pressures in the foreseeable future.

241,,2000-08-23 00:00:00,"Reassured by evidence that wage and price increases remain under control despite robust economic growth, the Federal Reserve voted today to leave interest rates unchanged but warned that it might raise them later in the year if inflation creeps up.The decision displayed the Fed's confidence that the economy is gradually moving onto a path of slightly more modest, though more sustainable growth, but suggested as well that the central bank is not yet sure that its campaign of rate increases is complete.The task of bleeding off any inflationary pressure without ruining a business expansion is a tricky one under any circumstances. It has become especially complicated in this cycle because, many think, some old rules have been rendered obsolete by the changes that technology and globalization have brought to the economy.Analysts and policy makers are increasingly certain that the economy is capable of a substantially faster pace of noninflationary growth than it was a few years ago, though there is considerable debate in and outside the Fed about where the new tipping point might be and how close the economy is to it.

Prices of Treasury securities rose in lethargic trading yesterday, helped by a rise in the dollar in overseas markets. The move in the dollar prompted some overseas buying, but dealers in New York said most domestic customers showed little interest once trading shifted to the United States.''We have been at these price levels since early this morning,'' said David Green, manager of government bond trading at Chemical Bank. ''The last two days have been as slow as the worst days of summer. I don't know what it will take to get retail investors off the fence, but they show no signs of moving right now.'' Employment Numbers AwaitedRoberta D. Olsen, a fixed-income portfolio manager at the Banc One Asset Management Corporation in Columbus, Ohio, with $650 million under management, said, ''Nobody is going to want to get back into the Treasury market until after the employment numbers are released on Friday.'' He added that now people are doing business in specific sectors like municipals or mortgage-backed bonds, and are trading those until they get a clearer picture of where the economy is going.Still, prices of some Treasury securities moved up by more than half a point, and gains were spread across the maturity spectrum.

In this day and age, consumers should have more choices and not fewer.” He added: “I’d like to know how this serves the public.”Many fans have been angered by the seven-year, $700-million deal, which will move Extra Innings from cable, where it is available to 75 million subscribers, and the Dish Network into an exclusive arrangement with DirecTV, which has 15 million subscribers. Extra Innings had about 600,000 cable and satellite customers last year.A spokesman for Kerry, Vincent Morris, said the DirecTV deal would be only one of several subjects raised during the hearing.

The evidence accumulated over the intermeeting period indicates that output is continuing to expand at a solid rate and hiring appears to have picked up. Although incoming inflation data have moved somewhat higher, long-term inflation expectations appear to have remained well contained.The committee perceives the upside and downside risks to the attainment of sustainable growth for the next few quarters are roughly equal. Similarly, the risks to the goal of price stability have moved into balance. At this juncture, with inflation low and resource use slack, the committee believes that policy accommodation can be removed at a pace that is likely to be measured.Voting for the F.O.M.C. monetary policy actions were: Alan Greenspan, chairman; Timothy F.

The Fed also declared that the risks to price stability ''have moved into balance.''The statement reinforced expectations among investors that the Fed would start to push borrowing costs higher before the November presidential election. If and when it raises rates, it would be the first time in four years and could lead to the first series of increases since 1994.

Bernanke's first meeting as head of the Federal Reserve's policy-making committee, the watchword was no surprises.As expected, the Federal Open Market Committee raised the benchmark federal funds rate on Tuesday by a quarter of a percentage point, to 4.75 percent, and suggested that at least one more increase was in the cards. It was the 15th such increase in consecutive meetings of the committee.In its statement describing the decision, the central bank veered little from the Fed's prior assessments of the economy and the expected path of monetary policy, underscoring Mr. Bernanke's stated intention to maintain the course set by his predecessor as Fed chairman, Alan Greenspan.Despite its predictability, the Fed's statement still modestly unsettled financial markets, bolstering the dollar in foreign exchange markets and sending the prices of stocks and government bonds lower. The broad Standard & Poor's 500-stock index fell 0.64 percent, to 1,293.23. [Page C9.]

Though virtually all investors expected the rate increase, a substantial minority of operators on Wall Street had held hopes that the Fed would indicate that it would be the last one in the cycle that began in June 2004, when the benchmark rate stood at 1 percent. They were disappointed by the clear suggestion that the Fed still saw the need for further tightening. Continue reading the main story",Fed Panel Raises Rate to 4.75%,2006-03-28,The New York Times
254,,2006-03-29 00:00:00,"Following is the text of a statement released by the Federal Reserve yesterday after the Fed's monetary policy panel, the Federal Open Market Committee, decided to raise its benchmark interest rates a quarter-point:The Federal Open Market Committee decided today to raise its target for the federal funds rate by 25 basis points, to 43/4 percent.The slowing of the growth of real gross domestic product in the fourth quarter of 2005 seems largely to have reflected temporary or special factors. Economic growth has rebounded strongly in the current quarter but appears likely to moderate to a more sustainable pace.As yet, the run-up in the prices of energy and other commodities appears to have had only a modest effect on core inflation, ongoing productivity gains have helped to hold the growth of unit labor costs in check, and inflation expectations remain contained. Still, possible increases in resource utilization, in combination with the elevated prices of energy and other commodities, have the potential to add to inflation pressures. The committee judges that some further policy firming may be needed to keep the risks to the attainment of both sustainable economic growth and price stability roughly in balance. In any event, the committee will respond to changes in economic prospects as needed to foster these objectives.Voting for the F.O.M.C. monetary policy action were: Ben S. Bernanke, chairman; Timothy F. Geithner, vice chairman; Susan S. Bies; Jack Guynn; Donald L. Kohn; Randall S. Kroszner; Jeffrey M. Lacker; Mark W. Olson; Sandra Pianalto; Kevin M. Warsh and Janet L. Yellen.In a related action, the board of governors approved a 25-basis-point increase in the discount rate to 53/4 percent. In taking this action, the board approved the requests submitted by the boards of directors of the Federal Reserve Banks of Boston, New York, Philadelphia, Cleveland, Richmond, Atlanta, Chicago, St. Louis, Minneapolis, Dallas and San Francisco.

In a related action, the board of governors approved a 50-basis-point reduction in the discount rate, to 3 1/2 percent.A significant reduction in excess inventories seems well advanced. Consumption and housing expenditures have held up reasonably well, though activity in these areas has flattened recently. Investment in capital equipment, however, has continued to decline. The erosion in current and prospective profitability, in combination with considerable uncertainty about the business outlook, seems likely to hold down capital spending going forward. This potential restraint, together with the possible effects of earlier reductions in equity wealth on consumption and the risk of slower growth abroad, continues to weigh on the economy.With pressures on labor and product markets easing, inflation is expected to remain contained. Although measured productivity growth stalled in the first quarter, the impressive underlying rate of increase that developed in recent years appears to be largely intact, supporting longer-term prospects.The committee continues to believe that against the background of its long-run goals of price stability and sustainable economic growth and of the information currently available, the risks are weighted mainly toward conditions that may generate economic weakness in the foreseeable future.In taking the discount rate action, the Federal Reserve Board approved requests submitted by the boards of directors of the Federal Reserve Banks of New York, Richmond, Chicago, St. Louis and San Francisco.

Prices of Treasury securities inched higher in moderate trading yesterday, as many participants interpreted the open-market activity by the Federal Reserve Board as a sign that the central bank has decided to push interest rates lower.Analysts have been anticipating a further easing in monetary policy by the Fed because the economic statistics of continue to be weak. When the central bank chose not to drain reserves from the banking system around noontime, the period when it normally conducts its open-market operations, analysts took the decision as an indication that the Fed was easing its policy.''The Fed's absence from the market at a time when they needed to drain reserves suggests they are moving to push the Federal funds rate down to 9 1/4 percent,'' said David M. Jones, chief economist at Aubrey G. Lanston & Company. ''That could happen over the next day or two.'' Looking for a ShiftFed watchers like Mr. Jones were more sensitive to the central bank's activities yesterday than usual because the Fed's policy-making arm, the Federal Open Market Committee, concluded two days of meetings in Washington. The windup of those sessions has occasionally provided evidence of a shift in policy.

The unemployment rate for June is expected to be unchanged from 5.2 percent in May, many economists say.''The market appeared to be anticipating tomorrow's employment figures as it moved higher following early weakness,'' said Robert B. Ritter, chief technical analyst at Ladenburg, Thalmann & Company. ''Given last week's sharp Dow decline, many negatives seem to have been discounted.''Mr. Ritter said takeover stocks continued to lead the market, particularly among transportations issues.

The first Treasury debt sale under new auction guidelines imposed in the wake of the Salomon Brothers bidding scandal went extremely poorly yesterday, as the Government struggled to sell $14 billion worth of new three-year notes.Traders and analysts cited a number of reasons for the poor auction. But all agreed that it would cost the Treasury -- and the taxpayer -- well over $120 million in higher interest over the life of the securities sold yesterday.Aside from an adverse reaction by primary dealers in Government securities to the new rules, traders said that the low level of short-term market rates and disappointment that the Federal Reserve Board did not move to cut key interest rates yesterday contributed to the poor results.  Watching Fed PolicyContinued signs of economic weakness had led some traders and analysts to believe that the central bank, whose policy-making Open Market Committee met in Washington yesterday, might decide to lower the overnight Federal funds rate to 4 3/4 percent from its current target of 5 percent before the refunding auctions began.

The market's focus now turns to the next meeting of the Fed's policy-making panel, the Federal Open Market Committee, which is scheduled to begin on Jan. 31.Many market participants think the Fed will choose that time for another increase in short-term interest rates to keep inflation from accelerating.

The Federal Reserve's top officials met for nearly four hours today but adjourned without announcing any change in interest rates.Most economists and traders still expect the Fed to raise rates again, possibly at its next meeting on Jan. 31 and Feb. 1, or perhaps before then.The Fed is prepared to brake economic growth, Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, warned a Congressional panel on Dec. 7, if necessary to prevent recent increases in raw materials and other manufacturing costs from showing up in consumer prices.But the central bank's top officials also hinted earlier this month that they would probably pass up the chance today to raise short-term interest rates for the seventh time this year. Alan S. Blinder, the Fed's vice chairman, emphasized on Dec. 9 that reliable information on the economy's health for the fourth quarter would not become available until January.

265,,1996-12-18 00:00:00,"The Federal Reserve voted today to leave interest rates unchanged, concluding that inflation remained dormant despite sporadic surges in economic activity.The Fed's decision had been widely anticipated among economists and in the financial markets. The Fed has not raised or lowered rates since January, and analysts said monetary policy was likely to remain unchanged well into 1997 because the economy had shown few signs of deviating from its course of moderate growth with low inflation, even though unemployment is low and other economic indicators occasionally send warning signals.Indeed, just before the central bank's Federal Open Market Committee began meeting to consider interest rate policy today, the Commerce Department reported that construction of housing jumped sharply higher last month, suggesting that the economic growth could be picking up again in the fourth quarter after cooling down substantially over the summer.Driven in part by a decline in mortgage rates, housing starts rose 9.2 percent in November, the biggest monthly jump since July 1995, the department said. The increase, which put housing starts at an annual rate of 1.514 million units, wiped out nearly all of a decline in new housing activity recorded in September and October.

Is this inflation, as the Government's statisticians contend? Or is it simply fair value for the promise of longer, healthier lives, as a blue-ribbon panel of economists argues?Or consider what happens when people shift from going out to the movies to bringing videos home. Watching ''Independence Day'' at the neighborhood theater costs, say, $7 a ticket while the video rental is $3.50, no matter how many people crowd around the television. Both prices have held steady for a while. Is that zero inflation, as the Government says? Or should the Consumer Price Index register a price decline for movies as people shift to a different movie experience that is less costly but comparable in quality, as the economists contend?In the suddenly expanding debate over the accuracy of the C.P.I. -- which is used to set everything from Social Security pensions and union wage increases to individual tax brackets -- questions like these are crucial. Indeed, behind the controversy, which was set off when the Congressionally appointed panel of economists recently released its report, lie two fundamentally different ways of looking at the economy.The blue-ribbon panel, led by Michael A. Boskin, President George Bush's chief economic adviser, concluded that the C.P.I. exaggerates the rate of inflation by slightly more than one percentage point a year. Defenders of the current way of measuring price changes -- a group that includes representatives of the elderly, labor unions and a number of economists as well -- contend that any error is much smaller.

''The market will continue to struggle with each upcoming data release, as traders attempt to divine the course of future rate moves. There is still the risk of higher rates this summer.''Because it was the short end of the market that would have been hit hard had the Federal Open Market Committee raised rates yesterday, it was the short end that experienced the sharpest rally.

The Fed made its intentions known simply by saying that the committee had adjourned with no announcement.Private economists have begun debating whether the central bank overreacted to fears of inflation in doubling short-term rates throughout 1994. If that is true, the Fed may be forced to start cutting them again later this year if the economy slumps.Fed governors have indicated that so far they believe this is unlikely. Some expect the economy to revive later this year as business inventories are run down and falling bond yields and a weak dollar stimulate housing and exports.

That helps explains the Fed's hand-off policy.Nevertheless, financial markets are starting to expect that the Fed's next move will be to cut rates during the summer or autumn.

Faced with slowing growth in the American economy and a strengthening dollar, the Federal Reserve left short-term interest rates unchanged at a meeting today.The Fed's interest rate policy group, the Federal Open Market Committee, signaled its decision with a brief statement. ""The F.O.M.C. meeting ended at 12:15 P.M.; there is no further announcement,"" said Joseph R. Coyne, the Fed's chief spokesman.The phrasing of the announcement matched almost exactly the wording of statements from previous meetings at which the Fed left interest rates unchanged.Few economists were surprised by the Federal Reserve's announcement. The central bank doubled short-term interest rates in the 12 months that ended on Feb. 1 in response to a burst of economic growth that appeared likely to produce some increase in inflation.

A wide range of economic indicators since then has pointed to slower growth, while inflation has barely risen. Producer prices and consumer prices did creep up in April. But last year's sharp increases in prices for raw materials like wheat and for semiprocessed goods like steel have not yet produced the run-up in finished good prices that many Wall Street economists and some Fed officials feared last year.

Bonds rallied yesterday, sending interest rates to their lowest levels in nearly a week on speculation that the Fed would cut short-term interest rates soon.The policy-making Federal Open Market Committee met without changing the Fed's monetary policy. After the meeting, the Fed's spokesman simply said, ""There is no further announcement.""William Shea, senior vice president-head government trading at Nikko Securities Company International, said that Treasuries received a lift from a report in The Washington Post yesterday that suggested Fed officials would lower the overnight bank loan rates, better known as the Federal funds rate, sometime this year. The article said that the central bank could cut short-term rates as much as 1.50 percentage points this year, if growth slowed to a 2.5 percent pace.Analysts said that since the economy was widely predicted to grow at less than that rate in the first quarter of this year, the newspaper article effectively presented a case for an easing of rates in the near term.

Wall Street rushed back to stocks for a second consecutive session yesterday, nearly wiping out last week's losses, after the Federal Reserve signaled a continuation of its steady interest-rate policy and traders speculated that there would be a rate cut later this year.As measured by the Standard & Poor's index of 500 stocks and the Nasdaq composite index, stocks raced to record levels. Traders bought back many of the stocks they had bid down last week, and much of the market has now returned to its price level of last Wednesday. The market fell 81.96 points on Thursday alone, when there was a rush of sell orders brought on by the quarterly expiration of options on Friday.The bond market continued its rally, but the rush to equities was not altogether explained by the lowering of borrowing costs implied by the rise in bond prices. For one thing, volume on the New York Stock Exchange surged to 362.7 million shares yesterday, more than the 352 million shares on Thursday, when traders were rushing for the exits.The Dow Jones industrial average rose 40.81 points, to 4,436.44, just 1.03 points shy of establishing a new high. It followed the even stronger rebound of Monday, when the Dow surged 54.30 points.

The broader S.& P. 500 rose 4.94 points yesterday, finishing at a record 528.59. The Nasdaq composite index, rich in the technology stocks that have led the market recently, advanced most of all, with the index rising 8.46 points to 879.64.

272,,1998-07-02 00:00:00,"The price of the 30-year Treasury bond was unchanged yesterday, after, as expected, the Federal Reserve policy-making committee decided not to adjust interest rates.The 30-year bond closed at a price of 107 6/32, leaving the bond's yield at 5.62 percent.Donald Fine, chief market analyst at Chase Asset Management, attributed the Fed's decision to a slowdown in the economy, subdued inflation, the budget surplus and the malaise in Asia.Treasury securities opened weaker yesterday after the dollar fell in currency trading. A strong dollar makes dollar-denominated investments like Treasury securities more attractive to foreign investors, who also benefit from the currency translation.But then a report on manufacturing suggested the economy was slowing. ''Indeed, economic data released today clearly indicated a slowing of economic momentum, as exemplified by the sharp decline in the National Association of Purchasing Management index, a fallback in construction spending, and the flattening in the index of leading indicators,'' Mr. Fine said. The June manufacturing index fell to 49.6 from 51.4 in May, the first time in two years that the level has dropped below 50, a sign of contraction in the industrial sector.

Mr. Fine added that some of the declines in the index were for production, employment and inventories, and while some of the sluggishness may be a result of the strike against the General Motors Corporation, he said, the crisis in Asia was  playing a much greater role.

Construction spending tumbled 1.5 percent in May to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $633.5 billion as private and public sectors registered declines. And the Conference Board's index of leading indicators was unchanged in May for the second consecutive month, which could  be signaling slower growth in the third quarter as well as the second  quarter.The Government will report today  on the number of jobs added to the economy last month and on the unemployment rate, both of which are capable of moving the market. Estimates of jobs created range from an increase of 125,000 jobs to an increase of 250,000, placing the consensus at about 190,000 new jobs.

273,,1998-07-02 00:00:00,"Banks are lending out cash a bit too easily, with too little regard for the risks that will come if the economy stumbles into recession. So says the Federal Reserve in an unusual letter sent to all banks last week and released to the public this week.That the Fed should be worried about easy credit now is merely the latest indication that the American economy is out of sync with many other world economies. Most of Asia is in the midst of a severe credit crunch, as suddenly cautious banks try to get back the money they were lending out so willingly as recently as last year.The Fed's letter, based on a detailed analysis of a sample of loans made by large banks across the country last year, falls well short of an indictment of bank lending practices. But the tone is one of caution, and there are specific warnings that credit standards may have slipped in certain areas, among them loans to real estate investment trusts and media companies. The Fed is also concerned that banks may be charging too little on loans to corporate customers. It is a concern that some top bankers privately say is warranted.To the extent the Fed's warnings are taken to heart by bankers, the letter might serve as a mild drag on the American economy, something some Fed officials would like to see. The Fed has been unwilling to accomplish that through the usual means, raising interest rates, because of concerns that such a move would exacerbate the Asian economic crisis. No one was surprised that this week's meeting of the Fed's Open Market Committee ended without a decision to raise or lower rates.In good times bankers vie to make loans, and are sometimes willing to use overly optimistic assumptions to justify those loans both to management and to regulators. Then, after errors become apparent, bankers grow too cautious, as may be happening now in Asia. If the Fed's letter does help to hold down excessive optimism now, it could help to reduce or forestall the pain that will be felt if the American economy does suffer a setback.

274,,1998-07-02 00:00:00,"With signs of a slowing economy and increasing evidence that the Asian economic crisis is beginning to hurt some industries in the United States, the Federal Reserve today decided not to raise interest rates.Following a two-day private meeting, the Fed said that it was keeping the benchmark Federal funds rate -- the borrowing cost on overnight loans between banks -- steady at 5.5 percent, just where it has been since March 1997.At the same time, other indicators were released today that gave a picture of an economy cooling down from the hectic pace of the last year or so. A key index of manufacturing activity, the monthly purchasing managers' report, fell in June for the first time in two years. This index measures manufacturing production and its sharp decline from 51.4 in May to 49.6 in June was seen as evidence that the Asian economic turmoil is starting to affect American industrial producers.The Commerce Department also reported today that construction slumped 1.5 percent in May, the worst drop in more than four years, and the Conference Board's indicator of future economic activity remained unchanged from April to May, at 105.2. This is the second consecutive month that the Conference Board's leading indicator stayed fixed, a sign that the economy, while still on a positive track, is expected to be sluggish.

''When you have an economy where inflation is low and the economy is slowing, there is no reason for the Fed to raise rates,'' said Stan Shipley, chief economist at Merrill Lynch & Company. ''And the three indicators also released today indicate that this economy is weakening and weakening rapidly. We think that by December we may begin to see unemployment rise and retail sales fall and then the Fed will have to vote to lower rates.''

275,,2001-02-01 00:00:00,"Following is the text of a statement released by the Federal Reserve yesterday after the Federal Open Market Committee, the Fed's monetary policy panel, decided to lower interest rates by 50 basis points, or hundredths of a percent:The Federal Open Market Committee at its meeting today decided to lower its target for the federal funds rate by 50 basis points to 5 1/2 percent. In a related action, the board of governors approved a 50 basis point reduction in the discount rate to 5 percent.Consumer and business confidence has eroded further, exacerbated by rising energy costs that continue to drain consumer purchasing power and press on business profit margins. Partly as a consequence, retail sales and business spending on capital equipment have weakened appreciably. In response, manufacturing production has been cut back sharply, with new technologies appearing to have accelerated the response of production and demand to potential excesses in the stock of inventories and capital equipment.Taken together, and with inflation contained, these circumstances have called for a rapid and forceful response of monetary policy. The longer-term advances in technology and accompanying gains in productivity, however, exhibit few signs of abating and these gains, along with the lower interest rates, should support growth of the economy over time.Nonetheless, the committee continues to believe that against the background of its long-run goals of price stability and sustainable economic growth and of the information currently available, the risks are weighted mainly toward conditions that may generate economic weakness in the foreseeable future.In taking the discount rate action, the Federal Reserve Board approved requests submitted by the boards of directors of the Federal Reserve Banks of New York, Philadelphia, Cleveland, Atlanta, Chicago, St. Louis, Minneapolis, Dallas and San Francisco.

The dollar rose yesterday against most currencies, despite a concerted round of dollar selling by the Federal Reserve and eight European central banks.Some traders and economists said they expected the dollar to continue to rise, unless there are increases in interest rates in West Germany and Japan or the Japanese central bank joins the dollar selling. And they predicted that the dollar could top 1.90 marks, which is considered the ceiling set for the currency by the Group of Seven, including the United States, Japan, West Germany, Britain, France, Canada and Italy.In late New York trading, the dollar was at 133.25 yen, up from 132.70 Monday, and at 1.8960 marks, up from 1.8834. The dollar was also sharply higher against the Swiss franc at 1.6540 and the British pound. The pound, which was at $1.7080 Monday, fell to $1.6855. Policy-Making Group MeetsThe rise in the dollar came as the Federal Reserve's Open Market Committee met yesterday to consider pushing interest rates higher to curb economic growth and inflation.

ORGANIC agriculture, espoused by those who went back to nature in the 60's, is on the verge of changing from a movement to an industry. In ever-increasing numbers and at ever-increasing speed, growers, distributors, retailers, governments, agricultural scientists and economists are responding to consumer concerns about food safety by exploring organic agriculture.''We no longer position ourselves as an alternative,'' said Fleur Hedden, vice president of marketing for Whole Foods Market, an eight-store organic- and natural-food chain in Texas. ''We are mainstream.''Organically raised food is generally described as food grown by traditional farming methods without synthetically compounded fertilizers, pesticides, herbicides or fungicides. Organic farming relies on crop rotation, manure and biological methods to control pests. Organic farming is a stricter form of sustainable agriculture, which seeks to reduce pesticide residues in food butnot necessarily to eliminate them.Less than 1 percent of the produce in this country is organic; even if sales continue to climb, experts do not expect it to be much more than 9 percent of the total produce grown in the next few years, said Robert Scowcroft, executive director of California Certified Organic Farmers.

But until recently such products were available only from relatively small producers and manufacturers, usually in natural-food shops. That situation is changing rapidly, and in the meantime, the stores that sell organic food are doing a land-office business.

278,,1997-07-03 00:00:00,"Prices of Treasury securities moved higher yesterday, as the Federal Reserve opted to keep monetary policy unchanged and more economic data pointed to a slowing economy, with low inflation.The 30-year bond rose 13/32, to a price of 98 31/32, and the yield, which moves in the opposite direction, fell to 6.71 percent, from 6.74 percent on Tuesday.While the market was relieved by the decision of the Fed's Open Market Committee not to raise interest rates, analysts said investors were equally interested in scrutinizing today's report on the labor market for signs of inflation, which erodes the value of bonds.But adding to the picture of a slowing economy, the Government reported yesterday that factory orders in May fell seven-tenths of 1 percent, more than the two-tenths of 1 percent decline that was expected. The April factory orders were revised upward to 1.4 percent, from 1.2 percent, and served only to underscore the decline in May.

''While the economy's apparent sluggishness in the second quarter, coupled with a still decelerating rate of inflation, kept the Fed at bay, there are still a number of developments in the economic picture that suggest caution in the months ahead regarding another round of Fed tightening and a potential backup in bond yields,'' said Donald Fine, chief market analyst at Chase Asset Management.

280,,1997-07-03 00:00:00,"U.S. central bankers decided to leave interest rates unchanged at their two-day policy meeting that ended Wednesday, after the economy showed few signs of inflation despite strong growth in recent months.After pushing up short-term rates by a quarter of a percentage point in March, the Federal Reserve Board's Open Market Committee has opted at its last two meetings to maintain its target for overnight interbank loans, which set a floor for U.S. rates, at 5.50 percent.Alan Greenspan, the Fed chairman, had been warning investors since late in 1996 that the central bank was concerned about rising stock and bond prices, which he said might reflect ""irrational exuberance"" about the markets' prospects. But although the economy grew at a strong 5.9 percent annual rate in the first quarter of the year, there have been few signs of inflation.It is widely believed that economic growth slowed to a rate of about 2 percent in the second quarter, but with unemployment below 5 percent for the first time in two decades, there have been questions as to whether a lack of workers would require wage increases that would kindle significant inflation.

281,,2008-06-26 00:00:00,"Following is the full text of the statement released Wednesday by the Federal Reserve:The Federal Open Market Committee decided today to keep its target for the federal funds rate at 2 percent.Recent information indicates that overall economic activity continues to expand, partly reflecting some firming in household spending. However, labor markets have softened further and financial markets remain under considerable stress. Tight credit conditions, the ongoing housing contraction, and the rise in energy prices are likely to weigh on economic growth over the next few quarters.The committee expects inflation to moderate later this year and next year. However, in light of the continued increases in the prices of energy and some other commodities and the elevated state of some indicators of inflation expectations, uncertainty about the inflation outlook remains high.The substantial easing of monetary policy to date, combined with ongoing measures to foster market liquidity, should help to promote moderate growth over time. Although downside risks to growth remain, they appear to have diminished somewhat, and the upside risks to inflation and inflation expectations have increased. The committee will continue to monitor economic and financial developments and will act as needed to promote sustainable economic growth and price stability.Voting for the F.O.M.C. monetary policy action were: Ben S. Bernanke, chairman; Timothy F. Geithner, vice chairman; Donald L. Kohn; Randall S. Kroszner; Frederic S. Mishkin; Sandra Pianalto; Charles I. Plosser; Gary H. Stern; and Kevin M. Warsh. Voting against was Richard W. Fisher, who preferred an increase in the target for the federal funds rate at this meeting.

HOUSTON — The two political parties have settled on markedly different strategies for improving domestic oil supplies to help lower gasoline prices.Republicans want to end the 27-year ban on offshore drilling along much of the nation’s coastline, while Democrats want to force companies to speed up exploration in certain offshore areas that they already control. A version of the Democratic plan may come to a vote in the House of Representatives as early as Thursday.But oil experts say that neither approach will give drivers any relief in the short run from prices that stood Wednesday at nearly $4.07 a gallon, on average. They say the simple reality is that no one knows how much oil is to be found  offshore, how difficult producing it would turn out to be or how many years that might take.And oil companies, amid a global drilling frenzy, are stretched so thin they will be hard-pressed to take on big new projects anytime soon. More than 400 major drilling and production projects are competing for engineers, rigs, seismic equipment and steel to build platforms, and the costs of doing the work have skyrocketed.

284,,2008-06-26 00:00:00,"On Wall Street, there are stars that fade and stars that fight. Richard A. Grasso is one of the latter.
On Wednesday, Mr. Grasso, the former chairman and chief executive of the New York Stock Exchange, won another round in his almost five-year battle to keep the $187.5 million of pay he amassed during his eight years at the helm of the Big Board.
The New York State Court of Appeals upheld a lower court ruling dismissing four of six counts originally brought by Eliot Spitzer, then New York’s attorney general, against Mr. Grasso. The decision leaves Mr. Spitzer’s successor, Andrew M. Cuomo, two claims to pursue.
Since 2004, the attorney general’s office has argued that Mr. Grasso’s pay was unreasonable under New York’s nonprofit laws and that his compensation was not properly disclosed to the exchange’s board. (The exchange became a public, profit-making corporation in 2006, after Mr. Grasso had been awarded his pay.)
But the Court of Appeals ruled that state law did not give the attorney general the authority to bring major parts of the case.
“Mr. Grasso is gratified by the court’s decision,” Gerson A. Zweifach, one of Mr. Grasso’s lawyers along with Mark C. Zauderer, told The new York Times. “He always had faith in the justice system.”
While the decision is certainly a win for Mr. Grasso, the war is not over. In 2006, Justice Charles E. Ramos of State Supreme Court in Manhattan ruled that Mr. Grasso had breached his fiduciary duty to keep the board informed about his pay and ordered Mr. Grasso to pay back at least $100 million. “Mr. Grasso’s duty is to be fully informed and to see to it that the board was fully informed,” Justice Ramos wrote. “He failed in this duty.”
Mr. Grasso is appealing that decision.
“Both sides have something to look forward to,” Richard J. Schulman, a securities lawyer for Bryan Cave, told The Times. “The attorney general has a decision from the lowest court saying there has been a breach of fiduciary duty. But Grasso has slimmed down the case against him.”
Mr. Grasso’s fight to keep his pay has drawn widespread attention, partly because of his rags-to-riches story. He grew up in a working-class neighborhood in Queens, dropped out of Pace University and started his career as a clerk at the exchange. But he rose through the ranks, ultimately securing the chairman’s title and ringing the exchange’s famous bell with business and political luminaries. He was even featured on an episode of “Sex and the City,” ringing the bell with Sarah Jessica Parker.
He protected the exchange’s open-cry auction system, which many deemed outdated and rife with human error, against the near universal move to all-electronic trading.
After the terrorist attacks in September 2001, Mr. Grasso helped get the exchange open again and reveled in his role as a high-profile cheerleader for the United States economy and its markets.
As his star rose, so did his pay. His annual compensation, including special payments, bonuses and base salary, soared from $3 million in 1996 to more than $30 million in 2001, when he was awarded a hefty bonus for his stewardship of the exchange through Sept. 11, according to an internal report conducted by the exchange’s lawyers and Winston & Strawn.
In 2003, in a move that would lead to his undoing, Mr. Grasso sought to cash out some of his retirement benefits. Some directors say he expressed concern that a future board would be less willing to give him the money, a charge he contests. The compensation committee devised a contract to award him an immediate lump sum payment of $139.5 million and an additional $48 million to be paid over four years for past and future work.
A storm of controversy followed. Some directors, including Henry M. Paulson Jr., then the head of Goldman Sachs, argued against paying out Mr. Grasso’s retirement benefits before retirement. Others said Mr. Grasso was entitled to money he had earned. By Aug. 7, 2003, when the board was scheduled to meet, some directors seemed to believe the lump sum payment would not be awarded since it was not on the agenda for a board meeting.
But the issue was presented and after a debate, those present voted to pay Mr. Grasso the lump sum. The amount was disclosed to the public. Two days later, the exchange revealed that Mr. Grasso was owed an additional $48 million. As the uproar over his pay continued to ripple around the world, the board voted 13 to 7 in favor of asking Mr. Grasso to resign.
Mr. Grasso will now wait to see what happens with his appeal of the two remaining charges, while Mr. Cuomo will have to decide how to proceed with the remaining claims. According to the appellate court’s ruling, the attorney general must prove that Mr. Grasso knew the compensation was unreasonable and that he “violated his fiduciary duties to the New York Stock Exchange by accepting awards of excessive compensation” while in the job.
Mr. Grasso’s recent victory could push the attorney general to seek a settlement. “The dismissal of these claims may ignite renewed talks of settlement,” Robert A. Mintz, a former federal prosecutor and a lawyer at McCarter & English, told The Times. “It’s a win for Grasso but the war is far from over.”

285,,2008-06-26 00:00:00,"HOUSTON — The two political parties have settled on markedly different strategies for improving domestic oil supplies to help lower gasoline prices.Republicans want to end the 27-year ban on offshore drilling along much of the nation's coastline, while Democrats want to force companies to speed up exploration in certain offshore areas that they already control. A version of the Democratic plan may come to a vote in the House of Representatives as early as Thursday.But oil experts say that neither approach will give drivers any relief in the short run from prices that stood Wednesday at nearly $4.07 a gallon, on average. They say the simple reality is that no one knows how much oil is to be found offshore, how difficult producing it would turn out to be or how many years that might take.And oil companies, amid a global drilling frenzy, are stretched so thin they will be hard-pressed to take on big new projects anytime soon. More than 400 major drilling and production projects are competing for engineers, rigs, seismic equipment and steel to build platforms, and the costs of doing the work have skyrocketed.

It was the third consecutive meeting at which the Fed kept monetary policy on hold, after raising rates by 1.75 percentage points in six steps starting in June of last year.In announcing its decision, the central bank's Federal Open Market Committee suggested that the economy's capacity for noninflationary growth had increased in recent years and that the expansion had slowed to near that range. But its statement was laden with caveats, and gave no indication that the Fed had begun thinking about cutting rates, as some investors had been hoping it would.Faced with the likelihood that rates would remain steady at best in coming months and might even rise, investors sent stock prices down after the Fed's announcement.

In announcing the move, the Fed, the nation's central bank, noted signs that the downturn may be reaching a bottom, the first time the Fed has done so since the terrorist attacks on Sept. 11.

294,,2005-02-03 00:00:00,"WASHINGTON — The Federal Reserve raised short-term U.S. interest rates on Wednesday, its sixth increase since last June, and signaled that its strategy of gradually raising rates is far from over. The central bank nudged up the federal funds rate, the rate charged on overnight loans between banks, by a quarter of a point, to 2.5 percent.
In a statement that accompanied the decision, the policy-setting Federal Open Market Committee repeated that it could afford to raise rates at ""a pace that is likely to be measured.""
The Fed also repeated almost word for word its previous sanguine view about the outlook for both economic growth and inflation. In so doing, it gave no hint of either slowing down or speeding up the process of tightening monetary policy.
With the decision Wednesday, the Fed has now more than doubled overnight lending rates from their 46-year low of 1 percent eight months ago.
But even with the latest rate increase, short-term borrowing costs are barely equal to the pace of inflation and below historical averages. More important, long-term interest rates for corporate bonds and home mortgages have actually declined in recent months.
Indeed, analysts say there is so much money available for lending that financial institutions are squeezing down rates for relatively high-risk corporate borrowers.
""There is so much liquidity in the marketplace that the only way lending institutions can compete is by lowering rates,"" said William Zadrozny, chief executive of Siemens Financial Services, which provides financing for business equipment and a wide array of other needs.""People are reaching to employ their money.""
Even though some Fed officials have begun to worry that rising wage costs and slowing growth of productivity could fuel inflation, the central bank said on Wednesday that the upside and downside risks to both inflation and growth are still ""roughly equal.""
By reiterating that monetary policy is still ""accommodative,"" the Fed signaled that it has not yet approached a ""neutral"" level of interest rates that neither encourages inflation nor slows down the economy.
Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Fed, has refused to say what a ""neutral"" rate would be in practice. But most analysts expect the Fed to keep raising overnight rates until they reach at least 3.5 percent and perhaps 4 percent.
Investors had almost unanimously expected the quarter-point increase.
Greenspan is expected to shed more light about the Fed's plans when he testifies before the banking committees of the U.S. House of Representatives and the Senate on Feb. 16 and 17.
Fed officials face several big uncertainties as they plot their strategy. They need to dissect conflicting pressures on inflation: consumer prices have climbed more slowly in recent months, but last year's run-up in oil prices has yet to have its full impact.
Potentially more important, Fed officials must grapple with the possibility of a prolonged slowdown in productivity growth and rising wage costs.

296,,2009-04-30 00:00:00,"It may still be months before the economy turns around, but investors on Wednesday were acting as if a recovery were just around the bend, and bet heavily that the worst economic declines were over.
Stock markets rallied broadly as investors stampeded into financial stocks and abandoned the safe-haven investment of Treasury debt, The New York Times’s Jack Healy reported. Their mood was leavened by an optimistic gloss on the country’s first-quarter output and a statement from the Federal Reserve saying that the pace of economic contraction was “somewhat slower.” 
Although stocks gave up some of their gains in the last minutes of trading, the Dow Jones industrial average still rose 168.78 points, or 2.1 percent, to 8,185.73. The broader Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index was up 18.48 points, or 2.2 percent, to 873.64, its highest close in three months.
“The market seems to be looking forward,” Peter Cardillo, chief market economist at Avalon Partners, told The Times. “It’s a good sign that the market’s focusing on the potentials of a rebound as opposed to the decay in economic activity.”
An analyst’s report predicting healthier bank profits helped lift financial shares. Bank of America rose 6.5 percent to $8.68 as shareholders meeting in North Carolina re-elected the bank’s board. After the markets closed, the company announced that its chief executive, Kenneth D. Lewis, was voted out as chairman.
Shares of the media and entertainment companies Time Warner and DreamWorks Animation rose after they reported earnings that beat investors’ expectations.
On its face, there was little cause for jubilation in the day’s economic news. The government reported that the gross domestic product — an important measure of the economy’s total output — fell at an annual pace of 6.1 percent from January through March, nearly identical to its plunge of 6.3 percent in the last months of 2008..
But investors took consolation because consumer spending, which accounts for 70 percent of economic activity, rose slightly after six months of declines. And they expressed hopes that government spending would pick up and other economic indicators would brighten as the government’s $787 billion stimulus program kicks into gear.
And they fixed on a statement from the Fed’s Open Market Committee that looked ahead to a “gradual resumption of sustainable economic growth in a context of price stability.”
But as the government tries to combat the sluggish economy with tax cuts and huge new spending projects, investors showed signs of balking at the vast new supply of Treasury debt pouring into the marketplace. The Fed has already laid out plans to buy $300 billion in longer-term Treasuries to keep interest rates low, but it announced no additional measures on Wednesday. As credit markets begin to heal and once-wary bond investors develop an appetite for higher returns, they are beginning to stray from Treasury notes, sending yields sharply higher and potentially increasing the cost for the government.
The Treasury’s 10-year note fell 26/32, to 97. The yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, rose to 3.11 percent, from 3.01 percent late Tuesday.

In “A Midsummer Night’s Dream,” when Bottom, in his ass’s head, is told “thou art translated!,” he has not only been physically transformed but also magically intoxicated, transmigrated to another world. In the Translation Slam on Friday, part of the PEN World Voices Festival, the Catalan poet Narcís Comadira will allow one of his poems to transmigrate through Mary Ann Newman and Rowan Ricardo Phillips. Mr. Comadira, who is a translator as well as a poet (“Formes de l’Ombra” or “Shadow Forms”), playwright, critic and artist, will read his poem in Catalan, followed by the English versions, prepared and read by Ms. Newman, director of the Catalan Center at New York University, and Mr. Phillips, poet and professor of English at Stony Brook University.So one poem becomes three, and the audience then dissects them, weighing meanings, tone, rhythm and the “feel” of each. “The conversation becomes an analysis of the act of writing,” said Michael F. Moore, the moderator and chairman of the PEN translation committee.Changing geography, the Irish writer Nick Laird (author of the poetry collection “On Purpose” and the novel “Utterly Monkey”), will read his poem in English, followed by a Spanish translation by Valerie Mejer, a Mexican poet and artist, and the writer Javier Calvo. (Mr. Calvo’s novel “Un Mundo Maravilloso” or “Wonderful World” was translated from Spanish into English by Mara Faye Lethem, the evening’s co-migrator.)This differs from last year’s Slam, Mr. Moore said, in which poems were translated from German, Spanish and Italian into English. “It’s my subversive little contribution to making the festival even more international, by pushing the English language into the minority position,” he said, “to get writers in English thinking about what happens when their words are transported into another language.” Even with skilled interpreters, and perhaps a touch of magic, you still can’t be exactly sure where a literary journey will end.

299,,1999-02-04 00:00:00,"Trapped between conflicting pressures at home and abroad, the Federal Reserve voted today to leave interest rates unchanged, keeping its hands off an economy that is either gratifyingly robust or too strong for its own good.The decision, almost universally expected by economists and investors, caused barely a ripple on Wall Street. But it highlighted the dilemma facing the central bank just months after it cut rates three times to insure that financial turmoil in much of the rest of the world would not derail the long American expansion.Rather than slowing, the economy grew at a torrid 5.6 percent annual rate in the fourth quarter, putting back on the agenda the possibility that inflation, long dormant, could reappear. One faction within the Federal Reserve is also concerned about rapid growth in the money supply, a cause or signal of inflation.As a result, analysts said, Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, and his colleagues on the central bank are almost certainly considering whether they will need to reverse course and raise rates later this year if growth does not slow markedly on its own.

Yet the continued fragility of global financial markets, a rapidly expanding trade deficit, concern about causing a big selloff on Wall Street and the almost total absence of any hard evidence of inflation have combined to create a strong case for leaving rates alone or even cutting them further.

300,,1999-07-01 00:00:00,"Following is the statement issued by the Federal Open Market Committee, the Federal Reserve's monetary policy panel, after its decision yesterday to raise short-term rates:The Federal Open Market Committee today voted to raise its target for the Federal funds rate 25 basis points to 5 percent. Last fall the committee reduced interest rates to counter a significant seizing-up of financial markets in the United States. Since then, much of the financial strain has eased, foreign economies have firmed and economic activity in the United States has moved forward at a brisk pace. Accordingly, the full degree of adjustment is judged no longer necessary.Labor markets have continued to tighten over recent quarters, but strengthening productivity growth has contained inflationary pressures.Owing to the uncertain resolution of the balance of conflicting forces in the economy going forward, the F.O.M.C has chosen to adopt a directive that includes no predilection about near-term policy action. The committee, nonetheless, recognizes that in the current dynamic environment it must be especially alert to the emergence, or potential emergence, of inflationary forces that could undermine economic growth.

301,,2004-09-22 00:00:00,"WASHINGTON, Sept. 21 - The Federal Reserve raised short-term interest rates another quarter of a point on Tuesday, and it suggested that it will keep raising them gradually over the next year.It was the Fed's third rate increase in three months. Coming six weeks before the presidential elections on Nov. 2, the decision pushed the federal funds rate on overnight loans between banks up to 1.75 percent from 1.5 percent.While incumbent presidents normally cringe at the prospect of higher rates before an election, the increases are not expected to pose a threat to President Bush because consumers and businesses have felt almost no tangible impact.Long-term interest rates, which determine home mortgage rates and many commercial loans, have edged down since June as fears of inflation have receded.

302,,2004-09-22 00:00:00,"Following is the text of a statement released by the Federal Reserve yesterday after the Fed's monetary policy panel, the Federal Open Market Committee, decided to raise its benchmark interest rates a quarter point:The Federal Open Market Committee decided today to raise its target for the federal funds rate by 25 basis points, to 1 3/4 percent.The committee believes that even after this action, the stance of monetary policy remains accommodative and, coupled with robust underlying growth in productivity, is providing ongoing support to economic activity. After moderating earlier this year partly in response to the substantial rise in energy prices, output growth appears to have regained some traction, and labor market conditions have improved modestly. Despite the rise in energy prices, inflation and inflation expectations have eased in recent months.The committee perceives the upside and downside risks to the attainment of both sustainable growth and price stability for the next few quarters to be roughly equal. With underlying inflation expected to be relatively low, the committee believes that policy accommodation can be removed at a pace that is likely to be measured. Nonetheless, the committee will respond to changes in economic prospects as needed to fulfill its obligation to maintain price stability.Voting for the F.O.M.C. monetary policy action were: Alan Greenspan, chairman; Timothy F. Geithner, vice chairman; Ben S. Bernanke; Susan S. Bies; Roger W. Ferguson Jr.; Edward M. Gramlich; Thomas M. Hoenig; Donald L. Kohn; Cathy E. Minehan; Mark W. Olson; Sandra Pianalto; and William Poole.In a related action, the board of governors unanimously approved a 25 basis point increase in the discount rate to 2 3/4 percent. In taking this action, the board approved the requests submitted by the boards of directors of the Federal Reserve Banks of Boston, New York, Philadelphia, Cleveland, Richmond, Atlanta, Chicago, St. Louis, Minneapolis, Kansas City, Dallas and San Francisco.

Economic growth appears to have slowed recently, partly reflecting a softening of household spending. Tight credit conditions, the ongoing housing contraction and some slowing in export growth are likely to weigh on economic growth over the next few quarters. Over time, the substantial easing of monetary policy, combined with ongoing measures to foster market liquidity should help to promote moderate economic growth.Inflation has been high, spurred by the earlier increases in the prices of energy and some other commodities. The Committee expects inflation to moderate later this year and next year, but the inflation outlook remains highly uncertain.The downside risks to growth and the upside risks to inflation are both of significant concern to the Committee. The Committee will monitor economic and financial developments carefully and will act as needed to promote sustainable economic growth and price stability.Voting for the FOMC monetary policy action were: Ben S. Bernanke, Chairman; Christine M. Cumming; Elizabeth A. Duke; Richard W. Fisher; Donald L. Kohn; Randall S. Kroszner; Sandra Pianalto; Charles I. Plosser, Gary H. Stern; and Kevin M. Warsh.

Proponents of a more systematic government role to help relieve financial institutions of their toxic securities range from Lawrence H. Summers, the former Treasury secretary under President Clinton, to former Federal Reserve chairmen Paul A. Volcker and Alan Greenspan.
In Congress, the idea that is gaining traction centers on the creation of a new agency that would buy troubled assets from hobbled companies.

Steny H. Hoyer, the House majority leader, said there was no time to consider any new proposals in the two weeks before Congress adjourns.
But in its ad hoc approach to the crisis, the Treasury Department and the Federal Reserve have, in effect, already embarked on a course similar to the proposals in Congress.
In the case of Bear Stearns, the Fed took $29 billion of the investment bank’s mortgage-related assets as collateral for a Fed loan to JPMorgan Chase, which then agreed to acquire Bear Stearns.
In the case of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the Treasury Department placed the companies in a conservatorship and explicitly backed the $5.3 trillion of mortgages they own or guarantee.
Treasury also agreed to buy an unspecified amount of Fannie’s and Freddie’s mortgage-backed securities on the open market, starting with a $5 billion purchase this month. Those securities are to be managed and ultimately sold for the government by an investment house on Wall Street.
But federal officials remain concerned about the plight of other institutions, including Washington Mutual, the nation’s largest savings association. Experts estimate that a government bailout of Washington Mutual could cut in half the size of the federal deposit insurance fund, which protects bank depositors at thousands of banks and savings and loan institutions.
Mr. Frank was among the House and Senate leaders who were hastily called to a meeting Tuesday with the Federal Reserve chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, and Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson Jr. to hear about the Fed’s latest rescue plan, this time of the American International Group.
Mr. Frank said that one of the issues discussed in the meeting was a potential need for broader, longer-term federal action in the marketplace.
“We have had a series of ad hoc interventions; this is one more ad hoc intervention,” he told The Times. “I do think, because you can’t be sure this is the last one, the question of a broader more systemic action in which the government tries to help resolve these things is very important.”
In concept, the proposal would resemble the Resolution Trust Corporation, which disposed of bad assets held by hundreds of crippled savings institutions. Created in 1989, Resolution Trust closed or reorganized 747 institutions holding assets of nearly $400 billion. It did so by seizing the assets of troubled savings and loans and then reselling them to bargain-seeking investors.
By 1995, the S.& L. crisis abated and the agency was folded into the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, which Congress created during the Great Depression to regulate banks and protect the accounts of customers when they fail.
But the parallels to Resolution Trust are inexact. The federal government, unlike now, had no choice but to acquire the assets from savings associations because they were backed by federal deposit insurance. The mortgages now at the heart of Wall Street’s woes are not backed by federally insured deposits.
Moreover, the mission of the corporation was to dispose of the assets as quickly as possible for maximum value. Its goal was to reduce taxpayer exposure.
In the current crisis, the goal is more debatable. Should the government be helping homeowners, housing or financial markets, or large companies in trouble? Moreover, policy makers already have been seeking ways to reduce the impact of hard-to-sell assets on the books of companies by encouraging healthier institutions to acquire troubled ones.
The issue is whether Congress, after the election, should create a more formal and accountable mechanism, such as a federal agency, that would provide a relief valve for the troubled assets now causing havoc on Wall Street.
“The question is, and it’s just a question, is, ‘Are we at the point where the private market has made so many bad decisions and is so depressed that it can’t get out from under?’ ” Mr. Frank, who is planning to hold a hearing next week to explore whether Congress should create an agency to help the markets dispose of hard-to-sell assets, told The Times.
“The question we have to address is, ‘Is it the case that market psychology has so depressed assets that no entity has capacity to buy and hold these assets except for the government?’ ”
Mr. Frank said it would be more appropriate for a new agency, rather than the central bank, to be relieving the markets of the troubled assets.
“It is not appropriate for the Federal Reserve either in a financial sense or in a democratic sense to take on this role,” Mr. Frank told The Times .
But Senator Christopher J. Dodd of Connecticut, the chairman of the Senate banking committee, said at a news conference announcing hearings later this week on the crisis that he wondered whether such an agency was necessary if Treasury and the Fed were already performing such a function and had the authority to continue to do it.
“I’m not opposed to it,” he told The Times of Mr. Frank’s proposal. “I’m anxious to hear what the administration would have to say about this.”
Administration officials said they had no plans to make such a proposal, and that they would leave it to the next administration.
Mr. Frank emphasized that any legislation creating a new agency would have to be accompanied by “tough new regulations” to discourage companies from making more risky investments. He acknowledged that the decision about such an agency would be in the hands of the next Congress and the next president.
In recent days, aides to the presidential campaigns of John McCain and Barack Obama have said it would be premature to consider creating a new agency. But after the election, the political imperatives could significantly change, particularly if the housing markets remain depressed and Wall Street continues to choke on the billions of dollars in mortgage-backed assets.

311,,2008-09-17 00:00:00,"Fearing a financial crisis worldwide, the Federal Reserve reversed course on Tuesday and agreed to an $85 billion bailout that would give the government control of the troubled insurance giant American International Group.
The decision, only two weeks after the Treasury took over the federally chartered mortgage finance companies Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, is the most radical intervention in private business in the central bank’s history, The New York Times’s Edmund L. Andrews, Michael J. de la Merced and Mary Williams Walsh write.
With time running out after A.I.G. failed to get a bank loan to avoid bankruptcy, Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson Jr., pictured above, and the Fed chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, convened a meeting with House and Senate leaders on Capitol Hill about 6:30 p.m. Tuesday to explain the rescue plan. 
They emerged just after 7:30 p.m. with Mr. Paulson and Mr. Bernanke looking grim, but with top lawmakers initially expressing support for the plan. But the bailout is likely to prove controversial, because it effectively puts taxpayer money at risk while protecting bad investments made by A.I.G. and other institutions it does business with.
What frightened Fed and Treasury officials was not simply the prospect of another giant corporate bankruptcy, but A.I.G.’s role as an enormous provider of esoteric financial insurance contracts to investors who bought complex debt securities. They effectively required A.I.G. to cover losses suffered by the buyers in the event the securities defaulted. It meant A.I.G. was potentially on the hook for billions of dollars’ worth of risky securities that were once considered safe.
If A.I.G. had collapsed – and been unable to pay all of its insurance claims – institutional investors around the world would have been instantly forced to reappraise the value of those securities, and that in turn would have reduced their own capital and the value of their own debt. Small investors, including anyone who owned money market funds with A.I.G. securities, could have been hurt, too. And some insurance policy holders were worried, even though they have some protections.
“It would have been a chain reaction,” Uwe Reinhardt, a professor of economics at Princeton University, told The Times. “The spillover effects could have been incredible.”
Financial markets, which on Monday had plunged over worries about A.I.G.’s possible collapse and the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers, reacted with relief to the news of the bailout. In anticipation of a deal, stocks rose about 1 percent in the United States on Tuesday. Asian stock markets opened with strong gains on Wednesday morning, but the rally lost steam as worries returned about the extent of harm to the global financial system.
Still, the move will likely start an intense political debate during the presidential election campaign over who is to blame for the financial crisis that prompted the rescue.
Representative Barney Frank, Democrat of Massachusetts and chairman of the House Financial Services Committee, said Mr. Paulson and Mr. Bernanke had not requested any new legislative authority for the bailout at Tuesday night’s meeting. “The secretary and the chairman of the Fed, two Bush appointees, came down here and said, ‘We’re from the government, we’re here to help them,’ ” Mr. Frank told The Times. “I mean this is one more affirmation that the lack of regulation has caused serious problems. That the private market screwed itself up and they need the government to come help them unscrew it.”
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi quickly criticized the rescue, calling the $85 billion a “staggering sum.” Ms. Pelosi said the bailout was “just too enormous for the American people to guarantee.” Her comments suggested that the Bush administration and the Fed would face sharp questioning in Congressional hearings. President Bush was briefed earlier in the afternoon.
A major concern is that the A.I.G. rescue won’t be the last. At Tuesday night’s meeting. lawmakers asked if there was any way of knowing if this would be the final major government intervention. Mr. Bernanke and Mr. Paulson said there was not. Indeed, the markets remain worried about the financial condition of major regional banks as well as that of Washington Mutual, the nation’s largest thrift.
The decision was a remarkable turnaround by the Bush administration and Mr. Paulson, who had flatly refused over the weekend to risk taxpayer money to prevent the collapse of Lehman Brothers or the distressed sale of Merrill Lynch to Bank of America. Earlier this year, the government bailed out another investment bank, Bear Stearns, by engineering a sale to JPMorgan Chase that left taxpayers on the hook for up to $29 billion of bad investments by Bear Stearns. The government hoped at the time that this unusual step would both calm markets and lead to a recovery by the financial system. But critics warned at the time that it would only encourage others to seek bailouts, and the eventual costs to the government would be staggering.
The decision to rescue A.I.G. came on the same day that the Fed decided to leave its benchmark interest rate unchanged at 2 percent, turning aside hopes by many on Wall Street that the Fed would try to shore up confidence by cutting rates once again.
Fed and Treasury officials initially turned a cold shoulder to A.I.G. when company executives pleaded on Sunday night for the Fed to provide a $40 billion bridge loan to stave off a crippling downgrade of its credit ratings as a result of investment losses that totalled tens of billions of dollars.
But government officials reluctantly backed away from their tough-minded approach after a failed attempt to line up private financing with help from JPMorgan Chase and Goldman Sachs, which told federal officials they simply could not raise the money given both the general turmoil in credit markets and the specific fears of problems with A.I.G. The complexity of A.I.G.’s business, and the fact that it does business with thousands of companies around the globe, make its survival crucial at a time when there is stress throughout the financial system worldwide.
“It’s the interconnectedness and the fear of the unknown,” Roger Altman, a former Treasury official under President Bill Clinton, told The Times. “The prospect of the world’s largest insurer failing, together with the interconnectedness and the uncertainty about the collateral damage – that’s why it’s scaring people so much.”
Under the plan, the Fed will make a two-year loan to A.I.G. of up to $85 billion and, in return, will receive warrants that can be converted into common stock giving the government nearly 80 percent ownership of the insurer, if the existing shareholders approve. All of the company’s assets are being pledged to secure the loan. Existing stockholders have already seen the value of their stock drop more than 90 percent in the last year. Now they will suffer even more, although they will not be totally wiped out. 
The Fed was advised by Morgan Stanley, and A.I.G. by the Blackstone Group.
Fed staffers said that they expected A.I.G. would repay the loan before it comes due in two years, either through the sales of assets or through operations.
Asked why Lehman was allowed to fail, but A.I.G. was not, a Fed staffer told The Times that the markets were more prepared for the failure of an investment bank. 
Robert B. Willumstad, who became A.I.G.’s chief executive in June, will be succeeded by Edward M. Liddy, the former chairman of the Allstate Corporation. Under the terms of his employment contract with A.I.G., Mr. Willumstad could receive an exit package worth as much as $8.7 million if his removal is determined to be “without cause,” according to an analysis by James F. Reda and Associates.

However, the committee believes that as those risks lift, as most analysts expect, the accommodative stance of monetary policy, coupled with ongoing growth in productivity, will provide support to an improving economic climate over time.In these circumstances, the committee believes that against the background of its long-run goals of price stability and sustainable economic growth and of the information currently available, the risks are balanced with respect to the prospects for both goals for the foreseeable future.Voting for the F.O.M.C. monetary policy action were Alan Greenspan, chairman; William J.

313,,2003-01-30 00:00:00,"The Federal Reserve left interest rates unchanged today, though it suggested that the biggest restraint on economic growth stemmed from uncertainties about a possible war with Iraq.In leaving the federal funds rate on overnight loans between banks at 1.25 percent, the lowest level in 41 years, the Fed's monetary policy committee said the balance of risks had not changed significantly since its last meeting in December.''Oil price premiums and other aspects of geopolitical risks have reportedly fostered continued restraint on spending and hiring by business,'' the Fed said in a statement after today's meeting.Essentially reiterating what Fed officials have said since they last reduced interest rates, in November, the Federal Open Market Committee went on to say that the combination of easy monetary policy and improving productivity should help the economy recover once the ''geopolitical risks'' are lifted.

A close reading of the statement by the Fed suggested that its chairman, Alan Greenspan, remains unlikely to push for higher interest rates for several more months. As it has before, the Federal Open Market Committee, which sets monetary policy, reiterated its view that inflation remains low and that the economy still has a considerable amount of ""slack"" in the form of relatively high unemployment and large amounts of unused factory capacity.

The evidence accumulated over the intermeeting period confirms that output is expanding briskly.Although new hiring remains subdued, other indicators suggest an improvement in the labor market. Increases in core consumer prices are muted and expected to remain low.The committee perceives that the upside and downside risks to the attainment of sustainable growth for the next few quarters are roughly equal. The probability of an unwelcome fall in inflation has diminished in recent months and now appears almost equal to that of a rise in inflation.

317,,2004-01-29 00:00:00,"The Federal Reserve's announcement yesterday that it had withdrawn its promise to keep short-term interest rates low ''for a considerable period'' shocked both the stock and bond markets, with the three major stock indexes dropping more than 1.3 percent and the yield on the 10-year Treasury note shooting up sharply.With its announcement, Fed policy makers took away what had been a security blanket for investors: a promise to keep the benchmark interest rate low as the economy picked up steam. That pledge was made in August, when members of the Federal Open Market Committee added these words to a statement after their meeting: ''The committee believes that policy accommodation can be maintained for a considerable period.''That promise was repeated as the economy grew, and it helped to keep longer-term rates low. As recently as last week, the 10-year Treasury yield was below 4 percent, more than half a percentage point lower than it was in September.After yesterday's bond sell-off, the yield was back up to 4.20 percent.

Although widely anticipated, the Federal Reserve Board's decision to cut its discount rate by half a percentage point, to 6 1/2 percent, was enthusiastically received in the credit markets yesterday. Treasury note and bond prices posted strong gains, and interest rates fell.For the past few weeks analysts had been saying that the Fed would have to lower the discount rate, if only because the overnight Federal funds rate, the market rate the Fed most directly controls, was being moved steadily down toward 7 percent. Generally the funds rate trades at a higher level than the discount rate.Indeed, in announcing the change the Fed said that one of the reasons for the cut was to realign the discount rate with other market rates.But traders and analysts said the Fed's admission that the cut was being made against a background of ""weakness in the economy, constraints on credit and slow growth in the monetary aggregates"" was the real reason the market reacted so positively to the move.

Acknowledging in effect that the American economy is in recession, the Federal Reserve sent a clear signal yesterday that reversing the decline -- rather than fighting inflation -- is now its top concern.The signal came in the form of a reduction in the discount rate to 6 1/2 percent, from 7 percent. This is the rate the central bank charges for loans to commercial banks, but since banks rarely borrow from the Federal Reserve -- unless they are in trouble -- the discount rate has become largely a signpost for policy decisions.The signal this time was a strong one, coming as it did as the Fed's top policy makers concluded one of their periodic reviews of the economy. The Fed had taken a few tentative steps recently to push down rates and thus encourage consumers and business people to borrow money to spend and invest, stimulating the economy. But the action yesterday -- the first change in the discount rate in 22 months -- was seen as an unequivocal statement that policy has changed.  'The Debate Is Over'""The debate is over within the Federal Reserve,"" said Robert DiClemente, an economist at Salomon Brothers. ""Their action is a clarion call that they want rates down and they want people to borrow and spend.""

The announcement at 3:25 P.M. listed ""weakness in the economy"" as the main reason for the discount rate cut. Further evidence of that weakness came yesterday morning as the Labor Department reported that the Consumer Price Index had risen a mild three-tenths of 1 percent in November.

Consumer prices rose a modest three-tenths of 1 percent in November, less than half the torrid oil-driven pace set during the three months immediately after Iraq's invasion of Kuwait, Labor Department figures showed today.The slowdown reflected both moderation in energy prices, which benefited from diplomatic efforts to solve the crisis instead of threats of force, and a general weakness in the economy. That weakness has tended to put downward pressure on the prices of some items while preventing higher prices for energy.When food and energy are excluded, the Consumer Price Index rose by the same three-tenths of 1 percent as when these volatile items are included. The rise in so-called core inflation has now been three-tenths of 1 percent for three straight months.  Strange Behavior for HousingWhile the November increase was about as expected, many analysts had braced for an unpleasant surprise since the largest element of the price index, housing, has been behaving strangely of late and because last week's report on prices at the producer level was worse than expected.

The reassurance provided by the modest rise in the consumer index appeared to extend to the Federal Reserve, whose governors announced this afternoon a half-point cut, to 6 1/2 percent, in the discount rate, the rate charged financial institutions when they borrow at the central bank. This move came as the Fed's Open Market Committee concluded a meeting to establish the course of monetary policy until early February.

322,,2000-06-29 00:00:00,"Following is the text of the statement by the Federal Open Market Committee, the Federal Reserve's monetary policy panel, after its decision yesterday to leave short-term interest rates unchanged:The Federal Open Market Committee at its meeting today decided to maintain the existing stance of monetary policy, keeping its target for the federal funds rate at 6.5 percent.Recent data suggest that the expansion of aggregate demand may be moderating toward a pace closer to the rate of growth of the economy's potential to produce. Although core measures of prices are rising slightly faster than a year ago, continuing rapid advances in productivity have been containing costs and holding down underlying price pressures.Nonetheless, signs that growth in demand is moving to a sustainable pace are still tentative and preliminary, and the utilization of the pool of available workers remains at an unusually high level.In these circumstances, and against the background of its long-term goals of price stability and sustainable economic growth and of the information currently available, the committee believes the risks continue to be weighted mainly toward conditions that may generate heightened inflation pressures in the foreseeable future.

323,,2000-06-29 00:00:00,"The Federal Reserve voted today to leave interest rates unchanged, giving itself more time to determine whether the series of rate increases it has imposed the last year are slowing the economy sufficiently to avoid an upturn in inflation.But the central bank warned that it could start raising rates again as soon as its next meeting, on Aug. 22. Analysts said the Fed would probably tighten policy in August unless economic indicators in coming weeks provided assurance that the red-hot pace of economic growth earlier this year had given way to a more sustainable path that reduces the threat of an inflationary spiral in wages and prices.The Federal Reserve's decision had been widely expected by economists and investors, and Wall Street took the news largely in stride. The Dow Jones industrial average climbed more than 100 points but fell back after the Fed announcement to close at 10,527.79, up 23.33, for the day. The Nasdaq composite index rose 81.38, to 3,940.34.In calling a time out today in its campaign of rate increases -- six over the last year, pushing its benchmark federal funds target rate up 1.75 percentage points, to 6.5 percent -- the Fed acknowledged that there had been some evidence that the economy was cooling off. And the central bank noted that while inflation by some measures had been accelerating, price pressures were being held down by continuing improvements in productivity, a measure of the economy's ability to produce more for less.

But the central bank's policy-making Federal Open Market Committee suggested that it remained unconvinced that the economic slowdown was real. And it stressed its continuing concern that the current low rate of unemployment -- 4.1 percent in May -- could lead wages to rise so fast that companies would be forced to raise their prices.

The evidence accumulated over the inter-meeting period indicates that output is continuing to expand at a solid pace and labor market conditions have improved. Although incoming inflation data are somewhat elevated, a portion of the increase in recent months appears to have been due to transitory factors.The committee perceives the upside and downside risks to the attainment of both sustainable growth and price stability for the next few quarters are roughly equal. With underlying inflation still expected to be relatively low, the committee believes that policy accommodation can be removed at a pace that is likely to be measured. Nonetheless, the committee will respond to changes in economic prospects as needed to fulfill its obligation to maintain price stability.Voting for the F.O.M.C. monetary policy action were: Alan Greenspan, chairman; Timothy F.

325,,2004-07-01 00:00:00,"The Federal Reserve raised its benchmark interest rate on Wednesday for the first time in four years, officially signaling that a remarkable period of historically low rates is drawing to a close.But even as it increased the cost of borrowing for financial institutions on overnight loans to 1.25 percent from 1 percent, it sought to soothe investors by saying that inflationary pressures remained low and that further rate increases should come at a ''measured'' pace.The Fed's statement was a relief for many on Wall Street, as well as for home buyers, who will be able to get mortgages at comparatively low rates for at least a few more months.It also appears to be good news for President Bush. Even though the Fed is expected to keep increasing interest rates as the November elections approach, the economic impact of those increases is likely to be mild until at least sometime next year.

But some of the Fed's growing chorus of critics on Wall Street warned that the Fed's chairman, Alan Greenspan, might have waited too long to start raising rates. That could force the central bank to play catch-up in tightening monetary policy in the months ahead to prevent inflation from re-emerging as a serious economic threat.

326,,2007-12-12 00:00:00,"Following is the text of a statement released by the Federal Reserve on Tuesday after the Fed’s monetary policy panel, the Federal Open Market Committee, decided to lower interest rates by a quarter of a percentage point:The Federal Open Market Committee decided today to lower its target for the federal funds rate 25 basis points, to 4.25 percent.Incoming information suggests that economic growth is slowing, reflecting the intensification of the housing correction and some softening in business and consumer spending. Moreover, strains in financial markets have increased in recent weeks. Today’s action, combined with the policy actions taken earlier, should help promote moderate growth over time.Readings on core inflation have improved modestly this year, but elevated energy and commodity prices, among other factors, may put upward pressure on inflation. In this context, the committee judges that some inflation risks remain, and it will continue to monitor inflation developments carefully.Recent developments, including the deterioration in financial market conditions, have increased the uncertainty surrounding the outlook for economic growth and inflation. The committee will continue to assess the effects of financial and other developments on economic prospects and will act as needed to foster price stability and sustainable economic growth.Voting for the F.O.M.C. monetary policy action were: Ben S. Bernanke, chairman; Timothy F. Geithner, vice chairman; Charles L. Evans; Thomas M. Hoenig; Donald L. Kohn; Randall S. Kroszner; Frederic S. Mishkin; William Poole; and Kevin M. Warsh. Voting against was Eric S. Rosengren, who preferred to lower the target for the federal funds rate by 50 basis points at this meeting.In a related action, the Board of Governors unanimously approved a 25 basis-point decrease in the discount rate to 4.75 percent. In taking this action, the board approved the requests submitted by the Boards of Directors of the Federal Reserve Banks of New York, Philadelphia, Cleveland, Richmond, Atlanta, Chicago and St. Louis.

Then,  accompanied by his wife, Janet, his daughter, Sarah, and his press secretary,  Alice Stewart — who doubles as his Boston Marathon trainer — he  walked into the dark, freezing morning, climbed into a waiting S.U.V. andheaded for Central College in Pella, Iowa.Huckabee, a former Arkansas governor, was in a buoyant mood on three  hours of sleep. The night before, his commercial flight suffered a long Chicago  holdover on the way from Boston, but he had reason to hope that his  days at the mercy of the airlines might be numbered. A Des Moines Register  opinion poll had just shown Huckabee passing Mitt Romney to take  the lead in the run-up to the Jan. 3 caucus. His picture, he already knew,  was on the front page of that morning’s USA Today. Now he was headed  to  Central College, to appear, surrounded by enthusiastic students, on ‘‘The  Early Show’’ on CBS . This kind of momentum, he hoped, would finally  produce enough cash to allow him to charter his own plane.The governor was especially happy that morning about an impending  endorsement he expected (and received the following day) from Tim  LaHaye, the author of the apocalyptic ‘‘Left Behind’’ series  of novels.‘‘Left Behind’’ is wildly popular among evangelicals,  who have bought  more than 65 million copies, making LaHaye a very rich man and one of  the few writers who is also a major philanthropist. Recently he donated a  hockey rink to Jerry Falwell’s Liberty University, although some members  of the faculty there deride ‘‘Left Behind’’ as science  fiction. Huckabee, an  ordained Southern Baptist minister, has no such reservations. He considers  the ‘‘Left Behind’’ books, in which the world comes  to a violent end as Jesus  triumphs over Satan, a ‘‘compelling story written for nontheologians.’’Huckabee’s affability and populist economic and social views have sometimes  been misinterpreted as a moderate brand of evangelical Christianity. In  fact, as he wrote in his book ‘‘Character Makes a Difference,’’ he  considers liberalism  to be a cancer on Christianity. Huckabee is an admirer of the late Jerry  Falwell (whose son, Jerry Jr., recently endorsed his candidacy) and subscribes  wholeheartedly to the principles of the Moral Majority. He also affirms the  Baptist Faith and Message statement: ‘‘The Holy Bible . . . has  truth, without  any mixture of error, for its matter. Therefore, all Scripture is totally true  and  trustworthy.’’

On the road to Pella, Huckabee talked about the enthusiasm he now  encounters everywhere he goes.

It was, I thought, a dangerous anecdote to tell within earshot  of a professional driver traveling along an icy highway at high speed, but  Huckabee was feeling invulnerable, and the driver, I later realized, was already  on the governor’s team. Huckabee normally starts his mornings by running  6 to 10 miles and reading a chapter from the Book of Proverbs. Today he was  too pressed to do either, but he planned to catch up later. Anyway, he knew  much of the day’s assignment, Chapter 3, by heart. ‘‘Trust  in the Lord,’’ he  quoted, ‘‘and lean not upon thine own understanding.’’ Not  a bad motto for  a campaign that is still too broke to do any independent polling.

330,,2005-07-01 00:00:00,"Following is the text of a revised statement released by the Federal Reserve yesterday after the Fed's monetary policy panel, the Federal Open Market Committee, decided to raise its benchmark interest rates a quarter-point:The Federal Open Market Committee decided today to raise its target for the federal funds rate by 25 basis points to 31/4 percent.The committee believes that, even after this action, the stance of monetary policy remains accommodative and, coupled with robust underlying growth in productivity, is providing ongoing support to economic activity.Although energy prices have risen further, the expansion remains firm and labor market conditions continue to improve gradually. Pressures on inflation have stayed elevated, but longer-term inflation expectations remain well contained.The committee perceives that, with appropriate monetary policy action, the upside and downside risks to the attainment of both sustainable growth and price stability should be kept roughly equal. With underlying inflation expected to be contained, the committee believes that policy accommodation can be removed at a pace that is likely to be measured. Nonetheless, the committee will respond to changes in economic prospects as needed to fulfill its obligation to maintain price stability.Voting for the F.O.M.C. monetary policy action were: Alan Greenspan, Chairman; Timothy F. Geithner, Vice Chairman; Susan S. Bies; Roger W. Ferguson, Jr.; Richard W. Fisher; Edward M. Gramlich; Donald L. Kohn; Michael H. Moskow; Mark W. Olson; Anthony M. Santomero; and Gary H. Stern.In a related action, the board of governors unanimously approved a 25-basis-point increase in the discount rate to 41/4 percent. In taking this action, the board approved the requests submitted by the boards of directors of the Federal Reserve Banks of Boston, New York, Philadelphia, Cleveland, Richmond, Atlanta, Chicago, St. Louis, Minneapolis, Kansas City, Dallas and San Francisco.

Prices of Treasury notes and bonds posted modest gains in very quiet, trendless trading yesterday, recapturing most of the losses sustained during Monday's session.Traders sold securities early in the day after the release of a Commerce Department report showing that, while economic growth in the second quarter was somewhat slower than previously thought, the rate of inflation was somewhat faster.However, the losses only amounted to as much as one-quarter of a point on long-term bonds. And they were recouped later on weakness in gold and oil prices. Reserves Added by FedSomewhat surprisingly, the day's major event in the credit markets had little or no impact on prices. For the second consecutive day, the Federal Reserve added reserves to the banking system, a move that surprised traders and led some to wonder if the central bank might be sending signals that it intended to ease monetary policy.

Prices climbed at a faster clip than previously thought during the second quarter, pushing the inflation rate further above the expectations of the Federal Reserve and Administration policymakers, Commerce Department figures showed today.None of the new figures, however, made much of an impression on economists or financial markets, and the Reagan Administration insisted there was still no reason to believe inflation was headed for worrisome levels.Marlin Fitzwater, the White House spokesman, said, ''The facts, plus the moderating growth rate, point to inflation remaining under control.''The Commerce Department said that prices rose at a 5 percent rate from April through June, as measured by the fixed-weighted index tied to the gross national product, compared with the 4.7 percent rate estimated for the period in both July and August. This compared with a 3.5 percent inflation rate during the first three months of the year.

Prices of Treasury notes and bonds slumped yesterday, sending the yield on the Treasury's bellwether 30-year bond to a 10-week high of 8.24 percent.Trading was sluggish, as market participants struggled with an offering of $9.5 billion worth of new two-year Treasury notes, the latest in an avalanche of new Treasury issues.Late in the day, the Treasury said the notes were sold at an average yield of 8.37 percent, sharply higher than the average 7.75 percent yield at the last two-year auction on July 26. The price surge came despite early optimism among traders that the auction had gone well. ''We saw pockets of reasonable interest,'' one government securities trader said. ''This is the first Treasury auction in a month that has been fairly priced.''Even so, the slide continued after the auction results were released, and by late in the day the two-year notes were offered on a when-issued basis at a price to yield 8.41 percent.

Orders to American factories for durable goods tumbled 1.9 percent in July to the lowest level in nine months, the Government said today. The report provides further evidence that the economy is weakening.The Commerce Department said demand for durable goods, a wide range of consumer and commercial items expected to last three years or more, totaled a seasonally adjusted $122.9 billion last month, the lowest level since October 1988.It was the fourth drop this year in the sector, which is considered a bellwether of the economy's performance.In June, orders rose 1.4 percent, faster than expected, following a 4.5 percent plunge in May, the steepest drop in 10 months. Orders rose in April and March and fell in February and January.

The bond market rose modestly yesterday, wiping out most of Monday's losses on the 30-year bond and moving higher in other maturities. But traders and analysts are still worried about some sudden surprise from the Republican National Convention and expect the market to be volatile for the rest of the week.The day's economic data continued to paint a picture of an economy growing slowly, which is one of the main reasons prices of notes and bonds have advanced recently.The Commerce Department reported that housing starts fell 2.8 percent in July, which surprised many analysts inasmuch as home mortgage rates are close to 20-year lows. The consensus forecast was for an increase of 1.7 percent.The one possibly positive note in the housing report was that permits for new structures were up 3.7 percent last month. But a lot of those new permits were for multifamily housing, not single-family dwellings, which would give a stronger lift to the economy. Permits for single-family homes have remained basically unchanged since April. Slower Sales Seen

Earlier this year, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation warned that 200 banks with combined assets of more than $80 billion would fail this year. After seven months, however, only 70 banks with $20.9 billion of assets have failed, far below the rate the F.D.I.C. forecast.But even as banking experts debate how much the slowdown stems from election-year politics and how much from the palliative effects of the lower interest rates that make even the weakest banks more profitable, the F.D.I.C. is warning that tougher new regulations that will take effect on Dec. 19 will result in a flurry of bank closings.After Dec. 19, regulators must either start closing banks whose shareholder capital drops below 2 percent of assets, or provide good reasons why they are letting them stay open. A good reason, F.D.I.C. officials say, would be a viable plan for a quick merger or infusion of fresh capital.Under current law, state and Federal regulators do not usually close banks unless they are insolvent, meaning that the value of the bank's assets, like loans and securities, is not equal to the combined total of its capital and what it owes depositors.

Nonetheless, the degree of the strengthening in final demand over coming quarters, an essential element in sustained economic expansion, is still uncertain.In these circumstances, although the stance of monetary policy is currently accommodative, the committee believes that for the foreseeable future, against the background of its long-run goals of price stability and sustainable economic growth and of the information currently available, the risks are balanced with respect to the prospects for both goals.The committee decided to include in its announcements following its meetings the roll call of the vote on the federal funds rate target, including the preferred policy choice of any dissenters. This action accelerates the release of this information, currently available in the minutes with a lag.To conform to this new practice, the board of governors also decided to report in the written announcement the roll call of any vote on the discount rate, also including the preferred policy choice of any dissenters.Voting for the F.O.M.C. monetary policy action were: Alan Greenspan, chairman; William J.

But the Fed laid the groundwork to begin reversing some of the 11 rate cuts it carried out last year as the economy sank into recession.The central bank also took a step to respond to criticism that its deliberations remain too shrouded in secrecy. It said that from now on it would immediately disclose how individual members voted on interest rate decisions. The Fed now waits to disclose the votes of individual members until after the subsequent meeting, when it releases minutes of its deliberations.At today's meeting, the Fed said, all 10 members of the open-market committee supported the decision to leave rates unchanged.

340,,2002-03-20 00:00:00,"Let the guessing games begin. Investment gurus around the world are turning their prodigious energies to fathoming the future direction of the financial markets in a world of rising interest rates.Not a soul expected the Federal Reserve, which met Tuesday, to lift U.S. rates immediately. The American recovery is not yet trundling ahead with enough momentum to warrant the cooling effects of a rate increase. But market players had generally expected that the Fed would shift its bias to neutral from negative, signaling that it will lift rates in coming months.And the Fed is not alone. As Nomura International put it: ""Other central banks are getting twitchy. Increasingly hawkish noises are being heard in different corners of the world: Canada, Sweden and Australasia."" Sweden and New Zealand raised their benchmark rates this week.Reading the mind of the Fed is tricky at best — and especially so at this early stage of the U.S. economy's slow crawl out of recession. Analysts at Societe Generale recently forecast that the improving American economy will put pressure on the Fed to reverse course on interest rates and start raising them sooner rather than later.

However, inflation pressures seem likely to moderate over time, reflecting contained inflation expectations and the cumulative effects of monetary policy actions and other factors restraining aggregate demand.Nonetheless, the committee judges that some inflation risks remain. The extent and timing of any additional firming that may be needed to address these risks will depend on the evolution of the outlook for both inflation and economic growth, as implied by incoming information.Voting for the F.O.M.C. monetary policy action were: Ben S. Bernanke, chairman; Timothy F. Geithner, vice chairman; Susan S. Bies; Jack Guynn; Donald L. Kohn; Randall S. Kroszner; Sandra Pianalto; Kevin M. Warsh; and Janet L. Yellen. Voting against was Jeffrey M. Lacker, who preferred an increase of 25 basis points in the federal funds rate target at this meeting.

Conditions in financial markets have generally improved in recent months. Household spending has shown further signs of stabilizing but remains constrained by ongoing job losses, lower housing wealth and tight credit. Businesses are cutting back on fixed investment and staffing but appear to be making progress in bringing inventory stocks into better alignment with sales. Although economic activity is likely to remain weak for a time, the committee continues to anticipate that policy actions to stabilize financial markets and institutions, fiscal and monetary stimulus, and market forces will contribute to a gradual resumption of sustainable economic growth in a context of price stability.The prices of energy and other commodities have risen of late. However, substantial resource slack is likely to dampen cost pressures and the committee expects that inflation will remain subdued for some time.In these circumstances, the Federal Reserve will employ all available tools to promote economic recovery and to preserve price stability. The committee will maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to  1/4 percent and continues to anticipate that economic conditions are likely to warrant exceptionally low levels of the federal funds rate for an extended period. As previously announced, to provide support to mortgage lending and housing markets and to improve overall conditions in private credit markets, the Federal Reserve will purchase a total of up to $1.25 trillion of agency mortgage-backed securities and up to $200 billion of agency debt by the end of the year. In addition, the Federal Reserve will buy up to $300 billion of Treasury securities by autumn. The committee will continue to evaluate the timing and overall amounts of its purchases of securities in light of the evolving economic outlook and conditions in financial markets. The Federal Reserve is monitoring the size and composition of its balance sheet and will make adjustments to its credit and liquidity programs as warranted.Voting for the F.O.M.C. monetary policy action were: Ben S. Bernanke, chairman; William C. Dudley, vice chairman; Elizabeth A. Duke; Charles L. Evans; Donald L. Kohn; Jeffrey M. Lacker; Dennis P. Lockhart; Daniel K. Tarullo; Kevin M. Warsh; and Janet L. Yellen.

343,,2009-06-25 00:00:00,"President Obama hailed a pledge by the pharmaceutical industry to contribute $80 billion in drug discounts and other savings over the next 10 years as “a significant breakthrough on the road to health care reform.” The pledge should help large numbers of older Americans struggling to pay high drug bills. But before anyone gets too ecstatic, we will need a lot more details about what industry is giving up and what it is getting.The deal was negotiated in private among the industry, Senator Max Baucus, chairman of the Finance Committee and a crucial figure in shaping health reform, and the White House. From the broad outlines described by the White House, it looks as if $30 billion would be used to cut in half the price of brand-name drugs sold to Medicare patients who have reached a gap in coverage known as the doughnut hole.That could be a great help for elderly Americans of modest means who, after reaching the gap, stop taking their medicines rather than pay the full cost themselves. And it could reduce the need for the federal government to close the hole entirely on its own. The move has been justifiably praised by  AARP and the Medicare Rights Center, both advocates for beneficiaries.The other $50 billion pledged is meant to save the government money that could be applied to covering the uninsured. There appear to be three main elements: a big increase in the discounts drug companies are required to give to Medicaid programs for the poor; a new fee imposed upon the companies; and a new regulatory pathway to foster the development of generics to compete with brand-name biological drugs.

Eager to have a strong voice in the health care debate — and head off more draconian demands — six major health care industries have promised to help reduce the growth in spending. So far the pharmaceutical industry is the only one to  come up with specific requirements that it is willing to meet.

The Congress and the public should see these proposals as an opening bid and not the final word.They will still provide less savings to the federal budget than the administration had been seeking. And viewed against the backdrop of the $1 trillion or more needed to finance health care reform over the next decade, these cost reductions seem small. The $80 billion is also a fraction of the nation’s overall drug spending, which federal estimates suggest will total $3.3 trillion over the next decade.

344,,2003-10-29 00:00:00,"The statement released by the Federal Reserve yesterday is nearly identical to its statements after monetary policy meetings in September and August. The only difference is its description of the labor market, which was ''weakening'' in September and appeared ''mixed'' in August, but now ''appears to be stabilizing.'' Following is the text of yesterday's statement:The Federal Open Market Committee decided today to keep its target for the federal funds rate at 1 percent. The committee continues to believe that an accommodative stance of monetary policy, coupled with robust underlying growth in productivity, is providing important ongoing support to economic activity. The evidence accumulated over the intermeeting period confirms that spending is firming, and the labor market appears to be stabilizing. Business pricing power and increases in core consumer prices remain muted.The committee perceives that the upside and downside risks to the attainment of sustainable growth for the next few quarters are roughly equal. In contrast, the probability, though minor, of an unwelcome fall in inflation exceeds that of a rise in inflation from its already low level. The committee judges that on balance, the risk of inflation becoming undesirably low remains the predominant concern for the foreseeable future. In these circumstances, the committee believes that policy accommodation can be maintained for a considerable period.Voting for the F.O.M.C. monetary policy action were: Alan Greenspan, chairman; Ben S. Bernanke; Susan S. Bies; J. Alfred Broaddus Jr.; Roger W. Ferguson Jr.; Edward M. Gramlich; Jack Guynn; Donald L. Kohn; Michael H. Moskow; Mark W. Olson; Robert T. Parry; and Jamie B. Stewart Jr.

345,,2003-10-29 00:00:00,"The Federal Reserve kept short-term interest rates at 1 percent on Tuesday, the lowest level in 45 years, and suggested that it would continue to do so until at least sometime next year.In a statement accompanying the decision, the Fed was optimistic for the first time this year about job creation and employment, saying, ''The labor market appears to be stabilizing.''But the Fed did not mention that economic growth appears to have accelerated to a blistering annual pace of 6 percent in recent months, or refer to a raft of data showing that business spending and investor confidence has climbed sharply.Instead, it reiterated its view of the last several months that there is more risk that inflation will be too low rather than too high, and it repeated its intention to continue its policy of rock-bottom interest rates for ''a considerable period.''

346,,2002-12-11 00:00:00,"Following is the text of a statement released by the Federal Reserve yesterday after the Fed's monetary policy panel, the Federal Open Market Committee, voted to leave the benchmark rate unchanged:The Federal Open Market Committee decided today to keep its target for the federal funds rate unchanged at 1 1/4 percent. The committee continues to believe that this accommodative stance of monetary policy, coupled with still robust underlying growth in productivity, is providing important ongoing support to economic activity.The limited number of incoming economic indicators since the November meeting, taken together, are not inconsistent with the economy working its way through its current soft spot.In these circumstances, the committee believes that, against the background of its long-run goals of price stability and sustainable economic growth and of the information currently available, the risks are balanced with respect to the prospects for both goals for the foreseeable future.Voting for the F.O.M.C. monetary policy action were Alan Greenspan, chairman; William J.

347,,2002-12-11 00:00:00,"The Federal Reserve kept interest rates unchanged today, leaving its main short-term rate at its lowest level in 41 years as policy makers wait for more signs of economic strength.In a statement after today's meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee, which sets monetary policy, the Fed repeated its view that the economy was working through a ''soft spot'' and that existing monetary policy was loose enough at the moment.Last month, the Federal Reserve made an aggressive move by reducing the federal funds rate on overnight loans between banks by half a percentage point, to just 1.25 percent. Alan Greenspan, the Fed chairman, has called the move an ''insurance premium'' in case the economy proves to be weaker than expected.Given the big rate cut last month and the continued signs of economic weakness, the decision today to stand pat came as no surprise. But analysts said the absence of new guidance from the Fed reinforced their view that rates would be kept down for at least the next several months.

348,,2002-12-11 00:00:00,"Jay A. Pritzker, the aging scion of Chicago's wealthiest and leading philanthropic family, called a meeting in June 1995 to hand 11 members of the next generation an important memorandum, outlining the Pritzker principle that family money should be shared among them and appointing a triumvirate to replace him at the empire's helm.But after Mr. Pritzker's death in 1999 and a nasty squabble between the triumvirate and the other cousins, that blueprint was torn up last year and replaced by a secret plan to carve up the $15 billion empire over the next decade, most likely taking public key assets like the Hyatt hotel chain, and handing each of the 11 a $1.4 billion purse.Now, a cousin who was left out of that pact, Liesel Pritzker, an 18-year-old movie actress and freshman at Columbia University, has sued the family, bringing unwanted attention to the underlying dispute and threatening the agreement. In her lawsuit, Liesel, who is a member of the family's fourth generation, contends that her trust funds were emptied to benefit the other members of that generation, who are decades older. It contends they are treating her and her 20-year-old brother, Matthew, like members of the fifth generation who are closer to their ages.''The Pritzker family will no longer be the major factor it was,'' said Leon Danco, chairman of the Center for Family Business, a Cleveland consulting firm that advises family businesses on management and governance. ''The dissolution of the family is an attribute of human nature. The Pritzkers were a powerful family. Jay Pritzker died and the money is diffused and it creates new factions and new allegiances.''

WASHINGTON, Sept. 20 — Senate Republicans formally put aside a broad immigration overhaul sought by President Bush  on Wednesday and decided instead to press ahead with narrower bills to require building 700 miles of fence on the southwestern border.Senator Bill Frist of Tennessee, the majority leader, said the fate of millions of illegal immigrants already in the United States had become a “fundamental sticking point” in trying to reach agreement with the House on a broad bill.Mr. Frist said the fence proposal, which the House has passed, was the best alternative if lawmakers wanted to salvage some immigration changes before the Nov. 7 elections.“Let’s focus on a problem the American people understand,’’ the senator said, “and that is, we have hundreds of thousands of people coming across our border every year into our country.”

353,,1998-05-20 00:00:00,"Treasury prices ended slightly lower yesterday after the Federal Reserve, as expected, left interest rates unchanged.The price of the 30-year Treasury bond fell 5/32, to 102 22/32. The bond's yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, edged up to 5.93 percent, from 5.92 percent on Monday. There was little reaction to the Fed's announcement at 2:15 P.M.Until last month, many bond market participants were confident that the central bank would not move to raise short-term interest rates anytime soon. But that changed, and there is now some anxiety looking ahead to the the next meeting of Fed policy makers, the Federal Open Market Committee, in July.''With signs of a slowing economy increasing, inflation still calm, the dollar still strong and Asia still in turmoil, the Fed decided to wait until its next powwow to see if an economic slackening actually materializes and thus provides the rationale to continue to adhere to a 5.5 percent Federal funds rate,'' said Donald Fine, the chief market analyst for Chase Asset Management.

However, he said, ''in the absence of a significant moderation in business activity, many on the F.O.M.C. will want to be pre-emptive and tighten at the July 1 meeting because of fears that the extremely low rate of unemployment will exacerbate already budding wage pressures and lead directly to increasing inflationary tendencies in the overall economy.''

Mr. Fine also said economic statistics over the next six weeks would be crucial to the Fed and would therefore come under intense scrutiny by bond investors.The Government released its April housing starts report yesterday and reaffirmed what the market already knows, that the housing industry remained strong.

354,,1998-05-20 00:00:00,"The Federal Reserve declined once again today to increase short-term interest rates, apparently determining that the threat of inflation remained remote and that the latest phase of the worsening Asian economic crisis might be exacerbated by any rate rise now in the United States.Several weeks ago, there were hints that the Federal Reserve might be leaning toward increasing interest rates sometime soon. But a number of recent indicators, including continued low inflation and the announcement this morning of a modest decline in the starts of new housing, have lessened immediate fears of an overheating of the economy, market analysts said.The decision to leave rates unchanged, at least for now, was hardly a surprise on Wall Street, where many leading economists had predicted that the policy-setting Federal Open Market Committee, which meets regularly to review interest-rate policy, would again sit on its hands. The markets yawned in response: The Dow Jones industrial average ended the day up 3.74 points, at 9,054.65, after having risen 62 points earlier in the day.While no one knows for sure what motivated the Federal Reserve's decision, its policy makers had reason to worry that an increase now would only worsen problems in Asia. In recent weeks, there have been signs of renewed economic trouble in Thailand and South Korea, and the images of Jakarta in flames last week rekindled fear of a contagion effect that would discourage further investment in Asia.

Meanwhile, the National Association of Purchasing Management reported that its monthly index of manufacturing activity in the Chicago region, seen as a bellwether for the economy, unexpectedly rose to 59.5 points in March from 57.8 in February.Taken together, the numbers indicate that the economy remains on a roll, analysts said.''These numbers are still remarkable,'' said Kathleen Stephansen, economist at Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette Securities.

In a related action, the Board of Governors approved a 25 basis point reduction in the discount rate, to 2 percent.The committee continues to believe that an accommodative stance of monetary policy, coupled with still robust underlying growth in productivity, is providing important ongoing support to economic activity. Recent signs point to a firming in spending, markedly improved financial conditions, and labor and product markets that are stabilizing. The economy, nonetheless, has yet to exhibit sustainable growth. With inflationary expectations subdued, the committee judged that a slightly more expansive monetary policy would add further support for an economy which it expects to improve over time.The committee perceives that the upside and downside risks to the attainment of sustainable growth for the next few quarters are roughly equal. In contrast, the probability, though minor, of an unwelcome substantial fall in inflation exceeds that of a pickup in inflation from its already low level. On balance, the committee believes that the latter concern is likely to predominate for the foreseeable future.Voting for the F.O.M.C. monetary policy action were Alan Greenspan, chairman; Ben S. Bernanke; Susan S. Bies; J. Alfred Broaddus Jr.; Roger W. Ferguson Jr.; Edward M. Gramlich; Jack Guynn; Donald L. Kohn; Michael H. Moskow; Mark W. Olson; and Jamie B. Stewart Jr.Voting against the action was Robert T. Parry. President Parry preferred a 50 basis point reduction in the target for the federal funds rate.In taking the discount rate action, the Federal Reserve Board approved the requests submitted by the boards of directors of the Federal Reserve Banks of Boston, New York, St. Louis, Kansas City and San Francisco.

The full Senate has not approved the accord, but after days of dispute, it appeared to remove one of the last obstacles to approval of the bill.''We will now have clear sailing to final passage,'' said Senator Max Baucus of Montana, principal Democratic sponsor of the bill.

The economy seems likely to continue to expand at a moderate pace over coming quarters.Readings on core inflation have improved modestly in recent months.However, a sustained moderation in inflation pressures has yet to be convincingly demonstrated. Moreover, the high level of resource utilization has the potential to sustain those pressures.In these circumstances, the committee’s predominant policy concern remains the risk that inflation will fail to moderate as expected. Future policy adjustments will depend on the evolution of the outlook for both inflation and economic growth, as implied by incoming information.Voting for the F.O.M.C. monetary policy action were Ben S.

363,,2002-05-08 00:00:00,"With new data suggesting that inflation will remain under control, the Federal Reserve voted unanimously today to hold its benchmark interest rate unchanged, saying the durability of the economic recovery remained uncertain.On a day when the Labor Department reported a bigger-than-expected surge in the growth rate of productivity, the central bank reiterated that it was not in any rush to raise interest rates, despite a sharp upturn in economic growth in the first quarter. The productivity gain is evidence that companies may be able to restore their depressed profit margins without having to jack up prices.The decision left the federal funds target rate on overnight loans among banks at a 40-year low, 1.75 percent, where it has been for nearly five months. Economists said the Fed would probably not seriously consider raising rates until August, especially if the unemployment rate continued to rise, as it has in recent months.On Wall Street, stock prices were little changed. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 28.51, to 9,836.55. The Nasdaq composite index closed at 1,573.82, down 4.66.

Growth in the current quarter appears robust. Fears of a credit squeeze in the bond market have abated. And while manufacturers and farmers still suffer from exports lost as a result of the financial turmoil of the last year and a half, the latest trade figures suggested that the worst may be past, even for them.

Prices of Treasury bonds and notes fell by as much as a point in fairly light trading yesterday, as market participants reacted negatively to the implications of a report showing a big drop in the nation's merchandise trade deficit in March.The sharp $4.08 billion decline in the March deficit from February's $13.8 billion shortfall was far above market expectations, and in the minutes after the 8:30 A.M. release of the figures, bond prices rallied by more than a point.But once analysts had a chance to study the numbers, the early enthusiasm gave way to sober reassessment and a sharp selloff.Closer examination of the data showed that very rapid export growth was the primary reason behind the improvement. Moreover, imports, which economists would like to see decline, rose again in March, although at a far slower rate than exports expanded.

The housing sector has shown some signs of improvement over recent months. Household spending appears to be expanding at a moderate rate, though it remains constrained by a weak labor market, modest income growth, lower housing wealth and tight credit.Businesses are still cutting back on fixed investment, though at a slower pace, and remain reluctant to add to payrolls; they continue to make progress in bringing inventory stocks into better alignment with sales. Financial market conditions have become more supportive of economic growth.Although economic activity is likely to remain weak for a time, the committee anticipates that policy actions to stabilize financial markets and institutions, fiscal and monetary stimulus and market forces will contribute to a strengthening of economic growth and a gradual return to higher levels of resource utilization in a context of price stability.With substantial resource slack likely to continue to dampen cost pressures and with longer-term inflation expectations stable, the committee expects that inflation will remain subdued for some time.

To provide support to mortgage lending and housing markets and to improve overall conditions in private credit markets, the Federal Reserve is in the process of purchasing $1.25 trillion of agency mortgage-backed securities and about $175 billion of agency debt. In order to promote a smooth transition in markets, the committee is gradually slowing the pace of these purchases, and it anticipates that these transactions will be executed by the end of the first quarter of 2010. The committee will continue to evaluate the timing and overall amounts of its purchases of securities in light of the evolving economic outlook and conditions in financial markets.

367,,2009-12-17 00:00:00,"A federal judge who will decide whether the name Tavern on the Green belongs to New York City or the restaurant’s current operators rained a barrage of  Socratic questions on a succession of trademark lawyers  who  popped up in the legal equivalent of Whack-A-Mole on Wednesday. 
Judge Miriam Goldman Cedarbaum of the Southern District of Manhattan reserved judgment on the name, which was bestowed on the property by the city in 1934 and trademarked in 1981 by its operator at the time, Warner LeRoy, whose family has lost the right to run the restaurant and has placed it in bankruptcy proceedings. But Judge Cedarbaum seemed to give equal measures of agita and hope to each side. 
While offering little indication of which side she favored, the judge gave every evidence that she would treat the case as a complex intellectual-property dispute that could be breaking new legal ground. “This is a very interesting case,” she said at one point, assuming a half-smile.
The ownership issue has been a flash point in Tavern’s bankruptcy case since the name — which has been appraised at $19 million — is potentially the restaurant’s most valuable asset.
Lawyers on both sides were circumspect after the hearing. The case “raises a lot of issues of concern to the court,” said Gerald E. Singleton, senior intellectual property lawyer for the New York City Law Department, “and this is far from a slam dunk for either side.”
Norman N. Kinel, lawyer for the committee of Tavern’s 452 unsecured creditors, who are owed $8 million, said that “from her spirited questioning, it is very clear that the judge is familiar with the arguments, and is giving the matter appropriate consideration.”
Other lawyers — there were 10 before the court and eight more attorneys and their assistants looking on — declined to comment. 
There was quiet drama in the incisive questions that enlivened the long play of argument centering on a legendary Manhattan building that began in 1872 as a sheepfold for a herd that chomped the grass in the adjoining field, now known as the Sheep Meadow.   
And both the city and the Tavern operators seemed to bear the brunt of the judge’s acute legal scrutiny. 
To the city, the judge stated flatly: “We have an incontestable trademark that you want to overcome as a matter of law.” She added: “Selecting a name doesn’t give you a trademark.” And of the incontestability, she said: “It is a heavy burden.” 
But to Tavern’s lawyers, Judge Cedarbaum commented about Mr. LeRoy’s use of the Tavern on the Green title that “he was given the name,” adding that “the city had always owned a building in Central Park that was called Tavern on the Green.”
When Mr. LeRoy submitted the trademark application in the 1970s the judge noted that he “didn’t disclose there had been a restaurant known as Tavern on the Green in the same place in Central Park for many years before.” Of making the sheepfold a restaurant, she said, “nobody questions that was the city’s idea.” 
The judge sent lawyers for both sides scurrying back to their offices to do homework, asking for more relevant prior cases that would shed light on the trademarking of a restaurant name describing a physical location, that is also a business providing services.  
The case has been bubbling in two separate federal courts. Only two weeks ago, on Dec. 1, Judge Cedarbaum ruled that she — and not a judge in United States Bankruptcy Court in Manhattan — would decide the ownership issue. Under the federal judicial bureaucracy, bankruptcy court is subordinate when the district court asserts its jurisdiction. 
“Trademark law is something that this court regularly examines,” Judge Cedarbaum said earlier this month, referring to intellectual property disputes that frequently wind up in the Southern District. 
At his death in 2001 at the age of 65, Mr. LeRoy named his daughter Jennifer Oz LeRoy chief executive of Tavern; the family holds the license to the restaurant under the name Tavern on the Green Limited Partnership. The LeRoys and their managers have said the trademarked name would have value in other locations, and they already market a line of Tavern on the Green salad dressings and gift items.
In two weeks the LeRoys must surrender their jurisdiction over Tavern to a new operator. Dean J. Poll, who runs the Boathouse restaurant in Central Park, was awarded the city’s new 20-year license to run Tavern starting Jan. 1, but he hasn’t signed a contract with Tavern’s landlord, the Parks Department. And he has yet to come to an agreement with the Hotel Trades Council, which represents some 400 Tavern employees.
Mr. Poll’s lawyer, Barry B. LePatner, has said of the name, “the only prospective purchaser is Dean Poll — and he is not paying very much for it.”
In its most recent court papers the city argued that the Tavern name is specific to the Central Park location and “associated in the minds of consumers with a specific place.”
But in its latest legal filings before Judge Cedarbaum, Tavern’s official committee of unsecured creditors  termed the restaurant under pre-LeRoy ownership “Tavern-in-the-Red,” describing it as a “dingy little money-losing rustic pub” before the LeRoys made an “investment of many millions of dollars and a complete gut and rebuild,” transforming it to “a world-class, opulent restaurant.” 
Furthermore, the name Tavern on the Green “now stands for the excellent creation of Warner LeRoy,” David H. T. Kane, a trademark lawyer for Tavern, explained to the judge on Wednesday. Both sides agree that under the family’s tenure, it became one of the country’s most lucrative restaurants. 
But at the Wednesday hearing, the city also introduced last-minute evidence — from, yes, 1956 — in the form of press releases and questions and answers authored by Robert Moses, the city parks commissioner then, who originally oversaw the naming of the sheepfold as a restaurant called Tavern on the Green in 1934.
Mr. Moses was quoted as saying that Tavern “is patronized by hundreds of thousands every year,” adding that “in recent years the use of the Tavern on the Green in Central Park has increased so greatly that enlargement of the building” was necessary. 
Tavern’s lawyers challenged the admission of the materials, which were nevertheless discussed at length. The city’s lawyer, Mr. Singleton, was expected to use the documents as an indication that Tavern was a popular attraction long before Mr. LeRoy reinvented it in 1976, in an effort to undermine claims that Mr. LeRoy’s association amounted to value added for the restaurant. 
Potentially, the trademark could be a lucrative bankruptcy asset. Last year Gabe Fried, chief executive of another brand advisory firm hired by Tavern, Streambank LLC, said his company sold the trademark and brand of the bankrupt Circuit City electronics chain for $17.5 million, Mr. Fried said, and sold the trademark and logo of the bankrupt KB Toys chain for $2.1 million at auction. 
The Tavern on the Green name was appraised at $19 million by Marshall & Stevens, a valuation firm. But Mr. Fried said last week that “it is too early to speculate on the value” of the Tavern trademark.
Since the LeRoy family would lose the license to operate the restaurant in the new year, “the infrastructure that helped support the value of the name would not be there any more,” Mr. Fried said. Therefore, the name’s “liquidation value will be lower than the fair market value,” probably less than $19 million.
To Mr. Fried, “The bottom line is that it is hard to think of a restaurant name that has as broad national and international recognition as Tavern on the Green,” he said. 
To hedge its bets against a courtroom defeat, the city has already registered a substitute name with New York State: Tavern in the Park.
In court the LeRoys have submitted proof of the legality of the original trademark certificate of ownership, and proof that the family has successfully defended the trademark through the years; they have argued, too, that the city never challenged that trademark — even when it renewed the LeRoys’ operating license in 1985.
Furthermore, the LeRoys opened a fine-dining restaurant in Wellington, Fla., invoking the Tavern on the Green name in 2006. Though at the time the parks department sent a letter to the LeRoys requesting that the trademark be turned over to the city, the LeRoys claimed ownership and operated the restaurant until 2009 without further city objection. 
“After being silent and claiming absolutely no ownership interest in the Tavern Mark for virtually the entirety of three decades, the city now has mounted a full-court media and legal press centered on a baseless claim of trademark ownership,” the creditors have charged in court papers.
In its own court papers the city has termed the LeRoys “merely custodians and caretakers of the name,” adding that nothing in the license agreement “authorizes them to walk away with the name at the end of the license term.” 
Furthermore, the city has derided the notion, in the creditors’ arguments, that “some city employee actually had to don an apron and personally supervise food preparation at Tavern on the Green in order for the city to establish and claim trademark rights,” the city’s latest filings assert. 
The city has also excoriated the LeRoys for a “failure to produce” the early 1970s agreement whereby Warner LeRoy purchased the Tavern assets of Restaurant Associates, the previous operator, asking if the predecessor claimed to own — and sell – “the Tavern name to LeRoy?”
After an hour and a half of closely parsed disputation and pointed cut-and-thrust, Judge Cedarbaum asked for more information from the parties, saying, “I will do my best to expedite the matter.” Her decision is not expected before the end of the year.

Despite elevated energy prices and hurricane-related disruptions, the expansion in economic activity appears solid. Core inflation has stayed relatively low in recent months and longer-term inflation expectations remain contained. Nevertheless, possible increases in resource utilization as well as elevated energy prices have the potential to add to inflation pressures.The committee judges that some further measured policy firming is likely to be needed to keep the risks to the attainment of both sustainable economic growth and price stability roughly in balance.In any event, the committee will respond to changes in economic prospects as needed to foster these objectives.Voting for the F.O.M.C. monetary policy action were: Alan Greenspan, chairman; Timothy F.

The rally in the Government bond market continued yesterday, as traders pushed up prices of some Treasury securities as much as a point and long-term interest rates fell to their lowest levels since the Persian Gulf crisis began.The catalyst behind yesterday's move was a Federal Reserve report that industrial output had dropped eight-tenths of a percent in October, the first decline since April.The drop in the industrial production index was slightly more than had been expected, but economists and bond dealers said the depth of the decline was not as significant as its breadth.   'In a Downturn'""Sector after sector, product group after product group, showed declines,"" said Joseph Liro, a vice president and economist at S. G. Warburg Securities Inc.

Yesterday was a choppy one on Wall Street with stock prices dropping slightly. Trading was brisk and oil prices edged $1.25 a barrel higher, to $33.12. Program trading was heavy and small stocks picked up a bit.Nervous investors cashed in their chips after the Federal Reserve, which was widely expected to trim interest rates as soon as yesterday or today took no immediate action.By the end of the day, the Dow Jones industrial average of 30 blue- chip stocks gave up 4.95 points to close at 2,535.40. The American Stock Exchange's market value index and the Nasdaq composite index of over-the-counter stocks edged ahead.Some analysts expect an upturn in the broad market before many days, largely because the Fed's widely heralded rate cut is still believed to be on the way -- particularly because of growing concern that the economy is faltering badly.

The output of American factories, mines and utilities dropped eight-tenths of 1 percent in October, prompting many analysts to declare that the economy as a whole has now conclusively slipped into recession.The decline, the first since April and the largest since January, was exceptionally widespread. And it intensified the belief that the Federal Reserve would move soon to cut interest rates again to arrest what could become a rapid economic contraction.""The steep decline in industrial production in October demonstrates that the economy is now entering the free fall stage,"" said Gordon Richards of the National Association of Manufacturers. ""The evidence of recession is now unambiguous.""

EARLIER this month, at a conference in Tokyo, the vice chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, Manuel H. Johnson, said he was ''not uncomfortable with the current level of exchange rates.'' Hidden in that off-the-cuff comment may be a growing rift between the Federal Reserve and the Treasury Department over the dollar.Although Mr. Johnson's remarks seemed entirely consistent with those he had uttered in the past, this time the foreign exchange markets reacted by sending the dollar to three-year highs against the yen. Since then, the dollar has climbed even higher, although other factors, like the drop in the Tokyo stock market, have also had an effect.The most elementary reading of Mr. Johnson's remarks was that the Federal Reserve was content to hold interest rates firm and would refrain from intervening in the foreign exchange markets. But given the uncertainty in Japan's stock market, a non-interventionist policy would almost certainly drive the dollar higher against the yen, something the Treasury, which is concerned about exports, almost certainly does not want.Carl Weinberg, chief economist at High Frequency Economics in New York, found Mr. Johnson's comments so important that ''I devoted two issues of my newsletter to them.'' Normally, the Fed does not take a position on the value of the dollar. ''It does what it is told by the Treasury,'' Mr. Weinberg said. ''But this remark signals a potential shift in the way the Fed sees itself.''

Prices of Treasury securities dipped slightly in very slow trading yesterday, as dealers placed bids on $10 billion worth of new two-year notes - the only real activity of the day.''We thought the two-year would spark some interest, but even though the auction went well, it wasn't enough,'' said Joe Liro, a vice president and money market economist at S. G. Warburg Securities Inc. ''We believe there is a lot of money on the sidelines, but at this juncture there is no reason for that money to come in.''At the auction, the notes were sold at an average yield of 8.59 percent, up from the 8.50 percent average yield at the last two-year note sale on Feb. 21, and the highest yield on a two-year note since the auction last May 24.As expected, the attractive yields generated strong demand from investors.Non-competitive bids for the notes, a good barometer of retail demand, amounted to $1.56 billion for the new notes. It was the largest non-competitive bid since the two-year auction held on April 26. $8 Billion Sale Today Today the Treasury is expected to sell $8 billion worth of new four-year notes.

375,,2009-09-24 00:00:00,"Following is the text of the Federal Reserve’s statement on Wednesday announcing it was holding its base federal funds target rate at a record low between zero and 0.25 percent: Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in August suggests that economic activity has picked up following its severe downturn. Conditions in financial markets have improved further, and activity in the housing sector has increased. Household spending seems to be stabilizing, but remains constrained by ongoing job losses, sluggish income growth, lower housing wealth and tight credit. Businesses are still cutting back on fixed investment and staffing, though at a slower pace; they continue to make progress in bringing inventory stocks into better alignment with sales. Although economic activity is likely to remain weak for a time, the committee anticipates that policy actions to stabilize financial markets and institutions, fiscal and monetary stimulus, and market forces will support a strengthening of economic growth and a gradual return to higher levels of resource utilization in a context of price stability.With substantial resource slack likely to continue to dampen cost pressures and with longer-term inflation expectations stable, the committee expects that inflation will remain subdued for some time.In these circumstances, the Federal Reserve will continue to employ a wide range of tools to promote economic recovery and to preserve price stability. The committee will maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to   1/4 percent and continues to anticipate that economic conditions are likely to warrant exceptionally low levels of the federal funds rate for an extended period. To provide support to mortgage lending and housing markets, and to improve overall conditions in private credit markets, the Federal Reserve will purchase a total of $1.25 trillion of agency mortgage-backed securities and up to $200 billion of agency debt. The committee will gradually slow the pace of these purchases in order to promote a smooth transition in markets and anticipates that they will be executed by the end of the first quarter of 2010. As previously announced, the Federal Reserve’s purchases of $300 billion of Treasury securities will be completed by the end of October 2009. The committee will continue to evaluate the timing and overall amounts of its purchases of securities in light of the evolving economic outlook and conditions in financial markets. The Federal Reserve is monitoring the size and composition of its balance sheet and will make adjustments to its credit and liquidity programs as warranted.Voting for the F.O.M.C. monetary policy action were: Ben S.

376,,2009-09-24 00:00:00,"Wall Street got an initial lift on Wednesday from the Federal Reserve’s assessment that an economic recovery was under way, but the glow faded fast, dragging stocks to their second day of losses this week.
The Dow Jones industrial average briefly crossed 9,900 points after the Fed released its statement at 2:15 p.m., but then a spree of selling pulled the market into the red, The New York Times’s Jack Healy reported. Financial firms led the way lower, and oil producers and industrial stocks slid as commodity prices dipped.
While investors found few surprises in the Fed’s words, the statement still offered some support for the prevailing economic outlook.
“The Fed statement didn’t really change anything,” Nick Kalivas, vice president of financial research at MF Globa, told The Timesl. “They went out of their way not to rock the boat.”
The Dow Jones industrial average fell 81.32 points, or 0.8 percent, to close at 9,748.55. The broader Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index lost 10.79 points, or 1 percent, to end at 1,060.87, while the Nasdaq composite index slipped 14.88 points, or 0.7 percent, to 2,131.42.
With no striking revelations from the Fed, investors homed in on nagging questions about whether stocks had become too expensive. The price-to-earnings ratio of the S.& P. 500, a broad measure of how stocks are priced compared with corporate profits, rose to its highest point in a year this week, according to Bloomberg News data.
In a regular Wall Street ritual, investors and analysts scoured a statement from the Fed as its Open Market Committee concluded a two-day meeting, seeking the central bank’s views on the prospects for inflation, interest rates and other aspects of the economy.
“Economic activity has picked up following its severe downturn,” the Fed wrote in its statement. “Conditions in financial markets have improved further, and activity in the housing sector has increased.”
As expected, the Fed left its key short-term interest rate untouched at a record low of close to zero, and it announced it would extend its program to buy more than $1 trillion in mortgage-backed securities to March 31.
Investors do not expect the Fed to lift its overnight federal funds rate until next year, given the huge challenges facing the economy as it tries to climb out of a deep recession. Unemployment is heading toward 10 percent, factories are still running at well under full capacity and credit markets are still fragile.
The prices of inflation-resistant investments fell on Wednesday as the Fed said that rapidly rising prices were not a threat, predicting that inflation would remain “subdued” for a while. Crude oil fell $2.79 a barrel, to $68.97, on the New York Mercantile Exchange, and gold and copper prices also slipped.
But investors grabbed up Treasury notes after the Fed released its statement, heartened by expectations of low inflation.
Yields on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note had been higher for much of the day after an auction of five-year notes drew lackluster response, but yields dropped after the Fed’s announcement as investors speculated that lengthening out the mortgage-purchase program would help to keep interest rates low.
“The mortgage market is such a huge driver of rates,” George Goncalves, head of fixed-income strategy at Cantor Fitzgerald, told The Times. “You have another large investor that hasn’t gone away.”
But Fed officials said the economy was continuing to improve, albeit slowly, leaving open the question of how and when the bank would begin to withdraw its emergency financing programs.
The Federal Reserve is monitoring the size and composition of its balance sheet and will make adjustments to its credit and liquidity programs as warranted.
The Treasury’s 10-year note rose 7/32 , to 101 23/32. The yield fell to 3.42 percent, from 3.44 percent on Tuesday.

The Government's chief gauge for predicting the economy fell one-tenth of 1 percent in September, the third decline in the latest five months, the Commerce Department said today.Although most economists had been expecting a small rise in the index of leading indicators, they focused today mainly on the sawtooth pattern that has developed in the index since late spring. That, they said, along with other figures, was evidence that the economy has clearly begun to slow.''Some of the momentum has been left behind,'' said Robert A. Brusca, chief economist for Nikko Securities Company International, a Wall Street firm. ''I think the index is forecasting some further sluggishness.'' Growth Rate of 2.2 PercentLast week the department said the economy had expanded at a rate of 2.2 percent in the third quarter, somewhat below the average growth of the gross national product for the first half of the year even after allowing for a substantial loss of output from this summer's drought.

385,,1997-03-26 00:00:00,"Treasury prices turned lower yesterday after the Federal Reserve fulfilled investors' expectations and raised short-term interest rates.The central bank's monetary policy arm, the Federal Open Market Committee, raised its target on the Federal funds rate to 5.50 percent, from 5.25 percent. The rate, the interest rate banks charge each other for overnight loans, has not been adjusted since January 1996, when the Fed cut it a quarter-point amid concern that the economy was headed for a recession. The committee did not, however, adjust the discount rate, which is the rate the Fed charges its member banks for overnight loans.While the rise in the funds rate had largely been expected, the hawkish tone of the Fed's announcement had not. ''This action was taken in light of persisting strength in demand,'' the Fed's statement said, ''which is progressively increasing the risk of inflationary imbalances developing in the economy.''The comments ''suggest the Fed will not stop tightening until the economy shows signs of slowing,'' Carl Palash, chief economist at MCM Moneywatch in New York, said.

Indeed, concerns over the Fed's next move weighed down prices late yesterday.The price of the 30-year bond ended down 18/32, to 95 25/32.

386,,1997-03-26 00:00:00,"The Federal Reserve voted today to raise interest rates for the first time in more than two years, firing a warning shot at an inflationary threat that remained hidden over the horizon.The central bank took one of the smallest steps it could, nudging up the more important of the two short-term rates it controls -- the Federal funds target rate for overnight loans between banks -- by a quarter of a percentage point, to 5.5 percent. In doing so, it was trying to keep the economy from growing so fast that it generates wage and price pressures strong enough to threaten the nation's six-year economic expansion.Because banks tie their benchmark loan rates to the Federal funds rate, today's action will ripple through the economy, probably curbing investment and consumption somewhat by increasing the rates charged for many business and personal loans and for credit cards.The move was applauded as tempered but appropriate by a number of Wall Street and academic economists, many of whom say the current combination of strong growth and low unemployment will ultimately lead to a resurgence of inflation unless action is taken to slow the economy. They said the Federal Reserve was likely to keep trying to fine-tune the economy by raising rates at least once or twice more this year.

''What the Fed did today is about right,'' said Paul A. McCulley, an economist at UBS Securities.But with few signs that rising prices are actually infecting the economy, the move drew criticism from a significant minority of economists as well as from labor unions, business groups and politicians who say that economic statistics overstate the threats to steady growth and that such factors as global competition and fear of layoffs have permanently damped inflationary forces.

In a related action, the board of governors approved a 50- basis-point reduction in the discount rate, to 4 1/2 percent.Persistent pressures on profit margins are restraining investment spending and, through declines in equity wealth, consumption. The associated backup in inventories has induced a rapid response in manufacturing output and, with spending having firmed a bit since last year, inventory adjustment appears to be well under way.Although current developments do not appear to have materially diminished the prospects for long-term growth in productivity, excess productive capacity has emerged recently. The possibility that this excess could continue for some time and the potential for weakness in global economic conditions suggest substantial risks that demand and production could remain soft. In these circumstances, when the economic situation could be evolving rapidly, the Federal Reserve will need to monitor developments closely.The committee continues to believe that against the background of its long-run goals of price stability and sustainable economic growth and of the information currently available, the risks are weighted mainly toward conditions that may generate economic weakness in the foreseeable future.In taking the discount rate action, the Federal Reserve Board approved requests submitted by the boards of directors of all 12 reserve banks.

In a related action, the board of governors approved a 25 basis point increase in the discount rate, to 5 percent.Although cost pressures appear generally contained, risks to sustainable growth persist. Despite tentative evidence of a slowing in certain interest-sensitive sectors of the economy and of accelerating productivity, the expansion of activity continues in excess of the economy's growth potential.As a consequence, the pool of available workers willing to take jobs has been drawn down further in recent months, a trend that must eventually be contained if inflationary imbalances are to remain in check and economic expansion continue.Today's increase in the federal funds rate, together with the policy actions in June and August and the firming of conditions more generally in U.S. financial markets over the course of the year, should markedly diminish the risk of inflation going forward. As a consequence, the directive the Federal Open Market Committee adopted is symmetrical with regard to the outlook for policy over the near term.In taking the discount rate action, the Federal Reserve Board approved requests submitted by the boards of directors of the Federal Reserve Banks of Boston, Cleveland, Richmond and Kansas City.

Today's increase took back the last of three quarter-point reductions  made last year in response to the global financial crisis and returned the rate to its level 14 months ago.

Stock investors generally dislike interest rate increases because, in the broadest sense, they raise the cost of operating a business. Rising rates also make bonds more attractive than stocks as investments.So it was not too surprising that the Fed's rate increase rattled stocks after it was announced. A quick blip upward could not be sustained, and the Dow Jones industrials fell about 140 points on the news.Minutes later, stock traders got their bearings and roared with approval over the move. The white-hot Nasdaq composite index gained 73.51 points on the day, a 2.28 percent increase. The Dow Jones industrial average raced ahead 171.58 points, or 1.59 percent.

The investor euphoria after the Fed's action seemed to be based on two assumptions. Most compelling was the view that the Fed's move was the last rate increase for the foreseeable future. The next meeting of the Fed's Open Market Committee takes place on Dec. 21, an unlikely occasion for anyone except Ebenezer Scrooge to raise rates. The meeting after that, in early February, is expected to feature economic statistics distorted by Year 2000 anomalies. As a result, many economists have concluded that the Fed will not move again on rates until next spring regardless of what the economic numbers show.

The Federal Reserve ended a two-day strategy session on monetary policy today without announcing an increase in short-term interest rates or explaining its apparent inaction.Analysts took this to mean that the central bank, which had raised rates four times since early February, was satisfied with early signs that the economy is slowing enough to minimize the risk of resurgent inflation.It had been widely agreed that the Fed's assessment of the domestic economy would outweigh its interest in supporting the dollar in world currency markets, even though higher rates, by making the dollar more appealing, would tend to enhance foreign investment and minimize inflation from imports. Markets' ResponseThe financial markets responded fairly positively, though with no great enthusiasm, to the apparent outcome of the Fed meeting. The dollar rebounded from its morning declines, blue-chip stocks rallied and bond prices showed relatively little change.

Prices of Treasury securities dipped in quiet trading yesterday, as dealers took profits after the recent strong rally.The price slide began during overnight trading in Tokyo, where a rise in the value of the yen against the dollar led to a mild selloff. Later, announcements that industrial production fell by four-tenths of a percent in April and that car sales for the first 10 days of May were weak failed to stir any enthusiasm, even though they would be a disincentive for the Federal Reserve Board to raise interest rates.''The market feels a little tired, even though it continues to trade very well,'' one Government securities trader said. ''With the Fed on hold for another month at least, it looks to me like prices are at the high end of a very wide trading range that has been established over the last couple of weeks.''The Federal Reserve Board's policy-making Open Market Committee gathered yesterday in Washington, and as the trader suggested, analysts and market participants are virtually unanimous that the Fed will vote to leave monetary policy unchanged.

Prices of Treasury notes and bonds moved lower in thin, volatile trading yesterday, as dealers used movements in oil prices as their major indicator to buy or sell securities.A sharp run-up in oil prices early in the day sent out a clear sell signal, pushing bond prices down by more than a point. But oil later came down from its daily highs, and that helped erase most of the decline in bond prices.Comments from Tariq Aziz, Iraq's Foreign Minister, calling for a negotiated settlement to the crisis in the Persian Gulf also helped buttress prices, even though Mr. Aziz did not offer to withdraw Iraqi troops from Kuwait and restore its monarchy.Traders said that the drop in stock prices had little influence on activity in the credit markets.

400,,2004-08-11 00:00:00,"The Federal Reserve increased short-term interest rates on Tuesday by one-quarter of a percentage point, to 1.5 percent, and strongly implied that it would keep raising rates modestly but regularly in the months ahead.Analysts had almost uniformly expected the increase, the second such move since June 30.But the Fed, the nation's central bank, was tougher in a statement issued after the meeting than some had thought it would be, and this increased the prospects that policy makers would follow up with an additional rate rise at their next meeting in September, less than six weeks before the election.In the statement, the rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee acknowledged that economic growth and job creation had both slowed but said that the economy ''nevertheless appears poised to resume a stronger pace of expansion.''The Fed also reiterated statements pointing to a series of small rate increases that are widely expected to stretch over the next year or so. And it raised another benchmark interest rate, the discount rate on loans to big banks, also by a quarter-point, to 2.5 percent.

''We read it as pretty hawkish,'' said William C. Dudley, chief United States economist at Goldman, Sachs, the Wall Street investment bank. ''There was no hint here that the Fed is inclined to stop. They could have left open an escape hatch, but I don't see any escape hatch here.'' Continue reading the main story",Fed Increases Interest Rates Quarter-Point,2004-08-10,The New York Times
401,,2008-05-01 00:00:00,"Following is the full text of the statement released Wednesday by the Federal Reserve:The Federal Open Market Committee decided today to lower its target for the federal funds rate 25 basis points, to 2 percent.Recent information indicates that economic activity remains weak. Household and business spending has been subdued and labor markets have softened further. Financial markets remain under considerable stress, and tight credit conditions and the deepening housing contraction are likely to weigh on economic growth over the next few quarters.Although readings on core inflation have improved somewhat, energy and other commodity prices have increased and some indicators of inflation expectations have risen in recent months. The committee expects inflation to moderate in coming quarters, reflecting a projected leveling-out of energy and other commodity prices and an easing of pressures on resource utilization. Still, uncertainty about the inflation outlook remains high. It will be necessary to continue to monitor inflation developments carefully.The substantial easing of monetary policy to date, combined with ongoing measures to foster market liquidity, should help to promote moderate growth over time and to mitigate the risks to economic activity. The committee will continue to monitor economic and financial developments and will act as needed to promote sustainable economic growth and price stability.Voting for the F.O.M.C. monetary policy action were: Ben S. Bernanke, chairman; Timothy F. Geithner, vice chairman; Donald L. Kohn; Randall S. Kroszner; Frederic S. Mishkin; Sandra Pianalto; Gary H. Stern; and Kevin M. Warsh. Voting against were Richard W. Fisher and Charles I. Plosser, who preferred no change in the target for the federal funds rate at this meeting.In a related action, the board of governors unanimously approved a 25-basis-point decrease in the discount rate to 2.25 percent. In taking this action, the board approved the requests submitted by the boards of directors of the Federal Reserve Banks of New York, Cleveland, Atlanta and San Francisco.

402,,2008-05-01 00:00:00,"WASHINGTON — The U.S. Federal Reserve's decision to reduce short-term interest rates this week came with a repetition of the discord that has accompanied some of its previous rate cuts.The Fed, mixing concern about the feeble U.S. economy with worries about rising inflation, reduced short-term interest rates Wednesday for the seventh time since September, while signaling a pause for now in any further rate cuts.The action lowered the federal funds rate - the rate it charges banks for overnight loans - to 2 percent, from 2.25 percent, the least since November 2004. The Fed defended that step as necessary to counter the ailing U.S. housing sector and the ""considerable stress"" shadowing financial markets.But two regional Fed bank presidents on the policy-setting committee again dissented from the decision to reduce  rates. They and many other economists have called on the Fed to shift its focus from countering a possible recession to heading off inflation spurred by the increasing costs of food and energy.

WASHINGTON — The Federal Reserve, mixing concern about the feeble economy with worries about rising inflation, reduced short-term interest rates Wednesday for the seventh time  since September, while signaling a pause in any additional rate cuts for now.The Fed’s action brought the federal funds rate — the rate at which banks lend to each other —  to 2 percent, from 2.25 percent, the lowest level since November 2004. It defended that step as necessary to counter the ailing housing sector and the “considerable stress” shadowing financial markets.The move followed new indications that the economy remained fragile at best. The Commerce Department reported early Wednesday that the economy expanded only 0.6 percent on an annualized basis in the first three months of 2008, short of an overall downturn but still far from healthy.The Dow Jones industrial average, which was trading up 178 points shortly after the Fed’s announcement, dropped sharply in late trading, ending down 11.81 points at 12,820.13.

404,,2000-02-03 00:00:00,"Following is the text of the statement by the Federal Open Market Committee, the Federal Reserve's monetary policy panel, after its decision yesterday to raise short-term interest rates:The Federal Open Market Committee voted today to raise its target for the federal funds rate by 25 basis points, to 5 3/4 percent. In a related action, the  board of governors approved a 25-basis-point increase in the discount rate, to 5 1/4 percent.The committee remains concerned that over time increases in demand will continue to exceed the growth in potential supply, even after taking account of the pronounced rise in productivity growth. Such trends could foster inflationary imbalances that would undermine the economy's record economic expansion.Against the background of its long-run goals of price stability and sustainable economic growth and of the information currently available, the committee believes the risks are weighted mainly toward conditions that may generate heightened inflation pressures in the foreseeable future.In taking the discount rate action, the Federal Reserve Board approved requests submitted by the boards of directors of the Federal Reserve Banks of Boston, New York, Philadelphia, Cleveland, Richmond, Atlanta, Chicago, St. Louis, Kansas City and San Francisco. The discount rate is the rate charged depository institutions when they borrow short-term adjustment credit from their district Federal Reserve Banks.

With the economy apparently recovering from a stumble in the spring, the Federal Reserve's top policy committee chose today to leave short-term rates unchanged.The decision to do nothing had been widely expected, given a recent string of strong economic indicators that suggested little need for the Fed to stimulate the economy right now. But the decision was nonetheless important as an indication that the central bank planned to move slowly on lowering rates even in the face of an equally striking set of indicators showing inflation was under control.The Federal Reserve's decision had little effect on the stock and bond markets.The group that met today, the Federal Open Market Committee, had voted on July 6 to cut interest rates for the first time since 1992. In the weeks before that meeting, the economy had seemed in worse shape, and the Fed's chairman, Alan Greenspan, had talked about the possibility of a recession.Nevertheless, the panel chose to make the smallest possible reduction in short-term interest rates, and justified the move not in terms of the need for stimulus but on the grounds that ""inflationary pressures have receded enough.""

Wall Street endured a typically dull late-August session yesterday, showing little response to the Federal Reserve Board's decision not to act on interest rates.Trading volume was sluggish and there were relatively small changes on the plus side in the major market averages.After a follow-through of Monday's selling early in the day, the stock market leveled off until the last hour of trading. At that point, buyers entered the market and many stocks pulled out of minus territory.""The market spent a lot of time waiting for the Federal Open Market Committee meeting and then nothing happened,"" said Robert H. Stovall, president of Stovall/21st Advisers, referring to the meeting by the Federal Reserve's policy-making arm. ""Once the announcement came out, the uncertainty was removed and the market began to pay attention to earnings and dividends and momentum.""

Prices of Treasury securities slipped yesterday, as the Federal Reserve left short-term interest rates unchanged at its monetary policy meeting and the Treasury sold two-year notes in a successful auction.The 30-year bond slipped 8/32 of a percentage point, to a price of 99 28/32; its yield, which moves in the opposite direction from its price, was 6.89 percent, compared with 6.87 percent on Monday.The only data out, a weekly retail sales report by Johnson Redbook, showed a drop of 1.1 percent for sales so far this month, compared with the previous one-month period, little changed from last week's reading of a 1 percent decline. Analysts said this was consistent with recent reports of disappointing back-to-school retail activity, but since the market was already aware of the trend, the report had little market impact. What it did do was raise hopes for another easing by the Fed later this year.Supply concerns also weighed on the market, particularly so soon after the quarterly refunding earlier this month. But after the recent flurry of dollar-buying interventions by central banks, market expectations were that there could be demand for Treasury securities to make use of the dollars purchased by the central banks. And traders thought that the two-year note would be a decent vehicle to be considered.

Yesterday's sale of $17.25 billion in two-year notes saw the high yield taken at 6.09 percent, lower than analysts' expectations of a 6.10 percent yield, but higher than last month's yield of 5.955 percent. There was the customary drop in prices just ahead of the auction as some dealers sold off in hopes of lowering prices enough to make the two-year issue that much more attractive.

The committee, accordingly, continues to see a risk of heightened inflation pressures. However, softening in business and household demand and tightening conditions in financial markets over recent months suggest that the economy could expand for a time at a pace below the productivity-enhanced rate of growth of its potential to produce.Nonetheless, to date the easing of demand pressures has not been sufficient to warrant a change in the committee's judgment that against the background of its long-run goals of price stability and sustainable economic growth and of the information currently available, the risks continue to be weighted mainly toward conditions that may generate heightened inflation pressures in the foreseeable future.

409,,2000-11-16 00:00:00,"Citing clear evidence that the economy has shifted into a lower gear, the Federal Reserve voted today to hold interest rates steady, but with unemployment low and energy prices high the central bank said it was not yet ready to proclaim that inflation was no longer a threat.The Fed's policy-setting Federal Open Market Committee did not allude to the uncertainty over the outcome of the presidential election or to the recent uncertainty in the stock market, but instead projected a business-as-usual tone in a statement that stressed the gradual cooling of the economy. The statement said economic growth appeared to have slowed to a rate below what most economists consider its noninflationary speed limit of about 4 percent a year.The Fed imposed six rate increases, totaling 1.75 percentage points, between June 1999 and May of this year, in an effort to bring economic growth into a range that would diminish inflation pressures.But the committee stressed that it still saw ''a risk of heightened inflation pressures'' stemming from the low rate of joblessness -- 3.9 percent in October -- and the rise earlier this year in oil prices.

411,,2003-08-13 00:00:00,"Following is the text of a statement released by the Federal Reserve yesterday after the Fed's monetary policy panel, the Federal Open Market Committee, decided to leave interest rates unchanged:The Federal Open Market Committee decided today to keep its target for the federal funds rate at 1 percent.The committee continues to believe that an accommodative stance of monetary policy, coupled with still-robust underlying growth in productivity, is providing important ongoing support to economic activity. The evidence accumulated over the intermeeting period shows that spending is firming, although labor market indicators are mixed. Business pricing power and increases in core consumer prices remain muted.The committee perceives that the upside and downside risks to the attainment of sustainable growth for the next few quarters are roughly equal. In contrast, the probability, though minor, of an unwelcome fall in inflation exceeds that of a rise in inflation from its already low level. The committee judges that on balance the risk of inflation becoming undesirably low is likely to be the predominant concern for the foreseeable future. In these circumstances, the committee believes that policy accommodation can be maintained for a considerable period.Voting for the F.O.M.C. monetary policy action were: Alan Greenspan, chairman; Ben S. Bernanke; Susan S. Bies; J. Alfred Broaddus Jr.; Roger W. Ferguson Jr.; Edward M. Gramlich; Jack Guynn; Donald L. Kohn; Michael H. Moskow; Mark W. Olson; Robert T. Parry; and Jamie B. Stewart Jr.

412,,2003-08-13 00:00:00,"The Federal Reserve left its overnight interest rate unchanged at 1 percent today, but it cheered financial markets by strongly suggesting that it would not raise interest rates until at least some time next year.Today's decision -- almost universally anticipated by analysts and investors -- leaves short-term rates at their lowest levels since the 1950's.But the Fed also gave investors a big clue about its plans for the months ahead and that clue came as a pleasant surprise to the markets.In its statement accompanying today's decision, the policy-setting Federal Open Market Committee repeated almost verbatim its previous assessment of the economy. It added a new sentence, however, on top of its familiar formulations, declaring that ''the committee believes that policy accommodation can be maintained for a considerable period.''

413,,2003-08-13 00:00:00,"While Federal Reserve policy makers were not very upbeat about the outlook for the economy yesterday, their statement that they would keep their benchmark interest rate low for a long time could help start the stock market moving again.The three main stock gauges have been locked in a trading range this summer. The Dow Jones industrial average and the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index are still below the highs they reached on June 17. The Nasdaq composite index is still below where it was on July 14. Many economists expected the long decline in jobs to turn the corner in July. Instead, they were surprised by another loss.And the tone of the Fed's statement was not so rosy. It said that the upside and downside risks to the economy were still ''roughly equal'' and that ''on balance'' the threat of deflation, though minor, was greater than inflation in the foreseeable future.But some analysts argue that the Fed's interest rate commitment should restrain the increase in longer-term rates, giving the weak recovery time to gain strength. With this limit on rate increases, investors are also more likely to believe that the recent rebound in corporate profits, a significant driver of share prices, can continue, setting the stage for a stock market rally.

Corporate profits, as included in the gross domestic product, have been rising the last five quarters, from the quarter in which the National Bureau of Economic Research said the most recent recession ended. Economists forecast that such profits also rose in the second quarter and should climb even higher in the current one.

Output appears to be growing at a moderate pace despite the rise in energy prices, and labor market conditions have improved. Inflation and longer-term inflation expectations remain well contained.The committee perceives the upside and downside risks to the attainment of both sustainable growth and price stability for the next few quarters to be roughly equal. With underlying inflation expected to be relatively low, the committee believes that policy accommodation can be removed at a pace that is likely to be measured.Nonetheless, the committee will respond to changes in economic prospects as needed to fulfill its obligation to maintain price stability.Voting for the F.O.M.C. monetary policy action were: Alan Greenspan, chairman; Timothy F. Geithner, vice chairman; Ben S. Bernanke; Susan S. Bies; Roger W. Ferguson Jr.; Edward M. Gramlich; Thomas M. Hoenig; Donald L. Kohn; Cathy E. Minehan; Mark W. Olson; Sandra Pianalto; and William Poole.In a related action, the board of governors unanimously approved a 25-basis-point increase in the discount rate, to 3 percent.

415,,2004-11-11 00:00:00,"WASHINGTON, Nov. 10 - The Federal Reserve raised short-term interest rates on Wednesday for the fourth time this year, and suggested that it would continue to raise them gradually through much of next year.The policy-setting Federal Open Market Committee raised the federal funds rate on overnight loans between banks by a quarter point, to 2 percent, a move that was widely expected.Saying that monetary policy is still ""accommodative,"" the central bank repeated its assertion of the last several months that it would continue to raise short-term rates at a ""measured pace"" from their historic lows earlier this year. The stock market had little reaction, with the three main gauges trading slightly lower. Bond prices fell on the possibility of further rate increases.""Output appears to be growing at a moderate pace despite the rise in energy prices,"" the Fed said in a statement announcing its decision.

416,,2000-03-22 00:00:00,"Following is the text of the statement by the Federal Open Market Committee, the Federal Reserve's monetary policy panel, after its decision yesterday to raise short-term interest rates:The Federal Open Market Committee voted today to raise its target for the federal funds rate by 25 basis points, to 6 percent. In a related action, the board of governors approved a 25 basis point increase in the discount rate to 5 1/2 percent.Economic conditions and considerations addressed by the committee are essentially the same as when the committee met in February. The committee remains concerned that increases in demand will continue to exceed the growth in potential supply, which could foster inflationary imbalances that would undermine the economy's record economic expansion.Against the background of its long-run goals of price stability and sustainable economic growth and of the information currently available, the committee believes the risks are weighted mainly toward conditions that may generate heightened inflation pressures in the foreseeable future.In taking the discount rate action, the Federal Reserve Board approved requests submitted by the boards of directors of the Federal Reserve Banks of Boston, New York, Philadelphia, Cleveland, Richmond, Atlanta, Chicago, St. Louis, Minneapolis, Kansas City and San Francisco. The discount rate is the rate charged depository institutions when they borrow short-term adjustment credit from their district Federal Reserve Banks.

417,,2000-03-22 00:00:00,"The Federal Reserve clamped down a bit more on the economy today, raising interest rates a quarter percentage point in an effort to prevent an outbreak of inflation.The move was no surprise to economists and investors, who had heard repeated hints the last month from Alan Greenspan, the central bank's chairman, that he intended to stick to his policy of raising rates in small, steady steps until he saw signs that the supercharged economy was throttling back.The stock market, which some analysts consider Mr. Greenspan's main target in raising rates, shrugged off the news and moved higher after the Fed's announcement this afternoon. Apparently relieved that the central bank did not raise rates a half-point, the Dow Jones industrial average gained 227.10 points, to 10,907.34. The Nasdaq composite index closed at 4,711.68, up 101.68 points.It was the Fed's fifth quarter-point rate increase since June, and it lifted the benchmark federal funds target rate on overnight loans between banks to 6 percent, its highest level in almost five years.

However, both the upward impetus from the swing in inventory investment and the growth in final demand appear to have moderated. The committee expects the rate of increase of final demand to pick up over coming quarters, supported in part by robust underlying growth in productivity, but the degree of the strengthening remains uncertain.In these circumstances, although the stance of monetary policy is currently accommodative, the committee believes that for the foreseeable future, against the background of its long-run goals of price stability and sustainable economic growth and of the information currently available, the risks are balanced with respect to the prospects for both goals.Voting for the F.O.M.C. monetary policy action were: Alan Greenspan, chairman; William J.

And it concluded that the risks remained evenly balanced for now between an economic rebound and a slowdown that could lead to another recession or a broad-based decline in prices.In its statement, the Fed did not mention the stock market's dive, the dollar's weakness or the corporate malfeasance that has undermined confidence among investors in the United States and around the world.

Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady said today that no taxpayer bailout of the nation's banks would be necessary if Congress approved the Administration's proposed banking legislation and if the economy avoided a complete collapse.In an interview in his office, Mr. Brady gave an upbeat appraisal of economic prospects, but he suggested that the Federal Reserve could prolong the recession if it became ""preoccupied with inflation"" and kept interest rates too high.Over the course of an hour, Mr. Brady addressed these other topics:*The Resolution Trust Corporation, the agency overseeing the savings and loan bailout, will not be able to go out of business by the summer of 1992 as the law requires, and new legislation will be needed to allow the agency to continue to take over failed institutions after that.*The United States should not help rebuild Iraq, as it did Germany and Japan after World War II, as long as Saddam Hussein is in power.

421,,2008-12-17 00:00:00,"From Palm Beach to Wall Street, Bernard L. Madoff’s wealth and reputation permeated high society.  
The man allegedly behind a $50 billion Ponzi scheme also had a considerable presence in Washington, contributing hundreds of thousands of dollars to politicians and lobbying firms.
The Center for Responsive Politics has found that Mr. Madoff and his wife, Ruth, have given $238,200 to federal candidates, parties and committees since 1991, with Democrats getting 88 percent of that. “Madoff made a fortune, and he played politics with some of that money,” the nonpartisan interest group said on its Web site, OpenSecrets.org. 
Mr. Madoff gave extensively to some of his favorite politicians, including Charles E. Schumer, the Democratic Senator from New York; and Ron Wyden, the Democratic Senator from Oregon. Both lawmakers are members of the powerful Senate Finance Commmitee.
Overall, Mr. Madoff and other individuals at his company, Bernard L. Madoff Investment Securities, gave $372,100 in campaign contributions since 1991, with 89 percent to Democrats.
But that’s not all: The firm also spent $590,000 on lobbying in the last 11 years, all but $10,000 of it with the lobbying firm of Lent, Scrivner & Roth.
DealBook took a look at the lobbying records, which showed that Mr. Madoff had his K-Street crew lobby the Securities and Exchange Commission and members of both houses of Congress. 
The lobbying issues included public ownership of equity markets, securities transaction fees and stock exchange mergers — topics that appear to relate to his firm’s market-making business, which is separate from its asset-management unit. (He also paid to lobby the National Park Service in relation to funding for the Lower East Side Tenement Museum in New York City.)
The latest filing shows that Mr. Madoff’s lobbying interests include market regulation, and specifically, the consolidation of certain regulatory functions.
It is not clear what Mr. Madoff’s position was on the topic. But any attempt by Mr. Madoff to shape the future of financial regulation could raise eyebrows now that the S.E.C. is under fire for failing to identify and shut down Mr. Madoff’s alleged fraud.

422,,2008-12-17 00:00:00,"TYSONS CORNER, Va. —  This intersection in Fairfax County is a mecca for shoppers: it is the Washington region’s largest retail center, with 5.9 million square feet of shopping, and it includes the country’s 10th-largest mall. It is also due for a major makeover — after the sinking economy rebounds.In October, the Fairfax County Board of Supervisors accepted the recommendations of a 36-member task force that had labored for three years on a plan to turn this traffic-clogged maze of malls and office parks into an urban center that has more housing and is less dependent on cars. This month, the supervisors said they would move quickly in 2009 to pass regulations allowing for greater density, consistent with the long-range plan for Tysons.The plan has been widely applauded as a forward-thinking blueprint to convert this “edge city,” 13 miles from downtown Washington, into the epitome of “smart growth” by 2050. The area is ultimately envisioned as having high-rise apartments adjoining four new rail transit stations built along an extension of the Metro system, shuttle buses, a pedestrian-friendly street grid, urban parks and outdoor plazas.The plan aims to be a guideline to be followed over decades, which is fortunate, because it was being completed just as the economy took a sharp downturn.

But it is not clear how soon this will happen. “Our plans are really tied to market demands,” said John E. Harrison, the vice president for development at Tysons.

The long end of the Treasury market rallied yesterday after the Federal Reserve announced its sixth and largest interest rate increase of the year, easing traders' fears of inflation.By late in the day, the 30-year bond was up 8/32 , to a price of 9327/32 , for a yield of 8.05 percent, down from 8.07 percent on Monday. Despite the rise in the long end of the Treasury market, prices in shorter maturities were mixed.The central bank raised short-term rates three-quarters of a percent, a quarter-point more than many had predicted. Expectations were running high as the Federal Open Market Committee met to determine monetary policy for the months ahead.While investors and dealers were expecting a rise of at least 50 basis points in the discount and Federal funds rates, they were hoping for something a little more aggressive -- and got it. The Fed lifted the discount rate that it charges banks for loans to 4.75 percent and the Federal funds rate that banks charge each other for money, usually overnight, to 5.5 percent.

Determined to prevent strong economic growth from feeding inflation, the Federal Reserve raised short-term interest rates today by the largest amount since 1981 and left open the possibility of further increases. Banks followed by raising the rates they charge for loans.The increases are likely to show up immediately in the rates charged millions of Americans on everything from home equity loans to credit cards to small-business loans. Already, interest rates on 30-year mortgages that were available at slightly more than 7 percent at the start of the year have risen to 9.05 percent.While rising rates are intended to slow economic growth, the Federal Reserve's five previous increases, which began in February, have had mixed results. Some industries, like auto making, that depend on customers who need loans have had robust sales, while others, like home building, have begun to slow. Critics of the Federal Reserve say that interest rate changes take up to 18 months to show results and that the previous increases may yet do so.The central bank today raised by three-quarters of a percentage point each of two short-term interest rates that it controls. Stocks, bonds and the dollar bounced up and down in value following the Federal Reserve's action but closed with little change.

The decision by the Federal Reserve came five hours after it reported that American factories operated at 84.9 percent of capacity in October, the highest level in nearly 15 years. When factories are working at top speed, production bottlenecks often occur and can lead to inflation as companies bid up the prices of scarce materials and skilled workers.

WASHINGTON, Sept. 18 — The Federal Reserve rolled out its most powerful interest rate weapon on Tuesday in a bid to stop the turmoil in housing and financial markets from bringing down the overall economy.But even as stock markets soared in a thunderous rally, the Fed carefully stopped short of implying any commitment to reduce rates even more in the months ahead. Indeed, policy makers cautioned that they still have lingering worries about inflation  — a concern that would weigh against stimulating the economy further with cheaper money.In reducing its benchmark interest rate by an unusually large one-half percentage point, to 4.75 percent from 5.25 percent, the central bank made it clear that policy makers viewed the turbulence and disruptions of the past couple of months as too dangerous to ignore.The reaction in stock markets was ecstatic: the Dow Jones industrial average jumped 200 points almost instantly and ended the day up 335 points, or 2.51 percent, at 13,739.39.

But domestic financial markets have recovered and foreign economic prospects have improved since the easing of monetary policy last fall.Against the background of already-tight domestic labor markets and ongoing strength in demand in excess of productivity gains, the committee recognizes the need to be alert to developments over coming months that might indicate that financial conditions may no longer be consistent with containing inflation.

Instead, it said it was now leaning toward imposing higher rates.The shift was subtle, but it signaled a clear change in the Federal Reserve's outlook from last fall, when it made three reductions in interest rates in response to the global financial crisis.In a statement, the Fed said it was ''concerned about the potential for a buildup of inflationary imbalances that could undermine the favorable performance of the economy.''

Investors and economists, who considered the odds of such a shift to be roughly 50-50, were well prepared for the announcement, which came just after 2:15 P.M. It rattled Wall Street, but only briefly. Stocks, which had been up modestly, turned down  before recovering most of their losses. Bond prices fell, and the dollar dipped slightly.

431,,1999-05-19 00:00:00,"The Federal Reserve's decision yesterday to leave interest rates unchanged but to warn that it was thinking of raising them in the future reaffirms how unsure the policy makers are about the state of the economy.The Fed cut rates three times late last year when it believed that the financial panic following the Russian default would slow American growth  and might bring on a world recession. In retrospect the Fed seems to have overreacted, although the  cuts appeared prudent at the time. Now, with the United States' economy growing far more rapidly than expected, a world recession seemingly unlikely and with some signs of a rebirth of inflation, a modest increase in rates could easily be justified.That the Fed did not dictate such an increase, but instead announced a ''bias'' in favor of raising rates in the future, probably reflects a continued argument within the Fed's open market committee about the extent to which inflation is a threat. Some believe that thanks to increases in productivity brought on by computers, the economy is now able to grow much faster than in the past without any appreciable threat of inflation. But it is also possible that inflation has been held down by overseas weakness that is now reversing. The Fed should be vigilant about inflation, and may rightly conclude next month that a rate increase is wise.

432,,1999-05-19 00:00:00,"Stock prices closed slightly lower yesterday but well above their lows of the session, as traders and investors reacted with relative equanimity to the decision by the Federal Reserve Board to adopt a more hawkish stance on interest rates.Given the continued strength in the domestic economy and signs that inflation may be on the rise, the announcement that the Federal Open Market Committee had adopted a tightening bias toward monetary policy did not shock financial markets.Still, the Dow Jones industrial average, which had been up as much as 77 points during the morning, sharply reversed course after the Fed's announcement, tumbling almost 150 points. But the blue-chip average subsequently regained much of that loss and closed at 10,836.95, a drop of 16.52 points.Elsewhere in the stock market, declines in oil stocks and regional telephone companies helped push the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index down 6.17 points, or half a percent, to 1,333.32. The Nasdaq composite index fell 3.48 points, to 2,558.36. But the Russell 2000 index of small-company stocks rose 1.10, or 0.25 percent, to 442.45.

433,,1999-05-19 00:00:00,"PROPELLED in part by increased alcohol sales on the Internet, intensive campaigns to restrict wine distribution further are afoot in state legislatures and in Washington.The proposed regulations would make it much harder for producers of scarce or unevenly distributed wines to ship directly to consumers, and for retailers to ship across state lines. Order those alluring bottles of Rochioli pinot noir or Screaming Eagle cabernet sauvignon you see on the Web, and you could wind up with a felony charge -- if you live in the wrong state and if anyone can figure out how to enforce the new legislation.It could be that the campaigns, financed mostly by wholesalers who fear the loss of business, will fizzle out. But they could succeed, and some fear that if they do, the choice of wines will be severely constricted for almost all wine drinkers.Michael Aaron, chairman of Sherry-Lehmann in Manhattan, one of the country's largest wine retailers, argues that attempts to tighten the rules for shipments across state lines will lead to the disruption of shipments within states, even package store deliveries.

But the Fed's warning about its possible next move -- in the form of a formal tilt toward a tighter monetary policy -- nonetheless jolted Wall Street and suggested that financial markets would remain jittery in coming weeks in anticipation of new data about the momentum of the economy.The Dow Jones industrial average, which had been up over 100 points just before the Fed's announcement, plummeted immediately and was down around 125 points before rebounding. It closed at 10,400.59, down 0.64 point on the day. Bond prices tumbled, sending longer-term interest rates higher.In holding rates steady for now but putting investors on notice that a rate increase could be in the offing, the Fed was trying to strike a policy balance that acknowledged both the warning signals of inflation being generated by the robust economy and the almost total lack of actual inflation outside of surging oil prices.

435,,1999-10-06 00:00:00,"American central bankers left interest rates unchanged on Tuesday, saying that even though a dwindling pool of workers meant inflationary pressures remained in the wings, U.S. prices were sufficiently stable to make a move unnecessary.But the policymakers of the Federal Reserve Board's Open Market Committee announced they were biased toward raising rates in the future. If the increasingly tight labor market pushes wages higher and forces companies to raise prices for their goods and services, the inflation rate could rise, they warned.The tightening bias suggests the panel could opt to raise its target on federal funds, the overnight interbank loan rate, at its next meeting, scheduled for Nov. 16, but the central bank has said it would make as much credit available as necessary late in the year to quell fears surrounding the Year 2000 computer problem.Markets reacted negatively.

yield on the 30-year issue to 6.15 percent from 6.09 late Monday.Harvinder Kalirai, senior economist at the IDEAglobal.com economics consultancy, said he thought the Fed should be pushing rates higher. The economy is expanding at roughly a 4 percent annual rate, and this is about 1 percentage point faster than it can stand without igniting inflation, he said. Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve Board chairman, has suggested that, with productivity rising at about 2 percent a year and the population growing by 1 percent, a 3 percent growth rate is the natural pace for the economy.Some economists say productivity is growing faster than measured by traditional indicators, which do not take into account changes in the composition of the economy. Mr. Kalirai noted, however, that the U.S. unemployment rate has dropped to 4.2 percent from more than 7 percent earlier this decade, and he said the declining level is mathematical proof that productivity does not account for all the economic growth.

However, labor markets have softened further and financial markets remain under considerable stress. Tight credit conditions, the ongoing housing contraction and elevated energy prices are likely to weigh on economic growth over the next few quarters. Over time, the substantial easing of monetary policy, combined with ongoing measures to foster market liquidity, should help to promote moderate economic growth.Inflation has been high, spurred by the earlier increases in the prices of energy and some other commodities, and some indicators of inflation expectations have been elevated. The committee expects inflation to moderate later this year and next year, but the inflation outlook remains highly uncertain.Although downside risks to growth remain, the upside risks to inflation are also of significant concern to the committee. The committee will continue to monitor economic and financial developments and will act as needed to promote sustainable economic growth and price stability.Voting for the F.O.M.C. monetary policy action were Ben S. Bernanke, chairman; Timothy F. Geithner, vice chairman; Elizabeth A. Duke; Donald L. Kohn; Randall S. Kroszner; Frederic S. Mishkin; Sandra Pianalto; Charles I. Plosser; Gary H. Stern; and Kevin M.

Faced with a revolt in his party's Congressional ranks and wariness around the country, President Bush appealed on television tonight for public support of the budget compromise he and Congressional leaders struck last weekend. He predicted ''economic chaos if we fail to reduce the deficit.''In a show of bipartisanship that verged on coalition Government, the President was followed with a broadcast by Senator George J. Mitchell of Maine, the Democratic leader. He urged support for the President ''because the nation is more important than partisan differences.'' [Transcripts of the Bush and Mitchell speeches appear on page D28.]  Mr. Mitchell was preaching to the converted for the most part. Despite considerable opposition among liberals, a majority of Congressional Democrats appear to support the agreement.Tough Task for BushBut Mr. Bush has the more difficult task of swaying enough dissident Republicans to win enactment of the plan.The President said that neither he nor anyone else was completely satisfied with the compromise, but he said it was ''the best agreement that can be legislated now.''

Elevated energy prices and hurricane-related disruptions in economic activity have temporarily depressed output and employment. However, monetary policy accommodation, coupled with robust underlying growth in productivity, is providing ongoing support to economic activity that will likely be augmented by planned rebuilding in the hurricane-affected areas. The cumulative rise in energy and other costs has the potential to add to inflation pressures; however, core inflation has been relatively low in recent months and longer-term inflation expectations remain contained.The committee perceives that with appropriate monetary policy action, the upside and downside risks to the attainment of both sustainable growth and price stability should be kept roughly equal. With underlying inflation expected to be contained, the committee believes that policy accommodation can be removed at a pace that is likely to be measured. Nonetheless, the committee will respond to changes in economic prospects as needed to fulfill its obligation to maintain price stability.Voting for the F.O.M.C. monetary policy action were: Alan Greenspan, chairman; Timothy F. Geithner, vice chairman; Susan S. Bies; Roger W. Ferguson Jr.; Richard W. Fisher; Donald L. Kohn; Michael H. Moskow; Mark W. Olson; Anthony M. Santomero; and Gary H.

Immediately after the rate cut of half a percentage point, stocks rallied then fell, and then reversed course again and climbed higher, as positive interpretations of the Fed rate cut won out, for now.At the close, the Dow Jones industrial average was up 92.74 points, or 1.1 percent, to 8,771.01. After the Fed announcement, the Dow made a 209-point swing, down to 8,590.19 and up to 8,800. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index climbed 8.37 points, or 0.9 percent, to close at 923.76. The Nasdaq composite index rose 17.82 points, or 1.3 percent, to 1,418.99.Despite a four-week rally and the Fed rate cut, all three gauges are still below the peaks they reached during the summer rally, which ended in late August as the overall market plunged to a five-and-a-half-year low in the second week of October.

Drug companies were among the stocks leading the market higher yesterday. Analysts said that with Republicans in control of Congress, price caps in a prescription drug bill were less likely. Merck rose $1.80, or 3.3 percent, to $56. Military contractors, who could benefit from a war in Iraq, also rose. Boeing was up $2.06, or 6.5 percent, to $33.58.

445,,2002-11-07 00:00:00,"The Federal Reserve cut its main interest rate today by half a percentage point, an aggressive move to ward off renewed economic weakness at a time when threats of terrorism and an impending confrontation with Iraq are weighing down business and consumer confidence.As the political parties in Washington digested the economic policy implications of Tuesday's Republican victory in the midterm election, the Fed put aside internal differences over the need for further rate cuts and voted unanimously for the half-point reduction. The step was intended to stimulate business investment and consumer spending by lowering borrowing costs.But the Fed also hinted that it does not plan to cut rates again when it next meets in five weeks, reflecting a view at the central bank that rates are now low enough and that it is in any case running out of room to reduce them much further.Economists said the United States would now have to rely increasingly on stimulative fiscal policy -- some combination of tax cuts and increased government spending -- to give the economy a boost if it does not bounce back soon.

He listed the association's top goals as expanded tax cuts, a new law governing terrorism insurance, a prescription drug policy for the elderly and a resolution of asbestos-related lawsuits that have hurt the stock prices of manufacturers and prompted numerous companies to seek protection in bankruptcy court.Other business leaders and executives, when asked what they most hoped the new Republican majorities in both House and Senate would be able to accomplish for American business, cited the swift passage of terrorism insurance rules, a lessening of environmental regulations and a bankruptcy law that will make it more difficult for people to escape their debts.Many also foresaw a more receptive climate for new limits on medical malpractice lawsuits and punitive damages awards. Lester Brickman, a professor at the Benjamin N. Cardozo Law School, recalled that President Bush gained popularity in Texas as ""a direct outcome of the largely successful tort reform efforts,"" and would be emboldened by the Republican victories.

447,,2002-11-07 00:00:00,"The resignation of Harvey L. Pitt from the Securities and Exchange Commission will set back by months the efforts of the agency to clean up Wall Street, provide vigorous oversight of the accounting profession and impose tougher regulations on company directors, government officials and corporate law experts said today.Even before Mr. Pitt's announcement on Tuesday evening that he would step down as the commission's chairman, the agency faced difficult challenges. It has suffered huge morale problems and high turnover among its more experienced staff, whose pay was lower than that of officials from other federal agencies. And although its mission was enlarged substantially this summer when Congress adopted the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, authorizing a 77 percent increase in its budget, the financing has remained in doubt because the White House has wavered over its commitment for such a large increase.Moreover, Mr. Pitt's choice to head the new accounting oversight board, William H. Webster, has said he is reconsidering whether to head that board in light of the disclosure that he headed the audit committee of a virtually insolvent company facing accusations of fraud. Should Mr. Webster step down, as some top officials today predicted, the vacancy would not be filled until after the commission gets a new permanent chairman, a process that will take months.''The agenda of the Securities and Exchange Commission is in shambles right now,'' said Donald C. Langevoort of Georgetown University, a former commission official who is an authority on securities and corporate law. ''Simply responding to the demands of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the corporate scandals was a massive management task. Now the commission has to go through a new search for leadership, and the accounting board probably will, too. This has to be a great setback.''

449,,2004-12-15 00:00:00,"Following is the text of a statement released by the Federal Reserve yesterday after the Fed's monetary policy panel, the Federal Open Market Committee, decided to raise its benchmark interest rates a quarter point:The Federal Open Market Committee decided today to raise its target for the federal funds rate by 25 basis points, to 2.25 percent.The committee believes that, even after this action, the stance of monetary policy remains accommodative and, coupled with robust underlying growth in productivity, is providing ongoing support to economic activity. Output appears to be growing at a moderate pace despite the earlier rise in energy prices, and labor market conditions continue to improve gradually. Inflation and longer-term inflation expectations remain well contained.The committee perceives the upside and downside risks to the attainment of both sustainable growth and price stability for the next few quarters to be roughly equal. With underlying inflation expected to be relatively low, the committee believes that policy accommodation can be removed at a pace that is likely to be measured. Nonetheless, the committee will respond to changes in economic prospects as needed to fulfill its obligation to maintain price stability.Voting for the F.O.M.C. monetary policy action were: Alan Greenspan, chairman; Timothy F. Geithner, vice chairman; Ben S. Bernanke; Susan S. Bies; Roger W. Ferguson Jr.; Edward M. Gramlich; Thomas M. Hoenig; Donald L. Kohn; Cathy E. Minehan; Mark W. Olson; Sandra Pianalto; and William Poole.In a related action, the board of governors unanimously approved a 25 basis point increase in the discount rate, to 3.25 percent. In taking this action, the board approved the requests submitted by the boards of directors of the Federal Reserve Banks of Boston, New York, Philadelphia, Cleveland, Richmond, Atlanta, Chicago, St. Louis, Minneapolis, Kansas City, Dallas and San Francisco.In addition, the committee unanimously decided to expedite the release of its minutes. Beginning with this meeting, the minutes of regularly scheduled meetings will be released three weeks after the date of the policy decision. The first set of expedited minutes will be released at 2 p.m. E.S.T. on Jan. 4, 2005.

Interest rates on short-term issues moved lower again yesterday and bond prices rose as the continuing crisis in the Soviet Union gave investors ample excuse to redirect funds into high-quality, safe securities.In addition to the Soviet crisis, traders said prices had also risen in anticipation that the Federal Reserve Board is about to lower short-term interest rates again soon and the idea that the economy may be falling back into recession.""Given those three factors, how can you bet against the market?"" one government bond trader said.Compared with Monday, when trading activity bordered on the chaotic after news of the ouster of Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, dealers said yesterday's session was much quieter.""People are just waiting, but right now the fundamentals for the market are in pretty good shape,"" another bond trader said.

But analysts cautioned that events in the Soviet Union could yet create further havoc in markets - particularly a worst-case scenario of a full-scale civil war with millions of refugees flooding into Scandinavia and Central Europe.""There are no long-term conclusions to be drawn"" from Tuesday's price movements, said David Hale, analyst at Kemper Financial Services Inc. in Chicago. ""We've made one big price adjustment in the dollar, but there's more to go for. If fighting starts we could see further gains for the dollar and in the price of oil.""""If the government clamps down but stays in charge and civil war is averted, markets will stabilize. What's haunting markets is that there could be a civil war,"" he said.Just how nervous and unsettled markets were was shown Tuesday when the dollar dropped 3 pfennig to 1.78 Deutsche marks within minutes on an unfounded rumor that Mikhail S.

452,,2007-08-08 00:00:00,"Following is the text of a statement released by the Federal Reserve yesterday after the Fed’s monetary policy panel, the Federal Open Market Committee, decided to leave interest rates unchanged.The Federal Open Market Committee decided today to keep its target for the federal funds rate at 5 1/4  percent.Economic growth was moderate during the first half of the year. Financial markets have been volatile in recent weeks, credit conditions have become tighter for some households and businesses and the housing correction is ongoing. Nevertheless, the economy seems likely to continue to expand at a moderate pace over coming quarters, supported by solid growth in employment and incomes and a robust global economy.Readings on core inflation have improved modestly in recent months. However, a sustained moderation in inflation pressures has yet to be convincingly demonstrated. Moreover, the high level of resource utilization has the potential to sustain those pressures.Although the downside risks to growth have increased somewhat, the committee’s predominant policy concern remains the risk that inflation will fail to moderate as expected. Future policy adjustments will depend on the outlook for both inflation and economic growth, as implied by incoming information.Voting for the F.O.M.C. monetary policy action were Ben S.

WASHINGTON, Aug. 7 — The Federal Reserve kept its key interest rate unchanged on Tuesday and signaled that it still expected to avoid cutting short-term rates despite the recent tumult in credit markets and on Wall Street. The Fed suggested that it would change course only if economic conditions deteriorate badly in the weeks and months ahead.In a statement announcing that the overnight lending rate it controls  would remain unchanged at 5.25 percent, the Fed’s policy-setting Federal Open Market Committee did not drift significantly from its core message that inflation remains a greater risk to the economy than recession.The central bank, however, softened its tone slightly by giving some recognition to worsening conditions in financial markets, by adding a new phrase to its statement saying that the risk of an economic downturn has “increased somewhat.”“The Fed threw the markets a bone, commenting on recent market volatility and tighter credit conditions,” Steven A. Wood of Insight Economics wrote in a commentary. “However, they gave no hint that they would act anytime soon.”

DEKALB, Ill. — While much of the nation worries about a slumping real estate market, people in Midwestern farm country are experiencing exactly the opposite. Take, for instance, the farm here — nearly 80 acres of corn and soybeans off a gravel road in a universe of corn and soybeans — that sold for $10,000 an acre at auction this spring, a price that astonished even the auctioneer.“If they had seen that day, they would have never believed it,” Penny Layman said of her sister and brother-in-law, who paid $32,000 for the entire spread in 1962 and whose deaths led to the sale.Skyrocketing farmland prices, particularly in states like Illinois, Iowa and Nebraska, giddy with the promise of corn-based ethanol, are stirring new optimism among established farmers. But for younger farmers, already rare in this graying profession, and for small farmers with dreams of expanding and grabbing a piece of the ethanol craze, the news is oddly grim. The higher prices feel out of reach.“It’s extremely frustrating,” said Paul Burrs, who farms about 400 acres near Dixon, Ill., and says he regularly bids on new farmland in the hopes of renting it. Mostly, he said, he loses out to higher bidders. “I crunch the numbers and go as high as I can. But then that’s it. There’s nothing more I can do.”

457,,2009-03-19 00:00:00,"The Federal Reserve sharply stepped up its efforts to bolster the economy on Wednesday, announcing that it would pump an extra $1 trillion into the financial system by purchasing Treasury bonds and mortgage securities.
Having already reduced the key interest rate it controls nearly to zero, the central bank has increasingly turned to alternatives like buying securities as a way of getting more dollars into the economy, a tactic that amounts to creating vast new sums of money out of thin air. But the moves on Wednesday were its biggest yet, almost doubling all of the Fed’s measures in the last year, The New York Times’s Edmund L. Andrews reports.
The action makes the Fed a buyer of long-term government bonds rather than the short-term debt that it typically buys and sells to help control the money supply.
The idea was to encourage more economic activity by lowering interest rates, including those on home loans, and to help the financial system as it struggles under the crushing weight of bad loans and poor investments.
Investors responded with surprise and enthusiasm. The Dow Jones industrial average, which had been down about 50 points just before the announcement, jumped immediately and ended the day up almost 91 points at 7,486.58. Yields on long-term Treasury bonds dropped markedly, and analysts predicted that interest rates on fixed-rate mortgages would soon drop below 5 percent.
But there were also clear indications that the Fed was taking risks that could dilute the value of the dollar and set the stage for future inflation. Gold prices rose $26.60 an ounce, hitting $942, a sign of declining confidence in the dollar. The dollar, which had been losing value in recent weeks to the euro and the yen, dropped sharply again on Wednesday.
In its announcement, the central bank said that the United States remained in a severe recession and listed its continuing woes, from job losses and lost housing wealth to falling exports as a result of the worldwide economic slowdown.
“In these circumstances, the Federal Reserve will employ all available tools to promote economic recovery and to preserve price stability,” the central bank said.
As expected, policy makers decided to keep the Fed’s benchmark interest rate on overnight loans in a range between zero and 0.25 percent.
But to the surprise of investors and analysts, the committee said it had decided to purchase an additional $750 billion worth of government-guaranteed mortgage-backed securities on top of the $500 billion that the Fed is already in the process of buying.
In addition, the Fed said it would buy up to $300 billion worth of longer-term Treasury securities over the next six months. That would tend to push down longer-term interest rates on all types of loans.
All these measures would come in addition to what has already been an unprecedented expansion of lending by the Fed. The central bank also said it would probably expand the scope of a new program to finance consumer and business lending, which gets under way this week.
In effect, the central bank has been lending money to a wider and wider array of borrowers, and it has financed that lending by using its authority to create new money at will.
Since last September, the Fed’s lending programs have roughly doubled the size of its balance sheet, to about $1.8 trillion, from $900 billion. The actions announced on Wednesday are likely to expand that to well over $3 trillion over the next year.
Despite a trickle of encouraging data in the last few weeks, Fed officials were clearly still worried and in no mood to cut back on their emergency efforts.
Fed policy makers sharply reduced their economic forecasts in January, predicting that the economy would continue to experience steep contractions for the first half of 2009, that unemployment could approach 9 percent by the end of the year and that there was at least a small risk of a drop in consumer prices like those that Japan experienced for nearly a decade.
The Fed rarely buys long-term government bonds. The last occasion was nearly 50 years ago under different economic circumstances when it tried to reduce long-term interest rates while allowing short term rates to rise.
Ben S. Bernanke, the Fed chairman, has been extremely cautious in recent weeks about predicting an end to the recession, saying that he hoped to see the start of a recovery later this year but warning that unemployment, a lagging indicator, would probably keep climbing until some time in 2010.
In contrast to several recent Fed decisions, with the presidents of some regional Fed banks dissenting, the decision at Wednesday’s meeting of the 10 members of the Federal Open Market Committee, the central bank’s policy making group, was unanimous.
Jan Hatzius, chief economist at Goldman Sachs, told The Times the Fed had adopted a “kitchen sink” strategy of throwing everything it had to jolt the economy out of its downward spiral.
But while Mr. Hatzius applauded the decision, he cautioned that the central bank could not solve the economy’s problems by expanding cheap money.
“Even if the Fed could make interest rates negative, that wouldn’t necessarily help,” Mr. Hatzius told The Times. “We’re in a deep recession mainly because the private sector, for a variety of reasons, has decided to save a lot more. You can have a zero interest rate, but if you just offer more money on top of the money that is already available, it doesn’t do that much.”
Fed officials have been wrestling for months with the fact that lenders remain unwilling to lend and borrowers are unwilling or unable to borrow. Even though the Fed has been creating money at the fastest rate in its history, much of that money has remained dormant.
The Fed’s action is an expansion of its effort to bypass the private banking system and act as a lender in its own right.
The Fed and the Treasury are starting a joint venture this week called the Consumer and Business Lending Initiative in their latest effort to thaw the still-frozen credit markets. The program will start out with $200 billion in financing for consumer loans, small-business loans and some corporate purposes.
Fed officials have said they hope to expand the program next month, possibly to include the huge market for commercial mortgages, and both the Fed and Treasury hope the program will eventually provide up to $1 trillion in total financing.

458,,2001-11-07 00:00:00,"The Federal Reserve cut interest rates again yesterday, pushing down short-term rates as far this year as it has usually done before the economy comes out of a recession. Stock market investors now seem to believe a recovery will begin by the middle of next year.Despite some hesitation after the announcement of the half-point reduction, share prices ended the day with a solid rally -- making it the most enthusiastic reaction of the year for any of the cuts that have come at regularly scheduled meetings of the central bank's policy making Federal Open Market Committee.The cut leaves the rate on overnight loans between banks at 2 percent, the lowest since 1961.The three major market averages, the Dow Jones industrial average, the Standard & Poor's 500 and the Nasdaq composite index, ended the day up 1.5 percent or more. They had been mixed to down after the first five expected moves this year, but rose, albeit not as strongly as yesterday, after the last move, on Oct. 2.Lower interest rates are expected to stimulate the economy by making it less expensive for individuals and businesses to borrow money. One rate the Fed directly controls is now down more than two-thirds from where it began the year. That is about the same amount as rates fell before recent recessions ended.

In part, yesterday's market advance reflected more mystery than usual surrounding the Fed meeting.

459,,2002-09-25 00:00:00,"Following is the text of a statement released by the Federal Reserve yesterday after the Fed's monetary policy panel, the Open Market Committee, decided to leave interest rates unchanged:The Federal Open Market Committee decided today to keep its target for the federal funds rate unchanged at 1 3/4 percent.The information that has become available since the last meeting of the committee suggests that aggregate demand is growing at a moderate pace.Over time, the current accommodative stance of monetary policy, coupled with still robust underlying growth in productivity, should be sufficient to foster an improving business climate. However, considerable uncertainty persists about the extent and timing of the expected pickup in production and employment owing in part to the emergence of heightened geopolitical risks.Consequently, the committee believes that for the foreseeable future, against the background of its long-run goals of price stability and sustainable economic growth and of the information currently available, the risks are weighted mainly toward conditions that may generate economic weakness.Voting for the F.O.M.C. monetary policy action were: Alan Greenspan, chairman; William J. McDonough, vice chairman; Ben S. Bernanke; Susan S. Bies; Roger W. Ferguson Jr.; Jerry L. Jordan; Donald L. Kohn; Mark W. Olson; Anthony M. Santomero, and Gary H. Stern.Voting against the action were: Edward M. Gramlich and Robert D. McTeer Jr.Governor Gramlich and President McTeer preferred a reduction in the target for the federal funds rate.

460,,2002-09-25 00:00:00,"The Dow Jones industrial average plunged to a four-year low yesterday, as investors digested a surprise dissent from two Federal Reserve policy makers.Two members of the Federal Open Market Committee, which met yesterday to discuss interest rate policy, voted against the decision of the majority of the committee to keep the Fed's benchmark interest rate at 1.75 percent. They wanted to reduce it.The dissent, from Edward Gramlich, a Fed governor, and Robert McTeer, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas, was read both negatively and positively by investors, as was evident in the gyrations in the market after the 2:15 p.m. announcement. But by the end of the session, it appeared that the negative interpretation was holding sway for now.The Dow dropped 189.02 points, or 2.4 percent, to 7,683.13, its lowest close since October 1998, while the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index fell 14.41 points, or 1.7 percent, to 819.29. The Nasdaq composite index, which eked out small gains earlier in the day, slipped 2.76 points, or 0.2 percent, to 1,182.17, a six-year low.

461,,2002-09-25 00:00:00,"The Federal Reserve voted today to leave official interest rates unchanged, but 2 of its 12 voting members took the rare step of opposing the decision and instead backed an immediate rate cut.The split decision did little to calm the tumult on Wall Street, where the Dow Jones industrial average ended the day at its lowest level in four years. But it was a clear indication that Fed officials, like economists generally, are divided over how to deal with the fears of further weakness in the economy and the uncertainty created by the prospect of war with Iraq. [Page C1.]It was the first time since 1998 that two members of the Fed's policy-setting Open Market Committee simultaneously broke ranks with Alan Greenspan, the chairman. While there is no indication that Mr. Greenspan's leadership or stature are at risk -- he left for Britain after the meeting to receive an honorary knighthood from Queen Elizabeth II on Thursday -- the dissents highlighted the unease in Washington and the markets about whether the economy is at risk of stalling again.The vote left investors and analysts uncertain about the Fed's next step. It disappointed some investors, who had hoped the Fed would address the swoon in stock prices, declining consumer confidence and reluctance on the part of businesses to expand and invest.

But the willingness of two Fed members to call for lower rates today suggested to analysts that a rate cut would be on the agenda at the next Fed meeting, on Nov. 6, the day after Congressional elections, when any move the central bank might make would have fewer political implications. If economic indicators point to further weakness, many predicted, the Fed is likely to lower rates at that meeting.

462,,2005-03-23 00:00:00,"Following is the text of a statement released by the Federal Reserve yesterday after the Fed's monetary policy panel, the Federal Open Market Committee, decided to raise its benchmark interest rates a quarter point:The Federal Open Market Committee decided today to raise its target for the federal funds rate by 25 basis points, to 23/4 percent.The committee believes that, even after this action, the stance of monetary policy remains accommodative and, coupled with robust underlying growth in productivity, is providing ongoing support to economic activity. Output evidently continues to grow at a solid pace despite the rise in energy prices, and labor market conditions continue to improve gradually. Though longer-term inflation expectations remain well contained, pressures on inflation have picked up in recent months and pricing power is more evident. The rise in energy prices, however, has not notably fed through to core consumer prices.The committee perceives that, with appropriate monetary policy action, the upside and downside risks to the attainment of both sustainable growth and price stability should be kept roughly equal. With underlying inflation expected to be contained, the committee believes that policy accommodation can be removed at a pace that is likely to be measured. Nonetheless, the committee will respond to changes in economic prospects as needed to fulfill its obligation to maintain price stability.Voting for the F.O.M.C. monetary policy action were Alan Greenspan, chairman; Timothy F.

It restated its intention to keep raising them at a ""measured"" pace in the months ahead.But in a departure from previous declarations, the central bank said there were rising inflationary pressures beyond those tied directly to the recent jumps in oil prices.""Though longer-term inflation expectations remain well contained, pressures on inflation have picked up in recent months and pricing power is more evident,"" the policy-making Federal Open Market Committee said in a statement.

The Fed also changed its assessment of risks to the economy. Last month, it said the risks to inflation and growth were ""roughly equal."" On Tuesday, it said the risks ""should be kept roughly equal,"" but said its outlook was dependent on ""appropriate monetary policy action.""

The Dow Jones industrial average, off 2.9 percent for the year, and the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index, off 3.3 percent for the year, are both within striking distance of the 2005 lows they reached in January.""As long as energy prices remain elevated, they will keep a level of fear in the market,"" said Jack Caffrey, equity strategist at J.P.

465,,2009-08-13 00:00:00,"Following is the text of the Federal Reserve’s statement on Wednesday announcing it was holding its base federal funds target rate at a record low between zero and 0.25 percent:Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in June suggests that economic activity is leveling out. Conditions in financial markets have improved further in recent weeks. Household spending has continued to show signs of stabilizing but remains constrained by ongoing job losses, sluggish income growth, lower housing wealth and tight credit. Businesses are still cutting back on fixed investment and staffing but are making progress in bringing inventory stocks into better alignment with sales. Although economic activity is likely to remain weak for a time, the committee continues to anticipate that policy actions to stabilize financial markets and institutions, fiscal and monetary stimulus, and market forces will contribute to a gradual resumption of sustainable economic growth in a context of price stability.The prices of energy and other commodities have risen of late. However, substantial resource slack is likely to dampen cost pressures, and the committee expects that inflation will remain subdued for some time.In these circumstances, the Federal Reserve will employ all available tools to promote economic recovery and to preserve price stability. The committee will maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to  1/4 percent and continues to anticipate that economic conditions are likely to warrant exceptionally low levels of the federal funds rate for an extended period. As previously announced, to provide support to mortgage lending and housing markets and to improve overall conditions in private credit markets, the Federal Reserve will purchase a total of up to $1.25 trillion of agency mortgage-backed securities and up to $200 billion of agency debt by the end of the year. In addition, the Federal Reserve is in the process of buying $300 billion of Treasury securities. To promote a smooth transition in markets as these purchases of Treasury securities are completed, the committee has decided to gradually slow the pace of these transactions and anticipates that the full amount will be purchased by the end of October. The committee will continue to evaluate the timing and overall amounts of its purchases of securities in light of the evolving economic outlook and conditions in financial markets. The Federal Reserve is monitoring the size and composition of its balance sheet and will make adjustments to its credit and liquidity programs as warranted.Voting for the F.O.M.C. monetary policy action were: Ben S.

The policy-making arm of the Federal Reserve pointedly kept the central bank out of the impasse between the White House and Congress at a time the economic outlook was uncertain anyway.The committee adjourned leaving the federal funds rate unchanged at 5percent. It meets next on Dec. 19, when Wall Street expects consumers to have clarified the outlook for the economy by their Christmas buying patterns and the political impasse to have ended with a plan to eventually eliminate the federal budget deficit.""The major negative in the economy is the budget imbroglio,"" said Allen Sinai, chief economist for Lehman Brothers Inc. ""The economy is on the soft side at the moment, but if the consumer revives during the Christmas season under the impetus of lower prices, that will keep the economy from caving in the last quarter of the year, and then I would not expect the Fed to ease in December.""On Wednesday, the Bureau of Labor Statistics said the consumer price index rose 0.3 percent in October, the largest rise in five months.

Treasury prices were little changed yesterday as the Federal Reserve left interest rates unchanged.While the outcome of the Fed's policy-committee meeting was expected, it did  hold down prices by turning the market's attention back to the impasse on the Federal budget and debt limit, as well as to the next Federal Open Market Committee policy meeting.In terms of the Fed easing, the question is now whether they will ease at the Dec. 19 F.O.M.C. meeting,"" said Carl Palash, chief economist at MCM Money Watch in New York, a market research and analysis firm.The price of the 30-year bond slipped 1/32 , to 10727/32 , leaving its yield  unchanged at 6.29 percent.Treasury prices were also weighed down by a report on consumer prices for October that was above expectations. The Labor Department said its Consumer Price Index rose three-tenths of 1 percent. Analysts had expected an increase of two-tenths of 1 percent. The core rate, which excludes the volatile categories of food and energy prices, also rose three-tenths of 1 percent for the month.

The Dow Jones industrial average soared past 4,900 for the first time yesterday, and the broader-based Standard & Poor's 500-stock index also set a record.Benign news on inflation put traders in a buying mood, even though the Federal Reserve took no action on cutting interest rates at yesterday's meeting  of its Federal Open Market Committee and the debt squabble in Washington was unresolved. In addition, four rounds of computer-guided ""buy"" orders in advance  of tomorrow's double-witching options expiration helped push the stock market upward late in the day.Robert H. Stovall, president of Stovall/21st Advisers, suggested the Fed would be ready to reduce rates once an agreement had been reached to balance the Federal budget. ""Such a move would make the total return on stocks more competitive than the return on bonds.""Bond prices and yields showed little movement during the day. The yield on the bellwether 30-year Treasury bond was unchanged at 6.29 percent.

The Dow climbed 50.94 points, or more than 1 percent, to 4,922.75, its top level of the day and its 57th new high this year. It surged through the 4,800 milestone just two months ago. Although a gain of 50 points or more is supposed  to set off a New York Stock Exchange rule that curbs stock-index arbitrage, the  30-stock average did not pass the 50-point mark until the market had closed, when last-minute orders were reflected in the final prices.

Despite mounting evidence of some economic slowing, the Federal Reserve decided today against lowering interest rates, which would have made borrowing less costly at the start of the holiday shopping season.Analysts generally attributed the decision to the Federal Government's stalemated budget negotiations and to the absence of compelling evidence that the economy needs to be spurred, though it is less robust than during the summer.It looks like they're waiting until some of the uncertainty over fiscal policy and the economy is cleared up,"" said James F. O'Sullivan, an economist at J. P. Morgan. ""It's debatable whether the economy needs any stimulus.""Others disagreed, pointing to weak retail sales and heavy levels of consumer  debt, and to fresh figures released today that showed flat industrial production and subdued inflation in October. Consumer prices were up three-tenths of 1 percent in the month, a bit more than expected, but not enough to bother economists.

The central bank has cut short-term interest rates only once this year, by one-quarter of a percentage point in early July, after a 12-month pre-emptive strike against inflation in which it had doubled the Federal funds rate, the benchmark overnight lending rate for the banking system, to 6 percent.

470,,2007-11-01 00:00:00,"Following is the text of a statement released by the Federal Reserve yesterday after the Fed’s monetary policy panel, the Federal Open Market Committee, decided to lower interest rates by a quarter of a percentage point:The Federal Open Market Committee decided today to lower its target for the federal funds rate 25 basis points, to 4.5 percent.Economic growth was solid in the third quarter, and strains in financial markets have eased somewhat on balance. However, the pace of economic expansion will likely slow in the near term, partly reflecting the intensification of the housing correction. Today’s action, combined with the policy action taken in September, should help forestall some of the adverse effects on the broader economy that might otherwise arise from the disruptions in financial markets and promote moderate growth over time.Readings on core inflation have improved modestly this year, but recent increases in energy and commodity prices, among other factors, may put renewed upward pressure on inflation. In this context, the committee judges that some inflation risks remain, and it will continue to monitor inflation developments carefully.The committee judges that, after this action, the upside risks to inflation roughly balance the downside risks to growth. The committee will continue to assess the effects of financial and other developments on economic prospects and will act as needed to foster price stability and sustainable economic growth.Voting for the F.O.M.C. monetary policy action were: Ben S. Bernanke, chairman; Timothy F. Geithner, vice chairman; Charles L. Evans; Donald L. Kohn; Randall S. Kroszner; Frederic S. Mishkin; William Poole; Eric S. Rosengren; and Kevin M. Warsh. Voting against was Thomas M. Hoenig, who preferred no change in the federal funds rate at this meeting.In a related action, the Board of Governors unanimously approved a 25 basis-point decrease in the discount rate, to 5 percent. In taking this action, the board approved the requests submitted by the boards of directors of the Federal Reserve Banks of New York, Richmond, Atlanta, Chicago, St. Louis and San Francisco.

Prices of Treasury securities were mixed in light trading yesterday, as longer-dated issues outperformed short-term notes and bills for the second consecutive session.Prices of all securities weakened during overnight trading overseas, as market participants took some profits. But the modest declines were erased later, buttressed by a report on April housing activity that showed continued softness in that sector of the economy. Analysts also said traders were encouraged by a drop in commodity prices.''There is definite demand for Treasury securities, especially after they dip to lower price levels,'' said William V. Sullivan Jr., a senior vice president at Dean Witter Reynolds. Overnight Funds Rate DipsHopes that the Federal Reserve Board might ease monetary policy arose in the afternoon, as the overnight Federal funds rate dipped a bit below the 9 3/4 percent to 9 7/8 percent range it has occupied for the last two months. The funds rate fell as low as 9 5/8 percent during the afternoon before bouncing back to a late quote of 9 11/16 percent. For the third straight day, the Fed did not undertake any open-market operations.

Market participants are particularly sensitive to any possible change in policy because members of the Fed's Open Market Committee began two days of meetings yesterday in Washington. Recent weak economic reports and a sense that inflationary pressures may be easing have helped to push short-term interest rates lower in anticipation of a less restrictive monetary policy.

LEAD: Stock prices fell yesterday after climbing for four consecutive sessions, and the Dow Jones industrial average declined 10.44 points to close at 2,453.45.Stock prices fell yesterday after climbing for four consecutive sessions, and the Dow Jones industrial average declined 10.44 points to close at 2,453.45.Traders said the market's pullback was to be expected after the Dow's recent strong run-up, which included last Friday's 56.82-point surge, the Dow's best one-day move in almost a year. In the four sessions before yesterday's, the Dow gained 92.56 points, reaching 2,463,89, its highest level since the October 1987 market crash.''It's profit taking after a couple of explosive days,'' said Robert H.

Growth in consumer spending has slowed and labor markets have softened. Financial markets remain under considerable stress, and the tightening of credit conditions and the deepening of the housing contraction are likely to weigh on economic growth over the next few quarters.Inflation has been elevated, and some indicators of inflation expectations have risen. The committee expects inflation to moderate in coming quarters, reflecting a projected leveling-out of energy and other commodity prices and an easing of pressures on resource utilization. Still, uncertainty about the inflation outlook has increased. It will be necessary to continue to monitor inflation developments carefully.Today’s policy action, combined with those taken earlier, including measures to foster market liquidity, should help to promote moderate growth over time and to mitigate the risks to economic activity. However, downside risks to growth remain.

474,,2008-03-19 00:00:00,"UNITED STATES: Fed forecastingThe US Federal Reserve yesterday cut its benchmark interest rate by 75 basis points. The Fed has dramatically reduced interest rates in its efforts to stimulate the US economy, even in the context of an inflationary environment. It has also started to make publicly available distributions of Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) members' forecasts of inflation, unemployment and GDP growth out to three years. This raises the question of whether the FOMC has become an inflation targeter -- and to what extent it will be able to achieve its objectives.The FOMC's summary statistics will be made available four times a year. The first such release accompanied the minutes of the October 2007 FOMC meeting. This is significant for several reasons:Better guidance? The FOMC is providing better guidance to markets in terms of possible macroeconomic outcomes. Whether this is useful depends on whether or not the FOMC is a better forecaster than private agents:•It is known that the Federal Reserve Board staff's Greenbook forecasts outperform private forecasts. Yet the Greenbook is released publicly with a five-year delay. On the other hand, FOMC forecasts are released in a timely manner.•Recent research has shown that Greenbook forecasts are superior to FOMC forecasts. It is thus not clear that FOMC forecasts will provide the best guidance about the macroeconomy.Policy clarity. Fed actions presumably will become easier to anticipate as FOMC members decide on the policy path based on their forecasts of macroeconomic developments. As those forecasts are now known, financial markets can have a better understanding of what FOMC members think they are facing.

Communication compromise. The debate on FOMC communication strategy will leave centre stage for a while. More frequent and longer-term FOMC forecasts are among the recommendations of a committee on FOMC communications chaired by Federal Reserve Vice-Chairman Donald Kohn:•Kohn was known to be against an explicit Fed inflation target. However, last September he said that he was ""relatively more persuaded that inflation targeting helps reduce the variance of inflation expectations.""

•Publishing long-term forecasts is thus a compromise between announcing an inflation target and not providing any more information than under the Greenspan chairmanship.Forecasting behaviour? Most importantly, FOMC long-term inflation forecasts are fundamentally different from private sector forecasts:•Monetary policy usually affects inflation with a lag of three to four quarters, therefore inflation forecasts at horizons longer than this in part are forecasts of Fed behaviour.

WASHINGTON — The Federal Reserve reduced short-term interest rates for the sixth time in six months on Tuesday, capping an extraordinary series of measures it has taken to stabilize financial markets. The cut was smaller than investors had been expecting, though, and exposed some signs of a split among policy makers.The central bank lowered its federal funds rate — the rate it charges banks for overnight loans —  by three-quarters of a percentage point, to 2.25 percent, and left the door open to additional rate cuts in the months ahead.Though it was one of the biggest one-day rate cuts in decades, investors had been betting heavily that the Fed would cut its benchmark rate a full percentage point in response to strong evidence that a recession has begun and to the deepening crisis on Wall Street.But two members of the Fed’s policy-making committee dissented, saying they favored an even smaller rate cut, and the policy group as a whole expressed new worries about inflation — a possible argument against aggressive rate cuts.

476,,2000-05-17 00:00:00,"Following is the text of the statement by the Federal Open Market Committee, the Federal Reserve's monetary policy panel, after its decision yesterday to raise short-term interest rates:The Federal Open Market Committee voted today to raise its target for the federal funds rate by 50 basis points to 6 1/2 percent. In a related action, the board of governors approved a 50 basis point increase in the discount rate to 6 percent.Increases in demand have remained in excess of even the rapid pace of productivity-driven gains in potential supply, exerting continued pressure on resources. The committee is concerned that this disparity in the growth of demand and potential supply will continue, which could foster inflationary imbalances that would undermine the economy's outstanding performance.Against the background of its long-term goals of price stability and sustainable economic growth and of the information already available, the committee believes the risks are weighted mainly toward conditions that may generate heightened inflation pressures in the foreseeable future.In taking the discount rate action, the Federal Reserve Board approved requests submitted by the boards of directors of the Federal Reserve Banks of Boston, Cleveland, Richmond and San Francisco. The discount rate is the rate charged depository institutions when they borrow short-term adjustment credit from their district Federal Reserve Banks.

477,,2000-05-17 00:00:00,"Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, still believes that his medicine -- higher interest rates -- will reduce the economy's feverish growth. But it appears that the medicine is much weaker than he thought just a year ago, and that much higher doses will be needed to have the desired effect.Last June, when the Federal Reserve's Open Market Committee raised interest rates for the first of what has now become six times, the committee's minutes reflected a general expectation of ''appreciable moderation in the trend'' of economic growth in the months ahead.At that time, a divided Fed decided not to signal that there would be future interest rate increases. This was despite warnings by some members that the lack of such a signal could be interpreted as meaning that no further raises in rates were likely. In fact, that exact interpretation took hold as financial markets rallied on the news.Since June, the economy has behaved in a way that few if any would have expected. The boom has continued, and economic growth has accelerated. Housing starts, industrial production and inflation are up, while unemployment is down.

Yesterday, when the Fed announced its sixth rate increase -- and the first in that series to bolster the federal funds rate target by half a percentage point, not the usual quarter-point rise -- it went out of its way to warn that it was still worried about inflation, and to hint that more increases would come unless and until the economy began to cool.

With the forces restraining the economy starting to diminish, and with the long-term prospects for productivity growth remaining favorable and monetary policy accommodative, the outlook for economic recovery has become more promising.The degree of any strength in business capital and household spending, however, is still uncertain. Hence, the committee continues to believe that, against the background of its long-run goals of price stability and sustainable economic growth and of the information currently available, the risks are weighted mainly toward conditions that may generate economic weakness in the foreseeable future.

The money, secured by Representative Nita M. Lowey, could be used to equip a county laboratory for identification of biological agents or train emergency workers to deal with casualties. Ms. Lowey, a Democrat who represents most of the county, plans a formal announcement today. The National Association of Counties released a survey on Tuesday in which 90 percent of the county governments questioned said they were unprepared to handle biological or chemical attacks.(AP)MANHATTAN: FIRE DAMAGES 2 BUILDINGSA four-alarm fire caused by a fallen candle displaced several families and damaged two Upper Manhattan apartment buildings early yesterday morning, a Fire Department official said. Four firefighters suffered minor injuries, and a resident with chest pains was taken to the hospital. Heat from the fire, which started about 3 a.m., roused Efrain Pizarro, 35, an off-duty firefighter who lives on the second floor of the building, at 117 East 101st Street. Mr. Pizarro ""went around the building and got everyone out,"" said Firefighter Louis Giaconelli, a department spokesman. The fire took about an hour to control and was ruled accidental.

Tara Bahrampour (NYT)NEW JERSEY MONROE: 3 STUDENTS SICKENEDThree teenage boys were hospitalized yesterday morning after officials said they drank a clear liquid, drove to school, vomited and then lost consciousness in class. Notices were immediately sent to the district's 5,100 students to quell a rumor that an environmental hazard had hospitalized scores of students. The teenagers, students at Williamstown High School in Monroe Township, were taken to nearby hospitals. They are 18, 17 and 15, and their names were not released. John Hagerty, a State Police spokesman, said it would take about a week to analyze the liquid. Continue reading the main story",Metro Briefing,2002-01-30,The New York Times
480,,2007-05-10 00:00:00,"Following is the text of a statement released by the Federal Reserve yesterday after the Fed’s monetary policy panel, the Federal Open Market Committee, decided to leave interest rates unchanged.The Federal Open Market Committee decided today to keep its target for the federal funds rate at  5  1/4 percent.Economic growth slowed in the first part of this year and the adjustment in the housing sector is ongoing. Nevertheless, the economy seems likely to expand at a moderate pace over coming quarters.Core inflation remains somewhat elevated. Although inflation pressures seem likely to moderate over time, the high level of resource utilization has the potential to sustain those pressures.In these circumstances, the committee’s predominant policy concern remains the risk that inflation will fail to moderate as expected. Future policy adjustments will depend on the evolution of the outlook for both inflation and economic growth, as implied by incoming information.Voting for the F.O.M.C. monetary policy action were Ben S. Bernanke, chairman; Timothy F. Geithner, vice chairman; Thomas M. Hoenig; Donald L. Kohn; Randall S. Kroszner; Cathy E. Minehan; Frederic S. Mishkin; Michael H. Moskow; William Poole and Kevin M. Warsh.

When Anya Bailey developed an eating disorder after her 12th birthday, her mother took her to a psychiatrist at the University of Minnesota who prescribed a powerful antipsychotic drug called Risperdal.Created for schizophrenia, Risperdal is not approved to treat eating disorders, but increased appetite is a common side effect and doctors may prescribe drugs as they see fit. Anya gained weight but within two years developed a crippling knot in her back. She now receives regular injections of Botox to unclench her back muscles. She often awakens crying in pain.Isabella Bailey, Anya’s mother, said she had no idea that children might be especially susceptible to Risperdal’s side effects. Nor did she know that Risperdal and similar medicines were not approved at the time to treat children, or that medical trials often cited to justify the use of such drugs had as few as eight children taking the drug by the end.Just as surprising, Ms. Bailey said, was learning that the university psychiatrist who supervised Anya’s care received more than $7,000 from 2003 to 2004 from Johnson & Johnson, Risperdal’s maker, in return for lectures about one of the company’s drugs.

482,,1997-12-17 00:00:00,"Last Thursday, as a Federal district judge was ruling that the Microsoft Corporation had violated a 1995 antitrust agreement with the Justice Department, attorneys general from some of the nation's most populous states were concluding a secret three-day meeting in Chicago to assess their own strategy for a possible antitrust action against Microsoft's marketing practices.The meeting -- coupled with government investigations under way in Europe and Asia, a continuing private antitrust suit and the specter of hearings in the United States Senate -- suggest that the world's most powerful software company could soon find that it has become a Gulliver enmeshed in Lilliputian legal entanglements around the globe.''Microsoft is going to find that it is looking at a shotgun with multiple barrels,'' said Gary Reback, a lawyer with the firm of Wilson, Sonsini, Goodrich & Rasati in Palo Alto, Calif., which represents a number of Microsoft's competitors.Nine states have subpoenaed information from Wilson, Sonsini, Mr. Reback said. Among the states that participated in the strategy session last week, he said, were Florida, Illinois, Minnesota and New York.

483,,1997-02-06 00:00:00,"The Federal Reserve voted today to leave interest rates unchanged, betting that a recent surge in economic growth will moderate and leave wage and price inflation under control.The decision continues a yearlong pattern in which the Fed has kept monetary policy on hold as the economy has accelerated, slowed and then accelerated again. The Fed's last move was on Jan. 31, 1996, when it reduced its Federal funds target rate, its overnight loan rate for banks, to 5.25 percent from 5.5 percent, and its discount rate for loans to financial institutions to 5 percent from 5.25 percent.Because the Fed's decision today not to raise rates had been widely anticipated for weeks in the financial markets, it was not a powerful enough dose of good news to stop a technology-led swoon in stock prices. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 86.58 points, to 6,746.90.Since last summer the Fed's official policy has been a ''bias'' toward  tightening, a way of signaling that it will raise rates at the first compelling evidence that inflation might be taking root. Economists said they expected that the Fed kept the policy in place today, although it would not disclose its decision until after the next meeting of its policy-making body on March 25.

By keeping rates unchanged, the Fed is once again waiting for further evidence of whether growth will slow sufficiently to keep wages from spiking up and setting off an upward spiral in inflation. Despite the economy's torrid 4.7 percent growth rate in the fourth quarter, wage increases have remained muted and there is almost no sign of rising inflation.

The yield, which moves in the opposite direction, dropped to 5.85 percent, from 5.86 percent on Tuesday.The Federal Open Market Committee, at its first meeting of the year, kept the Federal funds rate at 5.50 percent, where the short-term benchmark rate has remained for almost a year.What was not disclosed at the end of the two-day meeting is whether committee members have shifted to a neutral stance from their previous position of maintaining a bias toward raising rates. But given the prevailing evidence of benign inflation and the expected economic slowdown due to Asia's financial crisis, bond market analysts said such a change would not surprise them.

Gov. Mario M. Cuomo and legislative leaders reached a compromise Wednesday that would allow New York City to build a much disputed garbage incinerator in the Brooklyn Navy Yard. But in doing so, they imposed new hurdles that could slow the project or make it more expensive.The agreement, which will partly exempt the incinerator from strict air-pollution regulations, left both its proponents and critics claiming victory.The compromise came late Wednesday afternoon, as the Legislature rushed to close an extended 1993 session. In a flurry of activity, dozens of bills that had languished in what has been a slow and largely unproductive year came under last-minute consideration. New Hurdles for CityLater Wednesday, negotiators for Mr. Cuomo, Assembly Speaker Saul Weprin, a Queens Democrat, and Senate Majority Leader Ralph J. Marino, an Oyster Bay Republican, were trying to wrap up several major bills before daybreak today, when the lawmakers were hoping to adjourn until the fall.

488,,1997-08-20 00:00:00,"The Federal Reserve voted today to leave interest rates unchanged, continuing a remarkable economic experiment in which the central bank has kept interest rates low despite shrinking unemployment and unusually strong economic growth.Today's meeting of the Fed's policy-making committee was the third consecutive time that the central bank has passed up a chance to raise short-term interest rates. The last increase in the key short-term rate that the Fed controls came in March, a quarter-point rise, to 5.50 percent.The Fed's action today was no surprise. A wide variety of recent economic measurements have shown that inflation remains at barely noticeable levels, below an annual rate of 2 percent in the first half of the year. That is the lowest inflation rate since the early 1960's, and wholesale prices have declined this year, the first time that has happened in more than four decades.But the Federal Reserve's job is to anticipate economic trends and to act on such assumptions months in advance. So its decision today to hold its fire may only spur arguments over whether it is missing signs that wages and prices will increase toward the end of this year or in the beginning of 1998.

In a related action, the board of governors approved a 50-basis-point reduction in the discount rate, to 2 percent.The terrorist attacks have significantly heightened uncertainty in an economy that was already weak. Business and household spending as a consequence are being further damped. Nonetheless, the long-term prospects for productivity growth and the economy remain favorable and should become evident once the unusual forces restraining demand abate.The committee continues to believe that against the background of its long-run goals of price stability and sustainable economic growth and of the information currently available, the risks are weighted mainly toward conditions that may generate economic weakness in the foreseeable future.In taking the discount rate action, the Federal Reserve Board approved requests submitted by the boards of directors of the Federal Reserve Banks of Boston, New York, Cleveland, Richmond, Atlanta, St. Louis, Kansas City and San Francisco.

494,0.0,1993-05-19,"The prospect of a Yes vote in the Danish referendum weakened the D-Mark yesterday, as international investors took the view that such a result would significantly ease tensions in Europe's exchange rate mechanism. Several European currencies, including sterling and the Italian lira, enjoyed strong rises against the D-Mark, as Danish opinion polls pointed to a clear ratification of the Maastricht treaty and a period of calm in Europe's fixed exchange rate system. This reversed a trend of recent weeks in which investors, fearful of another Danish No, sought a safe haven against currency turmoil and a renewed threat to European economic and monetary union by buying D-Marks and Swiss francs. German government bond prices also fell to the benefit of Italian and French bonds. Danish opinion polls helped the pound to close a pfennig higher against the D-Mark on the day, at DM 2.4875. The Italian lira was also a strong performer, closing at L909.2 against the D-Mark from a previous close of L914.9. The dollar gained significantly from the D-Mark's weakness, rising more than a pfennig to peak at DM 1.6272 in Europe, and reaching a 7-week high. It later closed in London at DM 1.6240. An additional factor pushing the dollar higher against the German currency was speculation that the Federal Reserve's federal open market committee would lean towards tightening monetary policy at its meeting in New York yesterday. Expectations of a rise in short-term US interest rates have followed last week's US inflation figures, which were higher than anticipated. The results of the meeting, which took place yesterday and continues today, will not be known for some weeks. (c) The Financial Times Limited 1993.

495,1.0,1993-05-19,"THE BANK of England's announcement that the next gilt auction would be of #3bn 7 3/4% stock due 2006 lifted the UK government bond market at the end of the day. The good reception was attributed to the size of the auction - at the bottom end of expectations - and to the comparatively low coupon. A coupon below 8% was taken as a sign of the bank's confidence in a lower inflation outlook. It also meant the gilt would be priced below par, building in a capital gain. The futures contract benefited most, gaining about 3/8 points. In the cash market the auction area and beyond showed small gains. DISAPPOINTMENT that the Bundesbank left the repo rate unchanged at 7.60% caused a sell-off in the German government bond market. The immobility cast a further pall over hopes that it would cut the Lombard or discount rates at its council meeting today, although a few were still looking for a 1/4 reduction. Once the June futures contract fell through 94.45, further sales were triggered. The day's low was 94.26, from which there was some recovery. Expectations of a Yes vote in Denmark also acted as a drag on bunds, which are seen as losing more of their safe haven status. A Yes vote would give another push to the convergence story, activating further switches to higher yielders. The yield spread of 10-year Danish government bonds over bunds would be expected to narrow significantly from yesterday's 71 basis points. French government bonds have continued to benefit from this theme, with the bund-OAT yield spread coming in to as little as 29 basis points. THE ITALIAN government bond market, already attracting demand as a high yielder, rose further on the news that withholding tax would be refunded much more quickly to overseas investors. The 12 1/2% tax, which has taken six months to reclaim, has proved a deterrent to overseas investors. A new target of only two to three weeks was announced by the government, which needs overseas investors to finance the public sector deficit. It also announced spending cuts designed to counteract a looming overshoot on that deficit. The BTP future gained 80 basis points to close near its all time high of 99.56. THE JAPANESE government bond market took fright at a newspaper report that short-term interest rates might rise, exacerbating its concerns about economic recovery. The September futures contract fell through a key support level, opening at 106.44 and closing at 106.11. In the cash market the yield on the benchmark No 145 rose from 4.575% to 4.67%. Once again there was a lack of domestic demand. Other niggling factors were a rise in the overnight money rate to 3 7/32%, the weakening of the yen against the dollar and declines in overseas government bond markets. The US Treasury yield curve continued to flatten yesterday as longer-dated securities posted fresh declines while the short end held its ground. In late trading the benchmark 30-year government bond was down at 101 9/32, yielding 7.018%. At the short end of the market, the two-year note was unchanged at 99, to yield 4.026%. The day's only economic news - a 6.7% rise in monthly housing starts - was largely ignored but prices at the long end eased because attention was focused on the Federal Reserve's policy-making Open Market Committee meeting in Washington DC. Recent news on inflation has heightened speculation that the FOMC might decide to shift the bias of monetary policy towards a possibly tightening. Although such a move would not necessarily involve a hike in interest rates, it would make it more likely that interest rates would go up, rather than stay steady or be lowered, over the coming months.

496,2.0,1993-05-19,"BOTH the D-Mark and the Swiss franc continued to weaken in European trading yesterday as dealers took the view that there would be a strong Yes vote in Denmark's referendum on the Maastricht treaty, writes James Blitz. The first exit polls following the referendum indicated last night that there had been a comfortable victory for the Yes camp, although final confirmation of the result was being awaited. Nevertheless, the exit polls were clearly in line with the market's expectations and suggested that tensions in the European exchange rate mechanism were about to ease. As on previous days, the expectation that the treaty would be ratified led to unwinding of positions in both the D-Mark and the Swiss franc, both of which have been viewed as safe haven currencies in the event of a No vote. The dollar gained significantly from the D-Mark's weakness, rising more than a pfennig to peak at DM 1.6272 in Europe, and reaching a seven-week high. It closed in London at DM 1.6240, and later ended New York trading at DM 1.6246. Again, a factor pushing the dollar up against the German currency was speculation that the Federal Reserve's Federal Open Market Committee would lean towards tightening monetary policy following last week's higher than expected figures for US inflation. The results of the meeting, which took place yesterday and continues today, will not be known for some weeks. In Europe, expectations of a Yes vote led dealers to go long of several currencies outside the D-Mark bloc and to short the Swiss franc, which closed at SwFr 0.910 to the D-Mark from a previous SwFr 0.909. The Italian lira was the best performer on the Continent, ending at L909.2 per D-Mark from a previous L914.9. The lira's rise partly reflected strong buying of Italian bonds, with the five-year BTP future moving up more than 40 basis points on the day. Sterling also enjoyed a strong performance, again driven by the same factors. It finished at DM 2.4875, a full pfennig higher on the day. The clearest sign that the market was expecting a Yes vote was, of course, the Danish krone's performance. Denmark's currency peaked at DKr3.8250 to the D-Mark, and then weakened on profit-taking to end at around DKr3.8425. Its divergence indicator against its Ecu central rate fell to around minus 37 basis points at the close of London trading, some 3 basis points higher than at Monday's close. An important question facing the market today is whether the D-Mark's performance has been sufficiently bad in recent days to make the Bundesbank think twice about cutting the discount rate at its council meeting today. A 25 basis-point easing in the discount rate has been anticipated, but several Bundesbank officials have recently expressed concern about the dangers of imported inflation.

498,4.0,2001-03-21,"Twenty-four hours is a long time in the life of Romano Prodi. On Tuesday, the president of the European Commission went on Swedish TV and criticised the Swedish presidency of the EU for lacking any ambition. Yesterday he used a Brussels briefing, ahead of this week's EU Stockholm summit, to offer a mea culpa. Far from intending to criticise the Swedish presidency for being unambitious, Prodi pleaded that once again he may not have expressed himself clearly. Having salved his conscience he then outlined a bewildering wish list of what the Commission would like to see happen in Stockholm. Among the items he listed was the Spanish-British impasse over Gibraltar airport, which threatens to bring the Commission's air traffic control programme to a halt. So keen is Prodi to get the issue solved that he's been searching for answers in his Latin version of the 1713 Treaty of Utrecht - which handed Gibraltar over to Britain. Prodi then raised the thorny issue of which languages should be used for some EU bureaucracy. He suggested English, French and German - but joked that if his proposal were rejected he would impose his native Bolognese dialect. In reverse? When Noel Goutard, the veteran chairman of Valeo, named Andre Navarri as his successor in June 1999, he described the former Alsthom executive as ""un garcon superbe"". Less than a year after Navarri replaced Goutard at the helm of the auto components group, he was shown the door on Wednesday. Apparently, the Valeo board was unimpressed by Navarri's long-term strategy for reviving the company. It was more interested in short-term restructuring action and plans to improve shareholder returns. Observer understands that one of those calling for his head was Ernest Antoine Seilliere, chairman of MEDEF, the French employers' association. Seilliere's CGIP investment company is the largest shareholder in Valeo, with 20.6 per cent of the shares, almost 30 per cent of the votes and four representatives on the Valeo board. It's thought that CGIP wanted to see a better return from Valeo. So exit Navarri and re-enter Goutard, who will chair a new supervisory board. Insiders insist Goutard will not be running the company but advising on strategy. For a company that claims to be a leader in clutches and transmissions, this reads a little like engaging reverse gear. Miracle man? Spare a thought for Ricardo Lopez Murphy. The respected economist was called into service to right the troubled Argentine economy but was chewed up and spat out by the voracious Argentine political system in just 15 days. Still, Lopez Murphyshould take heart - hehas lasted longer thanmany others in his position. Joaqun de Las Heras took the post during the military coup in 1976 but survived just six days in office before he was replaced. Jorge Wehbe was appointed to the ill-fated post in 1962, only to find that the president who had chosen him was overthrown by the army. He was 12 days in office. Finally, Lopez Murphy should take comfort in the fact that he left the post with his health intact. Miguel Angel Roig, who was appointed to the economy ministry by the last president, Carlos Menem, died of a heart attack after just seven days in the office. In fact, Argentina's longest-serving economy minister is the one who has just returned: Domingo Cavallo. He served for an unprecedented five years under Carlos Menem and yesterday appeared very much in his element, threatening congressmen and chastising journalists. Close collaborators described his mood as ""euphoric"". Forget about whether he's the best man for the job; it's quite possible that he's the only man. Travel light Pity Kim Woo-choong, the fugitive founder of the bankrupt Daewoo group. The author of the business guide Every Street is Paved with Gold has been reduced to staying in third-class hotels in Europe and surviving on hamburgers.

That at least is the picture portrayed by Kim's lawyer to rebut suggestions that the businessman is living the high life as Interpol mounts a search to arrest him for an alleged $20bn accountancy fraud - the world's biggest. But the tale of woe, which brought down the Daewoo group in 1999, doesn't end there. Kim, 65, is suffering from suspected stomach cancer and is receiving treatment for hardening of the arteries. ""He's on the run not to avoid punishment but to put order into his life by writing his memoirs,"" says his lawyer. The lawyer adds that Kim may yet return home to clear his name.

499,5.0,2001-03-21,"Has the Federal Reserve declared its independence from the US stock market? One of the interesting sidebars to the drama over whether the US will stumble into a full-blown recession this year has been a cat-and-mouse game under way between the Federal Reserve and US equity markets. Every downward lurch in stock prices this year inflamed expectations of big rate cuts, as the Fed embarked on the biggest, fastest wave of monetary easing in any three-month period since 1982. The Fed's policy-making open market committee voted yesterday to cut short-term interest rates by a widely expected half-point, driving the Fed funds rate to a 20-month low of 5 per cent and almost completely erasing the rate increases that followed the 1997-98 global financial crisis. But many investors clearly hoped for more, thumbed their noses at the decision and went back to their regularly scheduled asset selling. The battered, tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite index erased its gains for the day and sank more than 3 per cent within an hour of the Fed's decision. Other stock indices followed suit. While the Fed, in a statement following the decision, acknowledged faltering investment and spending, subsequent inventory build-ups and excess capacity that could keep production ""soft"" for some time, it shied away from giving investors the ""surprise"" they expected. A re-reading of Alan Greenspan's repeated and vehement denials of any direct connection between stock prices and monetary policymaking might have tempered such expectations. The period September to November 1998 was the last time the Fed aggressively slashed interest rates. Equity prices were plunging at the time. But Mr Greenspan later explained that the Fed acted in its widely accepted role as lender of last resort to pre-empt a panic and a ""seizing up"" of debt markets following Russia's debt default and a feared implosion of the Long-Term Capital Management hedge fund. In testimony to congressional lawmakers in December 1998, the Fed chairman acknowledged that ""equity prices can play an important role in the economy, which the central bank must take into account"", but he insisted that the Fed was not attempting ""to prop up equity prices, nor did we plan to continue to ease rates until equity prices recovered, as some have erroneously inferred. This has not been, and is not now, our policy or intent."" With a liquidity crisis much less apparent now than in 1998, the Fed faced the possibility of reviving faith in a ""Greenspan put"", if only by default. It appeared mindful of that, said David Jones, an economist with Aubrey G. Lanston in New York. ""The Fed basically signalled that it's going to key its future rate cuts to the economy, not to the stock market,"" he said. ""The only way the market can influence the Fed is indirectly, through what it does to spending, and spending has held up better than expected."" While economic conditions in the US have deteriorated, the unemployment rate has held remarkably steady and retail sales have not collapsed. It is even possible that the US economy has recovered and more rate cuts could exacerbate any imbalances in the economy. ""There's an ambiguity in the data that precludes (the Fed) from being more aggressive at this time,"" said John Lipsky, the chief economist at JP Morgan Chase. But the Fed statement used wording that presaged surprise inter-meeting cuts in the past. It said it would ""monitor developments closely"" and reaffirmed its view that risks remained tilted toward more ""economic weakness in the foreseeable future"". Financial markets appeared to take that promise seriously. After the statement's release, futures prices quickly registered expectations for the Fed funds rate to drop as much as 75 basis points to 4.25 per cent by mid-year. Full statement from the FOMC The following is the full text of the Federal Open Market Committee statement. ""The committee at its meeting today decided to lower its target for the federal funds rate by 50 basis points to 5 per cent. In a related action the board of governors approved a 50 basis point reduction in the discount rate to 4 1/2 per cent. ""Persistent pressures on profit margins are restraining investment spending and, through declines in equity wealth, consumption. The associated backup in inventories has induced a rapid response in manufacturing output and, with spending having firmed a bit since last year, inventory adjustment appears well under way. ""Although current developments do not appear to have materially diminished the prospects for long-term growth in productivity, excess productive capacity has emerged recently. The possibility that this excess could continue for some time and the potential for weakness in global economic conditions suggest substantial risks that demand and production could remain soft. ""In these circumstances, when the economic situation could be evolving rapidly, the Fed will need to monitor developments closely. ""The committee continues to believe, against the background of its long-run goals of price stability and sustainable economic growth and of the information currently available, the risks are weighted mainly toward conditions that may generate economic weakness in the foreseeable future. In taking the discount rate action, the Fed approved requests submitted by the boards of directors of all 12 reserve banks.""

500,6.0,2001-03-21,"The dollar initially spiked higher after the decision of the Federal Reserve to cut rates by 50 basis points, as equity markets gave a warm response to the move. ""The key to the rise in the dollar has been the good performance of equity markets,"" said Ray Attrill, director of research at economic consultancy 4Cast. The US currency had been trading around half a cent lower against the euro ahead of the decison. Many said that the impact of the shift in monetary policy on the dollar would only become clear over the next few trading sessions. The reaction of the equity markets is thought to be key. Until last week the dollar was thought to be vulnerable to falling equity markets. With share ownership higher in the US than Europe or Japan, sliding stocks are expected to take a bigger bite out of US consumer spending and therefore economic growth. But at the end of last week the dollar was seen to benefit from safe-haven flows into the bond market as investors fled falling stock markets. Trading ahead of the FOMC decision was subdued. With Japanese traders on holiday, trading in the yen was especially thin. The yen settled into a narrow range after the volatility following Monday's monetary easing by the Bank of Japan. By the end of London trading the dollar stood at Y122.6, compared to Y122.2. * Argentina provided an element of drama to an otherwise subdued pre-Fed markets yesterday, with the resignation of the economics minister again unsettling the markets. The departure of Ricardo Lopez-Murphy, following his failure to secure agreement on a $4.45bn two-year cost cutting plan, caused some to worry over the long-term viability of Argentina's currency board. The peg with the dollar has been been inflicting ever greater pain on the Argentine economy. ""Argentina has been suffering from a classic gold standard problem,"" said Peter von Maydell, senior currency economist at Credit Suisse First Boston. Earlier in the week the dollar, and hence the Argentine peso, hit a record high against the Brazilian real. This has undermined the competitiveness of the Argentine economy - which conducts around 30 per cent of its trade with Brazil - and sent unemployment to 14.5 per cent. Aside from devaluation, deflation has been the only way to regain competitiveness. But so far the situation in Argentina has failed to spill over into other emerging markets. This is partly because most expect the currency peg to survive. The appointment of Domingo Cavallo as finance minister did something to ease nervousness. Mr Cavallo, who introduced the fixed exchange system in 1991, is thought by many to be more likely to secure political approval for budget cuts than his predecessor. Implied one-month yields in the non-deliverable forwards market - seen as a gauge of the prospect of a peso devaluation - have fallen steeply since Friday. ""Things have calmed down but Argentina is still in some kind of crisis mode,"" said David Lubin, emerging markets economist at HSBC in London. But he added that convertibility was a tough nut to crack. ""It would be possible to see the currency board surviving even a debt default."" Mr von Maydell said that Argentina's economic problems had not yet become unsustainable. ""Although unemployment is rising, it is still some distance from the 18.4 per cent it touched back in May 1995,"" he said. * Atriax, the foreign exchange internet portal, has said it plans to expand into bond and derivative markets. Dan Morehead, the chief executive of Atriax, said clients would prefer an internet platform which would allow them to trade a range of assets. The portal, which plans to go live between April and June, was formed last October by Deutsche Bank, Chase, Citibank and Reuters.

Regional bank presidents remain worried about inflationary pressures and believe it would be wrong to ease policy prematurely.

503,9.0,1997-08-20,"The D-Mark fell on fresh signs that the Bundesbank would not raise interest rates soon. The bank set its repo tender unchanged at a fixed rate of 3.00% for another week, and reported that growth in M3 money supply was far slower than forecast. M3 grew at a rate of 5.7% for the year to July. The Bundesbank thinks M3 growth is a good indicator of future inflation. Michel Camdessus, managing director of the International Monetary Fund, suggested that there was little need for Germany to raise rates to defend the D-Mark. The dollar's surge of the past year had created ""no inflationary effects"" in Europe, and had helped the European Union, he said. The dollar, helped by a recovery in US stocks after last week's carnage, gained 1.4 pfennigs against the D-Mark to close in London at DM 1.836. It rose Y 0.5 against the yen to Y 118.2, as gloom over the Japanese economy reduced prospects of an interest rate rise this year. Trading was again thin because of summer holidays. The Federal Reserve's open market committee meeting late yesterday also cast a shadow. However, as expected, the FOMC left US interest rates unchanged. The dollar was held back by strong resistance around DM 1.84 to the D-Mark, and by fears that the Bundesbank might try to revive prospects of a rate rise tomorrow, when its council meets for the first time after a four-week summer break. The Bundesbank has repeatedly threatened to move from a fixed to a variable rate repo tender, which could cause rates to creep higher. Euromark futures contracts moved little yesterday and are still pricing in a 25-basis-point German rate rise by September. Jeremy Hawkins, chief economist at the Bank of America in London, said the Bundesbank's apparent tactic of ""leaving an air of uncertainty over the market"" had been as effective as a rate rise at stopping the dollar's ascent. The pound rose 1.4 pfennigs against the D-Mark to DM 2.950, but fell half a cent against the dollar to $1.606. * The Canadian dollar fell on figures showing that the country's core consumer price index rose just 1.5% in the year to July. That reduced prospects of an interest rate rise. The Canadian dollar fell 0.4 cents against the US dollar to C$1.393, even though the Bank of Canada was seen buying its currency in the market. * The Australian dollar recovered in London trading yesterday from a tumble prompted by a false wire report. The wire quoted the Reserve Bank of Australia as saying that interest rates could be cut again. But the bank's quarterly report on the economy and financial markets had said nothing of the sort. It had merely given a rationale for previous cuts. The wire report had sent the Aussie dollar down to $0.7375, from its Monday close of $0.7423/28. But in trading after the London close yesterday the Aussie dollar was back up at $0.7415/25. The bank's report said the key inflation rate would stay below 2% possibly into 1998. But it also said that current interest rate levels could accommodate stronger growth. This suggested there was little need for another rate cut. Australia's key cash rate has fallen to 5%, below US rate levels. * The Hong Kong stock market fell 4% yesterday on fears that domestic interest rates would have to stay high to ward off speculative attacks on the Hong Kong dollar. One-month market rates rose above 11%, up from 7% last week. However, overnight rates dropped from 20% to 8-10% late in the day on signs that the attack on the currency may be fading away. Many traders said there were no speculative attacks yesterday.

505,11.0,1997-08-20,"European bond markets continued to trade higher yesterday after the Bundesbank signalled no immediate change to German interest rates. Most attention was on the meeting of the US Federal Reserve's open market committee, which was continuing after the official close of European trading. In the event, the FOMC did not signal any change in interest rates and US TREASURIES were little changed on the announcement from their earlier levels. Soon after the news the benchmark 30-year bond was 1/8 higher at 98 7/32, yielding 6.506%. The two-year note was down 1/16 at 100 1/16 to yield 5.821%, while the 10-year note was up 1/32 to 99 13/32, yielding 6.197%. Economists had said the current evidence favoured no interest rate rise coming from the Fed meeting. Inflation, as measured at the wholesale and consumer levels, had remained calm in spite of the continued low unemployment rate. Analysts have begun to speculate about what it might take for the Fed to raise rates when it meets again in late September. ""If retail sales continue strong, the Fed could move closer to tightening, but it would also require no slowdown in the labour market,"" said M. Cary Leahey, chief US economist at High Frequency Economics. The afternoon bond market had been little influenced by a new report on housing starts, which revealed July starts to have been unchanged, following a revised increase of 3.2% for June. ""The market's settled down after last week's debacle, but there is no broad-based interest, with the back end of the curve being buoyed,"" said John ""Rocket"" Spinello, government securities strategist at Merrill Lynch in New York. The benign US outlook helped to underpin solid if unspectacular gains earlier in the day in the European markets, which were cheered by the Bundesbank's decision, as expected, to make no change to its securities repurchase (repo) rate.

The move also paved the way for a good performance from FRENCH BONDS, with the notional September futures contract adding 32 points to 130.20 in Paris trading. Figures showing German money supply grew at an annualised rate of 5.7% in July, well inside the Bundesbank's target range of 3.5 to 6.5% and down on June's expansion of 6.4%, also gave a fillip to trading, although analysts cautioned that it did not change the medium-term interest rate outlook. Indeed, the belief that German interest rates may have to rise soon is still there, and is dependent on developments in the foreign exchange markets. David Brown, chief European economist at Bear Stearns, said: ""German interest rate relief will prove fairly short-lived, especially if the dollar-mark rally resumes with a vengeance."" The fall-out from that will have a strong bearing on the direction of high-yielding bond markets, which traded up again yesterday on the back of bund strength. The spread of ITALIAN BTPS over bunds had narrowed to about 103 points in late trading, while the September futures contract settled 48 points higher at 136.00. The September futures contract in SPANISH BONOS gained 30 points to settle at 117.34. High-yielders are now becoming hostage to foreign exchange rate developments, raising doubts about how much further the European monetary union convergence theory can push those markets, some bond market watchers believe. If the dollar regains its upward momentum against the D-Mark, reviving the spectre of a rise in German rates to reverse it, ""that is negative for the German yield curve, and for other markets as well,"" said Jeremy Hawkins, chief economist at Bank of America. UK GILTS had an especially quiet session, with the September futures contract unchanged at 115 1/16 in thin trading. The spread over bunds also widened sharply during the day, from an opening level of 150-151 basis points to around 155 points. Most attention was fixed on the release today of retail sales data for July, which will give an indication of the level of consumer spending. It will also give an indication of whether the interest rates have peaked, as the Bank of England has appeared to suggest.

506,12.0,1997-08-20,"The D-Mark fell on fresh signs that the Bundesbank would not raise interest rates soon. The bank set its repo tender unchanged at a fixed rate of 3.00% for another week, and reported that growth in M3 money supply was far slower than forecast. M3 grew at a rate of 5.7% for the year to July. The Bundesbank thinks M3 growth is a good indicator of future inflation. Michel Camdessus, managing director of the International Monetary Fund, suggested that there was little need for Germany to raise rates to defend the D-Mark. The dollar's surge of the past year had created ""no inflationary effects"" in Europe, and had helped the European Union, he said. The dollar, helped by a recovery in US stocks after last week's carnage, gained 1.4 pfennigs against the D-Mark to close in London at DM 1.836. It rose Y 0.5 against the yen to Y 118.2, as gloom over the Japanese economy reduced prospects of an interest rate rise this year. Trading was again thin because of summer holidays. The Federal Reserve's open market committee meeting late yesterday also cast a shadow. However, as expected, the FOMC left US interest rates unchanged. The dollar was held back by strong resistance around DM 1.84 to the D-Mark, and by fears that the Bundesbank might try to revive prospects of a rate rise tomorrow, when its council meets for the first time after a four-week summer break. The Bundesbank has repeatedly threatened to move from a fixed to a variable rate repo tender, which could cause rates to creep higher. Euromark futures contracts moved little yesterday and are still pricing in a 25-basis-point German rate rise by September. Jeremy Hawkins, chief economist at the Bank of America in London, said the Bundesbank's apparent tactic of ""leaving an air of uncertainty over the market"" had been as effective as a rate rise at stopping the dollar's ascent. The pound rose 1.4 pfennigs against the D-Mark to DM 2.950, but fell half a cent against the dollar to $1.606. * The Canadian dollar fell on figures showing that the country's core consumer price index rose just 1.5% in the year to July. That reduced prospects of an interest rate rise. The Canadian dollar fell 0.4 cents against the US dollar to C$1.393, even though the Bank of Canada was seen buying its currency in the market. * The Australian dollar recovered in London trading yesterday from a tumble prompted by a false wire report. The wire quoted the Reserve Bank of Australia as saying that interest rates could be cut again. But the bank's quarterly report on the economy and financial markets had said nothing of the sort. It had merely given a rationale for previous cuts. The wire report had sent the Aussie dollar down to $0.7375, from its Monday close of $0.7423/28. But in trading after the London close yesterday the Aussie dollar was back up at $0.7415/25. The bank's report said the key inflation rate would stay below 2% possibly into 1998. But it also said that current interest rate levels could accommodate stronger growth. This suggested there was little need for another rate cut. Australia's key cash rate has fallen to 5%, below US rate levels. * The Hong Kong stock market fell 4% yesterday on fears that domestic interest rates would have to stay high to ward off speculative attacks on the Hong Kong dollar. One-month market rates rose above 11%, up from 7% last week. However, overnight rates dropped from 20% to 8-10% late in the day on signs that the attack on the currency may be fading away. Many traders said there were no speculative attacks yesterday. Forex strategists believe the currency's peg to the US dollar will survive despite devaluations in the rest of south east Asia since July. They point to the $200bn in foreign exchange reserves held by Hong Kong and China, and to Hong Kong's good economic fundamentals. Copyright Financial Times Limited 1997. All Rights Reserved.

508,14.0,1997-08-20,"European bond markets continued to trade higher yesterday after the Bundesbank signalled no immediate change to German interest rates. Most attention was on the meeting of the US Federal Reserve's open market committee, which was continuing after the official close of European trading.<In the event, the FOMC did not signal any change in interest rates and US TREASURIES were little changed on the announcement from their earlier levels. Soon after the news the benchmark 30-year bond was 1/8 higher at 98 7/32, yielding 6.506%. The two-year note was down 1/16 at 100 1/16 to yield 5.821%, while the 10-year note was up 1/32 to 99 13/32, yielding 6.197%. Economists had said the current evidence favoured no interest rate rise coming from the Fed meeting. Inflation, as measured at the wholesale and consumer levels, had remained calm in spite of the continued low unemployment rate. Analysts have begun to speculate about what it might take for the Fed to raise rates when it meets again in late September. ""If retail sales continue strong, the Fed could move closer to tightening, but it would also require no slowdown in the labour market,"" said M. Cary Leahey, chief US economist at High Frequency Economics. The afternoon bond market had been little influenced by a new report on housing starts, which revealed July starts to have been unchanged, following a revised increase of 3.2% for June. ""The market's settled down after last week's debacle, but there is no broad-based interest, with the back end of the curve being buoyed,"" said John ""Rocket"" Spinello, government securities strategist at Merrill Lynch in New York. The benign US outlook helped to underpin solid if unspectacular gains earlier in the day in the European markets, which were cheered by the Bundesbank's decision, as expected, to make no change to its securities repurchase (repo) rate.

509,15.0,2005-11-02,"Government bond prices fell and yields rose round the world yesterday as the US Federal Reserve lifted rates for the 12th consecutive time and markets digested positive economic news and concerns about inflation. US Treasuries initially staged a modest rally after the Federal Open Market Committee confirmed a widely expected interest rate increase, but ended lower. The quarter-point hike took the Fed funds rate to 4 per cent, and the committee's statement left the door open for further increases at a ""measured"" pace. ""They are likely to raise rates at both the December and January meetings, given their positive outlook for growth and concern about inflation,"" said James Knightley, economist at ING Financial Markets. Earlier, the Institute for Supply Management's manufacturing index for October was reported at 59.1, at the high end of expectations. The data also showed signs of inflation. ""For markets, the biggest story is the large increase in prices paid in the last three months, from 48.5 in July to a stunning 84 in the latest month,"" said Alan Ruskin, research director at the 4Cast consultancy. Yields on 10-year Treasuries were up 1.6 basis points at 4.575 per cent late yesterday, still below recent seven-month highs that broke through 4.59 per cent. Two-year yields rose by 3.3bp to 4.419 per cent. Eurozone government bond yields also rose as the Purchasing Managers' Index of European manufacturing activity showed modest gains in October. The report increased the chances the European Central Bank might raise interest rates. ""The ongoing improvement in the manufacturing sector in the eurozone will only help to encourage the hawks on the ECB,"" said analysts at ING.

510,16.0,2005-11-02,"Government bond prices fell and yields rose around the world yesterday, as positive economic news and fears of inflation and rate rises dominated the markets.

511,17.0,2005-11-02,"The Federal Reserve yesterday pushed its target interest rate up to 4 per cent, highlighted concerns about inflation and said it expected to continue tightening monetary policy. The policymaking Federal Open Market Committee repeated its judgment that, following the increase, monetary policy still remained accommodative and said it expected to continue raising rates at a ""measured"" pace. It was the twelfth consecutive quarter point rate increase, stretching back to June of last year. Financial market reaction was limited after a decision that was widely expected, with a slight drop in bond prices and rises in stocks and the dollar. The Fed said that high energy prices and hurricane-related disruptions had temporarily depressed output and employment. ""Monetary policy accommodation, coupled with robust underlying growth in productivity, is providing ongoing support to economic activity that will likely be augmented by planned rebuilding in the hurricane-affected areas,"" the FOMC statement said. It again highlighted inflation risks, saying the ""cumulative rise in energy and other costs have the potential to add to inflation pressures"" while adding that core inflation and longer-term inflation expectations remained contained. The stress on cumulative energy price increases adds to the impression that a chief concern is a potential pass-through to core inflation after a sustained climb in the oil price. The impact on core inflation has been limited to date. But the 2 per cent rise in the Fed's preferred measure of core inflation in the two months to September is already at the top of the 1-2 per cent ""comfort range"" popularised by former Fed governor Ben Bernanke. Mr Bernanke has been nominated to replace Alan Greenspan as Fed chairman. There will be two more meetings of the FOMC, in December and January, before Mr Greenspan is scheduled to step down. The Fed's vote to raise interest rates and signal its intention of continuing to raise rates came in a unanimous vote. While some Fed policymakers think the notion of removing policy accommodation is stale, the current outlook retains majority support among the committee. At 4 per cent, the federal funds rate is no longer obviously a long way below the so-called ""neutral"" level where monetary policy neither restricts nor stimulates the economy. The Fed has maintained the same language as it has raised its target rate by 300 basis points from 1 per cent. Adding to recent data backing the Fed's view that the expansion remains strong the Institute for Supply Management said its index of manufacturing activity remained upbeat. Respondents said that production, new orders and employment rose. But the prices paid index rose from 84 from 78 in September as energy costs jumped. Separately, the Commerce Department said that construction spending rose 0.5 per cent in September to a new record level of an annualised Dollars 1,120bn, led by increased residential spending.

512,18.0,2005-11-02,"Short-dated eurozone government bonds fell on Wednesday, pushing yields to a 15-month high amid rising expectations for the first interest rate hike in more than two years. The European Central Bank is expected to leave interest rates unchanged at 2 per cent for the 29th consecutive month today, but rising expectations that the first rate hike will come before the end of the year or early in 2006 have pushed yields higher. The yield on the two-year Schatz yield rose 4bp to 2.462 per cent, its highest level since late July last year. The 10-year bund yield rose 5.4bp to 3.462 per cent, the highest level since late April this year. A report showing German unemployment falling in October for the forth month in five supported the view that the ECB's neutral stance on interest rates was about to come to an end. Investors will pay close attention to ECB chairman Jean-Claude Trichet's comments at today's press conference for any hints about the bank's view on inflation. US Treasury bonds were mixed, after yields tested seven-month highs and then retreated. Selling continued early on in the wake of Tuesday's quarter-point rate hike by the Federal Open Market Committee, helped by stronger economic news and weak government bond prices in Europe. But the move reversed after the Treasury said it would sell $44bn of debt in its quarterly auctions next week. Officials said the department would sell $18bn of three-year notes on Tuesday, $13bn of five-year notes on Wednesday, and $13bn of 10-year paper on Thursday. The Treasury also said it would sell 30-year bonds on February 9 next year for the first time since October 2001. Traders were also cautious ahead of Thursday's Congressional testimony by Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve, and Friday's key monthly employment report.

513,19.0,2007-09-19,"Whooping and hollering traders and soaring stock prices yesterday offered little evidence of the nagging concerns that the Federal Reserve's aggressive 50 basis point rate cut amounted to an admission that problems in the US financial system ran deeper than the Fed's governors first thought.  Charles Diebel, fixed income strategist at Nomura in London, said that by cutting the rate by more than the market expected, the Fed had opted for ""shock and awe"".  Arthur Hogan, chief market analyst at Jefferies &Co said he was taken aback by the traders' emphatic response, reacting to the cut ""as if Ben Bernanke (Fed chairman) has come up with a cure for cancer"".  The half percentage point cut, the result of a unanimous decision by the Federal Open Market Committee, surpassed what most people in the market expected. The consensus before the decision had been for a quarter-point cut.  An instant poll of more than 1,000 readers of FT.com showed that two thirds disagreed with the FOMC's decision.  Stocks soared, led by financial stocks and homebuilders, the two sectors most obviously affectedby the subprime mortgage market meltdown of recent months and its resultingfallout.  Trading both on exchange and over-the-counter markets had earlier been relatively light as Wall Street looked to Washington for direction.  Mr Hogan warned that the rate cut could in fact be viewed as an admission that the Fed sees a problem that is bigger than anticipated. Many other observers warned that there might be a reassessment today.  One trader said: ""The market seems to be taking solace in the aggression of the Fed. There were lots of cheers and not a small degree of shock and surprise. But I think there has to be a collective effort not to forget the backdrop of the serious problems in the credit derivatives market.""  Alfred Goldman, chief market strategist at AG Edwards, said: ""In the short term, the market likes pleasant surprises. The initial reaction was that the Fed came to the rescue, almost like the cavalry charging over a hill. But the risk is a hangover as people may ask 'what does the Fed know that we don't?' ""  Interest rate futures continued to price in rate cuts over the next 12 months with three-months rate seen at 4.25 per cent by September 2008, down from 4.45 per cent earlier in the day.  A Funds rate of 4.25 per cent - implying two further cuts of 25bp each - is now priced as a certainty by the meeting in January. At the beginning of the day, the market put the odds of this happening at barely 25 per cent.  The announcement was a surprise: Fed funds futures had pointed to a 33 per cent chance of a 50bp rate cut before the announcement. Analysts said further rate cuts would depend on the nature of forthcoming economic data.  ""The Fed is trying to tread a fine line and the 50bp cut is an attempt to restore confidence in the financial sector,"" said Dominic Konstam, head of interest rate strategy at Credit Suisse. ""The Fed has to wait for a meaningful slowdown in the economy and lower inflation before it can cut again. They are saving their bullets for the economy.""  Max Bublitz, chief strategist at SCM Advisors, said: ""This was the right thing to do, although I would have preferred more of a cut in the discount rate.  ""My guess is that more cuts will follow the rather weak data I expect to see this autumn.""  Mr Diebel said that the Fed ""really stepped up to the plate"" by cutting 50bp: a move clearly aimed at crisis of confidence as a result of credit concerns. ""It makes a cut in October look debatable but will not be the only move of the cycle in our view. If the data weaken further as we suspect then another move in December looks likely. The move should lessen some of the money market tensions.""  Citigroup drew a parallel between recent market conditions and those prevailing in 1998. ""History never repeats itself exactly, and the parallels between today's events and those of the Russia/LTCM crisis are not perfect. However, they are symbolic. Fed easing into a disrupted financial system in September-October 1998 was followed by solid equity market gains.""  In a possibly inflationary sign, oil prices climbed to a new high above Dollars 82 a barrel. Tom Sowanick, chief investment officer of Clearbrook Financial, pointed out that while stocks moved sharply higher, the bond market turned sceptical, in part because the market was adjusting to the reality that the Fed had entered into a risky trade-off between price inflation and economic growth. ""The bond market is essentially saying that the Fed's actions will risk a return to a higher inflation environment, supported by low short-term interest rates and perhaps, more importantly, a substantial decline in the US dollar.""  He pointed out that the action had the potential to usher in a cycle of renewed inflation risks. ""In our view, these risks are not small and, if realised, will be difficult to reverse. In the meantime, the Fed rate cuts are a green light for stocks and commodities.""  ",Cheering greets Fed announcement.,2007-09-18,The Financial Times
514,20.0,2007-09-19,"As Northern Rock has crumbled in recent days, Adam Applegarth, chief executive of the UK mortgage lender, has made little attempt to conceal his shock. ""Nobody could [fore]see the squeeze on global liquidity ... Watching liquidity disappear has been astonishing,"" he declared last week, adding that ""life changed on August 9"" when a sudden money market intervention by the European Central Bank revealed a broad freeze in the funding system.  Such comments about the unpredictability of events are unlikely to placate investors in Northern Rock's shares, let alone the depositors who queued to get their money out. But Mr Applegarth's comments highlight a crucial point about the spreading credit squeeze: behind the scenes many other private sector bankers, central bankers and regulators are also expressing astonishment at the turn of events.  Until this summer, most financiers had assumed that it was extremely unlikely that widespread problems in the money markets - on which financial institutions depend to fund their day-to-day operations - would occur. Thus, while financial institutions of almost every hue have been pouring resources into computer models designed to assess future risks, they had spent relatively little time analysing the events that have brought Northern Rock crashing down.  At the Bank of England, for example, officials had this year started warning about liquidity risks and creating new frameworks for measuring these, ahead of almost all of the central bank's counterparts in the western world. But the Bank had not rushed to finish this framework, since it thought a systemic funding freeze was unlikely. ""Nobody expected a complete money market freeze of this kind,"" confesses one senior continental European central banker. ""Every-one was looking for idiosyncratic financial shocks or worrying about subprime or credit being mispriced - that was the focus.""  Or as the treasurer of one big investment bank admits: ""What we are seeing now is like a natural disaster - whole parts of the financial system which we took for granted have stopped working. But that was not something that people had really prepared for.""  To a certain extent, this lack of preparation reflects the perennial tendency of experts in risk management to keep fighting the last financial war - in this case, the implosion of Long Term Capital Management, a US hedge fund, in 1998. The scenario that banks' planning meetings have focused on has been the possibility of another large-scale hedge fund collapse.  In some respects, this LTCM obsession has delivered welcome benefits. This summer, almost two dozen hedge funds ran into serious problems, including two linked to Bear Stearns, the Wall Street investment bank. These jolts have been handled relatively smoothly - in part because banks and regulators prepared so thoroughly for this scenario. ""Hedge funds have not been the issue this time,"" says one senior international regulator, who suggests this outcome may help to defuse demands from politicians for greater regulation of hedge funds in the coming months.  But while a focus on LTCM has helped the industry survive some of this summer's troubles, it may also have distracted risk managers from considering other potential shocks. That in turn highlights a bigger problem: in recent years regulators and investors have tended to play down the risks attached to banks, because they tended to assume that the biggest threats to financial stability lay elsewhere, most notably in unregulated areas such as hedge funds.  The reason for this lopsided view is that a fundamental shift has been under way in the financial system.  Banks used to be considered the dominant pillars of the financial world, since they provided credit to companies and individuals and retained the risk that these loans would turn sour. That meant that if a company defaulted, banks were left on the hook. As a result of this vulnerability, regulators required banks to hold large reserves of spare capital and pools of liquid assets to ensure they could cope with sudden credit shocks.  However, this decade has brought a move to what bankers describe as an ""originate and distribute"" model - meaning that although banks still tend to make (or ""originate"") loans, these are increasingly sold (or ""distributed"") to other capital market investors rather than retained on the banks' books. Since they have been selling on these loans, regulators have assumed that the banks would be less vulnerable if loans turned bad. Thus they have been willing to let the banks hold smaller cushions of capital relative to the volume of loans they create.  This shift towards an ""originate and distribute"" system has been good news for investment bankers, since it has enabled them to increase the volume of business they can do. One reason why Northern Rock, for example, expanded its mortgage book so fast this decade is that when the lender started turning its home loans into securities, regulatory rules permitted it to lend three times as much per unit of capital.  Until now regulators have generally tolerated - if not actively encouraged - this ""originate and distribute"" trend, since there was a widespread belief that the financial system would be safer if credit risk were spread around. In particular, policymakers assumed that the fact that banks were selling risks into the capital markets was making them less vulnerable to any future financial turmoil. Thus, it was presumed that there was now far less chance that a crisis would ever erupt in, say, the interbank lending market than among the hedge funds who were buying the credit risk from banks.  However, this summer's events have shattered some of these comforting assumptions. What has become clear in recent weeks is that banks' offloading of risks into the capital markets has not eliminated their vulnerability to a shock; on the contrary, although banks have shoved risk out through the ""front door"" (as evidenced in their published accounts), they have been re-acquiring it in other, indirect - or backdoor - ways.  One issue creating problems is that banks have been acquiring loans from each other, repackaged as new instruments via the capital markets. Thus as the value of subprime securities has fallen, for example, it has hurt not only the hedge funds and other non-bank institutions but the investment portfolios of banks too.  Another problem is that banks have been selling their credit risk to investment vehicles or conduits. Until recently, it was widely assumed that these were separated from the banks, because they raised finance in the capital markets. But the current crisis has forced banks to prop up these vehicles, by unexpectedly extending liquidity lines - meaning that risky assets are in effect moving back on to the banks' balance sheets again.  Worse still, as the market shock has spread, investors have started to lose confidence in techniques that have underpinned the ""originate and distribute"" model, such as securitisation (or the practice of taking loans and using these to issue bonds).  That, in turn, has made it impossible for banks to sell assets into the capital markets - such as loans to risky borrowers. ""Markets for a wide range of securities have de facto disappeared,"" says Marco Annunziata, chief analyst at Unicredit. The net result of this is that, to cope with an influx of assets, banks are scrambling to plump up the cash cushions they had let grow thin in recent years. In place of the ""originate and distribute"" model, in other words, a new pattern of ""re-intermediation"" is emerging, in which banks are again on the hook for risk. ""Re-intermediation by banks is a likely consequence of the current situation,"" note analysts at Dresdner Kleinwort Benson, who warn that this trend will ""stretch capitalisation and reduce returns on assets"" for most banks.  Some think this could herald a sea-change in 21st-century finance that would see banks returning to a much simpler business model instead of endlessly slicing and dicing risk. Others insist that the current pattern is simply a short-term response to a specific financial crisis that will quickly abate.  ""For financial innovation, there is no reverse gear,"" argues Moody's, the credit rating agency (and an institution that has greatly benefited from the securitisation trend in recent years). ""The old days of the bank-based intermediation system are gone. It is improbable that a dramatic reversal, a scaling backof securitisation and credit risk transfer will take place.""  But even if this second view is correct and the ""originate and distribute"" model is here to stay, the recent shocks are already forcing policymakers to rethink some of their approaches. This is likely to trigger some specific, micro-level reforms in the coming months: in the UK, for example, policymakers are scrambling to improve the system for protecting bank depositors from financial turmoil. While officials have been aware for several years that this system contained potential flaws - and had been mulling changes - efforts to reform it had not had much urgency before, precisely because a bank run was considered a low-risk event.  The events of recent weeks may also trigger a broader review, well beyond the UK, of the way regulators treat banks. Central bankers are already considering taking steps to force banks to prepare more effectively for liquidity shocks in their trading operations, for example, when a new set of rules about capital adequacy comes into force next year, known as Basel II.  Some policymakers also think pressure could grow for banks to hold more capital on their books against loans - even if they have sold on the credit risk. ""One of the things we will have to look at is whether we should require banks to hold more capital against stuff they have distributed off their books, but where there is a risk they may need to take this back on to their books for legal or reputational reasons,"" says David Dodge, governor of the Bank of Canada. A rethink is also looming about the treatment of off-balance-sheet vehicles. ""This is an area where there will definitely need to be a debate,"" admits one senior European financial official. Meanwhile, policy-makers of almost every hue are now united in calling for far greater transparency of complex finance. Or as Moody's notes: ""Looking forward, there will be ... a higher demand for capital and liquidity buffers throughout the financial system, which will marginally increase the cost of capital.""  Such measures will be disliked by bankers, who know that a tougher regulatory regime could make finance far less lucrative. But the longer the current market turmoil continues, the more the recriminations will grow - and, with them, the pressures for reform.  One thing is already clear: just as risk managers have spent the last decade discussing LTCM, the next 10 years will now be shaped by an equally intense debate about the lessons to be learnt from Northern Rock and the shock being felt by Mr Applegarth and others.  All at once, interest rates are on the turn  By Crhis Giles  In the space of two short months, financial turmoil in credit markets has blown apart the outlook for interest rates in the world's advanced economies.  Back in mid-July, economists and investors in money markets confidently expected interest rates to be on hold or to rise. The near-universal view was that the US Federal Reserve would hold its target for the Fed funds rate at 5.25 per cent, that the European Central Bank intended to raise its main refinancing rate by a quarter of a percentage point to 4.25 per cent in September, that the Bank of Japan would find sufficient grounds to push its interest rate up from 0.5 per cent and that the Bank of England was about to raise the price of money, also by a quarter point, to 6 per cent.  Now, the landscape is much changed, with interest rate rises seemingly off the agenda everywhere and central banks cutting rates or considering whether they should loosen monetary policy in response to the financial market upheavals.  In a period when central bankers have been unusually frank behind the scenes about each other's weaknesses in dealing with the chaos in money markets, they are now singing from the same hymn sheet on strategy. Everyone agrees that interest rates should be set low enough to guard against the market havoc having a knock-on effect on the real economy.  The view, plainly expressed by central bankers, is that they increasingly think there will be tangible effects on the economy. This is what led to Tuesday's rate cut in the US as well as a rethink of expected rate rises by other central banks.  Ben Bernanke, the Fed chairman, took the boldest action by cutting rates to 4.75 per cent and releasing a statement saying: ""Today's action is intended to help forestall some of the adverse effects on the broader economy that might otherwise arise from the disruptions in financial markets and to promote moderate growth over time.""  The same logic was apparent in Japan, the world's second largest economy, where the Bank of Japan held interest rates on Wednesday at 0.5 per cent despite a strong desire within the BoJ to restore rates to a more normal level. Toshihiko Fukui, the central bank's governor, warned of growing uncertainty in the global economy in the wake of the US subprime mortgage crisis and said: ""It is hard to see signs of improvement. The situation is still unstable.""  He added: ""There is no change in the need to adjust interest rates if the economy moves in line with our scenario.""  While most attention on the Bank of England on Wednesday was focused on its extraordinary U-turn in accepting lower quality collateral in return for central bank money - just days after insisting such action would sow the seeds of a future financial crisis - the minutes of its September rate-setting meeting were published. Looking at five possible ways the UK and global economies could be harmed by the financial market turmoil, the monetary policy committee said the issue was ""the extent to which developments in financial market intermediation would affect the wider economy and hence the outlook for inflation"". The MPC added that it was still too early to know the answer - but the heavy hint was that the market wobbles would reduce both economic growth and upward pressures on inflation, thus opening the door for interest rate cuts.  Jean-Claude Trichet, ECB president, made the same noises two weeks ago at his monthly press conference and, for the first time, did not raise interest rates the month after uttering the phrase ""strong vigilance"", the ECB's code for a coming rate rise.  Many will see the central banks' actions as tantamount to bailing out the risky decisions of the financial sector, but the policy-makers insist that they distinguish between action to ensure that growth does not slow unnecessarily and inflation does not slow too much on the one hand, and on the other their money market operations designed to ensure financial stability without bailing out banks.  Lower rates will by themselves mean a greater threat of inflation and there are plenty of reminders that such a risk remains serious: oil prices are at record highs, food prices are rising and China, manufacturer to the world, is suffering from an upward spiral in its costs.  The Fed acknowledged that inflation was far from dead when it said on Tuesday that its rate-setting Federal open market committee ""judges that some inflation risks remain, and it will continue to monitor inflation developments carefully"". Alan Greenspan, Mr Bernanke's predecessor as Fed chairman, has made similar points this week in interviews coinciding with the publication of his memoirs.  This threat of inflation was reflected in bond markets, where a concern was evident that the Fed favoured short-term growth over long-term inflation control. They reacted to the Fed's action by pricing higher inflation expectations into longer-term credits. The long US bond yield rose to 4.76 per cent, while gold rose to a 28-year high of $726.95 an ounce - a further pointer to concerns about the outlook for consumer prices, as the precious metal is seen as the ultimate protection against inflation.  Rising longer-term interest rates might also undermine the central banks' actions when they cut official rates, because these higher market rates offset the effect of the cheaper money lent at shorter maturities.  Two years ago, Mr Greenspan said a global conundrum existed because, however much the Fed raised rates, long-term market rates hardly budged, damping the effect of policymakers' actions. That conundrum might no longer exist but an equally large problem seems to have taken its place.  As central bankers ease monetary policy relative to expectations, investors are beginning to worry about inflation - boosting longer-term interest rates and mitigating the action the policymakers thought was necessary.

517,23.0,1996-09-25,"The Federal Reserve's monetary policy committee yesterday left US interest rates unchanged, causing a mild surprise to the markets. The decision suggested the Federal Open Markets Committee, which is responsible for setting interest rate policy, was not convinced that signs of inflationary pressure in the US economy warranted tightening. The FOMC's decision left the Federal funds rate, the interest banks charge each other for overnight loans, unchanged at 5.25%. It also left unchanged the discount rate, which the Federal Reserve charges banks, at 5%. Analysts were divided over what effect the decision would have on the dollar, although most considered that a rate rise was now most likely to take place after the US presidential elections in November. With the currency markets in Europe closing before the FOMC decision, trading was generally light and within narrow ranges for most currencies, as the market awaited the interest rate news from the US. The announcement of the UK's buoyant current account and growth figures was followed by sterling making small gains against the dollar and the D-Mark. The pound closed against the dollar at $1.5580 by end of trading in London, up slightly from $1.5569 the previous day. Against the D-Mark, sterling finished at DM 2.3576, up from DM 2.3562. The French franc continued its bullish trend against the D-Mark, climbing to FFr 3.383 from FFr 3.385. The D-Mark continued to trade in a narrow band against other European currencies. But it weakened slightly against the yen, to Y 72.52 compared with Y 72.62. The Swedish krona hit a recent high against the D-Mark in intra-day trading at SKr4.32, after yet another cut in the Swedish central bank's repo rate. The krona finished the day at SKr4.351, up from SKr4.359. The Italian lira was stable at L1,006. But Italian government debt markets rose strongly on positive inflation data and growing confidence in the government's ability to pass its 1997 budget through parliament. The benchmark December government bond futures contract rose to a contract high of 119.20, slipping back to a close of 119.15. * Britain recorded its largest current account surplus for nine years in the second quarter of 1996, and its annual rate of economic growth was revised up to 2.2% yesterday. The current account deficit for the second quarter showed a #457m ($712m) surplus after a deficit of #786m in the first quarter. Financial markets had expected a second quarter deficit of around #1.2bn. Mr Tony Norfield, treasury economist at ABN Amro bank in London, said the current account data was good news for the British economy and for sterling. ""The lack of a base rate cut should help sterling - it seems pretty unlikely we'll see any more base rate cuts for a while,"" he said. Official interest rates appeared to have been left unchanged at 5.75% after Monday's monetary policy meeting between Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor of the Exchequer, and the Bank of England. * The Riksbank, Sweden's central bank, showed its faith in the country's economic recovery by cutting interest rates for the twentieth time this year.<Its latest quarterly report on economic and monetary policy said inflation in Sweden was under control.

518,24.0,1996-09-25,"As the bond markets' tense vigil for the outcome of the Federal Open Market Committee meeting continued, activity in the eurobond market dried to a trickle, with only a handful of new issues surfacing yesterday. The largest deal of the day was a DM 500m floating-rate offering for Crediop, the Italian financial institution that lends to local authorities. Crediop's credit rating was upgraded by Moody's to Aa3 in July, making it one of the few Italian issuers with the same rating as the state. Moreover, forthcoming redemptions of D-Mark floating-rate paper are expected to provide good support for the transaction, said a syndicate manager at Paribas, joint book-runner with HSBC Trinkaus. ""More than DM 1bn of floating-rate notes are maturing in September and October, and we hope this deal will benefit from some reinvestment demand,"" he said. He reported demand from banks in the Benelux region and Italy, as well as money market funds in the UK and France, in spite of the deal's relatively tight pricing. At the re-offer price, the notes paid a spread of 5.7 basis points over Libor, which widened to full fees - 9 basis points over Libor - in the course of the day, in line with Crediop's dollar-denominated FRNs. In the sterling sector, Yorkshire Building Society issued #200m of five-year floating-rate notes, increased from the initial launch size of #150m due to strong demand, an official at lead Dresdner-Kleinwort Benson said. While it is only the 10th largest UK building society in terms of assets, it ranks third in UBS's relative creditworthiness league table of building societies, after the Halifax and Northern Rock, both of which are due to convert to banks next year. Most of the paper went to UK corporates and financial institutions, he said. In France, Merrill Lynch increased a FFr 1bn issue of 10-year bonds, launched in May at a spread of 51 basis points, by another FFr 1.5bn yielding only 43 basis points over French government bonds. The deal's strong spread performance, which had seen the differential tighten to as little as 38 basis points, lent good support to the new tranche, an official at Banque Paribas, one of the joint leads, said. Also in the French franc sector, dealers are awaiting the next foray by Cades, the government entity set up to manage the country's accumulated social security debts. It is expected to issue up to FFr 20bn - possibly in two tranches of differing maturities - as early as this week. In the emerging markets, the Philippine jumbo 20-year bond, which on Monday had tightened from its launch spread of 225 basis points to 220 basis points, continued to trade well and closed at a spread of 218 basis points over Treasuries.

Wall Street economists had been almost evenly divided about whether the Fed would raise the federal funds target rate by 25 basis points or leave it steady. At mid-morning bonds moved modestly lower on news of a jump in the consumer confidence index since the start of the summer. Reaction to the figures, however, was overshadowed by the market's focus on the FOMC meeting. The Conference Board said that it had revised its August figure to 112 - its highest level in nearly six years - and that the index was only modestly lower at 111.8 in September. The August figure was originally reported as 109.4. * European government bond markets languished as traders waited nervously for the outcome of the FOMC meeting. Trading ranges in most markets were narrow and volumes low, and where significant price changes did occur, they were mostly driven by mark-ups in the futures markets.

However, mounting hopes that the government could push through a convincing 1997 budget package helped the market recoup its losses during the afternoon. Traders also cited hopes that further inflation data would show that Monday's figures were an aberration.

""Gilts have not only underperformed bunds, but all European markets in recent weeks"", said Mr Andrew Roberts, gilts analyst at UBS. ""Yield convergence has resumed in Europe, but gilts are not part of it."" Mr Roberts also said ""economic fundamentals are against the gilt market"", with high spending growth and consumer price inflation constantly overshooting the Bank of England's 2.5% target. ""Only an end to the convergence process could help gilts, by attracting funds out of the high-yielding markets"", he said. * Swedish government debt ended mostly unchanged, after rising in early trading on abullish central bank report on inflation, while the krona firmed to SKr4.352 against the D-Mark, from SKr4.361 on Monday.

522,28.0,1996-09-25,"The derivatives sector was marking time yesterday as dealers waited for the outcome of the US Federal Open Market Committee meeting, writes Joel Kibazo. In futures, the December contract on the FT-SE 100 opened on a firm note at 3,954, well ahead of its previous close. Early buying, said to have been mainly by independent (local) traders, saw the contract rise steadily to 3,969. This turned out to be the high of the day as the more cautious view on the interest rate outlook gained the upper hand. December drifted lower for the rest of the morning but later settled to trade in a tight range of 3,940 to 3,950. The early falls on Wall Street did little to improve sentiment while a false rumour about a resignation from the UK government only served to increase the gloom surrounding the market. The contract closed at 3,945, up 2 on its previous close and around 2 points above its estimated fair value premium to cash of 33 points. Turnover rose slightly and closed at 10,809 contracts. Volume in the traded options also improved and reached 43,776 contracts against 37,227 lots on Monday. The FT-SE 100 option saw business of 19,309 lots while 14,584 was dealt in the Euro FT-SE contract. BP was the busiest stock option with a total of 3,015 trades.

523,29.0,1996-09-25,"Investors showed a mixed reaction to news that the Federal Reserve had decided to leave interest rates unchanged at yesterday's meeting of its Open Market Committee, writes Lisa Bransten in New York. Bluechip shares in the Dow Jones Industrial Average initially surged on the news and then almost as quickly fell back into negative territory in part because of pressure from AT&T, which issued a profits warning early yesterday morning. Just before 3pm the Dow was off 13.68 at 5,881.06 and the Standard &Poor's 500 slipped 0.86 at 686.66 while the American Stock Exchange composite added 0.74 at 564.36. Wall Street economists had been sharply divided over whether the Fed's policy making body would raise interest rates. Technology shares mostly remained higher as they rebounded from the drop seen on Monday. The Nasdaq composite, which is weighted toward that sector, added 3.33 at 1,214.80 and the Pacific Stock Exchange technology index climbed 1.1%. Semiconductor shares were particularly strong. Intel added $1 1/4 at $97, Applied Materials was up $1 3/8 at $27 5/8, Micron Technology climbed $2 1/2 at $30 1/2, Texas Instruments added $3 1/2 at $55 1/4, Motorola was $1 1/4 stronger at $52 5/8 and National Semiconductor climbed $1 3/8 at $20 1/2. Telecommunications shares were sharply lower on the heels of a warning from the industry giant, AT&T, that competitive pressures in the long distance business would push third quarter earnings as much as 10% below analysts' estimates. AT&T, which is a component of the Dow, was off $5 3/8 or 9% at $51 7/8, MCI Communications shed $1 3/8 or 5% at $25 3/4 and Sprint gave up $1 1/2 or 4% at $40. Interest rate sensitive commercial banks were mostly flat ahead of FOMC news. Citicorp was $1/4 stronger at $89 5/8, Chase Manhattan Bank was unchanged at $79 3/8 and JP Morgan shed $1 at $88 3/4. Pan Am World Airways rose in their first day of trading on the American stock Exchange. Shares in the newest reincarnation of the well-known carrier were priced at $15 and by 1pm had risen by $1 to $16. Shares in Revco gained $1 1/8 or 4% at $26 7/8 after the drug store chain said that its first quarter earnings were 21 cents a share, 6 cents ahead of analysts' estimates.

524,30.0,1996-09-25,"US Treasuries surged and then fell back from their highs on news that the Federal Reserve's Open Market Committee had left interest rates unchanged. Bonds began rising in early afternoon and then moved sharply higher at 2:15pm when the news was announced. The yield on the benchmark 30-year Treasury dipped below 7% on the news, but some 45 minutes later moved back above the psychologically important level. By late afternoon the long bond was 5/32 stronger at 96 to yield 7.008%. Shorter maturity Treasuries however, managed to hold on to a good portion of their gains, with the two-year note climbing 5/32 to 99 15/16 to yield 6.140%. The curve that maps the spread between two-year and 30-year Treasuries jumped by eight basis points. Wall Street economists had been almost evenly divided about whether the Fed would raise the federal funds target rate by 25 basis points or leave it steady. At mid-morning bonds moved modestly lower on news of a jump in the consumer confidence index since the start of the summer. Reaction to the figures, however, was overshadowed by the market's focus on the FOMC meeting. The Conference Board said that it had revised its August figure to 112 - its highest level in nearly six years - and that the index was only modestly lower at 111.8 in September. The August figure was originally reported as 109.4. * European government bond markets languished as traders waited nervously for the outcome of the FOMC meeting. Trading ranges in most markets were narrow and volumes low, and where significant price changes did occur, they were mostly driven by mark-ups in the futures markets. ""No investor flows were backing the rally"", said Mr Graham McDevitt, a bond strategist at Paribas. * Italian government bonds had the most volatile day among European markets, weakening in the morning on stronger than expected consumer price data released after the close of the market late Monday by five Italian cities. However, mounting hopes that the government could push through a convincing 1997 budget package helped the market recoup its losses during the afternoon. Traders also cited hopes that further inflation data would show that Monday's figures were an aberration. ""If the government comes up with the goods on the 1997 budget and the Bank of Italy are impressed enough, it won't be too long before we should expect to see rate cuts entering back into the equation again,"" said Mr David Brown, chief international economist at Bear Stearns. The BTP contract on Liffe rose by 0.46 to settle at 119.17, before reaching an all-time high of 119.34 in after-hours trading. * UK gilts traded in a very narrow range, ending the day flat or slightly higher. Liffe's December long gilt future settled at 107 15/32, up 3/32. In the cash market, the 10-year gilt was 3/32 higher at 97 3/8, its yield spread over the equivalent bund 3 basis points wider at 180 points. This spread is now some 15 points wider than at the beginning of the month.

525,31.0,1996-09-25,"The Federal Reserve's monetary policy committee yesterday left US interest rates unchanged, causing a mild surprise to the markets. The decision suggested the Federal Open Markets Committee, which is responsible for setting interest rate policy, was not convinced that signs of inflationary pressure in the US economy warranted tightening. The FOMC's decision left the Federal funds rate, the interest banks charge each other for overnight loans, unchanged at 5.25%. It also left unchanged the discount rate, which the Federal Reserve charges banks, at 5%. Analysts were divided over what effect the decision would have on the dollar, although most considered that a rate rise was now most likely to take place after the US presidential elections in November. With the currency markets in Europe closing before the FOMC decision, trading was generally light and within narrow ranges for most currencies, as the market awaited the interest rate news from the US. The announcement of the UK's buoyant current account and growth figures was followed by sterling making small gains against the dollar and the D-Mark. The pound closed against the dollar at $1.5580 by end of trading in London, up slightly from $1.5569 the previous day. Against the D-Mark, sterling finished at DM 2.3576, up from DM 2.3562. The French franc continued its bullish trend against the D-Mark, climbing to FFr 3.383 from FFr 3.385. The D-Mark continued to trade in a narrow band against other European currencies. But it weakened slightly against the yen, to Y 72.52 compared with Y 72.62. The Swedish krona hit a recent high against the D-Mark in intra-day trading at SKr4.32, after yet another cut in the Swedish central bank's repo rate. The krona finished the day at SKr4.351, up from SKr4.359. The Italian lira was stable at L1,006. But Italian government debt markets rose strongly on positive inflation data and growing confidence in the government's ability to pass its 1997 budget through parliament. The benchmark December government bond futures contract rose to a contract high of 119.20, slipping back to a close of 119.15. * Britain recorded its largest current account surplus for nine years in the second quarter of 1996, and its annual rate of economic growth was revised up to 2.2% yesterday. The current account deficit for the second quarter showed a #457m ($712m) surplus after a deficit of #786m in the first quarter. Financial markets had expected a second quarter deficit of around #1.2bn. Mr Tony Norfield, treasury economist at ABN Amro bank in London, said the current account data was good news for the British economy and for sterling. ""The lack of a base rate cut should help sterling - it seems pretty unlikely we'll see any more base rate cuts for a while,"" he said. Official interest rates appeared to have been left unchanged at 5.75% after Monday's monetary policy meeting between Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor of the Exchequer, and the Bank of England. * The Riksbank, Sweden's central bank, showed its faith in the country's economic recovery by cutting interest rates for the twentieth time this year. Its latest quarterly report on economic and monetary policy said inflation in Sweden was under control. After the publication of the inflation report, the central bank cut its key repo rate by 10 basis points to 5.05%. The repo rate has now dropped by nearly four percentage points, from 8.91% in January. * Mr Romano Prodi, Italy's prime minister, said Italy would face economic ruin if it failed to join Emu. ""There can no longer be a situation where some arrive first and others later, but there will be a large number of countries that enter right away,"" Mr Prodi said. ""Not being among these countries means economic ruin for Italy,"" he said. Mr Prodi said Italy's 1997 budget, due to be presented on Friday, would help Italy clinch a place in Emu.

526,32.0,1996-09-25,"As the bond markets' tense vigil for the outcome of the Federal Open Market Committee meeting continued, activity in the eurobond market dried to a trickle, with only a handful of new issues surfacing yesterday. The largest deal of the day was a DM 500m floating-rate offering for Crediop, the Italian financial institution that lends to local authorities. Crediop's credit rating was upgraded by Moody's to Aa3 in July, making it one of the few Italian issuers with the same rating as the state. Moreover, forthcoming redemptions of D-Mark floating-rate paper are expected to provide good support for the transaction, said a syndicate manager at Paribas, joint book-runner with HSBC Trinkaus. ""More than DM 1bn of floating-rate notes are maturing in September and October, and we hope this deal will benefit from some reinvestment demand,"" he said. He reported demand from banks in the Benelux region and Italy, as well as money market funds in the UK and France, in spite of the deal's relatively tight pricing. At the re-offer price, the notes paid a spread of 5.7 basis points over Libor, which widened to full fees - 9 basis points over Libor - in the course of the day, in line with Crediop's dollar-denominated FRNs. In the sterling sector, Yorkshire Building Society issued #200m of five-year floating-rate notes, increased from the initial launch size of #150m due to strong demand, an official at lead Dresdner-Kleinwort Benson said. While it is only the 10th largest UK building society in terms of assets, it ranks third in UBS's relative creditworthiness league table of building societies, after the Halifax and Northern Rock, both of which are due to convert to banks next year. Most of the paper went to UK corporates and financial institutions, he said. In France, Merrill Lynch increased a FFr 1bn issue of 10-year bonds, launched in May at a spread of 51 basis points, by another FFr 1.5bn yielding only 43 basis points over French government bonds. The deal's strong spread performance, which had seen the differential tighten to as little as 38 basis points, lent good support to the new tranche, an official at Banque Paribas, one of the joint leads, said. Also in the French franc sector, dealers are awaiting the next foray by Cades, the government entity set up to manage the country's accumulated social security debts. It is expected to issue up to FFr 20bn - possibly in two tranches of differing maturities - as early as this week. In the emerging markets, the Philippine jumbo 20-year bond, which on Monday had tightened from its launch spread of 225 basis points to 220 basis points, continued to trade well and closed at a spread of 218 basis points over Treasuries. The rest of the sector was muted by the FOMC meeting, but dealers are looking to the forthcoming D-Mark issues for Colombia and the Czech Republic's Komercni Banka.

527,33.0,2003-06-26,"By opting for a quarter-point cut in the federal funds rate, rather than the half-point favoured by one of its members, the Federal Open Market Committee has left room for a further reduction. It has also postponed the day when it must embrace the high-risk strategy of unconventional action. We must now wait and see if the second-half recovery which the Fed is hoping for - and which the stock market has priced in - materialises. Consumer spending has kept the economy afloat, but a more robust recovery requires businesses to start spending. May's durable goods orders - with core non-defence capital goods orders excluding aircraft dropping by 0.5 per cent following April's 2.6 per cent decline - was the latest piece of evidence confirming that the post-war snapback is long in coming. Corporate America continues to focus on balance sheet repair. The saving grace is that, encouraged by a still-buoyant housing market, underwritten by the Fed's efforts, and with tax cuts to come, the repair of US household balance sheets has been postponed. Yesterday's statement repeated the soothing, two-pronged approach adopted in May: the upside and downside risks to growth are roughly balanced, but the risk of an unwelcome substantial fall in inflation exceeds that of a pickup in inflation. This is a difficult balancing act. If the economic recovery does not materialise, equity markets will fall; but if it does, the bond market's recent weakness could quickly turn into a fierce reversal. London Edition 1.

528,34.0,1995-11-16,"Positive news on the French fiscal deficit combined with fundamentals pointing to lower growth and waning inflationary pressure buoyed the European bond markets yesterday. The German and UK markets rose strongly in morning trading before losing some ground in the afternoon due to a combination of profit-taking and disappointing inflation statistics in the US. The dollar stabilised, but its weakness in Asia overnight contributed to underperformance by high-yielding bonds, with the 10-year yield spread of Italian bonds over German bunds widening by 3 basis points to 535 points. French bonds responded positively to news of the government's plans to reduce its social security deficit. Prime Minister Alain Juppe said the deficit would fall to FFr 17bn in 1996. On Matif the 10-year December future gained more than half a point, while the three-month Pibor contract closed up 0.10 at 94.17, continuing its strong recent advance. German bond prices rose strongly after a cut in the securities repurchase rate fanned expectations of a reduction in interest rates. The repo rate cut of two basis points was in line with expectations, taking it down to 3.98%. Mr Graham McDevitt bond strategist with Banque Paribas, said the change in the headline number from 'four' to 'three' had an important 'psychological impact' on the markets. There are hopes in some quarters that the discount rate could be reduced when the Bundesbank's council meets today. 'While the market call is for no change in official rates, we are definitely entering the 'amber alert zone' now for an early German rate cut,' said Mr David Brown at Bear Stearns. 'We tend to put the chances of a 25 basis point discount rate cut at 50:50 tomorrow, as all the pre-conditions are pointing to lower rates.' Fresh economic data in the UK provided further evidence that the economy is slowing and helped gilts continue their rally. On Liffe, the December long gilt contract surged to a high of 108 3/8, before falling back in the afternoon, partially as a result of sterling weakness. It closed at 107 31/32, down 5/32. US Treasury prices ended lower yesterday after the Federal Reserve's Open Market Committee finished its meeting without changing monetary policy. Late in the session, the benchmark 30-year Treasury was unchanged at 107 27/32 to yield 6.283%, while the two-year note slipped 3/32 to 100 3/16, yielding 5.504%. Few on Wall Street believed the FOMC would cut rates before Congress and the president had agreed to a deficit-cutting package, but traders said there was some buying early yesterday on hopes that the Fed might surprise the market. Once the FOMC meeting was over, however, attention turned to the new supply due next week when the Treasury is to hold auctions of three-year and 10-year notes that have been delayed since last week. In Washington, skirmishing continued between Congress and the administration over a deficit-reducing budget package but Mr Robert Rubin, treasury secretary, said his actions to circumvent the debt ceiling should allow the Treasury to continue making payments until at least late December. Economic data released yesterday was mixed. Industrial production was down 0.3% in October, but September's figure was revised to an increase of 0.1% from the originally reported decline of 0.2%. Capacity utilisation slipped to 83.6 in October from 84.1 in September. (c) The Financial Times Limited 1995.

529,35.0,1995-07-07,"The dollar yesterday fell slightly after the Federal Reserve's decision to cut the federal funds rate by 25 basis points to 5.75%, writes Philip Gawith. An early assessment of the impact of the Fed's move was that it could help the dollar if, as has been the case recently, it took its lead from the bond market which responded positively. Further out, however, the prognoses is more negative, with some analysts predicting that the removal of interest rate support would cause it to retest historic lows around DM 1.3450. In the immediate aftermath of the Fed's announcement, the dollar was trading around DM 1.3780, down from the London close of DM 1.3816. Against the yen it traded at Y 85.14. It finished in New York at DM 1.3789 and Y 84.955. Foreign exchanges had earlier had a very quiet day, with traders and investors content to take to the sidelines until the outcome of the FOMC meeting was known. Sterling maintained its firmer tone, with the trade weighted index closing at 83.6 from 83.3. Against the D-Mark it finished at DM 2.2087, from DM 2.2019. Against the dollar it closed at $1.5987 from $1.5918. Elsewhere, there were interest rate cuts in France and Denmark. The Bank of France, as expected, cut the 5-10 day lending rate to 7.25% from 7.5%, while in Denmark the discount rate was cut to 5.75% from 6%. Pessimism about the dollar's medium term outlook stems from the fear that the market will see this cut in rates as the first of a sequence. 'If a 6% funds rate could not hold the currency, there is little chance of a 5 3/4% rate doing any better,' said Mr Jeremy Hawkins, chief economist at Bank of America in London. Mr Gerard Lyons, chief economist at DKB International in London endorsed this view, but said the dollar would be more stable against the yen because there were signs that Japanese investors were diversifying from yen assets to D-Mark assets. Certainly, there is broad agreement that developments in Japan remain critical to developments on the dollar. Mr Robin Marshall, chief economist at Chase Manhattan in London, said the key issue was the recapitalisation of the banking system, necessary if financial flows out of the country were to be unblocked. Mr Paul Chertkow, head of global currency research at UBS in London, said there were two conflicting views of the currency implications of developments in Japan. One view was that further weakness in the Nikkei would prompt repatriation of offshore assets by Japanese investors, further strengthening the yen. The other view, held by Mr Chertkow, is that the strong yen is already fully discounted (the forward rate one year out is Y 81.15), with capital market participants preparing to take more money out of Japan. The recent pattern in UK money markets of fairly tight liquidity conditions persisted, with overnight money rising to 7 3/8% as the Bank of England provided only #454m at established rates towards clearing a #850m shortage. It provided #210m late assistance. Mr Philip Shaw, economist at Union plc, said he detected that the Bank had 'once again become awkward in buying bills from the market'. He suggested three possible motives: First, it wanted to ensure that three-month LIBOR did not fall below the 6.75% base rate, as it had done for most of the March-June period. Second, 'it may be paying more attention to one-month LIBOR. This is currently at 6.63% and barring just a few occasions has been continually below base rates since mid-1994. In fact, over the past year the one-month/base rate spread has averaged -22 basis points; typically it is close to zero. Third, with the Bank known to be concerned about currency weakness, keeping overnight rates firm was a disincentive to shorting the pound. The franc was barely changed after rates were cut, finishing at FFr 3.498 per D-Mark from FFr 3.497. Mr Chertkow predicted that the Bank of France might well, in the months ahead, be more aggressive than the Bundesbank in cutting rates. Taking a minority view, he said lower rates would be well received in financial markets as a vote of confidence in French fiscal policy. (c) The Financial Times Limited 1995. ",MARKETS REPORT - FEDERAL RESERVE CUTS FUNDS RATE TO 5.75%.,1995-07-06,The Financial Times
530,36.0,1995-07-07,"US Treasury prices surged yesterday after the Federal Reserve's Open Market Committee cut the Federal funds target rate by 25 basis points to 5.75%. Late in the session the benchmark 30-year Treasury was 1 13/32 higher at 114 9/16 to yield 6.505. At the short end of the maturity spectrum, the two-year note jumped 3/4 at 100 1/8 to yield 5.540. In lowering interest rates the FOMC said that 'inflationary pressures have receded enough to accommodate a modest adjustment in monetary conditions'. This added to the bond rally by suggesting that the members of the Fed were not concerned about inflation, which can erode the value of long-term bonds. Bonds have rallied since early June as a string of weak economic data suggested to many investors that the Fed might lower interest rates this week. Early yesterday, however, bonds slipped in quiet trading amid renewed fears that the Fed might leave rates steady. Both the index of leading economic indicators and the weekly release of data on new claims for unemployment benefits were in line with economists' expectations and therefore failed to move the bond market. Soon after the announcement of the rate cut, traders turned their attention to June unemployment figures set to be released today. The median economic estimate holds that non-farm jobs will have increased by about 125,000 to reverse May's 101,000 decline, but the figure is expected to be an important factor when the Fed meets to consider interest rate policy again next month. Mr Bill Curtin, chief fixed-income strategist at Lehman Brothers, said he thought the report could be stronger than expected and that might spook investors. But, he added, in general the economy is relatively weak which should be good for Treasuries in the longer term. European government bonds fell back yesterday as traders awaited the FOMC decision. German government bonds declined in spite of favourable unemployment data. Reports of comments by Mr Hans Tietmeyer, which suggested that he saw little scope for a cut in German interest rates for the time being, depressed bunds in early trading. Dealers today will be focusing on US non-farm payroll data. French government bonds fell sharply in spite of a move by the Bank of France to lower its five to 10-day lending rate to 7.25%. Fresh supply, following a FFr 21bn auction of OATs, weighed on prices at the long end of the market. Traders said the cut in the lending rate had already been priced into the market. But Mr Huw Roberts, European bond strategist at NatWest Markets, said there could be further cuts soon, probably as early as next week, following comments earlier this week by Mr Jean-Claude Trichet, governor of the Bank of France. Mr Trichet said that the new French budget was stringent enough for the central bank to allow interest rates to 'return progressively to a normal level'. Mr Roberts thinks that there are further gains to be made at the short end of the French market. He said the French yield curve is currently very flat - with the spread in yields between two and 10-year bonds at 109 basis points, compared with 171 in Germany - which means that the curve could steepen in coming days with the short-end outperforming. The September notional futures contract on Matif settled down 0.6 point at 114.04. UK government bonds fell back, although they outperformed most other European markets. They rose in early trading with dealers reporting flows out of bunds into gilts, primarily on the futures exchange. The spread over bunds narrowing to 158 basis points, before gilts fell back in later trade. The spread over bunds settled at around 160 basis points. The long gilt future on Liffe was at 104 7/32 in late trade, up 1/32 on the day. (c) The Financial Times Limited 1995.

AMSTERDAM broke through a new barrier but just failed at the finish to set a new all-time high, as the AEX index ended 1.34 firmer at 440.04. It had earlier seen an intraday peak of 440.73. There was no stopping Philips, which steered the market to its high, the shares gaining Fl 2.70 or nearly 4% at Fl 72.30, and just off a high of Fl 72.70. Polygram made 70 cents to Fl 93.90. All the action was not one way, however. There was further bad news for Fokker, which said that it expected the first-half net loss to be higher than that seen over 1994, which was Fl 449m. This would mean that shareholders equity would fall well below half of the issued share capital, the company added. The stock plunged Fl 1.10 or 10% to Fl 9.80. Royal Dutch was hit by the possibility of a US law suit, tumbling Fl 2.10 to Fl 188.30. STOCKHOLM's attention remained focused on Ericsson in an otherwise cautious market which saw the Affarsvarlden index rise 6.3 to another all-time high of 1,681.3.

533,39.0,1998-12-23,"US manufacturing industry has called for a 10% tax cut for companies and individuals as a way of sustaining the country's seven-year economic expansion. The call came as the US Federal Reserve left interest rates unchanged and as new forecasts predicted a sharp slowdown in growth next year. The National Association of Manufacturers said a 10% tax cut, costing $80bn ( #47.6bn) a year, would lead to sharp increases in consumption and investment. Otherwise, it said economic growth would slow next year to about 2.1%, down from 3.6% this year and below potential output growth of 3%. The tax cut, it said, would allow growth next year of 3%, rising to 4% in 2000 and 2.9% in 2001. It said the main factors contributing to the long economic expansion - investment, personal consumption and exports - would not hold up next year without such a cut in tax rates. ""Exports, already down in 1998, are expected to deteriorate further next year due to continued troubles in Asia, and a likely slowdown in Latin America,"" it said. Business investment would also slow as companies' profits came under pressure because they had little power to raise prices. Consumers, already dipping into investments to spend, would also retrench next year. The Fed's decision to hold rates unchanged, following the last meeting this year of the policy setting Federal Open Market Committee, was expected and was to some extent signalled after the previous meeting in November. Then, the Fed cut interest rates by a quarter point for the third time in seven weeks in response, it said, to strains in the financial markets. Those market strains, which emerged after the Russian debt default in August, appear to have eased, and analysts were expecting the Fed to begin to focus on evidence of weakness in the real economy. In a separate forecast, Standard &Poor's, the US credit rating agency, said the economy would slow sharply in the first half of next year, growing annually at 1%. Growth would accelerate somewhat in the second half to give a 2% figure for the whole year, it said. Nonetheless, there remained a 40% chance that the economy would sink into recession in 1999 - though if it did, it would be a mild one, S&P said. It predicted the Fed would over the course of the year resume its interest rate reductions. The current Fed Funds rate of 4 3/4% would be cut to 4% by the year end, it said. David Blitzer, S&P's chief economist, said: ""Consumers have been the driving force for the economy, but they cannot keep increasing their spending twice as fast as their earnings. ""Other sectors of the economy - foreign trade, capital spending, government spending and housing - are not big enough or strong enough to replace the consumer as the growth engine.""

By midsession, the Dow Jones Industrial Average had clambered back above the 9,000-point level.

US Treasuries were weaker, with the benchmark 30-year bond falling 25/32 to 102 3/32, yielding 5.112%. By early afternoon the Dow had gained 13.65 at 9,002.50, while the Standard &Poor's 500 index was down 1.15 to 1,201.69. Cyclical consumer shares were the main movers in the Dow, with Coca Cola up $1 1/2 to $67 1/4 and Procter &Gamble up $2 1/2 at $89 1/2. But Goodyear Tire, another Dow member, fell $1 15/16 to $50 3/8 after Morgan Stanley cut the stock to a ""neutral"" rating from ""strong buy"". The Nasdaq composite was down 13.01 to 2,125.02 as major computer shares, ranging from Intel to Compaq Computer fell back, one day after Monday's rally sent the Nasdaq and the S&P 500 to new record closes.

535,41.0,2004-08-11,"The US Federal Reserve raised its target interest rate by a quarter point to 1.5 per cent yesterday, and gave no indication that recent weaker economic data would rein in its intention to tighten monetary policy at a measured pace. The policymaking Federal open market committee noted: ""In recent months, output growth has moderated and the pace of improvement in labour market conditions has slowed."" In line with Congress testimony of Alan Greenspan, Fed chairman, the statement said: ""This softness likely owes importantly to the substantial rise in energy prices. The economy nevertheless appears poised to resume a stronger pace of expansion."" The rest of the statement was unchanged from June's, with the Fed reiterating that, with underlying inflation expected to be relatively low, rates could be moved back towards a more neutral level ""at a pace likely to be measured"". The rate increase was expected despite weaker economic activity at the end of the second quarter and a weak July jobs report. Some Fed-watchers predicted the central bank would give itself greater flexibility in its guidance following Friday's announcement that US employers added only 32,000 jobs to payrolls in July. The yield on the two-year Treasury note rose 10 basis points to 2.54 per cent following the announcement and the 10-year yield rose 5 basis points to 4.3 per cent. The S&P 500 rose 1 per cent and the dollar strengthened. Futures contracts suggested investors raised the probability of a September rate increase from below 50 to above 70 per cent. The US labour department reported that productivity grew at a 2.9 per cent annual rate in the second quarter in the non-farm business sector, slower than the 3.7 per cent in the first quarter but above consensus expectations of a 2 per cent rate.

536,42.0,1994-08-17,"The US Federal Reserve yesterday announced a 50 basis-point increase in the discount rate to 4% from 3.5%, writes Philip Gawith. The dollar's initial response was favourable, jumping from DM 1.5515 before the announcement to DM 1.5660 against the D-Mark. Traders reported a surge of interest in US Treasury bonds, which should help the dollar. New York trading finished with the US currency at DM 1.5615. The decision by the Federal Open Market Committee, the policy-making arm of the Fed, was favourably received by analysts, who described it as a 'healthy, decisive move'. The rate increase was the fifth this year by the Fed. It said in a statement that it expected its actions 'to be sufficient, at least for a time, to meet the objective of sustained non-inflationary growth'. The Federal Funds rate - the benchmark for US short-term rates - will rise to 4.75% from 4.25%. Ahead of the FOMC's announcement, which came at 17.17 GMT, currency trading across the board was fairly listless, with volumes low and currencies moving in fairly narrow ranges. The D-Mark was slightly easier as some investors took profits, anticipating a rise in US rates. Sterling had an uneventful day, with the trade weighted index unchanged all day at 78.8. Analysts welcomed both the extent of the Fed's move and the rhetoric accompanying it. Mr Tim Stewart, currency strategist at Morgan Stanley, commented: 'This goes a long way to instilling credibility in the Fed both in terms of its actions and by its rhetoric.' He said the dollar had been given a good deal of support at the DM 1.55 level. Mr Stewart said the dollar would probably take its cue from the Treasury bond market, where the early outlook was encouraging with signs of foreign investors buying. Mr Stewart added that the Fed would be unlikely to move rates again before its November meeting. He is not predicting a further rise this year. But Mr Julian Jessop, international economist at Midland Global Markets, predicted that the Fed Funds rate would probably rise to 5% this year, still a long way short of the 5.85% being discounted by the December Eurodollar contract. Ahead of the FOMC, activity in the interest rate futures markets was subdued. The December short sterling contract traded only 13,400 lots, but closed four basis points firmer at 93.23, helped by a lower than expected July public sector borrowing figure, and the CBI distributive trades survey showing that consumer spending remains patchy. Mr Nick Parsons, treasury economist at CIBC in London, said the market was still 'far too gloomy' about the outlook for rates. He noted that at the beginning of the year, December short sterling reflected three-month interest rates at 4.4% by the end of 1994. This figure is now close to 6.8% - 'a massive turnaround by any standards'. Mr Parsons noted that, going back to 1989, three-month LIBOR, as implied from the futures market, had never closed more than 82 basis points above the base rate. But even if UK rates jump by 3/4 percentage point to 6%, the December contract is still nearly 80 basis points above this level. 'It is hard to see what will drive three-month rates to 6.8% by December,' said Mr Parsons. Ms Liz Ward, economist at Bank Julius Baer in London, makes a similar point, noting that on the March 1995 futures contract for sterling and D-Mark rates, the expected differential has widened from a low of 52 basis points in March to around 200 basis points now. Ms Ward said that while expectations of higher UK short-term rates should have boosted the pound, the reverse has occurred. 'The widening gap seems to have reflected market perceptions of a weaker pound ahead. The causation is flowing from the currency to interest rates, rather than vice versa.' She cited two other factors which explain the 6% fall in the pound against the D-Mark this year. One is that sterling has traded like a 'transatlantic' currency, following roughly half of the 6.7% move down in the dollar. The other is that 'exchange markets have ignored strong UK fundamentals for even stronger ones in Germany'. There also appears to be a belief that the German recovery is less likely than the UK one to foster inflation. Although purchasing power parity estimates suggest the pound is nearly 10% undervalued against the D-Mark, Ms Ward said it is difficult to make a case for buying pounds 'without a convincing move on base rates first'. Sterling finished at DM 2.3951 from DM 2.4061 and at $1.5401 from $1.5467. The Bank of England did not operate in the morning or afternoon rounds yesterday, providing UK money markets with only #90m late assistance after earlier forecasting a #350m shortage.

537,43.0,1994-08-17,"But critics fear the interest rate increases might hamper economic growth, writes George Graham. The US Federal Reserve's decision yesterday to raise short term interest rates was almost universally expected, but the argument over whether this is the right step to take is not so one-sided. In its statement announcing an increase of half a percentage point in both the discount and federal funds rates, the Fed said it was acting 'against the background of evidence of continuing strength in the economic expansion and high levels of resource utilisation'. 'The actions are intended to keep inflationary pressures contained and thereby foster sustainable economic growth,' the Fed said. But administration officials and Democratic members of Congress are worried that the Fed might be too jittery about prices rises that are still scarcely visible to the naked eye: in its zeal to kill off inflation 18 months down the road, does it not risk killing off an already slowing economic recovery before its time? Mr Lloyd Bentsen, the Treasury secretary, and Ms Laura D'Andrea Tyson, the chairman of the White House Council of Economic Advisers, were conciliatory yesterday in their joint statement. 'The administration recognises and respects the independence of the Federal Reserve to make decisions about the nation's monetary policies. We share a common goal with the Federal Reserve of sustained growth with low inflation,' they said. There is not much more the administration can do, except back the Fed's board with new appointees. That seems to be having little effect, for yesterday's vote was unanimous, despite the addition to the board of Mr Alan Blinder and Ms Janet Yellen, two Clinton nominees. Democratic senators were more forthright in their criticism of the Fed's decision. Senator George Mitchell, the majority leader, called it unwise and Senator Paul Sarbanes, who will take over next year as chairman of the banking committee, urged the Fed to 'leave the economy alone'. 'The economy is doing pretty well but every time the Fed takes the rates up it dampens economic activity,' he said. Many business groups share this concern. But the financial markets side firmly with the Fed on the need to deal with brewing signs of inflation. Even an increase of a quarter of a percentage point yesterday would have been greeted with disappointment as a sign that the Fed was 'behind the curve' on inflation. The members of the Federal Open Market Committee are less godlike in their certitude than the markets. They appear to have taken to heart Oliver Cromwell's advice to the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland: 'I beseech you, in the bowels of Christ, think it possible you may be mistaken.' Mr Alan Greenspan, the Fed's chairman, put it a little differently last week in testimony to a congressional committee last week. 'Policy making requires an assessment of the consequences of various policy alternatives should they prove to be wrong. We must ask ourselves: how difficult would it be to reverse policy mistakes and at what cost?' The committee also includes five presidents of regional Federal Reserve banks. They stay in close touch with business leaders in their districts, and several of them have in recent weeks made a concerted effort to justify higher interest rates in speeches to community leaders and chambers of commerce. Fed officials say they have not been fully convinced by signs of an economic slowdown in some recent statistics, such as the large increase in business inventories in the second quarter, and argue that the capacity of the job market and industrial plant to absorb more demand is becoming stretched. The Fed said yesterday that its half point increase in rates was 'expected to be sufficient, at least for a time, to meet the objective of sustained, non-inflationary growth.' That probably averts the likelihood of further tightening at next month's committee meeting, but does not appear to rule out the possibility of another increase before the end of the year.

538,44.0,1994-08-17,"Discount rate up half a point; US bonds and stocks rally; Banks increase loan costs. By GEORGE GRAHAM. The US Federal Reserve yesterday lifted short-term interest rates for the fifth time this year, adding half a percentage point in an effort to head off inflation rises. After a morning meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee, which sets interest rate policy, the Fed announced that it was increasing the discount rate which it charges on money lent to the banking system to 4% from 3.5%. The Fed is also raising the federal funds rate, which banks charge each other on overnight balances, to 4.75% from 4.25%. Although an increase in rates had been widely expected, investors and dealers were unsure whether the Fed would raise rates by a quarter of a point or make the sharper adjustment that came yesterday. On Wall Street, the news triggered a surge in bond prices and brought solid gains to stocks. The markets had stumbled briefly in the minutes after the Fed's announcement, but quickly picked up forward momentum during the afternoon. Chase Manhattan raised its prime lending rate for its best business customers to 7.75% from 7.25% in the wake of the Fed move and other banks followed suit. White House officials have repeatedly said that they see no signs of inflation rises that would require a tightening of monetary policy, but add that the Fed is independent. 'Given the strong gains in output and employment so far this year, we need to be watchful for signs of developing price pressures,' Mr Lloyd Bentsen, US Treasury secretary, and Ms Laura Tyson, White House chief economist, said in a joint statement yesterday. Democratic senators, however, were less sparing in their criticism. 'If you're bored down there at the Fed, if a rosy economic outlook makes you blue, get out of town, take a vacation, do any thing, but just don't raise those interest rates,' Senator Dennis DeConcini of Arizona said before the Fed move. Fed officials note that they kept interest rates very low to try to boost sluggish recovery in 1992 and 1993. 'In fact, real short term rates - that is, adjusted for inflation - were around zero levels throughout last year,' Mr Robert Parry, president of the San Francisco Fed, said last week. Most recent economic data have suggested that the economy has slowed considerably, and is growing at a much steadier pace than the 3.7% annualised rate of the second quarter. However, July's employment statistics showed that job creation remained strong, and the producer price index, published last Thursday, showed a 0.5% bounce in wholesale prices last month. Fed officials say that policy actions only show their effects about one-and-a-half to two years later, and that they cannot be deterred by the apparently calm inflation indices. Some Fed economists argue that full employment is now reached when the unemployment rate stands at around 6% - very close to its current level. Any further drop in unemployment, they say, could lead to shortages of labour and be expected to provoke an acceleration in the inflation rate. After the early pause, prices on longer-dated Treasury bonds climbed nearly 1 1/2 points on the rate rise, even though most analysts had anticipated the Fed's course of action. Traders appeared reassured by the apparent resolve of the Fed's chairman, Mr Alan Greenspan, to snuff out inflationary pressures. In the equity markets, the rate rise triggered a brief rally, but in minutes a 20-point gain by the Dow Jones Industrial Average was converted into a 15-point loss. By the close, however, it was up 24.28 at 3,784.57. In Tokyo today, stocks opened firmer. The Bundesbank, which has a policy meeting tomorrow, is expected to let the dust settle after the Fed move. Economists see scope for a German discount rate cut, but believe the bank's 'steady hand' policy will prevail.

Confirmation of a rise in US interest rates came well after the market close, writes Joel Kibazo. The September contract on the FT-SE 100 opened at 3,155 and languished in the first hour. The lower than expected PSBR figure cheered the market, sending the contract ahead to reach a peak of 3,169. However, a combination of profit-taking together with concerns that the FMOC would raise interest rates saw the contract give up the early gains. Following a bout of sideways trading over the lunchtime period, September again moved forward, this time encouraged by the firm opening on Wall Street. But the worries on interest rates remained, which brought another setback and September finished just ahead of the day's low at 3,153, a point ahead of its previous close and at a 5-point premium to cash. Volume at 6,766 lots remained low. Traded options stayed dull and total turnover was 22,268 lots. Two big trades in Hanson puts were the only outstanding feature in the stock options.

The FT-SE 100 Index settled with a net gain of 5.1 at 3,147.3, having moved in a narrow range throughout the day. The FT-SE Mid 250 Index delivered another uninspiring performance, closing 4.1 lower at 3,715.1. While dealers remained on alert for the rise in US rates, which could impact on the large number of UK stocks traded on Wall Street, the move of 50 basis points in the Fed Funds rate came two hours after London closed. The market began the trading session in subdued fashion with marketmakers lowering their opening prices in the wake of an eight-point fall on the Dow Industrial Average. The early decline proved short-lived, however, as a lower than expected public sector borrowing requirement number of #1.1bn, compared with a consensus figure up around #1.5bn, boosted gilt-edged stocks and produced a keen rally in the equity market. Gilts were also supported by the latest survey of disitributive trades published by the Confederation of British Industry which pointed to a slowing of retail sales, a move interpreted in the City as reducing the possibility of an early increase in UK interest rates. Down some three points at the outset, the FT-SE 100 moved into positive territory within the hour, gradually climbing to reach the day's high point of 3,151.6, up 9.4, shortly after Wall Street opened and while the US Federal Open Market Committee meeting was in progress. But with Wall Street faltering, before embarking on another good rise after London had closed, the UK market began to ease off. As well as having to contend with an expected rise in US interest rates, the market has to face a welter of domestic economic news this morning. This will include unemployment figures for July, average earnings and, most importantly, inflation numbers for last month. Some forecasters are looking for a negative inflation result month on month. Turnover yesterday came out at 511.8m shares, with non-FT-SE 100 stocks accounting for around 57% of activity. The value of customer business on Monday was a slightly disappointing #1.145bn. Meanwhile, a buzz of excitement went around the trading desks in the late afternoon as dealers picked up whispers that a big FT-SE 100 bid could be in the offing. GEC was one name being bandied about as a potential bid target for one of the big conglomerates such as BTR or Hanson. This story was mostly dismissed by analysts, who pointed out that GEC was much more likely to emerge as a predator than a target. And traders again began to focus on the obvious benefits of a merger between British Aerospace and GEC, which have been involved in tentative merger talks in the past. There was heavy trading in GEC stock, with one leading UK broking house said to have bought the stock aggressively, while British Aerospace shares were being chased in the market. Marketmakers also pointed out that GEC was in a strong position to buy in its own shares. Another takeover candidate, according to the market, was Wellcome, the pharmaceuticals group, with Glaxo one name being mooted. The regional electricity stocks were also being viewed as potential takeover targets. Bank shares continued to attract switching, with HSBC again badly affected by worries of static underlying profits growth. Bank of Scotland and Standard Chartered were the prime beneficiaries of the stories. Dealers pointed to Goldman Sachs, UBS and Morgan Stanley as brokers advising the switch.

FRANKFURT had its fun in the post bourse as the September bund future took a view on the Washington meeting, and jumped 44 basis points to 91.99 on the proposition that the Fed would impose a 50-point rate rise later in the US day, a forecast that was later confirmed. After a rise of just 4.30 to 2,143.14 in the Dax on the session, the post bourse saw an Ibis-indicated peak of 2,158.13 before it closed at 2,152.65. However, Ms Barbara Altmann at B Metzler in Frankfurt, said there was little trading as investors bided their time ahead of the FOMC decision; short-covering, she added, took the Dax constituents up in the afternoon. Turnover rose from DM 5.1bn to DM 6.6bn. Schering, the pharmaceuticals group, dropped DM 42.50 to DM 915 as it said that two of its drugs were under examination, and regained only DM 6 after hours after stating that neither were carcinogenic and calling a press conference for tomorrow morning to elaborate. Construction stocks were strong, Strabag rising DM 17.50 to DM 510.50 on a 20% increase in orders in the first half of 1994. In chemicals, BASF rose DM 4.90 to DM 327.20 as its Wintershall subsidiary forecast a profit from its gas operations in 1995, a year earlier than originally planned. AMSTERDAM recovered all of Monday's losses, helped by good gains in a number of the blue chips. The AEX index improved 1.89 to 417.07. Unilever rose Fl 3.10 to Fl 199.60, a number of brokers having issued positive reports following last week's results. Among them was James Capel, which reiterated its buy recommendation and remained optimistic about earnings per share growth during 1995 and 1996. Philips and KPN also saw buying strength as they announced plans to establish a joint venture, together with Graff Pay-Per-View, of the US, to provide a new media service in Europe. Philips put on 30 cents at Fl 58.20 and KPN added 70 cents at Fl 50.50. Hunter Douglas shed Fl 1.30 to Fl 83.70 as profits were taken following its better than expected results, while Wolters Kluwer added Fl 1.50 at Fl 120.50 after announcing a 23% gain in first-half profits and forecasting 20% growth over the full year. MILAN returned after Monday's holiday and continued to monitor the political temperature, following last week's unexpected rise in interest rates and a weekend of meetings between coalition partners in Mr Silvio Berlusconi's government. The Comit index closed 9.72 higher at 654.15. Analysts expect the nervousness to continue, with the 1995 budget due to be presented to parliament before September 30. Among individual performances, Fiat advanced L35 to L6,385, Benetton rose L650 to L22,450 and Olivetti L75 to L2,195. ZURICH took the Frankfurt line on FOMC prospects and the SMI index rose 18.1 to 2,588.7. Roche certificates and Nestle were the most active stocks, with gains either side of 1%. In banks, UBS recovered with a rise of SwFr 25 to SwFr 1,112, and SBC bearers rose SwFr 3 to SwFr 397 ahead of results which arrived after hours. However, analysts flinched when they saw the figures, which included a 63% drop in first-half trading income, and said that the shares would tumble today. MADRID fell against the trend, the general index losing 1.71 at 311.18. Bonds were slightly firmer but most banks were down, with BBV off Pta45 at Pta3,040 and BCH Pta80 at Pta2,665. ADR stocks such as Endesa, Pta50 lower at Pta6,010, and Repsol, down Pta95 at Pta3,930, became less attractive as Wall Street lost its impetus late in the European day. PARIS drifted higher in a session that was characterised by a lack of corporate news. The CAC-40 index improved 5.40 to 2,012.35 in thin turnover of about FFr 2bn. STOCKHOLM staged a modest recovery as the market reversed three days of losses. Ericsson, the telecommunications group, provided the main support for the market, but shares in the forestry sector were also strong. The Affarsvarlden general index was little changed, down 0.3 at 1,400.3, in moderate turnover of SKr2.2bn. Ericsson B shares rose SKr4 to SKr393 ahead of tomorrow's six-month figures, while Electrolux lost SKr3 at SKr368 in spite of reporting an improvement in half-year results. TEL AVIV fell another 2%, the Mishtanim index closing 3.74 lower at 183.40 after the Israeli finance minister Mr Avraham Shohat said Israel's 1994 inflation rate would be double digit, revising an official forecast of 8%. Mr Shohat had more news for the market after hours when he proposed a capital gains tax on share profits, specifically a 10% tax on real profits from share investments.

542,48.0,2009-06-25,"No plans to expand asset purchases 'Output gap' guards against inflation The Federal Reserve is on hold - but it expects quite a long time to pass before it starts raising interest rates again. That is the basic message from yesterday's statement. The central bank did not increase its planned asset purchases, which amounts to no additional easing. However, it simultaneously rebuffed market expectations of early rate increases. The Fed said it ""continues to anticipate that economic conditions are likely to warrant exceptionally low levels of the federal funds rate for an extended period"". It noted that ""prices of energy and other commodities have risen"" and importantly dropped a reference to deflation risk. But it said ""substantial resource slack is likely to dampen cost pressures"" and added that it ""expects that inflation will remain subdued for some time"". These last three words were new and reinforce the message. This reflects the view of Ben Bernanke, the Fed chairman, and Don Kohn, Fed vice-chairman, that a large and growing output gap between demand and potential supply provides a strong safeguard against inflation. The decision was unanimous, with more hawkish members of the Federal Open Market Committee apparently accepting the guidance on interest rates in return for no increase in Treasury purchases. The central bank said it would continue to evaluate the ""timing and overall amounts of its purchases of securities"" - leaving open the possibility that it could still adjust its Treasury -purchase plan at or before its next meeting. ""I think there is still a good chance that in order to avoid the cliff edge effect they will stretch it out and may change the mix between Treasuries and mortgages,"" said Richard Berner, chief US economist at Morgan Stanley. But the lack of any clear signal on this in the statement suggests the Fed is not predisposed to expand the Treasury programme and might simply complete it as scheduled in September. Peter Hooper, chief economist at Deutsche Bank Securities said: ""They are delivering more or less the promised degree of stimulus, in the context of an economy where the news is improving and rates are backing up."" The Fed did say it would ""make adjustments to its credit and liquidity programmes as warranted"". One interpretation of this phrase is that the Fed wants to retain flexibility to tweak its programmes even if the overall stance of policy is hold. Another is that this was an oblique reference to the gradual phasing out of some programmes as market conditions improve. There was no explicit reference to exit strategy. The US central bank marked up its assessment of current economic conditions, but did not radically reappraise its economic -outlook. It said the pace of the recession was ""slowing"" and said conditions in financial markets ""have generally improved"". There were ""further signs of -stabilising"" household spending, while businesses ""appear to be making progress"" on inventories. However, the Fed said household spending ""remains constrained by ongoing job losses, lower housing wealth and tight credit"" while business were ""cutting back on fixed investment and staffing"". It reiterated its cautious view that ""economic activity is likely to remain weak for a time"". While the immediate market response was to sell Treasuries and push up yields, on the grounds that the Fed was not buying any more of them, Bill Gross, founder of Pimco, told CNBC he was surprised by this response and thought yields on short-term securities should trade lower on the statement.",Consensus reflects easing and rates trade-off,2009-06-24,The Financial Times
543,49.0,2009-06-25,"wall street US stocks bounced yesterday morning as Oracle boosted the technology sector and investors focused on the positives in a mixed bag of economic data. The software maker helped the technology sector top the benchmark S&P 500 index after reporting sales and profit that were better than Wall Street had expected. Its shares gained 8.7 per cent to $21.60. Two of Oracle's biggest rivals also felt the benefit with Microsoft rising 1.2 per cent to $23.63 and IBM up 1.3 per cent at $105.83. On a busy day for economic data, the markets were reassured by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, which upgraded its forecasts for US growth for 2009 and 2010. The OECD's 2009 forecast is now slightly better than that from the World Bank, whose downgrade of its forecast on Monday helped trigger that day's sell-off. Stocks were given added impetus by figures showing that durable goods orders unexpectedly rose during May. Lower demand for cars had been expected to drag the number lower and the figures helped Ford climb 5.3 per cent to $5.83. Meanwhile, materials producers and industrial companies performed well. Metals stocks continued Tuesday's recovery following a sharp sell-off on Monday, boosted by the durable goods numbers and higher commodity prices. Alcoa , which produces aluminium, rose 4.9 per cent to $10.49 while Free-port McMoRan , the copper miner, which was upgraded by Friedman Billings Ramsey, picked up 6.4 per cent to $50.20. AK Steel advanced 5.5 per cent to $18.65 and Caterpillar , which makes machinery for the mining industry, was 3.6 per cent higher at $34.17. The materials sector was initially given an extra boost by results from Monsanto , the agricultural giant, which beat estimates with its quarterly earnings. But the shares fell 1.5 per cent to $78.15 after the company said gross profit from its Roundup herbicide would fall roughly 50 per cent because of increased competition. The markets dipped in early trade after figures were released showing that new home sales unexpectedly fell in May but stocks then quickly recovered. ""The fact that the market completely shrugged off the new home sales data had me stunned,"" said Dan Cook, senior market analyst at IG Markets. ""But technology and materials stocks seem to be providing support right now."" By midday, the benchmark S&P 500 index was up 1.5 per cent to 908.56. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.9 per cent to 8,396.90 and the Nasdaq Composite index picked up 2.2 per cent to 1,803.72. Many on Wall Street remained cautious ahead of the end of the meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee, however, with investors looking for signals on when the Federal Reserve might implement an exit strategy from its stimulus programme. Financial stocks were higher after figures showed mortgage applications rose last week as interest rates dropped from recent levels. They then continued to climb in spite of suffering a brief dip on the new home sales data. By midday, Wells Fargo , which Citi said yesterday would see sufficient business in its mortgage department to give it strong second-quarter results, was 1.4 higher at $23.22. Citigroup also picked up ground, helped by the news that it intends to increase employees' base salaries in 2009 as part of an effort to retain top talent. Its shares climbed 1.3 per cent to $3.05. Meanwhile, Darden Restaurants , which owns several leading US mid-market chains, including Olive Garden and Red Lobster, also beat estimates with its earnings but its shares fell as the company warned 2010 would not be as good a year as hoped. The stock lost 1.9 per cent to $32.39. There was more bad news from the supermarket chain SuperValu , which warned lower customer spending would see quarterly results come in substantially below analysts' predictions. The stock fell 11.9 per cent to $13.83 and the words also had an effect on its rival Kroger , which reported lower quarterly revenues than expected on Tuesday.

544,50.0,2009-06-25,"GLOBAL OVERVIEW Libor falls after ECB injects €442bn Fed likely to play down rate rises Central banks dominated financial market action yesterday as the ECB lent record funds to eurozone banks, the Swiss National Bank moved to weaken the franc and investors awaited the outcome of a Federal Reserve policy meeting. The European Central Bank pumped €442bn ($617bn) into the banking system at a rate of 1 per cent in its first-ever offer of one-year funds - more than analysts had expected. Lorenzo Bini Smaghi, an executive of the ECB's executive board, said that banks must now lend on the funds they had borrowed. In the money markets , the three-month euro Libor rate fell 2.6 basis points to a record low of 1.185 per cent. ""My gut feeling is that all the spare cash flushing around now will drive yields still lower for the next week or two,"" said Erik Nielsen, chief European economist at Goldman Sachs. ""If I had to make a guess, I could well see three-month money 25bp-50bp cheaper by mid-July, which would be about the easing the ECB probably is looking for."" But Christoph Rieger at Commerzbank warned that the excess liquidity posed new challenges for markets and the ECB. ""The amounts involved are so huge that the ECB may not be able to sit on its hands and leave the market to itself."" Mr Rieger added that ""inactivity would . . . leave overnight rates pinned significantly below the ECB's main policy rate for quite some time and, more importantly, money market functioning could be impaired with so much excess reserves in the system."" The ECB's move drove the euro lower against the dollar and pushed up short-dated European government bonds. On the currency markets , the euro dipped 0.3 per cent against the dollar and 0.7 per cent against sterling. But it rose sharply against the Swiss franc after the Swiss National Bank again stepped into the markets to drive its currency lower in a bid to protect Switzerland's manufacturing sector. The dollar was softer against most higher-yielding currencies as investors awaited the outcome of a two-day meeting of the Federal Reserve. The US central bank was widely expected to play down market expectations of an early rise in interest rates. ""The Federal Open market Committee is expected to reiterate its commitment to keeping policy rates low for an 'extended period',"" said David Greenlaw, Morgan Stanley's chief US fixed income economist, although he added: ""We doubt that the Fed will cite a particular date."" Uncertainty ahead of the Fed's post-meeting comments and fresh concerns about forthcoming supply put pressure on US government bonds . The yield on the 10-year Treasury was up 4bp at 3.67 per cent and the 30-year was 7bp higher at 4.43 per cent. By contrast, the two-year German Schatz yield fell 8bp to 1.41 per cent following the ECB's action and a gloomy assessment of the eurozone's prospects from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. ""The new OECD forecasts still see the eurozone as an underperformer, with a contraction in real GDP of nearly 5 per cent this year followed by stagnation next year - signalling the need for the ECB to exhaust the remaining scope for interest rate cuts sooner rather than later,"" said Marco Annunziata, UniCredit's chief economist. However, the OECD was more upbeat about the global outlook, saying the prospects for economic recovery next year had improved for the first time in two years. The comments, along with robust US durable goods data and strong earnings from software group Oracle, provided a more solid backdrop for equity markets. Investors largely shrugged off disappointing home sales figures. By midday in New York, the S&P 500 was up 1.5 per cent, while the FTSE Eurofirst 300 index gained 2.4 per cent and the Nikkei 225 Average in Tokyo rose 0.4 per cent. In commodities , oil inched higher but failed to regain the $70 a barrel level as weekly US data showed a big drop in crude stockpiles. Copper's push back above $5,000 a tonne led a broad advance in base metals as sentiment was lifted by hopes of increased demand.

On Wednesday the Federal Open Market Committee meeting delivered the expected result - no change in US monetary policy and a toning down in inflation expectations - leaving investors with a clearer message that policy measures would not be withdrawn in the near future. The Fed was also slightly more upbeat on growth prospects, noting that the pace of contraction in the economy was slowing. This was in contrast to the picture developing in South Korea, where, in spite of an upward revision to the government's economic outlook for this year, exports continued to fall while domestic spending weakened. ""The recovery of private domestic demand will probably remain gradual as the debt burden of household and corporate sectors persists,"" said Suktae Oh at Citigroup. ""Export growth is likely to slow as the recent strength, driven by inventory restocking, should be limited by the limited recovery in final demand."" By midday in New York, the Korean won had fallen 0.7 per cent against the dollar, to Won1,258.10, and was 0.3 per cent lower against the yen to Won13.3670. Elsewhere, the yen was down across the board on fears that the rising risk of lower prices will keep the Bank of Japan hamstrung long after other central banks have started removing their accommodative policy measures. Antje Praefcke at Commerzbank said: ""Today's Japanese inflation data are likely to show ongoing rising deflation risks, and this trend should continue, supporting our view that the yen will weaken further in the months to come."" Meanwhile, the latest portfolio flow data showed Japanese investors were heavy buyers of foreign bonds. The yen fell 0.5 per cent against the dollar to Y96.13 and was down 0.4 per cent versus the euro to Y133.89. The dollar edged 0.1 per cent lower to $1.3920 against the euro. The Swiss franc remained on the back foot after Wednesday's intervention by Swiss monetary authorities to weaken the currency. It was down 0.1 per cent against the euro to SFr1.5308 and was 0.2 per cent weaker against the dollar at SFr1.0994. Sterling was weighed down by comments on Wednesday from Mervyn King, governor of the Bank of England, describing Britain's road to economic recovery as ""a long, hard slog"".

546,52.0,2009-06-25,"The US economy continued to contract in the first quarter of this year, but at a slower pace than previously thought, official figures showed on Thursday. Separately, the labour department said that new claims for unemployment benefits grew more than expected last week, offering a stark reminder that even as the economy turns around the stricken labour market could be slow to follow. Revised commerce department figures revealed that US gross domestic product declined by an annualised rate of 5.5 per cent in the first three months of the year. That was better than economists expected and a smaller contraction than the original estimate of a 6.1 per cent contraction and last month's estimate of a 5.7 per cent decline. Output is slowly beginning to rekindle in the US economy, which has been mired in its worst recession in the last 50 years. The first quarter result, while grim, was an improvement from the end of 2008 when GDP declined by 6.3 per cent, the steepest fall since 1982. Economists expect to see more significant improvement in the second quarter of this year. On Wednesday the Federal Reserve said in its Federal Open Market Committee statement that economy activity was likely ""remain weak for a time"" but that sustainable economic growth would then resume gradually while inflation remains ""subdued"". Meanwhile the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development improved its outlook for the US and predicted the economy would grow by 0.9 per cent next year. Housing and manufacturing have shown signs of life lately. Home prices and sales have begun to stabilise in some areas and businesses have begun to ramp up their capital investment with more orders for durable goods. However, analysts fear that rising joblessness could slow the recovery. The labour department said on Thursday that initial jobless claims rose by 15,000 to 627,000 last week. That was more than expected and boosted the four-week average to 617,250. The number of Americans continuing to claim unemployment benefits rose in the second week of the month to 6.74m, up from 6.71m the prior week. ""With initial claims still very high at above 600,000, it is unlikely that new hiring has picked up in any meaningful fashion,"" said Joshua Shapiro, chief US economist at MFR. ""More probable is that long-term unemployed are starting to fall off the rolls as the duration of their unemployment benefits reaches the statutory limit.""

CA shares were also hit by concerns over the profit outlook for the French bank. Kepler Capital Markets cut its rating to ""hold"" from ""buy"" and lowered the 2009 profit estimate for 2009 to €945m from €1.92bn.

In the wider market, European bourses were lower, with the Federal Reserve's comments on Wednesday evening leading investors to look ahead to the US central bank's ""exit strategy"" and a withdrawal of market stimulus measures. The Fed did not change interest rate levels and did not expand its planned asset purchases. Ed McKelvey at Goldman Sachs noted several aspects of the FOMC statement that were more hawkish than expected.

548,54.0,1992-10-07,"An open commitment - Gordon Pepper and Anthony Harris call for more transparency in British monetary management. The crisis of confidence which has undermined sterling in the past few days is mainly due to uncertainty about government policy. Yet in countries where monetary policy is not under political control, political difficulties do not normally turn into financial crises. This has led to proposals that the Bank of England should be made independent. We doubt whether this would, of itself, solve the British problem, which is not due only to political interference. The monetary regime has changed frequently and radically over many years, with little success. Monetary targets have regularly been missed. Decisions are made in secret, and are seldom explained, so market doubts go unanswered. Monetary targets will now take the place of exchange rate discipline; but the same forces which have driven Britain out of the ERM will make monetary control more difficult. International flows distort the monetary aggregates in ways which are not yet fully understood, and floating exchange rates have proved very hard to stabilise. The government further proposes that targets should include not only the exchange rate, but also broad and narrow measures of money, and housing and other asset prices. These indicators look well chosen, and would have alerted the authorities to many recent problems. But though the approach is described as new, it is essentially the traditional British system, and revives an old problem. It is impossible to keep multiple targets always in the sights of a single weapon, the interest rate regime. Something on the list will always look out of line; and sometimes objectives will be incompatible, as they are now. Policy cannot both support the exchange rate, and reduce real interest rates so as to relieve debtors and restore the growth of credit and money. Policy must be a compromise. Market acceptance will, therefore, depend on restoring confidence in official judgment. That is the aim of our proposal: to enable the markets to monitor the reasoning behind policy decisions, and to strengthen the policy process by bringing in well-regarded outsiders. Proposal: the UK should set up an Open Market Committee (OMC), similar to the FOMC of the US Federal Reserve. This would have full executive responsibility for monetary policy. At the moment the chancellor is nominally responsible, but the Bank and Number 10 Downing Street make their own inputs. When any policy fails, the buck passes rapidly round this triangle; this may be intended to protect reputations, but further undermines confidence. An OMC could not disown its decisions in this way; Publication: honest differences of opinion will always arise in matters of policy. The market is likely to have more confidence in decisions - even those which prove mistaken - if it knows what facts and interpretations were involved in reaching them. The minutes of the OMC should, therefore, be published after a minimum delay, as are those of the FOMC (six weeks in arrears). They should report the sometimes dissenting views expressed in reaching a decision, and should also include the committee's assessment of each of the indicators for policy, with full explanation if any is judged misleading at the time. We believe that disclosure on these lines would increase market confidence, partly by reducing uncertainty; Outside directors: British monetary policy is managed by a committee of Bank and Treasury officials. It usually maintains an outside appearance of unanimity and confidence. This has never been fully convincing; at a time when policy has gone off the rails, and leaks tell of furious internal arguments (as after every British crisis), the pretence simply undermines confidence further. Compared with this, the federal structure of the US and German central banks has important advantages. The heads of the Fed districts and the Landesbanks have their own power base, their own local information, and they often hold strongly independent views which are widely known. This assures markets that policy decisions are fully informed and largely politician-proof. It would be hard to imitate such a structure in the UK; but some of the same advantages could be secured by including outside directors or advisers in the OMC. These 'non-executive directors' should not be officials either of the Bank or of the Treasury. As 'insiders', they could not be active in the City during their time on the OMC. They would have a threefold role: to ensure that policy-making is fully informed about private-sector views and problems; to ensure that the OMC minutes convey meaningful information about policy decisions; and to act as potential whistle-blowers if they strongly disagree with the OMC consensus. They should be encouraged to propound and debate policy i n public, as do the directors of the Fed and the Bundesbank; Execution: the OMC would steer policy, and answer for it; but day-to-day execution would remain in the hands of the Bank.

Dealers said yesterday's improvement was partly a technical correction after the market was oversold on Monday. Trading conditions proved volatile yesterday, with the long gilt future opening up 11/32 at 95.16, before falling back to close at 94.30. But the shorter end of the market performed well, recording gains of as much as 3/8 point. 'Sterling holds the key at the moment,' said Mr Phillip Tyson, an economist at UBS Phillips and Drew. The improvement in sterling revived hopes that a further reduction in interest rates would be possible sooner rather than later. The short sterling contract on the London International Financial Futures Exchange gained 6 basis points to close at 91.75. However, dealers expected trading conditions to remain volatile at least until firm details of the government's economic policy emerge following sterling's withdrawal from the exchange rate mechanism. The market will listen keenly to the Chancellor of the Exchequer's speech tomorrow for hints of the form the new economic policy will take. High-yielding European bond markets continued their meteoric fall yesterday. Italian government bonds shed 1 1/2 points, as the lira dived yesterday morning, but recovered some ground later in the day. Spanish bonds fared poorly, recording losses of 1 3/8 points. Non-resident selling pressure pushed prices down further, as fears of a peseta devaluation and worries about the lifting of capital controls depressed sentiment further. Dealers said liquidity in the Spanish bond market was particularly poor. GERMAN bund prices were forced to surrender some of the gains that they made on Monday, ending 1/4 point lower. Dealers said the market had got ahead of itself, but sentiment remained positive. The new 10-year 7 1/4% bund issue met firm demand, dealers said. The results are due to be announced today. Although the rush of buying seen on Monday appeared to have dried up, German bunds are expected to retain their safe haven status, since economic fundamentals remain favourable. The German bund future on Liffe closed at 91.38, down from Monday's close of 91.70. DUTCH bonds fell back after their opening rise, following a steep fall in German bund futures. Dealers said bond prices had gone too high and fell back as stock market turbulence faded. An increased supply from tap issue had also brought prices down, dealers said.

553,59.0,1992-10-07,"The crisis of confidence which has undermined sterling in the past few days is mainly due to uncertainty about government policy. Yet in countries where monetary policy is not under political control, political difficulties do not normally turn into financial crises. This has led to proposals that the Bank of England should be made independent. We doubt whether this would, of itself, solve the British problem, which is not due only to political interference. The monetary regime has changed frequently and radically over many years, with little success. Monetary targets have regularly been missed. Decisions are made in secret, and are seldom explained, so market doubts go unanswered. Monetary targets will now take the place of exchange rate discipline; but the same forces which have driven Britain out of the ERM will make monetary control more difficult. International flows distort the monetary aggregates in ways which are not yet fully understood, and floating exchange rates have proved very hard to stabilise. The government further proposes that targets should include not only the exchange rate, but also broad and narrow measures of money, and housing and other asset prices. These indicators look well chosen, and would have alerted the authorities to many recent problems. But though the approach is described as new, it is essentially the traditional British system, and revives an old problem. It is impossible to keep multiple targets always in the sights of a single weapon, the interest rate regime. Something on the list will always look out of line; and sometimes objectives will be incompatible, as they are now. Policy cannot both support the exchange rate, and reduce real interest rates so as to relieve debtors and restore the growth of credit and money. Policy must be a compromise. Market acceptance will, therefore, depend on restoring confidence in official judgment. That is the aim of our proposal: to enable the markets to monitor the reasoning behind policy decisions, and to strengthen the policy process by bringing in well-regarded outsiders. Proposal: the UK should set up an Open Market Committee (OMC), similar to the FOMC of the US Federal Reserve. This would have full executive responsibility for monetary policy. At the moment the chancellor is nominally responsible, but the Bank and Number 10 Downing Street make their own inputs. When any policy fails, the buck passes rapidly round this triangle; this may be intended to protect reputations, but further undermines confidence. An OMC could not disown its decisions in this way; Publication: honest differences of opinion will always arise in matters of policy. The market is likely to have more confidence in decisions - even those which prove mistaken - if it knows what facts and interpretations were involved in reaching them. The minutes of the OMC should, therefore, be published after a minimum delay, as are those of the FOMC (six weeks in arrears). They should report the sometimes dissenting views expressed in reaching a decision, and should also include the committee's assessment of each of the indicators for policy, with full explanation if any is judged misleading at the time. We believe that disclosure on these lines would increase market confidence, partly by reducing uncertainty; Outside directors: British monetary policy is managed by a committee of Bank and Treasury officials. It usually maintains an outside appearance of unanimity and confidence. This has never been fully convincing; at a time when policy has gone off the rails, and leaks tell of furious internal arguments (as after every British crisis), the pretence simply undermines confidence further. Compared with this, the federal structure of the US and German central banks has important advantages. The heads of the Fed districts and the Landesbanks have their own power base, their own local information, and they often hold strongly independent views which are widely known. This assures markets that policy decisions are fully informed and largely politician-proof. It would be hard to imitate such a structure in the UK; but some of the same advantages could be secured by including outside directors or advisers in the OMC. These 'non-executive directors' should not be officials either of the Bank or of the Treasury. As 'insiders', they could not be active in the City during their time on the OMC. They would have a threefold role: to ensure that policy-making is fully informed about private-sector views and problems; to ensure that the OMC minutes convey meaningful information about policy decisions; and to act as potential whistle-blowers if they strongly disagree with the OMC consensus. They should be encouraged to propound and debate policy in public, as do the directors of the Fed and the Bundesbank; Execution: the OMC would steer policy, and answer for it; but day-to-day execution would remain in the hands of the Bank. We believe this structure would improve the operations of an independent Bank of England. It would be even more important if the Bank is not made formally independent.

554,60.0,1995-05-24,"The French franc remained the focus of attention yesterday as the market responded sceptically to a policy speech by Mr Alain Juppe, the new prime minister, writes Philip Gawith. Plans to tackle unemployment and raise the minimum wage were not well received and the franc lost ground, closing in London at FFr 3.559 per D-Mark, from FFr 3.542. The D-Mark was a general beneficiary of franc weakness, and made gains against most European crosses. It was also firmer against the dollar. Traders did report buying interest when the dollar dipped, an indication of the positive sentiment in the market. This was reinforced by lack of enthusiasm for taking the currency decisively lower. The dollar finished mildly down at DM 1.4362, from DM 1.4482. Against the yen it closed at Y 87.025 from Y 87.715. Opinion ahead of the FOMC meeting was practically unanimous that no change in policy should be expected. In New York the US currency ended at DM 1.4440 and Y 87.175. Sterling had little fresh news to chew on. It lost ground against the firmer D-Mark to close at DM 2.2563, from DM 2.2695. Against the dollar it finished at $1.5711 from $1.5672. The effect of Mr Juppe's speech was to confirm the market's worst expectations about a slide from economic rigour under the new government. Potential spending commitments were mentioned, without any compensating comments about deficit management. Mr Avinash Persaud, currency strategist at JP Morgan in London, said: 'I think it is going to be very hard for the new government to square the circle. The market senses that the one of those three objectives (cutting the deficit, cutting unemployment, and keeping the franc stable) the government is going to be less committed to than before is keeping the exchange rate strong.' Mr Persaud said the prospect of the franc revisiting FFr 3.60 could not be ruled out, but he did not think it would go to FFr 3.90, the upper limit of the EMS band. 'I do not think the Bundesbank will allow it to reach FFr 3.90,' he said. 'Above FFr 3.60 it becomes not just a French problem, but a German problem.' The main reason to cut rates again would be to alleviate the pressures German industry is feeling from a strong D-Mark. Mr Frank Newman, the US deputy treasury secretary, told the OECD gathering in Paris the perception that the US was trying to talk down the dollar was 'absolutely unfounded'. He also said that he saw the overall US trade deficit declining over time. Some economists believe a good US trade performance will be the catalyst for a dollar rally, making people happier to hold dollars, and increasing the prospect of higher US interest rates. Mr Toyoo Gyoten, a special adviser to Japan's Ministry of Finance, said the recent 'erratic' phase of the yen's rise appeared to be over. He forecast that it would trade in a fairly narrow range of about Y 85 to Y 90 to the dollar. He predicted that currencies would be discussed at the G7 summit in Halifax, but doubted whether any concerted action would result. 'They know the problem, they have a desire to cope with the problem and solve it, but I do not think they are collectively quite ready to launch some very concrete steps,' he said. Mr Gyoten acknowledged that Japan itself had not done enough to affect the fundamental economic change necessary. The Iranian government's attempts to peg the value of the rial at 3,000 rials to the dollar have met with a sceptical reception. The new regulations, which ban all dealings above the rate of 3,000 rials, were announced after the currency lost a third of its value in two weeks. Reports from Tehran indicate that little trade was being conducted, with market participants waiting to see how the new system settles down. Expectations are that the repo rate will stay at 4.51% in today's variable rate auction in Germany. The Bundesbank will not want to raise expectations of a move in official rates, by allowing a sharp drop in the repo, when it is not yet prepared for a follow-up. The Bank of England, in its daily operations, cleared a #550m shortage at established rates. Three-month LIBOR eased to 6 19/32%, from 6%. (c) The Financial Times Limited 1995.

555,61.0,1995-05-24,"The FT-SE 100-share Index just failed in its attempt to move back up through the 3,300 level. However, it survived a number of determined attempts by marketmakers and futures traders to get the market sharply lower. Once again it was Wall Street that came to the market's rescue. The Dow Average moved effortlessly back above the 4,400 mark shortly after it opened, with barely a ripple of unease about the Federal Open Market Committee meeting. Earlier, in what was said by marketmakers to have been an awkward trading session, share prices had come off sharply in the wake of poor preliminary results from Marks and Spencer, the UK's premier high street retailer and one of the world's top-rated companies. They also reacted to stricter than expected rules on cross-media ownership. The latter drove shares in many of the recently buoyant television companies sharply lower, while boosting some of the radio company stocks. Bolstered by Wall Street, the FT-SE 100 settled a net 7.3 firmer at 3,291.8. Second-line stocks fared less well, the FT-SE Mid 250 Index never looking likely to emulate the 100 index and finally ending the session only 1.1 points firmer at 3,605.7. The Mid 250 index was restrained by a dismal performance from the leading housebuilders, which provided the three poorest performers in Wimpey, Barratt Developments and Taylor Woodrow. They were badly affected by a television programme on Monday evening which predicted falling house prices in real terms in coming years. There were no problems for the market at the outset of trading after Wall Street once again had confounded the bears and jumped 54 points. Marketmakers lifted their opening prices and the FT-SE 100 had improved some 11 points shortly after trading commenced. The early strength was quickly dissipated, however, by the disappointing numbers from Marks and Spencer which confirmed the difficult trading conditions in the UK's high streets outlined last week by WH Smith. It was another dismal trading session for the retailing sector, with GUS taking the dubious honour of worst performer in the FT-SE 100 Index, followed by Boots in second place and M&S in fourth. The VSEL/GEC/BAe takeover saga, which has rumbled on since last year, took a series of twists as early reports that GEC would be prevented from continuing its bid for the submarine manufacturer were shot down by news that the Department of Trade and Industry had allowed both bids to proceed. With the bid now set to be contested in the market place, VSEL shares, sharply lower first thing, subsequently shot up to approach the level of the BAe offer, around #18 a share. After the Dow moved ahead strongly in the late afternoon, the Footsie ended in good heart. Nevertheless, senior dealers do not expect many fireworks for the rest of the week as most European markets are closed for the Ascension Day holiday. Turnover was 671.9m shares, with non-Footsie stocks accounting for 63% of the total. (c) The Financial Times Limited 1995.

556,62.0,1996-03-27,"US Treasury prices were relatively steady at lower levels after the Federal Reserve's Open Market Committee left interest rates unchanged after yesterday's meeting. Few had expected the Fed to lower interest rates after the surprisingly strong figures on February employment were released earlier this month. Treasury prices were lower as the Fed began its meeting at 8am and held at those levels after the FOMC meeting ended. But prices dipped later after Mr Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Fed, told a senate panel that the economy was moving 'at a reasonably good clip'. Mr Greenspan, who was nominated by President Clinton to a third term at the Fed, testified before the Senate Banking Committee as part of the confirmation process. In early afternoon trading, the benchmark 30-year Treasury was 5/16 lower at 92 3/32 to yield 6.604%, and the two-year note was down 1/16 at 98 15/16, yielding 5.696%. Yesterday's losses came despite a new indication that consumer spending is not likely to spur economic growth in the near term. At mid-morning, the Conference Board reported that its index of consumer confidence slipped to 97.7 in March from 98 in February. Most economists had expected the figure to rise modestly to about 99. 'Although consumer attitudes, on balance, are pretty much in neutral territory, the uneasiness about the job market, coupled with concerns about future levels of income, do not suggest consumers are ready to spend more freely,' the Conference Board said. * Italy provided the focus for attention in Europe, with activity sparked by the suspension of the shares of Banco di Napoli and worries about the cost to the government of recapitalising the bank. On Liffe, Mr Alex Cooper, floor manager with Credit Lyonnaise Rouse, said many traders, who last week bought Italian bonds in the wake of consolidation in Europe and the US, moved quickly to reduce their exposures. As a result, volumes on Liffe were buoyant, with 52,510 contracts exchanged. The June future settled at 107.94, down just over a point. In the cash market, the 10-year yield spread over bunds widened to 448 basis points from 427 points on Monday. Mr David Brown, chief European economist at Bear Stearns, said the 'likely size of any recapitalisation is not huge but it has spooked BTPs nevertheless, catching the market on the defensive'. * Other European high-yielders had a mixed day. Spanish bonds closed marginally higher, with the 10-year yield spread over Germany falling from 333 basis points to 331 points. Swedish bonds closed lower, with the 10-year spread over bunds widening to 209 basis points. The Riksbank's cut in the securities repurchase rate from 7.6% to 7.4%, the seventh this year, had been expected. * Fears about the cost of BSE - so-called 'mad cow disease' - continued to overhang UK government bonds, which again underperformed other European markets. Mr Andrew Roberts at UBS said: 'There has been a real change of investor perception. BSE is the overriding factor in the market just now.' Yields on benchmark 10-year bonds rose by 5 basis points, with the yield spread over bunds, which had narrowed to 178 basis points on Monday, widening to 185 points. Yields on benchmark two-year paper closed 7 basis points higher. On Liffe, June long gilts closed at 104 7/8, down 3/8. * German bonds closed largely unchanged, with yields falling marginally on 10-year bunds and most shorter-dated paper. The market slipped in early trading, following indications from the Bundesbank that an immediate cut in short-term rates was not on the cards, but later recovered ground. On Liffe, 10-year June futures settled at 96.44, down 0.01. * French figures for household consumption in February were as expected and OATs largely tracked bunds. The 10-year yield spread widened by 2 basis points to 23 points. (c) The Financial Times Limited 1996. ",OVERSEAS NEWS - TREASURIES STEADY AFTER FOMC MEETING.,1996-03-26,The Financial Times
557,63.0,1996-03-27,"By STEVE THOMPSON, UK Stock Market editor. The political fall-out from the mad cow disease controversy continued to cast a shadow over UK equities and was said to have been responsible for another dismal performance by the stock market. With dealers increasingly taking the view that the government will struggle to recover from the political and potential economic impact of the BSE scare, gilts were persistently sold throughout the day and the Footsie future traded at a big discount to the cash market. And some of the market's bears were casting doubts about today's auction of #3bn of five-year gilts. The 10-year gilt closed off the day's low but was still 12 ticks down at the close. The 20-year gilt was 14 ticks easier. The outcome of a difficult trading session in London was that the FT-SE 100 index once again waved goodbye to the 3,700 level. By the close, it was left nursing a 21.0 fall at 3,660.9. There was much less pressure on the second-line stocks, where another outstanding performance by Securicor, a further 11% stronger following Monday's restructuring proposals, helped sustain the FT-SE Mid 250 index, which ended 2.0 off at 4,294.5. Wall Street gave precious little support to London, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average coming in on the weak side and falling sharply in the first 30 minutes of trading before staging a good rally and posting a small gain soon after that. Late in the session there was news that the US Federal Open Market Committee meeting had finished and that US interest rates had been left unchanged. Commenting on the day's events, the head trader at one of the leading UK securities houses said the institutions were worried about the political implications of the BSE scare. 'The feeling is that the government is in real trouble and that things will probably get much worse before they get better,' he said. He added that London was being propped up by Wall Street and that any big setback in New York, together with more bad news on the BSE front, could produce a nasty few days for UK stocks. Last week's burst of programme trading activity had also left the market heavy of certain stocks and caused considerable indigestion, he said. On the plus side, however, the view in the market was that the FT-SE 100 index was being depressed by a large short position in the future which, if unwound, might produce a sharp rebound. It was not all doom and gloom in the market. Glaxo Wellcome shot to the top of the FT-SE 100 leader board, in the wake of a burst of speculative buying triggered by the emergence of rumours that a merger between the company and Pfizer, of the US, could be on the cards. Most traders, although keen to take advantage of the big two-way business unleashed by the rumours, were unconvinced that such a deal was imminent. Turnover at 6pm came out at 822.8m shares, with non-FT-SE 100 stocks providing 61% of the business. Customer activity on Monday was valued at #1.59bn. (c) The Financial Times Limited 1996.

558,64.0,1996-03-27,"Currency markets had a quiet day yesterday with traders mostly content to stay on the sidelines ahead of the Federal Reserve policy meeting. The dollar closed little changed in London at DM 1.4758, from DM 1.4777, while the Fed was still meeting. Against the yen it closed at Y 106.245 from Y 106.13. The dollar firmed slightly when it emerged that the Fed had left interest rates on hold. The announcement did not come as a surprise. While many observers believe US rates will still fall further, the chance of an early cut was reduced by the freak US payrolls report last month. On the policy front, the Swedish central bank cut the repo rate to 7.4% from 7.6%, the seventh reduction of its central money market tender rate this year. In Europe the D-Mark finished slightly firmer against most currencies. The lira was the main loser, finishing at L1,064 from L1,055. Traders sold the currency after news emerged that shares in the state-controlled Banco di Napoli had been suspended. Sterling was stable, but there remain concerns that the government will pay a heavy political price for its handling of the 'mad-cow' scare. It closed at DM 2.2463, from DM 2.2536. Against the dollar it closed at $1.5222, from $1.5252. * Although the D-Mark had a slightly firmer tone yesterday, many analysts believe the outlook for the German currency is bleak. Mr Chris Turner, currency strategist at BZW in London, said 'quite a bearish story' was developing for the D-Mark. He cited three recent developments: M3 growth, the regional elections and the IFO business confidence survey. With M3 money supply growth running at six per cent year on year, Mr Turner said the necessary condition for currency depreciation - money supply growth outstripping nominal output growth - was now in place. The election result, meanwhile, said Mr Turner, 'gave Chancellor Kohl the green light to press on with EMU.' He said this was likely to be negative for the D-Mark on fears of dilution when it becomes part of a single currency. Also, with the EMU project requiring a tight fiscal policy, this would need to be countered by an environment of low interest rates. The IFO survey revealed a big drop in exporter optimism, to the lowest level since last June. Mr Turner said this was probably a lagged response to the D-Mark's large appreciation against the yen in the second half of 1995. The D-Mark has also been the subject of pessimistic comment from Robert Fleming Securities. Peter Warburton and Paul Brunker note that for 20 years the D-Mark's reputation as a dependable store of wealth 'increased in parallel with the 2.9% per annum average gain in its trade-weighted index.' Progress has been so consistent that 'it is 15 years since the D-Mark index last dropped by as much as 3% below its last year average.' But they believe there are three reasons - falling competitiveness, the role of net foreign purchases of bunds, and the issue of 'flight capital' - why the D-Mark will weaken. As evidence of the cumulative loss of competitiveness over a number of years, they note that the pace of net outflows of direct investment from Germany reached almost DM 40bn last year (roughly 40% of the size of the trade surplus), while West German employment has not recovered from the 1992 recession. Mr Brunker believes Germany is pushing for a single currency because it wants to avoid the sort of revaluation of the D-Mark, common in recent years, which took place regardless of German fundamentals. 'The feeling in Germany is that if the single currency is abolished, or even delayed, the D-Mark will go on a strong run again which the economy cannot afford.' * While the FOMC meeting held little joy for currency markets, some better news came in the form of prepared comments from Mr Alan Greenspan, the Fed chairman, at his confirmation hearings. 'Maintaining the key role of the dollar is important to American growth and standards of living,' he said. Repeating this comment for the second time in two weeks will remind markets that the US authorities are not indifferent to the value of the dollar. (c) The Financial Times Limited 1996.

559,65.0,1996-03-27,"US Treasury prices were relatively steady at lower levels after the Federal Reserve's Open Market Committee left interest rates unchanged after yesterday's meeting. Few had expected the Fed to lower interest rates after the surprisingly strong figures on February employment were released earlier this month. Treasury prices were lower as the Fed began its meeting at 8am and held at those levels after the FOMC meeting ended. But prices dipped later after Mr Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Fed, told a senate panel that the economy was moving 'at a reasonably good clip'. Mr Greenspan, who was nominated by President Clinton to a third term at the Fed, testified before the Senate Banking Committee as part of the confirmation process. In early afternoon trading, the benchmark 30-year Treasury was 5/16 lower at 92 3/32 to yield 6.604%, and the two-year note was down 1/16 at 98 15/16, yielding 5.696%. Yesterday's losses came despite a new indication that consumer spending is not likely to spur economic growth in the near term. At mid-morning, the Conference Board reported that its index of consumer confidence slipped to 97.7 in March from 98 in February. Most economists had expected the figure to rise modestly to about 99. 'Although consumer attitudes, on balance, are pretty much in neutral territory, the uneasiness about the job market, coupled with concerns about future levels of income, do not suggest consumers are ready to spend more freely,' the Conference Board said. * Italy provided the focus for attention in Europe, with activity sparked by the suspension of the shares of Banco di Napoli and worries about the cost to the government of recapitalising the bank. On Liffe, Mr Alex Cooper, floor manager with Credit Lyonnaise Rouse, said many traders, who last week bought Italian bonds in the wake of consolidation in Europe and the US, moved quickly to reduce their exposures. As a result, volumes on Liffe were buoyant, with 52,510 contracts exchanged. The June future settled at 107.94, down just over a point. In the cash market, the 10-year yield spread over bunds widened to 448 basis points from 427 points on Monday. Mr David Brown, chief European economist at Bear Stearns, said the 'likely size of any recapitalisation is not huge but it has spooked BTPs nevertheless, catching the market on the defensive'. * Other European high-yielders had a mixed day. Spanish bonds closed marginally higher, with the 10-year yield spread over Germany falling from 333 basis points to 331 points. Swedish bonds closed lower, with the 10-year spread over bunds widening to 209 basis points. The Riksbank's cut in the securities repurchase rate from 7.6% to 7.4%, the seventh this year, had been expected. * Fears about the cost of BSE - so-called 'mad cow disease' - continued to overhang UK government bonds, which again underperformed other European markets. Mr Andrew Roberts at UBS said: 'There has been a real change of investor perception. BSE is the overriding factor in the market just now.' Yields on benchmark 10-year bonds rose by 5 basis points, with the yield spread over bunds, which had narrowed to 178 basis points on Monday, widening to 185 points. Yields on benchmark two-year paper closed 7 basis points higher. On Liffe, June long gilts closed at 104 7/8, down 3/8. * German bonds closed largely unchanged, with yields falling marginally on 10-year bunds and most shorter-dated paper. The market slipped in early trading, following indications from the Bundesbank that an immediate cut in short-term rates was not on the cards, but later recovered ground. On Liffe, 10-year June futures settled at 96.44, down 0.01. * French figures for household consumption in February were as expected and OATs largely tracked bunds. The 10-year yield spread widened by 2 basis points to 23 points. (c) The Financial Times Limited 1996. ",OVERSEAS NEWS - TREASURIES STEADY AFTER FOMC MEETING.,1996-03-26,The Financial Times
560,66.0,2009-11-05,"Levels close to zero expected for 6 months Statement allows for changing conditions The Federal Reserve yesterday signalled that it still expected to keep interest rates near zero for at least six months, but for the first time identified factors that could lead to earlier rate rises. In a shift foreshadowed in the Financial Times, the US central bank tweaked guidance in its policy statement that had been unchanged since March, edging away from a simple forecast that it expects to keep rates at ""exceptionally low levels"" for an ""extended period"" - commonly understood to mean at least six months. Policymakers kept the ""extended period"" phrase but for the first time set out the conditions on which this guidance is based: ""low rates of resource utilisation, subdued inflation trends and stable inflation expectations"". The statement implies that if these conditions are not met - because of an upside surprise on growth, a pick-up in inflation or a rise in inflation expectations - the Fed may have to raise rates within the six-month period. In making this change, the US central bank spelt out what the market should watch for in terms of the factors that could lead to rate rises. Meanwhile, the Federal Open Market Committee decided to shave $25bn off the planned $200bn purchase of debt issued by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. The decision was justified on technical grounds reflecting ""the limited availability of agency debt"". The reduction only makes the tiniest dent in the Fed's overall $1,750bn asset purchase programme. However, it was notable that the committee cut the $25bn rather than using it to buy Fannie and Freddie mortgage-backed securities. This suggests that it would take a lot to persuade mainstream Fed officials and hawks to increase the MBS purchases - an option some Fed doves want to consider. In spite of public disagreements between Fed hawks and doves in the run-up to the meeting, the statement was unanimously endorsed by the committee. This reflects the fact that there was something in it for both camps. Hawks will be able to point to the reference to ""subdued inflation trends and stable inflation expectations"" as indicating red lines for rate policy. Doves will say that this is obvious and changes nothing, while the reference to ""resource utilisation"" rather than growth highlights the importance of unemployment. If the forecast plays out as expected and the Fed's conditions are met, the Fed will not be raising rates in the next six months.

562,68.0,2009-11-05,"LONDON Evolution Group came into focus yesterday afternoon after one of its biggest shareholders attempted to sell its stake. Shares in the mid-cap investment bank closed 3 per cent lower at 152.7p amid talk that 22m shares, or 9.4 per cent of the company, was being offered to the market. Only two Evolution shareholders hold that much stock; Portuguese bank Banco Espirito Santo (BES) and BlackRock. The talk in the market was that the seller was BES, disposing of what was now deemed to be a non- core holding. The shares are thought to have eventually been placed with new investors at about the 150p level by stockbroker Execution. When Banco first revealed its holding in January 2008, it fuelled speculation that it could be the prelude to a full bid for Evolution, which has been on an aggressive expansion drive in the past year. The FTSE 100, meanwhile, recouped all of Tuesday's losses, rising 70.7 points, or 1.4 per cent, to 5,107.9, helped by a strong opening on Wall Street following the release of positive service sector and employment data. Trading volumes were light, however, with many investors choosing to sit on the sidelines ahead of the statement from the US Federal Open Market Committee. Elsewhere, the FTSE 250 jumped 236 points, or 2.7 per cent, to 8,992.7. Retailers led the market higher. Marks and Spencer rose 6 per cent to 361½p as half-year results impressed and the company said it expected a further improvement in margins. Analysts responded by increasing their full-year pre-tax profit forecasts by about 7 per cent to £620-£630m, although good Christmas trading could trigger further upgrades. Next added 5.6 per cent to £19.12 after better-than- expected third-quarter results and upgrading its sales and profit guidance for the rest of the year. ""Sales of autumn/winter clothing appear to have been boosted by an improved product offering and are currently trading ahead of management guidance,"" said Merrill Lynch. Randgold Resource was also in demand as the price of gold hit a record high. Its shares finished 4.6 per cent higher at £45.06. Meanwhile, Mexican silver miner Fresnillo rose 9.2 per cent to 820p as the price of silver advanced in tandem. British Airways rallied 6.6 per cent to 191.8p following reports that Spain's Iberia had hired JPMorgan to help it close a planned merger with its UK rival. Cadbury , however, failed to join the rally. Shares in the group slipped 1.4 per cent to 766p as the share price of its US suitor, Kraft, fell in the wake of disappointing results. ""Kraft's third-quarter results disappointed on top-line growth for the fourth quarter in a row with 0.5 per cent like-for-like sales growth contrasting with Cadbury's impressive 7 per cent,"" said Panmure Gordon. There was speculation that Kraft was poised to go hostile with its original cash-and-stock offer, which is now worth about 723p a share. If that happens, Kraft would then have 28 days to post its offer document and 46 more to increase the terms of its offer to an acceptable level. Housebuilders were the standout feature in the mid- caps. The sector rose sharply after Taylor Wimpey , up 8.2 per cent to 40p, said trading conditions had improved and it was now fully sold for 2009. That news saw Persimmon rise 10.6 per cent to 424p and Barratt Developments put on 12.7 per cent to 136.3p. Barratt also announced a 92.3 per cent take-up for its rights issue and placed the unwanted shares at 120.9p. Chip designer Imagination Technologies moved up 12.7 per cent to 225p after Panmure Gordon issued a ""buy"" recommendation. Increasing its target price to 250p, from 200p, analyst Nick James said the company was bullish on the prospects for Meta, its processor core, which could be used in Android-powered mobile phones.

The index is based on a survey of about 300 analysts and institutional investors. Last month it showed its biggest fall for many years.

565,71.0,2002-12-11,"The Federal Reserve decided to keep short-term interest rates unchanged yesterday, in something of an anticlimax to recent dramatic developments on the US policy front. But it appeared to leave open the possibility of future rate cuts if the economy failed to emerge from its current ""soft spot"". The Fed's policymaking Open Market Committee (FOMC) voted unanimously at its last scheduled meeting of the year to leave the Fed funds rate at a 40-year low of 1.25 per cent. The rate regulates overnight lending of reserves among banks. Surprising signs of economic weakness have emerged over the past two weeks, raising doubts among investors about the strength of the recovery. But those signs failed to sway the Fed from its position that it had done enough for now. Explaining its decision, it said its previous rate cuts and strong productivity growth were ""providing important ongoing support"" to the economy, but the central bank acknowledged significant uncertainty, adding that it needed more readings on the economy before it could justify new policy moves. The Fed last month reduced rates by half a percentage point as extra insurance against further weakness. In its previous assessment, the FOMC said the economy was working its way through a ""soft spot"", although it acknowledged apprehension among businesses and consumers about risks to the economy. It said again yesterday that the economy might still be stuck in a soft spot. Economic reports continue to send mixed signals - suggesting investment is tentatively turning around and the US economy is stabilising. But businesses are still reluctant to expand operations. Recent data have suggested a sharp drop in demand for unemployment benefits, rebounds in consumer spending and confidence and an acceleration in the growth of service-sector activity. But there have also been indications of a slowdown in the growth of income and home prices and declines in advertised job openings, manufacturing activity and employment. Yesterday, the Institute of Supply Management, a group of purchasing executives, predicted a long ""jobless recovery"".

In its last policy meeting this year, the Fed's Open Market Committee said the economy is working its way through its ""soft spot."" The decision had no impact on the Treasury market, which had not expected the Fed to alter the 1.25 per cent Federal funds rate. Some bond market strategists said yesterday that further cuts in rates have become more unlikely following Treasury Secretary Paul O'Neill's resignation last week. Mr O'Neill's departure has cleared the way for the Bush administration to push ahead with more fiscal stimulus. ""The fiscal stimulus might provide the support needed (for the economy),"" said Joseph Schatz, government bond strategist at Merrill Lynch, adding that this might make it less likely that the Fed would have to ease rates again next year. After the FOMC meeting, the 10-year bond was 5/32 lower at 99 17/32 to yield 4.056 per cent, while the 30-year bond had also lost 5/32 to 106 1/2 with a yield of 4.944 per cent. The two-year note had fallen 1/16 to 100 7/32 with a yield of 1.878 per cent. Short-dated eurozone government bonds again outperformed the long end as comments from the European Central Bank and German economic data suggested a further cut in interest rates early next year.

The yield on the 10-year bund was 4.37 per cent, down 1bp. The market benefited from the German ZEW economic sentiment survey, which fell 3.6 points to 0.6 in December, indicating an economy on the brink of recession. Moreover, Otmar Issing, the ECB's chief economist, said late on Monday the central bank was worried about the public perception that inflation was higher than it actually was. The German government will today auction Euros 9bn of new 3 per cent two-year schatz notes, having increased the amount of the issue by Euros 2bn. ""The 20bp rally in two-year yields suggests that the market is not set up for the auction,"" said analysts at UBS Warburg.

The two-year gilt was yielding 3.822 per cent, down 1bp. The yield on 10-year paper was up 1bp at 4.561 per cent.

Any nerves about broader fallout of political turmoil in Thailand and Hungary or large losses suffered by US hedge fund group Amaranth faded quickly with investors in a mostly positive mood over the outcome of the US Federal Reserve's meeting on rate policy. Wall Street sentiment was also lifted by a fall in US oil prices to briefly below the level at which they started the year and strong quarterly earnings from Morgan Stanley and Oracle.

The statement accompanying the decision also did not contain any great surprises either with few changes from the August meeting statement. The Fed said the moderation in economic growth appeared to be continuing, partly reflecting a cooling of the housing market. However, it removed the word ""gradual"" from the August statement's description of that cooling. The Federal Open Market Committee added that readings of core inflation had been elevated, and high levels of resource utilisation and commodity prices had the potential to sustain inflation pressures. However, it said inflation pressures seemed likely to moderate over time, reflecting ""reduced impetus"" from energy prices and otherfactors. The statement appeared to slightly disappoint those betting on a more dovish statement. Treasuries and equities pared early gains.

Any nerves about the broader fallout of political turmoil in Thailand and Hungary, or about large losses suffered by US hedge fund group Amaranth, faded quickly. Investors were in a mostly positive mood over the outcome of the US Federal Reserve's meeting on rate policy. Wall Street sentiment was also lifted by a fall in US oil prices to briefly below the level at which they started the year, and by strong quarterly earnings from Morgan Stanley and Oracle. The Federal Open Market Committee kept its benchmark Fed funds rate unchanged at 5.25 per cent as expected. All 109 economists polled by Bloomberg beforehand had expected the central bank to do so. The statement accompanying the decision did not contain any great surprises either, with few changes from the August meeting statement. The Fed said the moderation in economic growth appeared to be continuing, partly reflecting a cooling of the housing market. However, it removed the word ""gradual"" from the August statement's description of that cooling. The FOMC added that readings of core inflation had been elevated, and that the high levels of resource utilisation and of the prices of energy and other commodities had the potential to sustain inflation pressures. However, it said inflation pressures seemed likely to moderate over time, reflecting ""reduced impetus"" from energy prices, contained inflation expectations, and the cumulative effects of monetary policy actions. The statement appeared to slightly disappoint those betting on a more explicitly dovish statement. Treasuries and equities pared early gains while the dollar rallied a little. By mid-afternoon, the S&P 500 was up 0.7 per cent at 1,327.16, its highest level since February 2001. The Nasdaq Composite was up 1.4 per cent, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average added 0.6 per cent. The rises came as oil prices fell further. West Texas Intermediate crude fell below the Dollars 61.04 a barrel at which it ended 2005, but by midday US time was trading at Dollars 61.25, down 41 cents. Michael Thompson, global managing director of research at Thomson Financial, said the market was finally starting to recognise the fact that the US was approaching its 13th consecutive quarter of double-digit earnings growth. Consensus forecasts compiled by Thomson Financial indicate 14.2 per cent earnings growth for the S&P 500 constituents in the third-quarter. Mr Thompson said current estimates indicated companies would maintain this double-digit pace through the first quarter next year - the longest run in more than 50 years. The Thai stock market was closed, and the bahtwas largely flat against the dollar. The Hungarian forint weakened but bounced off day lows to trade 0.3 per cent lower against the euro. The Budapest stockmarket benchmark, the BUX index, eased 2.2 per cent. The Hungarian events did not appear to have a great impact on investor risk appetite. The Vix index, the measure of market volatility that is sometimes called the investor ""fear gauge"", fell 4.17 per cent to 11.48. The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury fell 1.4bp to 4.7248 per cent. ",Fed pause on interest rates eclipses events in Thailand and Hungary GLOBAL OVERVIEW.,2006-09-20,The Financial Times
569,75.0,2006-09-21,"Heightened expectations that the next move for US interest rates would be downwards had only a limited impact on world equity markets on Thursday but sent the dollar and US Treasury yields lower. The Federal Reserve's Open Market Committee left interest rates unchanged at 5.25 per cent for a second successive month on Wednesday, as expected, but reiterated that it felt some inflation risks remained. But David Hensley, director of global economics at JPMorgan, suggested that the sharp recent fall in oil prices meant headline inflation ""would slow to a crawl"" in the fourth quarter. The consequent boost to household real incomes would support consumer spending while the economy absorbed the brunt of the housing slowdown, he added. ""This backdrop gives the FOMC ample room to stay on hold despite the continued breach of its 1-2 per cent inflation comfort zone."" ING Financial Markets went further, saying it was so concerned about the impact of the housing market slowdown on consumer sentiment and spending growth that it believed US rates would be cut to 4.25 per cent by the end of the first half of next year. ""A combination of weaker demand and lower energy prices suggests inflation could fall quickly in the first half of next year, offering the Fed scope to act promptly and aggressively to offset the potential for a more severe economic downturn,"" said James Knightley, economist. By midday in New York, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was flat, although the Nasdaq Composite index was 0.2 per cent higher. The S&P 500, which touched a 5l-year high on Wednesday, was up 0.1 per cent. Wall Street's muted showing took some of the shine off an early advance for European stocks, although continued merger and acquisition activity provided support and the FTSE Eurofirst 300 index ended 0.4 per cent higher at a four-month peak. Serono leapt more than 17 per cent after Germany's Merck launched a surprise bid for the Swiss drugs group, while Spanish property group Metrovacesa jumped nearly 16 per cent as a bid battle for the company intensified. Meanwhile, the dollar fell below the Y117 level and also eased back against the euro, while Treasury bond prices extended the previous day's moderate gains. Emerging markets remained in focus following the military coup in Thailand and political unrest in Hungary this week. ""These events are in themselves unlikely to be big market movers in the global emerging markets,"" said Lars Christensen at Danske Bank. ""However, they are nonetheless adding to risk aversion among international investors."" In Bangkok, the benchmark SET index initially tumbled 4 per cent but subsequently recovered to close just 1.4 per cent lower. The week's events unsettled Turkish investors, and the ISE 100 index fell 1.3 per cent. The RTS index in Moscow was also off 1.3 per cent. But Brazilian stocks, which fell nearly 2 per cent on Wednesday, were down 1 per cent at midday on Thursday amid political uncertainty. The Bux index in Budapest shed another 1.8 per cent, taking its fall since the start of the week to 5.1 per cent. Oil prices rallied off Wednesday's six-month lows, with the benchmark US crude future hovering around the $61 a barrel mark. However, this is more than 20 per cent down from the record high of $78.40 a barrel struck in July and several analysts suggested prices would soon fall below $60 a barrel.

570,76.0,2006-09-21,"The US dollar slipped in European morning trade on Thursday as the market digested a modestly dovish monetary policy statement from the Federal Open Market Committee. As pretty much everyone expected, the Fed kept US interest rates on hold at 5.25 per cent. However the accompanying statement was a little softer than some had expected, with the Fed noting a ""cooling"" in the housing market, rather than the ""gradual cooling"" seen in the previous statement, as well as highlighting the ""reduced impetus from energy prices"" on inflation. ""The inclusion of falling energy prices as a downside risk to inflation as opposed to an upside risk to growth is something of an unexpectedly dovish tilt, albeit a minor one,"" said Steve Pearson, chief currency strategist at HBOS. Hans Redeker, head of currency strategy at BNP Paribas, said ""the more than 20 per cent drop in oil prices since early August should quell the Fed's fears of upside risks to inflation,"" arguing that the Fed could be forced to cut interest rates as soon as ""end 2006"" as the data ""begin to point to a quicker than expected slowdown"". However most saw the statement as only modestly dovish, with one member, Jeffrey Lacker, once again voting for a rate rise. As the result the dollar drifted just 0.5c to $1.2732 against the euro, Y0.55 to Y116.86 against the yen, 1.05c to $1.8982 against sterling and 0.5c to C$1.1233 against the Canadian dollar. Elsewhere the New Zealand dollar weakened after the island nation's already vast current account deficit widened still further than expected, and Michael Cullen, the finance minister, made another attempt to talk the kiwi lower. New Zealand's deficit rose to NZ$3.08bn in the second quarter, taking the annual deficit to 9.7 per cent of GDP, the worst level since 1975. Mr Cullen commented that: ""looking at the size of the current account deficit, there have still got to be significant downside risks on the New Zealand dollar and both the Reserve Bank and the government want to signal that fact quite clearly."" The kiwi slipped against the weakening greenback, being marked down 0.1c to $0.6593. The Thai baht recovered 0.7 per cent to Bt37.415 to the US dollar as tensions over the recent coup were soothed to some degree by an announcement that King Bhumibol had issued a royal order backing General Sonthi Boonyaratkalin, the army commander-in-chief leading the coup. However the Hungarian forint dipped a further 0.3 per cent to Ft275.38 to the euro following a third night of clashes between police and protesters calling for the resignation of prime minister Ferenc Gyurcsany.

571,77.0,2004-12-15,"London shares slipped yesterday in cautious trade, dragged lower by weakness in the index heavyweight Vodafone. The FTSE 100 lost 0.3 per cent to 4,722.8 while the FTSE 250 fell 0.2 per cent to 6,715.7. Trading volumes were a solid 3.9bn. Traders said the market was driven more by stock-specific factors than by an overall trend with caution prevailing ahead of the interest rate-setting meeting of the US Federal Open Market Committee after the close of London trade. The release of data showing a wider-than-expected US trade deficit in October also dampened sentiment. ""The fall (in the market) has really all been about Vodafone today,"" said one trader. The mobile telecommunications company was the second biggest faller in the FTSE 100, sliding 2.4 per cent to 139 1/2p on concerns it may be drawn into a bidding war with its US associate Verizon for Sprint. The stock was also hit by a downgrade by Goldman Sachs, Vodafone's house broker, from ""outperform"" to ""in-line"". However, not all brokers were taking a dim view of a Sprint deal. Bear Sterns said: ""If Verizon does enter the arena, this could cause uncertainty at the Vodafone level."" But it may be the catalyst to resolve long-term strategic dilemmas about the extent of its US operations. Dresdner Kleinwort Wasserstein also said a Sprint deal might not be a negative story for Vodafone. ""This is no AT&T Wireless,"" the bank said. Vodafone launched a failed bid for AT&T Wireless in February. ",Vodafone puts City on hold.,2004-12-14,The Financial Times
572,78.0,2004-12-15,"The US Federal Reserve yesterday raised interest rates by a quarter point to 2.25 per cent and signalled there had been no change in its assessment of current economic conditions. The policy-making Federal Open Market Committee left the wording of its policy statement, which accompanied the announcement, virtually unchanged from its last meeting. The Fed said monetary policy remained accommodative, output was growing at a moderate pace in spite of the rise in energy prices, and inflation and long-term inflation expectations remained unchanged. The US central bank said it would continue to raise rates ""at a pace that is likely to be measured"", and gave no indication of an early end to quarter-point increases. Markets rose slightly after announcement of the rate rise, which had been widely expected. The adjustment comes amid new data showing that high oil prices and retail stockpiling before the holiday season pushed the US trade deficit to a new record in October. The trade gap widened to Dollars 55.46bn (Euros 116.9bn, Pounds 80.6bn) from Dollars 50.9bn the previous month, according to the Commerce Department. It was more than economists had expected and boosted the tally for the first 10 months of the year to Dollars 500.5bn, topping 2003's full-year record of Dollars 496.5bn. Imports of goods and services rose by 3.4 per cent in October to Dollars 153.5bn - the fastest rate in almost two years and far outstripping a 0.6 per cent rise in exports to a record Dollars 98.1bn. The White House is hosting an economic summit with business leaders and economists in Washington today and tomorrow to discuss President George W. Bush's plans for his second term, including Social Security and tax reform. Business groups have told the administration that reducing the fiscal deficit should be its priority. The FOMC also announced that it would in future release the minutes of its meetings three weeks after it meets. It used to keep the details of its deliberations secret until after the subsequent meeting. The minutes of yesterday's meeting will be released on January 4. In one change in its policy statement, the committee slightly toned down its assessment of the labour market, saying that ""conditions continue to improve gradually"" - a slightly less definitive than its November statement. The employment report, released before the FOMC statement, showed 112,000 jobs were created in November compared with 303,000 in October. Ironing out the monthly bumps, however, employment growth has averaged 178,000 over the past three months and 185,000 since the start of the year - fast enough to take in labour market slack and to convince policymakers that employment growth has turned the corner after two disappointing years.

573,79.0,2004-12-15,"The US Federal Reserve on Tuesday raised interest rates by a quarter point to 2.25 per cent and signalled that there had been no change in its assessment of economic conditions. The Federal Open Market Committee left the wording of its policy statement virtually unchanged from its last meeting: monetary policy remained ""accommodative"", output was growing at a moderate pace in spite of the rise in energy prices, and inflation and long-term inflation expectations remained unchanged. The central bank said it would continue to raise rates ""at a pace that is likely to be measured"" and gave no indication of an early end to quarter-point increases. Bond and stock markets rose slightly and the dollar edged lower after the announcement, which was widely expected. The FOMC has raised rates by a quarter point at each of its last five meetings. On Tuesday it gave no signal that it might either need to move to more aggressive rate increases or pause in its tightening campaign. Tuesday's rate increase came amid new data showing that high oil prices and retail stockpiling before the holiday season had pushed the US trade deficit to a record in October. The trade gap widened to $55.46bn from $50.9bn the previous month, the Commerce Department said above economists' expectations. The trade gap and the low savings rate are seen within the Fed as factors likely to be drags on growth. International concern over the US fiscal and current account deficits has contributed to the recent decline in the dollar, though there is no sign of alarm, judging by the low level of long-term interest rates. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note, at just over 4.1 per cent, was little changed after the rate increase. In June, before the FOMC started raising rates, it stood at almost 4.9 per cent. The White House is hosting an economic summit with business leaders and economists on Wednesday and Thursday to discuss President George W. Bush's plans, including Social Security and tax reform. Industry has told the administration that reducing the fiscal deficit should be its priority. The FOMC said the balance off risks to the inflation and growth outlooks are both rougly equal. However, a federal funds rate of 2.25 per cent rate is still seen as accommodative, or too low to be consistent with medium-term price stability. Policymakers have indicated they intend to continue raising rates to a neutral level as long as there is no evidence this risks knocking the expansion off track and that the pace of increases will be dictated by the incoming data. The FOMC also announced that it would in future release the minutes of its meetings three weeks after it meets. The minutes of Tuesday's meeting will be released on January 4. The change in policy, to increase transparency, follows discussions within the Fed over the past year on how to improve its communications with the markets. In one change in its policy statement on Tuesday, the committee toned down its assessment of the labour market, saying ""conditions continue to improve gradually"" a slightly less definitive view than in November following last month's weaker employment report. Employment growth has averaged 185,000 a month this year, fast enough to convince policymakers employment growth has turned the corner. The committee also acknowledged in passing that oil prices have fallen recently, a development which, if it continues, will help growth next year.

The decision, made at the year's first meeting of the policymaking Federal Open Market Committee, had been widely expected. Although the economy grew by a faster-than-expected 3.8% last year, there has been little sign of inflation re-emerging.

576,82.0,1998-02-05,"Russian President Boris Yeltsin's warnings on Iraq, combined with a big bund auction in Germany, knocked confidence in European government bond markets yesterday, but US Treasuries fared better ahead of the widely expected decision to hold interest rates. Nonetheless, Sonja Gibbs, senior market strategist at Nomura International, said: ""I would expect a bounce back in European markets tomorrow given the magnitude of the drop today - unless there is a sharp recovery in Asian equities."" Mr Yeltsin's comments, warning that US action in Iraq could spark a global conflict, were reported just as the Bundesbank was in the midst of a 10-year GERMAN BUND auction. In the circumstances, the auction went well, with DM 7.4bn of the bunds taken up, and bids of DM 14.3bn. However, the yield curve steepened, as longer-dated issues were hit by the new supply. The March bund contract in London fell by 0.52 at its worst, recovering to settle at 106.26, down 0.34 on the day. Turnover was active, with over 216,000 contracts traded in London, and 310,000 in Frankfurt. Ms Gibbs argued: ""There's a perception creeping into the German market, misguided in my view, that the economy is going to turn around."" There have been rumours that today's unemployment data will reveal a sharp fall. UK GILTS also suffered from concern that the growing Iraqi crisis could hit confidence in financial markets. The March contract settled 3/8 lower at 122 27/32, some 9/32 off its lows. Trading was brisk, with turnover of more than 86,000 contracts. There was some nervousness ahead of today's pronouncement on interest rates from the Bank of England's monetary policy committee. Short sterling futures have fallen by seven basis points this week, reflecting concern that there might be another rise. The adjusted yield spread against bunds widened by one basis point to 112. Andrew Roberts, gilts analyst at UBS Securities, said: ""This is the 'last chance saloon' for the hawks in the MPC. It was foolish of the market to ignore the possibility of a rate rise."" ITALIAN BTPs traded in line with other European markets, with the March contract settling 0.29 lower at 117.16, and the spread against bunds narrowing one basis point to 39 points. Carl Azeglio Ciampi, Treasury minister arrives in Bonn today on a two-day trip to ease German concern over Italian membership of European monetary union.

US TREASURIES were mixed as the Federal Open Market Committee concluded its two-day meeting to set interest rate policy. The consensus opinion on the meeting was that there would be no interest rate change, although opinions were decidedly mixed as to what the Fed would do later in the year. In morning trading, investors favoured shorter-term issues over longer ones. The benchmark 30-year bond had fallen 7/32 to 103 13/32 by early afternoon, sending the yield up to 5.881%. The 10-year note also fell, by 3/32 to 104 3/32, yielding 5.565%, but the two-year note gained 1/32 to 100 1/8, yielding 5.308%. The Federal Funds rate was 5.37%.

The Federal Open Market Committee voted nine to one to leave the federal funds rate at5.25 per cent. Ahead of the announcement, futures contracts had implied the central bank was expected to leave rates on hold, but many investors still feared the Fed would continue its steady monetary tightening. Treasury markets took the pause in their stride, with investors already looking to the likelihood of a further pause at the next FOMC meeting in September. James Knightley, strategist at ING Financial Markets, said: ""This leaves the September meeting wide open with the market currently split down the middle in terms of whether the Fed raises rates again."" Yields on the two-year notes, which are particularly sensitive to Fed interest rate moves, were down 3.3 basis points to 4.924 per cent shortly after the Fed's announcement, while the yield on benchmark 10-year notes was barely changed at 4.921 per cent. Government bonds in the UK, Europe and Japan all saw tight trading as markets awaited the Fed's decision. UK gilts were still suffering a hangover from last week's surprise interest rate rise from the BoE, which lifted rates to 4.75 per cent. Clues as to why the Bank made such a move should be forthcoming in today's quarterly inflation report. Yields on the two-year gilt rose 2bp to 4.944 per cent. Those on the 10-year gilt, however, were 1bp lower at 4.661 per cent. Eurozone government bonds were very quiet ahead of the Fed decision. The two-year Schatz yield was down 0.3bp at 3.534 per cent while that on the 10-year bund was up 0.6bp at 3.901 per cent. Japanese government bond traders were also anxious not to move prices. The 10-year yield was unchanged at 1.835 per cent. But traders were forced to make a choice when it came to the five-year, given the government's auction of Y2,000bn worth. The market was reluctant to buy, since traders expected the US Federal Reserve to leave interest rates unchanged, suggesting an end to the US rate cycle and hence downward pressure on JGB yields. Demand in the five-year auction was only 2.28 times supply, the poorest since September 2003. As a result, the yield on the five-year rose 2bp to 1.380 per cent.

578,84.0,2006-08-09,"The US labour market is likely to move centre stage in the Federal Reserve's policy debate following yesterday's decision not to raise interest rates for the first time since May 2004. With unit labour costs rising at an annualised rate of 4.2 per cent in the second quarter, labour costs are now putting upward pressure on core inflation. The Fed will not put too much weight on a single quarter's figures. But the rise in unit labour costs is not a single-quarter phenomenon. Data revisions now show these costs rising at an average annualised rate of 3.25 per cent over the past four quarters. Members of the Fed's Open Market Committee will want to be sure that this reflects workers gaining at the expense of shareholders, as often happens late in the business cycle, and not the beginnings of a wage-price spiral. Having argued that the recent rise in inflation reflects companies exploiting pricing power to pass on energy costs to consumers, the Fed will be hard pressed to claim that companies will not be able to pass on higher labour costs too, unless the economy slows significantly. This debate may expose differences within the FOMC that cut across the traditional distinction between ""hawks"" and ""doves"". Fed watchers say that Don Kohn, the Fed's vice-chairman, and Janet Yellen, president of the San Francisco Fed, pay particularly close attention to whether employment has pushed beyond its sustainable non-inflationary rate. The debate over labour market trends is only one of several key discussions that remain unresolved even though the Fed is now on pause, and render unwise any glib assumptions as to where rates are heading next. According to the Fed's last set of minutes, for its June policy meeting, many FOMC members believed that ""significant uncertainty accompanied the appropriate setting of policy going forward"". One source of uncertainty is the slowing housing market, which creates downside risks for growth. Yet another is that the Fed may have misdiagnosed the nature of the inflation surprise, which could reflect more general overheating or rising energy costs. If so, the Fed may have to slow growth significantly below potential to let off steam. Many private-sector economists believe growth will slow below trend in the second half, and the Fed's staff economists appear to think so too. But the FOMC does not seem to think growth will be much below par in the second half. Members are not even agreed on whether interest rates at 5.25 per cent are slowing the economy, or still stimulating it. Focus on the change in interest rates since the Fed started tightening, and policy looks tight: a total increase of 4.25 percentage points. Focus on the level, 5.25 per cent, and it still looks relatively slack, at least compared with the peaks of past cycles. The FOMC is also not sure about how much tightening remains in the pipeline from recent rate increases. The time lags are particularly hard to judge because rate rises were largely telegraphed in advance. The upshot is that the future path of interest rates is very hard to predict. Prior to yesterday's move, the current market assumption was that the Fed would raise rates one more time to 5.5 per cent before the end of the year, then cut rates twice to end next year on 5 per cent. That is as reasonable as any other guess. But there is a strong possibility that the Fed could have to raise rates considerably higher, or indeed cut them more aggressively next year. The markets will have to stay focused on the Fed.

579,85.0,2006-08-09,"Fresh concerns about US inflation sparked a bout of Treasury bond weakness yesterday, but financial markets were largely becalmed as investors waited for news from the US Federal Reserve's policy meeting on interest rates. After making 17 successive quarter-point rises in interest rates, the US central bank's Federal Open Market Committee was widely expected to take a pause on tightening monetary policy. ""Fed watchers are generally anticipating a pause and 'hawkish' language from the Fed,"" said Richard Bernstein, chief investment strategist at Merrill Lynch. David Bloom, global head of foreign exchange research at HSBC, said the US central bank was unlikely to stop emphasising the ""data dependency"" of its policy decisions because inflation had yet to be brought down to the Fed's ""comfort level"" of near and below 2 per cent. By midday in New York, the Dow Jones Industrial Average, the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite were all up about 0.3 per cent. European stocks managed even less progress, with the FTSE Eurofirst 300 index up less than 0.1 per cent. The dollar was barely changed against either the euro or the yen. But Treasury bonds edged back after news that US productivity had slowed in the second quarter but unit wage costs had risen sharply. Lombard Street Research argued that the data made a rise in US rates more likely. ""Labour cost inflation has already reached the point where the Fed can only keep inflation under control and close to its target by means of recession, or at best a hard landing,"" said Charles Dumas, LSR economist. ""Given the new data, the Fed should tighten today (Tuesday) even if the economy is slowing. Substantial slowing is what it needs."" Nouriel Roubini, professor of economics and international business at the Stern School of Business at New York University, said that after the recent flow of dismal economic indicators, he was raising the odds of a recession in the US by the end of the year from 50 per cent to 70 per cent. Mr Roubini cited the worsening housing market, mounting inflationary pressures and ever-increasing oil prices. ""Housing alone is now enough to cause a severe US recession,"" Mr Roubini said. Oil prices finally eased slightly yesterday after Monday's sharp rise, which followed news that BP had been forced to shut down North America's biggest oil field.

On Nymex, WTI for September delivery was down 18 cents at Dollars 76.80. Edward Meir at Man Financial said that while the amount of oil put out of circulation by BP's shutdown was relatively small, it reduced the overall cushion available to the market without dipping into stockpiles. But he said the timing of the outage was not bad. ""Crude stocks are at record highs, gasoline stocks are comfortable and gasoline demand should start to wane after Labor Day (September 4),"" he said. Angus McPhail, global oil and natural resources analyst at Alliance Trust, said he felt it was more likely that oil prices would rise than fall. ""If the geopolitical situation does not improve and there's a particularly bad hurricane season in the US, we see oil prices (ICE Brent) spiking to Dollars 85,"" he said. Copper futures fell back below Dollars 8,000 a tonne in spite of a strike at the world's biggest copper mine in Chile.

580,86.0,2006-08-09,"A rally in global equities ran out of steam on Wall Street on Thursday, as investors pondered the outlook for US economic growth in the wake of the Federal Reserve's decision to leave US interest rates unchanged after more than two years of rises. Earlier, world stock markets had logged gains in spite of a rise in oil prices following news of an unexpectedly big drop in US gasoline supplies last week. By the close, the technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite index was almost flat, down 0.57 points at 2,060.28, having been more than 1 per cent ahead for the day at one point. The S&P 500 fell 0.4 per cent, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.9 per cent, principally because of a bad day for the manufacturer Caterpillar. Cyclical stocks and home-builders - both particularly exposed to a US slowdown - bore the brunt of the sell-off. In Europe, the FTSE Eurofirst 300 index rose 0.7 per cent. Asian stocks put in some of the day's best performances. The Nikkei 225 Average in Tokyo climbed 1.2 per cent to a two-month high while Hong Kong leapt 1.8 per cent, nearly reaching a six-year high. The main debate for market watchers was the Federal Open Market Committee's Tuesday decision to leave interest rates at 5.25 per cent. Wall Street ended Tuesday lower on concerns it signalled an economic slowdown. This mood reinforced itself by the close on Thursday, although the market opened in more upbeat mood as investors speculated on whether the pause marked the end of themonetary tightening cycle. Goldman Sachs believed rates had peaked. ""The FOMC members acknowledged the upside risk to inflation due to high capacity utilisation and elevated energy prices and left themselves the option to tighten further if incoming data demands,"" said Fiona Lake, global markets economist. ""However, by outlining a view that inflation pressures will moderate based largely on conditions already in place, the committee has left itself ample room to look past more bad news on inflation."" Robert Lind, analyst at ABN Amro, was more hawkish. ""The [Fed's] statement continues to emphasise the data dependency of policy decisions, and inevitably the uncertainty around the outlook,"" he said. ""I read this as the FOMC maintaining a tightening bias. But the markets are clearly reading the 'pause' as a definitive stop in the tightening process."" What now appears to have become the most pressing concern in the market was voiced by Richard Bernstein, chief investment strategist at Merrill Lynch. ""Regardless of whether the Fed pauses or actually stops, we believe that economic growth is likely to slow during the next 12 months,"" he said, adding that current conditions, with rising inflation, and the Fed on pause, were similar to those of 1987, the year of the ""Black Monday"" crash. Oil prices were volatile after weekly US inventories data showed strong demand for gasoline and distillates. Benchmark US crude futures briefly pushed through the $77 a barrel level before easing back, while ICE September Brent slipped 27 cents to close at $77.28 a barrel. Speculation on US interest rates put the dollar under pressure. It fell as low as Y114.8 before recovering slightly, while the euro briefly nosed above $1.29. The yen touched an all-time low against the euro as investors increasingly took the view that the Bank of Japan would keep interest rates on hold at tomorrow's policy meeting.

582,88.0,2005-08-10,"US Treasury prices edged higher, and yields lower, after the Federal Open Market Committee increased short-term interest rates for the 10th consecutive time. The widely expected 25 basis point hike leaves the Fed funds target rate at 3.5 per cent, its highest since September 2001. As in prior statements, the FOMC said future rate increases could take place at a ""measured"" pace. Other changes to the wording appeared nuanced, with no obvious shift to the more hawkish stance some had expected. ""This is pretty much as expected, with an improving outlook on growth, though the inclusion of the tame outlook on core inflation may be viewed as friendly by bonds,"" said analysts at Action Economics. Shortly after the announ-cement by the FOMC, the 10-year Treasury yield was 1.6bp lower at 4.410 per cent. Two-year notes were yielding 4.145 per cent, down 1.7bp. Before the rate decision, bond prices had fallen back after a brief boost from data that helped ease concerns about inflation. Productivity growth slowed in the second quarter, but a rise in unit labour costs, a key measure of price pressures in the job market, was far weaker than expected. Eurozone government bonds came under pressure ahead of the US decision but were outperforming their US counterparts. As prices fell, yields on the 10-year Bund were 0.6bp higher at 3.375 per cent. The two-year Schatz rose 1.7bp to yield 2.346 per cent. ""Government bond markets remain under some pressure, and we doubt that this is likely to change soon,"" said David Brown, chief European economist at Bear Stearns. ""Bond prices might not be collapsing, but there is a slow and steady drift towards lower prices."" As investors awaited today's inflation report from the Bank of England, gilts were lower on an improvement in the UK's trade position in June. This offset bond-friendly data that indicated further deterioration in high street sales. Ten-year and two-year gilts rose 0.6bp to yield 4.399 per cent and 4.233 per cent, respectively. Japanese government bond prices fell, responding to a strong rise in equity prices. In spite of the political uncertainty arising from the snap election called for next month, yields on the benchmark 10-year bond hit a four-month high, before falling back to close at 1.410 per cent.

583,89.0,2005-08-10,"The Federal Reserve yester-day signalled greater confidence on growth and continued vigilence on inflation as it delivered its 10th consecutive quarter-point rate increase and said there were more to come. The Federal Open Market Committee, in the statement announcing an increase in the federal funds rate to 3 1/2 per cent, repeated that it saw monetary policy as still ""accommodative"" and that it expected to continue raising rates at a ""measured"" pace, generally taken to mean quarter-point increments. The FOMC's statement was largely unchanged from the one issued after its June meeting, but the committee gave a more upbeat view on the economy. ""Aggregate spending, despite high energy prices, appears to have strengthened since last winter,"" the statement said. Earlier this year the Fed had signalled concern about the impact of oil prices on spending. The committee acknowledged recent better inflation data but made clear its focus remained on inflation risks. ""Core inflation has been relatively low in recent months and longer-term inflation expectations remain well contained, but pressures on inflation have stayed elevated,"" the statement said. Yesterday's rate increase brings the federal funds rate back to the 3 1/2 per cent level prevailing before the September 11 attacks in 2001. The committee lowered the federal funds rate to 1 per cent by the middle of 2003 and left it there until commencing tightening in the middle of last year. ""It has taken nearly four years to do the round trip and get rates back to 3 1/2 per cent,"" said Mickey Levy, chief US economist at Bank of America. ""The bottom line is that they still see policy as accommodative and expect to continue raising rates at a measured pace. They gave every indication that they will continue to raise rates and that it is the strength of the economy that will lead them to do it."" While the Fed has raised the fed funds rate by 150 basis points since June last year, the yield on the 10-year note, in spite of a rise in recent weeks, remains 40 basis points below the level when the Fed embarked on the tightening campaign. The still low level of long-term rates is likely to bolster the committee's intention to continue raising the fed funds rate. Policymakers have highlighted froth in the housing market, encouraged by low long-term rates, and the knock-on effect on consumer spending. Futures markets have priced in a fed funds rate of about 4.1 per cent by the end of the year, which suggests expectations that the committee will raise rates again in September and November and uncertainty about whether there will be another rate increase in December. Many economists expect the Fed to continue raising rates next year, while some have raised the possibility of a larger 50 basis point rate if the committee decides that inflation risks demand a more aggressive approach. Alan Greenspan, Fed chairman, has said unit labour costs are the key to assessing the core inflation outlook. Over the past 12 months unit labour costs were up 4.3 per cent, but Fed policymakers are confident some of that reflects one-off bonus and stock-based compensation payments. ",Fed makes quarter point rate rise.,2005-08-09,The Financial Times
584,90.0,2005-08-10,"The refusal, so far, of long-term bond yields to follow short-term rates upwards is the ""conundrum"" highlighted by Alan Greenspan six months ago. But at least one observer thinks the Federal Reserve chairman, of all people, should see no mystery in this phenomenon. Robert Kessler says: ""He started out with the same conundrum."" Mr Kessler, who helps wealthy investors get access to government bond markets on terms usually reserved for big financial institutions, points out that in 1988, the year after Mr Greenspan took the helm at the Fed, 10-year yields started tracking higher with the Fed funds rate - but then refused to budge. Long-term yields hovered around 9 per cent as short-term rates went from about 7 per cent in May 1988 to almost 10 per cent in March 1989 (see chart). Something similar seems to be happening now. After the Fed hiked short-term interest rates for the 10th time in succession on Tuesday, the yield on 10-year Treasury bonds fell. Despite edging higher overall in recent weeks, the yield is still below its level of 14 months ago when the Fed began raising rates. In two intervening cycles, Mr Kessler concedes, 10-year yields did indeed move upwards in parallel with the Fed funds rate, following the conventional wisdom. But he sees similarities between the late 1980s and today that did not apply throughout the 1990s. Towards the end of the 1980s, lax lending on commercial property helped trigger serious problems in the US financial system, most notoriously among savings and loan institutions. Mr Kessler wonders if concerns about lending in the booming US housing market - and about consumer borrowing - could be affecting the bond markets this time around. He also sees little evidence of inflation either in the US or globally. Economic growth - particularly outside the US - hardly looks strong to him. ""The 10-year [yield] is predicting a slowdown,"" he says. ""How about accepting it?"" History suggests that when short-term rates begin to exceed long-term rates - a so-called inversion of the yield curve - a recession is likely to follow. David Rosenberg, chief economist at Merrill Lynch, notes that six out of the seven yield curve inversions since the late 1960s have preceded recessions. At 3.5 per cent, the Fed funds rate is still below the 10-year yield, which stood at about 4.4 per cent yesterday. But if, as many expect, the FOMC continues to raise rates by a quarter point each time it meets, the short-term rate will reach 4.25 per cent by the end of the year. Mr Rosenberg thinks Mr Greenspan is set on curbing the ""froth"" he has identified in the housing market. If he gets no help from rising long-term bond yields, that could mean taking the Fed funds rate well beyond the 4 per cent or so that many economists estimate to be ""neutral"" - a rate that neither fuels nor slows US economic growth. ""As we saw in both the UK and Australia, by the time those central banks were done tightening interest rates, a very flat or inverted yield curve occurred,"" said Mr Rosenberg during a recent conference call. He predicts a ""range-traded"" 10-year yield for the rest of the year but thinks it will fall to 3.5 per cent by the third quarter next year. Others are less bearish on the economic outlook and think long-term bond yields will rise. Strategists at Barclays Capital, for example, believe the US economy is ""firing on all cylinders"", growth elsewhere in the world will pick up, and 10-year yields will peak above 5 per cent early next year. Nevertheless, they expect a flat or slightly inverted yield curve later in 2006. Whichever view turns out to be closer to reality, Mr Kessler's analysis shows that 10-year Treasury yields tend to fall after the Fed stops raising short-term rates, with a corresponding rise in bond prices. That, at least, has been the pattern following the last four Fed tightening cycles. There should be no surprise about that either, according to Mr Kessler. He says as Fed rate rises begin to bite - usually well into the tightening cycle - they damp expectations for future growth and inflation, both of which influence long-term bond yields. Thus while high long-term yields are often associated with inflationary pressures, high short-term rates can mean something different. ""The higher the Fed raises rates, the more deflationary it is,"" he says. ",FT.com site : Rates cycle sets a familiar pattern.,2005-08-09,The Financial Times
585,91.0,2005-08-10,"The yen surged on Wednesday amid a potent cocktail of buoyant equity markets, a strengthening Japanese economy and signs that Junichiro Koizumi may remain prime minister after September's snap election. The yen has suffered for much of 2005, sliding from Y102.45 against the dollar to Y112.40 earlier this week as the resignation of the reform-minded Mr Koizumi compounded the problems caused by Japan's extremely low bond yields, which have led domestic investors to increasingly seek out higher-yielding paper overseas. However there were signs yesterday that sentment may be turning. Opinion polls published in Japanese newspapers showed an increase in Mr Koizumi's approval rating, while a majority of respondents said they supported his plans to privatise the postal service, the issue that brought his government down. Moreover Japan's domestic corporate goods price index, a measure of wholesale prices, rose 1.5 per cent year-on-year in July, outstripping forecasts and raising hopes that deflation may be on the way to being defeated. Furthermore Tokyo's Nikkei 225 stock market index rose 1.7 per cent, extending Tuesday's 1 per cent gain and pushing the index to its highest close since April 2004. Foreign investors are likely to be playing a part in the rally, supporting the yen in the process. In July foreigners bought Y1,323bn of Japanese equities, the highest figure since March 2004. As a result the yen rose 1 per cent to Y110.67 against the US dollar, 1.3 per cent to Y136.68 against the euro and 0.7 per cent to Y198.39 against sterling. Derek Halpenny, senior currency economist at Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi, saw a ""notable pick-up in demand [for yen] reflecting rising optimism over the economic outlook and falling pessimism over the political outlook."" Yianos Kontopoulos, global forex strategist at Merrill Lynch, added his voice to the yen-bullish chorus, arguing that politics rarely has more than a very short-term effect on G10 currencies. ""The bullish fundamental case for the yen is more compelling than it has been for some time,"" he said. ""The yen is undervalued, the domestic economy is showing increasing signs of sustainable growth and China's new FX regime coupled with expectations of further renminbi strength should support the yen."" Merrill sees fair value for dollar/yen at Y87. Elsewhere, sterling was buoyed by an unexpectedly hawkish Bank of England quarterly inflation report, which suggested last week's UK rate cut may not be the start of a trend. The Bank said inflation would rise above its 2 per cent target in 2007 if it was to cut interest rates again, but be around the target level if rates were now left on hold. ""[The] report indicates that the BoE is in no hurry to change policy further,"" said James Knightley, economist at ING Financial Markets. As a result the pound rose 0.3 per cent to $1.7923 against the dollar, a six-week high, and 0.5 per cent to GBP0.6888 against the euro. The US dollar was weaker for much of the session in the wake of Tuesday's monetary policy statement, which was generally seen as being on the dovish side. The Federal Open Market Committee essentially repeated its language from previous statements, despite a general improvement in US economic data in recent weeks. However by mid-session New York trading the dollar had recovered to sit 0.2 per cent stronger at $1.2348 against the euro and 0.2 per cent firmer at SFr1.2609 against the Swiss franc, despite hitting two-month lows against both currencies earlier in the day. With global appetite continuing to rise several emerging market currencies made gains.

The yield on the 10-year Treasury note was largely unchanged after the Fed's announcement, at about 4.4 per cent. Bond yields have risen in recent weeks, following stronger data and somewhat hawkish comments by Fed policymakers, but remains lower than when the committee started tightening. This is seen within the Fed as offsetting the committee's efforts to tighten monetary policy. Policymakers have also highlighted froth in the housing market, encouraged by low long-term rates, and the knock-on effect on consumer spending. Futures markets price a federal funds rate of 4-4.25 per cent by year end, suggesting the committee will raise rates again in September and November and uncertainty about a similar move in December. Goldman Sachs forecast rates would rise to 5 per cent in quarter point moves without pause by next spring. Deutsche Bank, which had been forecasting a 5 per cent rate late next year, said that following recent stronger data it now expected the Fed to reach that level during the summer. Such forecasts reflect the expectation that the Fed will need to restrict growth to contain inflation, rather than merely returning to a neutral rate, often described in a range centred on about 4.25 per cent. Other economists have raised the possibility of a half point rate increase if the Fed decides inflation risks demand a more aggressive approach. Alan Greenspan, Fed chairman, sees unit labour costs as the key to the inflation outlook. After falling in recent years, unit labour costs are now rising.

Ahead of the FOMC meeting in the US, it was mostly a day of waiting on events, with just 10,453 contracts traded in the December FT-SE 100 future, down from 16,295 on Monday. The independent traders mostly had the field to themselves and as a result the December contract moved around sharply at times. Dealers said the most encouraging aspect of the session was the solid, general support shown when the contract touched 3,000 around midday. Once or twice the premium to the cash market extended to some 20 points, which put the premium, briefly, in excess of fair value for the first time in weeks. December peaked at 3,030.0 just before the afternoon close and ended nine points up at 3,018. At this level the premium to the cash market is 9 1/2 and the premium to fair value around 18.

Traders said that technical pressures had slackened, and that marketmakers had largely succeeded in passing on the lines of stock left with them by the recent spurt of trading programmes. But two more, albeit smaller, programmes were reported yesterday and nervousness over the medium term outlook for equities continued to restrain trading volume. A firm opening on Wall Street, more than 15 Dow points up in UK hours, helped London at the close, as did a steadier trend in bond markets. However, the chances that yesterday's FOMC meeting could have led to a tightening of Federal Reserve credit policy had continued to overshadow London trading. The FT-SE 100-share Index closed 8.7 up at 3,008.5, having touched 3,011.3 earlier. The market's return to relative health was also encouraged by a better tone in stock index futures, where the December contract on the Footsie traded briefly during the day at a genuine premium, in contrast with its recent performance. The improvement in the market's technical position may help share prices rally over the immediate term - provided that some investment support for equities reappears. However, few analysts believe that the clouds have lifted in any permanent sense. Market concern that institutional investors are downgrading their equity holdings was further increased when Mr Barton Biggs, strategist at Morgan Stanley, the US investment bank, reduced the weighting of European stocks in his global portfolio by 2 percentage points to 6%. The two trading programmes spotted yesterday appeared to range across the full breadth of the stock market, taking in non-Footsie as well as blue chip issues. The FT-SE Mid 250 Index, drawing less benefit from stock index futures than the FT-SE 100 Index, slipped 3.9 to 3,517.5. Trading volume improved only slightly, the day's Seaq total of 544.9m shares comparing with 515.8m in the previous session. Monday's retail business was worth #1.22bn, at the low end of daily averages but still a healthy figure from the point of view of the London based securities industry, and an indication that the big institutions are not absent from the London equity market. Trading statements from leading British companies produced some features but again failed to encourage the stock market as a whole. In the construction sector, good figures from Tarmac stimulated confidence in the progress of recovery in the domestic economy but brought out profit-takers in the shares. In a generally uncertain retail sector, the first-half report from Sears was followed by increased activity in the shares although no lasting improvement in the share price. Recoveries in bank shares, in the leading pharmaceuticals and in selected consumer stocks was ascribed to the clearing away of the debris left behind by the recent selling bout. These sectors featured in the series of selling programmes reported since the middle of last week and are also closely linked to activity in the Footsie stock index future contract, which has been leading the market lower. Marketmakers are believed to have cleared their trading books, for the time being at least, and would therefore respond readily to any sign of buying interest in equities. But the market is likely to be poised for any reaction on Wall Street to the FOMC meeting. (c) The Financial Times Limited 1994.

Against the yen, the dollar closed in London at Y 98.1350, down from Y 98.70. Against the D-Mark, it finished at DM 1.5470 from DM 1.5551. In late trading it had dropped below Y 98.00 and DM 1.54. The US currency ended in New York at Y 98.105 and DM 1.5435. The D-Mark strengthened slightly on the European crosses, although political uncertainty in advance of the October 16 general election limited the upside of the German currency. The markets bounced the Italian lira around as they focused closely on the progress of Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi's attempts to pass a suitably tough deficit-cutting budget for 1995. The market had been on tenterhooks throughout the day, in anticipation of an FOMC announcement on interest rates. Most analysts expected that the Fed would not act at this meeting. Still, some corners of the market had priced in as much as a 50 basis-point rise, and the failure of the Fed to produce such a move drove the dollar down. It regained some footing as markets seemed to take the news with equanimity. 'The fact that the Fed has not done anything yet does not mean it will not do anything before the next meeting,' said Mr Adrian Cunningham, currency economist at UBS. 'It is bad, but not disastrous, for the dollar, since the Fed will probably maintain a bias towards tightening.' Meanwhile, the markets continued to await the outcome of trade talks between the US and Japan before the September 30 deadline for sanctions. Mr Ryutaro Hashimoto, Japan's trade minister, arrived in Washington yesterday and indicated that Japan would make an effort to reach a deal on the auto sector, the area which has been the most likely target for sanctions. The dollar moved positively against the yen on the back of these comments and analysts became increasingly optimistic that a reasonable compromise would be reached. Although political concerns kept the market apprehensive about the D-Mark, thin trading helped the German currency maintain, and even strengthen, its position against most other European currencies. Against the French franc it closed unchanged at FFr 3.417. Against the Danish krone it finished at DKr3.928, up from DKr3.926, and against the Swiss franc it ended at SwFr 0.829 from SwFr 0.828. The D-Mark is unlikely to get any inspiration from tomorrow's meeting of the Bundesbank council. In recent days the central bank's officials have been making comments which suggest that a cut in rates, which has been anticipated in some quarters, is improbable. Bundesbank council member Mr Reimut Jochimsen said the bank should pursue a cautious monetary policy while a further reduction in inflation may prove difficult because of rising commodity prices. In addition, yesterday's preliminary national cost of living figures for September came in at 2.9%, basically flat against 3% for August. These factors contributed to a market expectation that the Bundesbank will hold its fire tomorrow. But Mr Cunningham said: 'There is still scope for rate reductions if the trend in inflation continues to go down and the money supply shows a deceleration of growth.' The lira slipped against the D-Mark to as low as L1009.50 in early trading as markets responded negatively to the failure of the Italian government to reach an agreement with trade union leaders on a pension reform plan. But hopes that ministers could pass a budget as early as last night raised optimism about the lira. The Italian currency was further bolstered when Mr Berlusconi said the deficit reduction in the 1995 budget could exceed the previously planned L45 trillion. Mr Jeremy Hawkins, economist at Bank of America, commented: 'If the government stands up to the unions, even if they go on strike, that should be good for the lira in the long term. The markets want to see a government that has the strength of its convictions.' The lira ended in London at L1006 per D-Mark, unchanged from Monday's close. Sterling tracked the dollar down in late trading, but was relatively steady throughout the day. The pound closed in London at $1.5770, up from $1.5743, and at DM 2.4396, down from DM 2.4482. The December short sterling contract saw 16,350 lots traded and finished unchanged at 93.19, allowing for a short-term interest rate of 6.81%. In the UK money markets, the Bank of England provided late assistance of #155m after forecasting a shortage of #300m. Overnight rates traded between 4 3/8 and 6 1/4%. German call money was quoted between 4.30 and 4.40%. (c) The Financial Times Limited 1994. ",MARKETS REPORT - DOLLAR EDGES DOWNWARD.,1994-09-27,The Financial Times
591,97.0,1994-09-28,"Longer-dated US Treasury bonds retreated yesterday afternoon after it became apparent that the Federal Reserve had decided against an immediate increase in short-term interest rates. Late in the session, the benchmark 30-year government bond was 9/16 lower at 96, with the yield rising to 7.841%. At the short end, the two-year note was off 1/32 at 99 17/32, to yield 6.492%. In the early hours, traders were reluctant to make fresh commitments as the Fed's Open Market Committee was meeting in Washington to discuss monetary policy. The waiting ended at 2pm when the central bank issued a terse announcement that the meeting had adjourned. There was no statement on policy, which led observers to conclude that the committee had opted to delay its next move to tighter credit conditions. Only a minority of analysts had expected a policy change yesterday. Most believed the Fed would wait until after the November elections, despite a recent spate of stronger than expected economic data. Still, prices on longer-data securities backtracked on the announcement, amid concerns that the Fed was falling behind in the race to keep ahead of inflation. Early on, the market was presented with data suggesting the contrary. The Conference Board said its index of consumer confidence had fallen this month to 88.4, against a reading of 90.4 in August. The index, which had been expected to show no change, encouraged the notion that inflation at the consumer level was still not a threat. However, the report was not enough to lift bond prices, with traders preoccupied with the possibility of impending policy decisions. Positioning ahead of an afternoon auction of $17.25bn in new two-year notes was also depressing the market during the morning. Dealers had hoped to wrest concessions from the Treasury when it awarded the securities. In the event, the bidding proved to be lacklustre and the notes were issued at a yield which slightly exceeded expectations. But with the Fed revealing its hand just a few minutes later, the event was quickly forgotten. Trading in European bond markets was very thin yesterday, with few investors prepared to commit themselves before knowing the impact on US interest rates of the Federal Open Market Committee meeting in the US. German government bonds shrugged off data showing that year-on-year inflation in the month to mid-September was 2.9%, a fall from the previous month's figure of 3%. 'The market is waiting on the FOMC and has completely ignored these good inflation figures,' said Mr Pio de Gregorio, European economist at NatWest Markets in London. The market will be watching today's Bundesbank council meeting for a change in interest rates, but Mr de Gregorio said that he did not think there would be a change in rates before the German election on October 16. The December bund future was around 89.01 in late trading, up 0.09 points on the day. The yield on 10-year Italian government bonds fell 7 basis points to 11.76% yesterday. Mr Andre de Silva of PaineWebber said the optimism was prompted by hopes that trade union agreement on a cut in spending on pensions would allow the government to reduce its deficit. UK government bond trading languished in the shadow of the FOMC meeting and today's 10-year gilt auction. Mr Robert Thomas at NatWest Markets said he expected the auction to meet with good demand, but added that other gilts were being sold in order to buy the auction stock. He said: 'This is not new money coming into the market.' Mr Kevin Adams at BZW expected the auction to be covered between 1.5 and 2 times, but added that the switching out of other gilts may mean 'the after-market may be very heavy water'. This meant that if the Fed had increased rates, the market could gain in the morning, but trade off in the afternoon. The spread of gilts over bunds could widen to 165 basis points, he said, against 151 yesterday. (c) The Financial Times Limited 1994.

592,98.0,1994-09-28,"The US Federal Reserve indicated yesterday there would be no immediate move to increase interest rates, despite continuing concern in financial markets about inflation. In its traditional elliptical style, the Fed announced that yesterday's meeting of its policy-setting Federal open market committee had adjourned after more than four hours of discussions and would make no further announcement. Financial market economists said the Fed could still act to tighten monetary policy before the next FOMC meeting on November 15. Bond markets, which have shown much more anxiety about the possibility that inflation might accelerate than either the Fed or the vast majority of professional economists, fell by about half a point after the Fed declined to raise its rates. Equity markets remained largely flat. The Fed has not always announced its interest rate moves. But so far this year, to make clear it is taking action, the Fed has announced all five of its increases in short-term interest rates. When it raised both the discount rate and the Federal funds rate by half a percentage point last month, it said that was 'expected to be sufficient, at least for a time, to meet the objective of sustained, non-inflationary growth'. Many economists believe the Fed has succeeded in slowing the economy to a steadier and less inflation-prone pace, but markets have been taken aback in recent weeks by signs that growth remains strong. Most alarming to bond investors was the jump in industrial production in August which took the capacity utilisation rate calculated by the Fed to 84.7%, close to the 85% level at which many economists believe industry starts to hit production bottlenecks, pushing prices upwards. While the Fed's first steps to tighten monetary policy earlier this year were widely accepted as necessary, its more recent rate rises have provoked opposition from Democratic members of Congress and business groups. Both feared that the Fed could kill off the economic recovery by raising interest rates too much. New York Comex gold broke $400 an ounce and surged to a fresh 13 1/2 month high after the committee adjourned. The dollar initially fell against the yen and the D-Mark, but quickly regained its footing, rising above Y 98.0 and DM 1.543.

593,99.0,1994-09-28,"Stock index futures moved higher yesterday, and although trading volume was low - at under 10,000 contracts - the market's broad undertone was said by dealers to be much improved. Ahead of the FOMC meeting in the US, it was mostly a day of waiting on events, with just 9,478 contracts traded in the December FT-SE 100 future, down from 16,295 on Monday. The independent traders mostly had the field to themselves and as a result the December contract moved around sharply at times. Dealers said the most encouraging aspect of the session was the solid, general support shown when the contract touched 3,000 around midday. Once or twice the premium to the cash market extended to some 20 points, which put the premium, briefly, in excess of fair value for the first time in weeks. December peaked at 3,030.3 just before the afternoon close and ended nine points up at 3,018. At this level the premium to the cash market is 9 1/2 and the premium to fair value around 18. Traded option volume was 34,570 lots, down from a previous 39,507. FT-SE turnover was 10,776 but the Euro FT-SE was barely traded. British Gas was easily the most active individual stock option with 3,040 contracts. HSBC managed 1,955 lots and BP 1,705. (c) The Financial Times Limited 1994.

594,100.0,1994-09-28,"Selling pressure lifted somewhat in the UK stock market yesterday and, although investors remained cautious ahead of news from the US Federal Reserve's Open Market Committee meeting, the FT-SE 100 Index managed to regain the 3,000 mark. Traders said that technical pressures had slackened, and that marketmakers had largely succeeded in passing on the lines of stock left with them by the recent spurt of trading programmes. But two more, albeit smaller, programmes were reported yesterday and nervousness over the medium term outlook for equities continued to restrain trading volume. A firm opening on Wall Street, more than 15 Dow points up in UK hours, helped London at the close, as did a steadier trend in bond markets. However, the chances that a tightening of Federal Reserve credit policy could emerge in the wake of yesterday's FOMC meeting continued to overshadow London. The FT-SE 100-share Index closed 8.7 up at 3,008.5, having touched 3,011.3 earlier. The market's return to relative health was also encouraged by a better tone in stock index futures, where the December contract on the Footsie traded briefly during the day at a genuine premium, in contrast with its recent performance. The improvement in the market's technical position may help share prices rally over the immediate term - provided that some investment support for equities reappears. However, few analysts believe that the clouds have lifted in any permanent sense. Market concern that institutional investors are downgrading their equity holdings were further increased when Mr Barton Biggs, strategist at Morgan Stanley, the US investment bank, reduced the weighting of European stocks in his global portfolio by 2 percentage points to 6%. The two trading programmes spotted yesterday appeared to range across the full breadth of the stock market, taking in non-Footsie as well as blue chip issues. The FT-SE Mid 250 Index, drawing less benefit from stock index futures than the FT-SE 100 Index, slipped 3.9 to 3,517.5. Trading volume improved only slightly, the day's Seaq total of 544.9m shares comparing with 515.8m in the previous session. Monday's retail business was worth #1.22bn, at the low end of daily averages but still a healthy figure from the point of view of the London based securities industry, and an indication that the big institutions are not absent from the London equity market. Trading statements from leading British companies produced some features but again failed to encourage the stock market as a whole. In the construction sector, good figures from Tarmac stimulated confidence in the progress of recovery in the domestic economy but brought out profit-takers in the shares. In a generally uncertain retail sector, the first-half report from Sears was followed by increased activity in the shares although no lasting improvement in the share price. Recoveries in bank shares. in the leading pharmaceuticals and in selected consumer stocks was ascribed to the clearing away of the debris left behind by the recent selling bout. These sectors featured in the series of selling programmes reported since the middle of last week and are also closely linked to activity in the Footsie stock index future contract, which has been leading the market lower. Marketmakers are believed to have cleared their trading books, for the time being at least, and would therefore respond readily to any sign of buying interest in equities. But the market is likely to be poised for any reaction on Wall Street to the FOMC meeting. (c) The Financial Times Limited 1994.

595,101.0,1994-09-28,"The lack of a decision on US interest rates during European market hours left most bourses short of initiative, writes Our Markets Staff. AMSTERDAM was on hold, the AEX index rising just 0.19 to 400.66 with shares receiving a slight boost from gains in the Dutch bond market and in German bunds. Aegon was Fl 2.40 lower at Fl 99.40 after news that the company planned an early redemption of a convertible bond which could inflate the number of shares outstanding by as much as 8%. Heineken and Unilever put in firm performances as investors turned from cyclical to defensive stocks. Each gained Fl 2.00, at Fl 238.30 and Fl 196.50 respectively. Philips closed unchanged at Fl 54 after the Dutch goverment said it intended to give the company a Fl 100m research grant for digital radio and television, and the European Commission said it intended to take a favourable view towards a joint venture being set up by Philips Lighting and Osram, of Germany. PARIS spent a day waiting, not very happily, for the FOMC and results from its own corporate sector. The CAC 40 index fell 1.44 to 1,901.28 in turnover of FFr 2.49bn. Its mood looked negative: Monday's forecast of a 'very, very sharp' 1994 recovery from Peugeot was greeted with a fall of FFr 21 to FFr 772; the Canal Plus acquisition of 24.9% in the German television channel Vox left the French company's shares down FFr 25 at FFr 802. The main results of the day fell after hours. Societe Generale, just after the close, saw at least unchanged 1994 profits; the shares eased FFr 1 to FFr 534. Credit Lyonnais, some minutes later, fell into the expected range with a first-half net attributable loss of FFr 4.5bn; here, the certificates fell another FFr 13 to FFr 374. On the plus side, Eurotunnel recovered 80 centimes to FFr 21.90 after Monday's salt water leak scare, and Alcatel Alsthom rose FFr 6 to FFr 560 although the industrial conglomerate is expected to report sharply lower first-half net attributable profits this afternoon. FRANKFURT caught up with Monday's post-bourse losses during the session, the Dax index declining 9.96 to 2,058.73; but turnover stayed thin, investors awaiting the Washington rates decision and thought unlikely to take firm decisions on the market before the October 16 elections. Attention focused again on Metallgesellschaft, down another DM 14.70 to DM 118.50 after a low of DM 100 in Ibis trading. The shares were quoted at DM 211 only four weeks ago, but the latest falls came in big turnover and dealers yesterday thought it too early to call the turn in this downslide. Turnover eased from DM 5.3bn to DM 5.0bn. After hours, Siemens showed a rise on the day of DM 5 to DM 652.70 after weakness inspired by a magazine article on Monday; the group said yesterday that it was considering spinning off parts of its plant-technology division. MILAN put in a strong performance on expectations that Mr Silvio Berlusconi's government would finally unveil the 1995 budget last night, with cuts of up to L48,000bn from public expenditure. The Comit index rose 8.77 or 1.3% to 680.91 as Mr Berlusconi also held out hopes that the government might be about to publish a new calender of privatisations, or revenue targets from disposals. One Milan dealer commented that the market was prepared to overlook the threat of a national strike by trade unions, which had earlier rejected proposed reforms to cut the cost of of the country's pensions system. 'If that is the price that we have to pay for a strong budget, then so be it.' He added that the market was also supported by expectations of positive six-month figures from the telecommunications companies and from Fiat. Fiat led the market higher, picking up L101 to L6,793, while Telecom Italia rose L109 or 2.5% to L4,435 and Stet added L131 or 2.8% to L4,752. ZURICH adopted a weaker bias, the SMI index slipping 5.1 to 2,581.0, with investors unwilling to open new positions. Registered shares in Sulzer, under pressure last week, picked up from early lows to finish SwFr 1 easier at SwFr 923 after the group released lower than expected first-half net profits. However, analysts commented that the positive outlook for the full year and the perception that the first-half figure, while low, was also influenced by seasonal factors, helped to support the stock. Ciba gave up SwFr 8 to SwFr 745, while BBC was one of a few blue chips to move ahead, rising SwFr 6 to SwFr 1,171. MADRID tried to go higher but ended flat, with the general index just 0.07 firmer at 297.24. Turnover amounted to Pta20.6bn, boosted on the day by block trades arrranged by JP Morgan. Strength in Repsol was the most consistent feature of the session, the shares rising another Pta40 to Pta3,190, but in the banking sector Bankinter and Popular came late with gains of Pta200 to Pta11,750, and Pta110 to Pta15,310 respectively. BRUSSELS ended mixed, with the Bel 20 index easing 0.86 to 1,384.95 in thin turnover of BFr 1bn. The Luxembourg-based steelmaker Arbed stole the show with a rise of BFr 270 to BFr 4,770 after it said that a private offering of 1m shares had been priced at BFr 4,550, and oversubscribed.

By 1 pm, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was 16.49 higher at 3,865.73, while the more broadly based Standard and Poor's 500 was up a scant 0.88 at 461.72. But the Nasdaq composite was off 0.87 to 754.76 and the American SE composite dipped 0.99 to 452.75. Volume on the Big Board was a moderate 157m shares by early afternoon. After weeks of speculation over the Fed meeting, the big day finally arrived. In early trading, investors held back from fresh commitments as the members of the Fed's Open Market Committee discussed a sixth change in monetary policy since February. Most economists were expecting the central bank to opt to delay its move to tighter credit conditions for a month or two. An announcement was expected by the Fed during the early afternoon. In the meantime, investors received some evidence that the economy was cooling. The Conference Board said that its September index of consumer confidence had fallen from its August levels. Most analysts had expected the index to hold steady. It was a hopeful sign for investors, who feared that the prospect of accelerating inflation would prompt the Fed to lift rates yesterday, although it was unlikely that the reading would have had any influence on the outcome of the FOMC meeting. Bonds held steady amid the uncertainty, but blue chips were able to make some progress in the morning hours, carrying through a flurry of buying that lifted the Dow industrial index by 17 points the previous day. The gains were fractional, with the exception of Alcoa. The aluminium supplier's stock climbed $1 1/4 to $86 5/8, lifted by a 'buy' recommendation from PaineWebber. Elsewhere, share prices were mixed, with corporate news moving a few individual issues higher and lower. By early afternoon, the declines on the Big Board were holding a slight edge on advances. In telecommunications, Nynex gained $1 1/8 to $37 1/8 after submitting a seven-year framework agreement for regulating phone services in New York state, its primary market. A coalition of telecom providers, including MCI and AT and T, is offering active opposition to the proposal. In retailing, Gap Stores lost $1 3/8 to $30 5/8. CS First Boston lowered its estimate of the company's third-quarter and fiscal 1995 earnings. Micron Technology, the semiconductor supplier, receded $7/8 to $35 1/8. Trading in the shares remained brisk following a CS First Boston downgrade. Texas Instruments was down $3/8 to $67 7/8 even though Morgan Stanley placed it on its 'buy' list. 20th Century Industries, the insurance group hard hit by the California earthquake last winter, jumped $1 5/8 to $11 on news that American International Group had agreed to help shore up its financial position as part of a broad strategic alliance. AIG receded $3/8 to $89 5/8. A downward drift on the Nasdaq was led by Lotus Development, which shed $1 3/16 to $35. Fresh Choice, a restaurant chain, lost $2 1/4 to $21 on disappointment over its third-quarter results. Canada Toronto relinquished early gains to trade mixed at midday, the TSE 300 composite index standing 3.26 higher at 4,344.68 in low volume of 20.4m shares.

The Nikkei 225 average fell 345.47 to finish at 19,468.89, the first close below support at 19,500 since April 4. After reaching the day's high of 19,822.16 during the morning, the index declined to a low of 19,404.18 in the final half-hour of trading. On September 19, when the Nikkei 225 last approached the 19,500 mark, public funds moved in to arrest the decline. This time, public funds, comprising state run postal savings and insurance, seemed to remain on the sidelines. Volume was an estimated 231m shares, little changed from Monday's 239.41m. The Topix index of all first section stocks shed 22.46 to 1,562.75, while the second section lost 5.59 at 2,231.43 in volume estimated at 5.99m shares. Losers surged ahead of winners by 769 to 227, with 159 issues unchanged. But in London the ISE Nikkei 50 index gained 2.63 at 1,279.43. As on Monday, most traders stayed on the sidelines, reflecting uncertainties surrounding the US-Japan framework talks and Tuesday's meeting of the US Federal Open Market Committee. Yesterday was also the last trading day for delivery of September index futures. The thinness of the market made it vulnerable to a wave of afternoon selling that began with futures traders closing positions. The ensuing decline in futures prices triggered dumping of speculative stocks and unwinding of arbitrage positions. The resulting price slide was accelerated by index-linked selling and rumours that Morgan Stanley was cutting the weighting of Japanese stocks in its portfolio. Japan Telecom, being closely watched ahead of next month's listing of Japan Tobacco, fell Y 30,000 to another low of Y 4.02m. Other telecommunications stocks were mixed. Nippon Telegraph and Telephone dipped Y 1,000 to Y 884,000, but DDI, which lost Y 8,000 on Monday, rallied Y 7,000 to Y 878,000. Steelmakers suffered losses in some of the heaviest trading of the day. Nippon Steel, the volume leader, edged down Y 2 to Y 385. Kobe Steel slipped Y 5 to Y 326, Kawasaki Steel lost Y 6 to Y 432 and NKK ticked down Y 1 to Y 289. Electricals also came under fire. Matsushita Electric Industrial receded Y 30 to Y 1,600, Fujitsu Y 10 to Y 1,040, Hitachi Y 10 to Y 955 and Oki Electric Industrial Y 5 to Y 755. In Osaka, the OSE average slid 257.66 to 21,843.87 in volume of 36.3m shares. Roundup Lassitude afflicted several of the region's equity markets, as investors sat on their hands in advance of yesterday's FOMC meeting in Washington. However, there were one or two winners. HONG KONG closed mildly weaker in drowsy trading, the Hang Seng index easing 33.39 to 9,610.24 in turnover down from HKDollars 3.50bn to HKDollars 2.85bn. HSBC, the most active issue, lost 25 cents at HKDollars 87.50. It was followed by Hongkong Land, down 10 cents at HKDollars 19.35, while Hong Kong Telecom was 10 cents off at HKDollars 15.50. Sino Land, the most active of the new index entries on Monday, retreated 12.50 cents to HKDollars 8.625, and Johnson Electric declined HKDollars 1 to HKDollars 21.50. SYDNEY was nervous about interest rates as the All Ordinaries index dipped 16.2 to 2,013.8. Resources issues were dragged down by falls in the golds sector following a bullion price decline in New York, and by lower commodity prices in the US. The gold shares index dropped 46.5, or nearly 2%, to 2,343.8. Newcrest Mining lost 29 cents at A$6.50 and Placer Pacific 5 cents at A$3.93. SINGAPORE took a last minute dive and the Straits Times Industrial index relinquished 9.97 to close at 2,289.84. The fall was caused mainly by a loss of 60 cents in Cycle and Carriage to S$12.80, and a 30-cent retreat to S$11 by Sembawang Corp. Before that, investors seemed to believe that the Federal Reserve meeting could yield at most a 50 basis-point increase in interest rates, and that this would be acceptable. MANILA combined fears of another rise in US interest rates with worries about delays in the implementation of the value added tax (VAT), which could put more pressure on the Philippine government deficit. The composite index ended 9.93 down at 2,934.27. BOMBAY, also risk-averse, fell on fears of a plague attack in western India. Following Monday's halt in trading, the BSE 30-share index lost 51.97 at 4,444.56. SEOUL registered a strong rebound in blue chips as the composite index finished 6.89 better at a new closing high of 1,052.01. In spite of the rise, declining issues outnumbered gainers by 452 to 367. KARACHI, similarly, majored on index heavyweights as the KSE 100 index rose 17.48 to 2,237.65.

598,104.0,1994-09-28,"The dollar fell by nearly a pfennig in late trading yesterday as markets waited to see if the US Federal Open Markets Committee, the policy-making arm of the Federal Reserve Board, would raise interest rates, writes Motoko Rich. Against the yen, the dollar closed in London at Y 98.1350, down from 98.70. Against the D-Mark, it finished at DM 1.547 from DM 1.5551. The D-Mark strengthened slightly on the European crosses, although political uncertainty in advance of the October 16 general election limited the upside of the German currency. The markets focused closely on the progress of the Italian budget and bounced the lira around, reflecting the travails of Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi in his attempt to pass a suitably tough deficit-cutting budget for 1995. A market expectation that the FOMC meeting would yield either no movement, or at most a 50 basis point hike, pushed the dollar down against the D-Mark. Most investors have already priced in a 50 basis point hike, and anything else was expected to be negative for the dollar. Meanwhile the dollar was tightly range-bound against the yen as the markets awaited the outcome of trade talks between the US and Japan before the September 30 deadline for sanctions. Mr Ryutaro Hashimoto, Japan's trade minister, arrived in Washington yesterday and indicated Japan would make an effort to reach a deal with the US on the auto sector, the area which has been the most likely target for sanctions. The dollar moved positively against the yen on the back of these comments and analysts became increasingly optimistic that a reasonable compromise would be reached. Mr Avinash Persaud, currency strategist at JP Morgan, said: 'There was a belief that US officials had a dollar devaluation policy but that view is receding,' he said. 'So we may be overplaying the importance of these trade talks.' Although political concerns kept the market apprehensive about the D-Mark, thin trading helped the German currency maintain, and even strengthen, its position against most other European currencies. Against the French franc, it closed unchanged at FFr 3.417. Against the Danish krone, it finished at DKr3.928, up from DKr3.926 and against the Swiss franc, the D-Mark closed at SwFr 0.829, up from SwFr 0.828. The D-Mark is unlikely to get any inspiration from tomorrow's meeting of the Bundesbank council, where changes in interest rates are not largely expected. In recent days the central bank's officials have been making comments which suggest that a cut in rates, which has been anticipated in some quarters, is improbable. Bundesbank council member Mr Reimut Jochimsen said the bank should pursue a cautious monetary policy while a further reduction in inflation may prove difficult because of rising commodity prices. In addition, yesterday's preliminary national cost of living figures for September came in at 2.9%, basically flat against 3% for August. These factors contributed to a market expectation that the Bundesbank will hold its fire tomorrow. But Mr Adrian Cunningham, currency economist at UBS, said this situation would not hold forever. 'There is still scope for rate reductions if the trend in inflation continues to go down and the money supply shows a deceleration of growth,' he said. The lira slipped against the D-Mark to as low as L1009.50 in early trading as markets responded negatively to the failure of the Italian government to reach an agreement with trade union leaders on plans to reform Italy's pension system. But hopes that ministers could pass a budget as early as last night raised optimism about the lira. The Italian currency was further bolstered when Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi announced that the deficit reduction in the 1995 budget could exceed the previously planned 45 trillion lira. Mr Jeremy Hawkins, economist at Bank of America said: 'If the government stands up to the unions, even if they go on strike, that should be good for the lira in the long term. The markets want to see a government that has the strength of its convictions.' Against the D-Mark, the lira finished in London at L1006, unchanged from its Monday closing rate. Sterling tracked the dollar down in late trading, showing that it has not detached completely from the US currency. Against the dollar, the pound closed in London at $1.577, up from $1.5743 and against the D-Mark, it finished at DM 2.4396 from DM 2.4482. The December short sterling contract traded 16,350 lots to finish unchanged at 93.19, allowing for a short-term interest rate of 6.81%. In the UK money markets, the Bank of England provided late assistance of #155m after forecasting a shortage of #300m. Overnight rates traded between 4 3/8 and 6 1/4%. German call money was quoted at between 4.30 and 4.40%. (c) The Financial Times Limited 1994. ",MARKETS REPORT - DOLLAR EDGES DOWN.,1994-09-27,The Financial Times
599,105.0,1994-09-28,"US Treasury bonds held fairly steady yesterday morning as the Federal Reserve's policy-making arm considered the merits of a sixth increase in short-term interest rates this year. By 1pm, the benchmark 30-year government bond was 1/8 lower at 96 13/32 with the yield rising to 7.805%. At the short end, the two-year note was off 1/32 at 99 17/32, to yield 6.492%. At the opening, the uneasy calm which had dominated the previous session held prices close to their starting values. Traders were generally reluctant to make fresh commitments until receiving news about any decision reached by members of the Fed's Open Market Committee, who were meeting in Washington. Most observers were expecting the central bank to opt for delaying its next move to tighter credit conditions until after the November elections. An announcement from the Fed was expected during the early afternoon. Early trading was complicated by the government's auction of $17.25bn in new two-year notes, scheduled to begin at 1pm. Primary dealers, who are authorised to participate in such sales, attempted to drive down prices at the short end in an effort to wrest concessions from the Treasury when it awarded the issue. That strategy proved to be marginally successful, as bond prices across the maturity range dipped in light trading. The downturn might have been steeper but for some positive economic news. The Conference Board said its index of consumer confidence had fallen this month to 88.4, against a reading of 90.4 in August. The fall in the index, which had been expected to show little change on August, encouraged the notion that consumer inflation was still not a threat to the value of fixed-rate investments. The favourable surprise lent some support to the market, but its effect was to build a floor in prices, rather than provide a springboard for an advance. However, the tone was expected to shift dramatically in one direction or the other as the afternoon's events unfolded. Trading in European bond markets was very thin yesterday, with few investors prepared to commit themselves before knowing the impact on US interest rates of the Federal Open Market Committee meeting in the US. German government bonds shrugged off data showing that year-on-year inflation in the month to mid-September was 2.9%, a fall from the previous month's figure of 3%. 'The market is waiting on the FOMC and has completely ignored these good inflation figures,' said Mr Pio de Gregorio, European economist at NatWest Markets in London. The market will be watching today's Bundesbank council meeting for a change in interest rates, but Mr de Gregorio said that he did not think there would be a change in rates before the German election on October 16. The December bund future was around 89.01 in late trading, up 0.09 points on the day. The yield on 10-year Italian government bonds fell 7 basis points to 11.76% yesterday. Mr Andre de Silva of PaineWebber said the optimism was prompted by hopes that trade union agreement on a cut in spending on pensions would allow the government to reduce its deficit. UK government bond trading languished in the shadow of the FOMC meeting and today's 10-year gilt auction. Mr Robert Thomas at NatWest Markets said he expected the auction to meet with good demand, but added that other gilts were being sold in order to buy the auction stock. He said: 'This is not new money coming into the market.' Mr Kevin Adams at BZW expected the auction to be covered between 1.5 and 2 times, but added that the switching out of other gilts may mean 'the after-market may be very heavy water'. This meant that if the Fed had increased rates, the market could gain in the morning, but trade off in the afternoon. The spread of gilts over bunds could widen to 165 basis points, he said, against 151 yesterday. (c) The Financial Times Limited 1994.

600,106.0,1994-09-28,"There was a dearth of new eurobond issues yesterday, with bond markets nervous ahead of the US FOMC monetary policy meeting. Syndicate managers said conditions have worsened in recent days, with eurobond spreads over the underlying government bond market widening most markedly in the dollar and sterling sectors. 'The dollar market has recently been underpinned by good retail flows but these have now slowed,' said Mr Tim Skeet, senior vice-president at Kidder Peabody. 'The dollar market is suffering from uncertainty caused by the FOMC, quarter-end considerations and the fact that retail flows out of Switzerland and Benelux countries have slowed, particularly at the long-end of the market,' he said. Attention today is likely to turn to Lebanon's debut eurobond offering of $300m of three-year fixed-rate notes, increased yesterday from $150m due to unexpectedly strong demand. The bonds are expected to carry a coupon of around 10%, yielding around 325 to 350 basis points over US government bonds. Indover Bank, a Dutch subsidiary of the Indonesian central bank, launched its first foray into the international capital markets with a $125m offering of three-year floating-rate notes, offering a spread of 67 1/2 basis points over three-month Libor. Lead manager HSBC Markets said 70% of the bonds were sold into Europe, with the remainder placed in South East Asia. 'This is the bank's first transaction and it was anxious to come into the mainstream of the market, which at the moment is the short-term, floating-rate dollar sector,' it said. The Kingdom of Belgium's DM 1bn offering of five-year bonds, which was launched on Monday, was priced yesterday to yield 25 basis points over German government bonds, which some syndicate managers said was expensive. Hongkong International Terminals, a subsidiary of Hutchison Whampoa, is expected to launch a $1.74bn offering of 10-year floating-rate notes in the next 10 days. The notes will carry a coupon of Libor plus 85 basis points, with a call option at the end of the fourth year. (c) The Financial Times Limited 1994.

601,107.0,1994-09-28,"The US Federal Reserve indicated yesterday that there would be no immediate move to increase interest rates despite growing fears of rising inflation In its traditional elliptical style the Fed announced that yesterday's meeting of its policy-setting Federal Open Markets Committee had adjourned after more than four hours of discussions and would make no further announcement. Financial market economists said the Fed could still act to tighten monetary policy before the next FOMC meeting on November 15. So far this year, the Fed has announced all five of its increases in short-term interest rates. When it raised both the discount rate and the Federal funds rate by half a percentage point last month it said that was 'expected to be sufficient, at least for a time, to meet the objective of sustained, non-inflationary growth."" But economists, who had earlier thought the Fed had succeeded in slowing the economy to a steadier and less inflation-prone pace, have been taken aback in recent weeks by signs that growth remains strong. Most alarming to the financial markets was the jump in industrial production in August which took the capacity utilisation rate calculated by the Fed to 84.7%, close to the 85% level at which many economists believe industry starts to hit production bottlenecks, pushing prices upwards. While the Fed's first steps to tighten monetary policy earlier this year were widely accepted as necessary, its more recent rate rises have provoked opposition both Democratic members of Congress and business groups. Both feared that the Fed could kill off the economic recovery by raising interest rates too much. New York Comex gold broke $400 an ounce and surged to a fresh 13 1/2 month high after the committee adjourned. The dollar initially fell against the yen and the D-Mark, but quickly regained its footing, rising above Y 98.0 and DM 1.543. (c) The Financial Times Limited 1994.

602,108.0,2001-05-16,"As the debate continues over the prospects for the US recovery, the Fed is taking no chances. Its statement on Tuesday called the half point cut in interest rates a response to continuing weakness of the economy at home and abroad and diminishing inflationary pressures. Its tone suggested that further cuts might be on the way. The Federal Open Market Committee's judgment on Tuesday was a difficult one. While Wall Street has been looking for the bottom of the downturn, the news from Main Street has been unremittingly negative. Profits in the first quarter of the year plunged, partly because of rising energy costs, but mostly because of waning demand. This week's industrial production figures added to the gloom. Worst hit have been the technology sector and business equipment manufacturers, victims of the slowdown in investment. But the pain is becoming widespread. Few industries are immune to flagging US demand. The speed of the industrial slowdown is beyond doubt. The problem for the Fed was to judge how worrying this really is. It is still possible that the US is experiencing a one-off adjustment to a period of exceptionally strong performance. In high-technology industries, for instance, output has been falling at a rate of around 1 percentage point per month since the start of the year, but in April it was still up nearly 20 per cent on an annual basis. It is also at least possible that changes in US business practice are having a telescoping effect. If so, this would help to explain the severity of the slowdown. For instance, while the past few months have shown the depressing effects of the inventory cycle, changing inventory management techniques have probably speeded up the adjustment. Likewise, the rapid decline in payroll employment may indicate that US firms are more willing to shed costs at an early stage, rather than hang on to staff for as long as possible. The other major factor which the Fed had to take into account was the relative strength in the household sector. Consumer confidence is no longer declining, and according to one measure may even be rising. April's retail sales figures were good. Wage growth is strong. These conditions might have made the Fed wary of seeming to take a chance with inflation by shoring up America's debt-ridden consumers - and, for that matter, the financial markets. But with Tuesday's decision, Alan Greenspan showed that despite the risks, his instincts still lie with supporting growth. Nonetheless, given the uncertainties, he would be well advised to pause before a further cut. ",Growth gamble.,2001-05-15,The Financial Times
603,109.0,2003-01-30,"The Federal Reserve has placed its bet on ""oil price premiums and other aspects of geopolitical risks"". It is little surprise that the Fed left interest rates on hold yesterday. Its explanation that war risk is holding back business investment and spending and - once the picture becomes clearer - the recovery will follow is a little surprising. Is the threat of war really the only thing holding back investment and recruitment? Much like a year ago, monetary policy is extremely accommodative, there will be support from fiscal policy in some form and geopolitical risk clouds the outlook. But the danger remains that a falling stock market could again undermine confidence in the recovery. Geopolitical risks are part of the reason for corporate reticence. But so is past over-investment, continuing overcapacity, the lack of topline growth, pricing pressure, and a continued preference for balance sheet repair. Housing market activity remains buoyant, but it is surely worrying for corporate decision-makers that the US consumer is showing signs of fatigue. Meanwhile, the rest of the world economy is in dismal shape. The fourth quarter ""soft spot"" may be followed by a rebound in the first quarter. And a quarter-point rate cut is not going to kickstart US corporate spending. Having shifted to a neutral policy bias in November, perhaps prematurely, the FOMC may not want to reverse that now. But, even with short rates so low, it is hard to be confident the risks are balanced, or that Saddam Hussein is the sole reason for concern. London Edition 1.

604,110.0,2003-01-30,"When the chancellor of the exchequer announced that the Bank of England would become independent, that interest rate decisions would be made by a monetary policy committee and responsibility for banking supervision would be transferred to a newly created Financial Services Authority, Edward George, the Bank's governor, read the bill only when the ink had dried. The European Union has decided to do things differently when preparing the European Central Bank for enlargement of the eurozone to up to 25 countries. The outcome could be a bad system, one that risks undermining the credibility of the euro. Under current rules, the central bank governor of each new eurozone member would get a vote on the ECB's key decision-making body, the governing council. The council could thus grow to 30 members, including the six members of the executive board - too many for efficient decision-making. Under the Nice treaty, heads of government will decide how to reform the ECB's voting rules ""acting on a proposal by the ECB itself or by the European Commission"". Since the Commission has neglected to produce a proposal, the bank has presented its own: a rotation system whereby not every central bank governor would have a right to vote at each meeting. Eurozone members would be divided into three groups. The first, to include Germany, France, Spain, Italy and Britain (if it joins), would have four votes. The second group, to be half the total number of eurozone members, would have eight votes. The remaining countries would share three votes. Thus the number of votes in the governing council would be capped at 21. This complex proposal has three main flaws. First, it violates the spirit of the ECB statutes, which stipulate that national central bank governors sit on the governing council in a personal and independent capacity, not as national representatives. Second, the cap is set far too high. Today's council of 18 members is already too large. It therefore has a bias towards the status quo - interest rates are sometimes kept unchanged simply because it proves difficult to gather consensus in favour of change. Third, the composition of the voting team will keep changing. How frequently depends on how long some members go without a vote, something the ECB has not yet explained. The ECB's plan was clearly the result of a deal among the current members of the governing council. None of today's 12 eurozone countries stands to lose its vote for several years. To keep tiny Luxembourg happy, countries would be assigned to the three groups according the size of their financial system as well as their gross domestic product. Thus the Grand Duchy, in Group 2, would have a vote more often than Poland in Group 3. Best practice in central banking strongly argues in favour of delegating interest rate decisions to an independent committee. This is the model in Sweden, Australia, Canada and New Zealand as well as in Britain. Delegation to a committee is consistent with the ECB statutes. It is also consistent with EU decision-making in other areas. The Union has clear supra-national executive power in two areas only: monetary policy and competition policy. In the latter, power has been delegated to a committee - the European Commission. It is true the US Federal Reserve's open market committee, which sets interest rates, operates a partial rotation system among regional reserve banks. But the number of committee members with the right to vote is limited to 11 - and seven of those votes are reserved for members of the Fed's board of governors. Under the ECB's own plan the executive board, which speaks for the eurozone as a whole rather than for national interests, would eventually account for only six out of 21 votes. The Federal Open Market Committee, moreover, is dominated by its chairman. In the ECB national central bank governors are the strongmen, largely because many still act as financial market supervisors. Delegation of monetary policy to independent bodies, such as the ECB, is appropriate. What is not is for such bodies to be left to design themselves. National central bank governors should never have been allowed to propose new voting rules for the ECB. It was inevitable that they would come up with rules designed to protect their own interests. EU leaders should think hard before accepting the ECB plan. The writer is professor of economics at Bocconi University and a fellow of the Centre for Economic Policy Research.

605,111.0,2007-05-10,"Move along please, nothing to see here. The Federal open market committee's decision to leave its target Fed Funds rate unchanged at 5.25 per cent yesterday surprised nobody.  All 101 economists polled by Bloomberg had predicted it.  The language in their communique is almost unchanged, beyond acknowledging that ""economic growth slowed in the first part of this year"", which we knew already. Ben Bernanke, Fed chairman, and his colleagues may have learnt from the confusion that they triggered in the market with many subtle changes to their statement in March. This time, the bottom line is clear. Inflation and not slowing growth is the committee's ""predominant policy concern"". It will not cut without either a significant rise in unemployment or a financial markets meltdown.  Some traders had hoped for a hint that the Fed was less worried about inflation. That showed up in slightly higher bond yields and a slightly stronger dollar. But this did not stop the S&P 500 from closing at yet another new six-year high.  Today will be more exciting. With UK inflation now above 3 per cent, a rate rise from the Bank of England is a given. But will it be 25 or 50 basis points?  Markets are braced for 50 basis points of tightening over the next 12 months. Doing it all at once might make the BoE look rattled. But it would take the market by surprise. It might work better (bearing in mind Bernanke's experience in March) than an attempt to exert the same effect on the market through the use of rhetoric.  Rate rises may be the only language they understand.  Expect no such excitement from the European Central Bank, which is universally expected to leave rates on hold today. Even the risk of misunderstandings looks minimal. Look out for one little word. If the ECB says it is ""vigilant"", it will raise rates next month. If not, not.

The decision by the Federal Open Market Committee to leave interest rates steady and still flag concerns over inflation, sparked a brief bout of selling in stocks, that knocked them off their best levels for the day.  The housing market re-mains one of the economy's weak spots, highlighted yesterday when Toll Brothers, a builder of luxury homes, warned that it would not meet recent quarterly and annual guidance. Its shares fell 1.2 per cent to Dollars 28.85.  Beyond the FOMC meeting, analysts said the outlook for stocks remained positive.  A major talking point among investors yesterday was Cisco as its shares slid 6.3 per cent to Dollars 26.57. The computer network operator's fiscal third-quarter profits rose 34 per cent from a year ago, but investors were hoping for more robust revenue guidance. Cisco weighed on the Nasdaq Composite, which was down 0.2 per cent at 2,5567.16.  Blue-chips were a little firmer and at mid-afternoon the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 0.1per cent at 13,320.86.

607,113.0,2007-05-10,"The dollar held steady against the euro yesterday as the Federal Reserve left US interest rates on hold for the seventh consecutive meeting.  The central bank's decision to keep rates at 5.25 per cent came as no surprise.  The accompanying statement, which reiterated that the Fed's predominantconcern remained the risk that US inflation failed to moderate as expected, was little changed from that which came after its previous meeting.  Alan Ruskin, chief international strategist at RBS Greenwich Capital, said the Fed probably calculated that, having surprised the market with its statement after its last decision, there was no point in making minor changes that risked mis-communication for a second consecutive meeting.  ""While the statement is hardly a surprise, merely getting past the FOMC date removes a minor element of uncertainty and frees the market to even more actively embrace risk,"" he said.  The dollar was flat at Dollars 1.3540 against the euro by mid-afternoon in New York.  Analysts said caution before today's interest rate decisions from the European Central Bank and the Bank of England were also helping to subdue activity.  The ECB was widely expected to keep interest rates unchanged at 3.75 per cent and signal a 25 basis point rise in June. A 25bp rise in UK interest rates to 5.5 per cent has been fully priced into the market.  There has been speculation that the Bank of England's monetary policy committee could raise rates by 50bp as it battles to bring consumer price inflation back towards its 2 per cent target.  Ian Gunner, at Mellon Financial, said that the market was nervous about the outcome of the BoE's decision, especially since the MPC would have access to UK consumer price inflation data for April, due for release next week.  ""It would take something remarkably strong to move them into employing the shock treatment of a 50 basis point move, especially with the CPI rate set to head substantially lower from May onwards,"" he said.  ""The pound will retain support until this meeting is out of the way, but if only 25 basis points is delivered, sterling will most probably fall back.""  The pound rose 0.4 per cent to Pounds 0.6782 against the euro and climbed 0.4 per cent to Dollars 1.9975 against the dollar. The yen edged 0.2 per cent higher against the dollar to Y119.75 and climbed 0.2 per cent to Y162.24 against the euro, consolidating Tuesday's strong gains against the single currency.

608,114.0,2007-05-10,"The Federal Reserve yesterday made very few changes to its policy statement, keeping rates on hold at 5.25 per cent and reiterating that its ""predominant policy concern remains the risk that inflation will fail to moderate as expected"".  The policymaking Federal Open Market Committee again described core inflation as ""somewhat elevated"" - in spite of the dip in core inflation on its preferred measure in March to 2.1 per cent year on year.  This description will disappoint some investors, who were looking to the Fed to hint that the risks of inflation remaining at an uncomfortably high level have receded since the previous policy meeting in late March.  Equities traded broadly flat after the Fed's announcement, while the dollar edged up a fraction against the euro, with traders citing a reduced likelihood of early rate cuts.  Futures markets priced in a slightly reduced chance of rate cuts at subsequent meetings this year, with the market now assuming only a single rate cut by year end.  The FOMC did acknowledge that ""economic growth slowed in the first part of this year"" and that the adjustment in housing was ""ongoing"".  But it reiterated its view that ""nevertheless, the economy seems likely to expand at a moderate pace over coming quarters"". 'Moderate pace' in the Fed's lexicon appears to mean growth of roughly 2 per cent.  The statement seems consistent with a policy of keeping interest rates on hold for some time. As at the prior meeting, though, the Fed implicitly signalled that it was concerned about growth as well as inflation.  It said ""future policy adjustments"" - by implication, interest rate moves in either direction - ""will depend on the outlook for both inflation and economic growth"".  The statement was, on balance, slightly more hawkish than most economists were expecting.  It did not acknowledge any increased risk from housing in the light of early data from the spring selling season, nor did it suggest that inflation concerns had been substantially moderated by a combination of March's softer inflation report and April's weaker payrolls gain.  Policymakers are likely to want to see more evidence of moderating inflation and softer jobs growth before shifting to a neutral policy stance.

US bond prices were a little firmer early on Thursday after weekly jobless claims and the March trade figures.  The yield on the 10-year bond was 0.7 basis points lower at 4.662 per cent.  The dollar was 0.15 per cent firmer versus the euro at $1.3508, after the European Central Bank left rates steady. ECB President Trichet said the bank would maintain ""strong vigilance"" over price pressures in the coming months and that briefly pushed the euro to a high of $1.3564.

611,117.0,1991-10-02,"THE US composite index of leading indicators failed to rise in August, signalling possible future weakness in the US economy, the Commerce Department said yesterday. A separate report by purchasing managers indicated manufacturing industry continued to expand in September, but at a slower pace than earlier in the summer. The figures, suggesting a mixed economic outlook, were released as the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), the US central bank's policy-making committee, met to discuss interest rate policy. The committee was expected to lean towards further easing of monetary policy, but its deliberations will not be made public for six weeks. The index of leading indicators was flat in August after steady gains in the preceding six months. Six of its 11 components signalled contraction, including orders for plant and equipment, claims for unemployment insurance and real money supply. An index of coincident indicators - designed to measure current economic conditions - fell slightly and has shown no growth since June. Taken together, the behaviour of the indicators supports the view that the economic recovery faltered in late summer, but it does not yet suggest an economic relapse. The purchasing managers' index, a closely watched measure of manufacturing health, rose to 55 per cent last month, compared with 54.8 per cent in August. The increase was smaller than in recent months but indicates that prospects in manufacturing remain brighter than in the larger services sector. The index has been above 50 per cent - the level that indicates the manufacturing economy is expanding - for four months. Mr Robert Bretz, for the National Association of Purchasing Managers, said the economy 'seemingly paused to catch its breath' last month. However, the fifth consecutive monthly increase in new orders indicated 'moderate growth' in the final quarter of this year. Yesterday's figures and FOMC meeting follow high level discussions between Mr Alan Greenspan, Fed chairman, and the White House. Administration economists are urging new measures to alleviate the alleged 'credit crunch' - artificial restrictions on the supply of credit due to the weakness of the banking system - which is seen as inhibiting economic recovery. One option being considered is to relax bank capital requirements slightly to stimulate fresh lending. Economists are split over the importance of credit restrictions. The Shadow Open Market Committee, a group of monetarist economists formed to second-guess official monetary policy, says the economy is on track for 2-3 per cent growth and does not require additional stimulus. Prof Allan Meltzer, the group's leader, says the credit crunch is a 'red herring'. Bankers are applying tighter lending standards in weak sectors. But weak credit growth generally reflects weak demand, normal at this stage of the business cycle.

612,118.0,1992-05-20,"THE DOLLAR sank to a new three-month low against the D-Mark on the foreign exchanges yesterday on news of a bigger than expected monthly drop of 17 per cent in US housing starts for April, writes James Blitz. The US unit was trading at a low of DM1.5865 shortly after lunchtime in European markets, as dealers feared that the sharpest monthly fall in housing starts for eight years would force the Federal Reserve to ease interest rates again. When the rate cut failed to materialise at yesterday's Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting, the dollar regained some ground and closed in London 1/2 pfennig down at DM1.5905. Dealers said the dollar had been propped up by heavy bidding just below DM1.59 by two large German institutions and life insurance companies in Tokyo. In New York it ended at DM1.5903/10. However, analysts believe the case for a cut is much stronger following the housing figures, and could come today, when the FOMC meets again. Mr Neil MacKinnon, chief economist of Yamaichi International in London, said: 'The balance of probabilities is for the Fed easing.' He does not believe that the dollar weakness will last but thinks the currency could yet bottom out at DM1.56. The dollar also lost ground yesterday morning to the yen on news that Japanese machine orders for March were up 14.6 per cent from the previous month. The figure brought a strong reaction from the markets, coming one day after news that the Japanese trade surplus in April was 13.4 per cent higher than for the previous month. However, the Fed's decision not to cut rates gave the US currency a temporary respite and it ended a little firmer at Y129.10, and later closed in New York at Y129.12. The D-Mark continued to perform strongly in the wake of Monday's news that a large industrial strike had been avoided. Its best gain was against the French franc as traders took profits following last week's bullish performance by the French currency. The D-Mark finished at FFr3.3634, up about 1/2 franc. Sterling's recent rise against the D-Mark also seems to have petered out as traders give up hope that the pound might cross its central rate against the German currency. The pound closed 1/4 pfennig down at DM2.9250. One London dealer suggested that the pound's decline against the D-Mark may have been due to profit-taking in sterling/dollar trading, after the UK currency reached a high point of Dollars 1.8425 in London yesterday. The Swiss franc made new gains following Switzerland's decision to formally apply for EC membership. The Swiss currency ended about 1/2 centime stronger against the dollar at SFr1.4600.

613,119.0,2004-03-17,"The Federal Reserve yesterday left interest rates on hold and kept its accompanying statement almost unchanged, a sign that the Federal funds rate is likely to remain at 1 per cent for several months to come. In the only significant change, the Fed's open market committee said that ""although job losses have slowed, new hiring has lagged"". Following its January meeting the committee said: ""Although hiring remains subdued, other indicators suggest an improvement in the labour market"". The slight downgrading of the Fed's assessment of labour market conditions follows February's disappointing employment report, which showed that the US economy added just 21,000 new jobs last month. The committee reiterated that with inflation quite low and resource use slack, it believed it could be ""patient in removing its policy accommodation"". Investors had expected no change in interest rates and few economists had expected a change in the language of the committee's statement, other than a tweak to employment assessment. Immediately following the meeting the yield on the 10-year Treasury note fell six basis points to 3.71 per cent. While employment conditions remain weak, economists expect the Fed rate to remain on hold. Following the February employment report, the yield on 10-year Treasury notes had dropped from above 4 per cent to below 3.8 per cent at present. Federal Reserve officials have indicated that the risk of the US economy slipping into deflation is no longer seen as a serious threat. However, the committee maintained its judgment that the probability of an unwelcome fall in inflation has diminished and appears ""almost equal"" to that of a rise in inflation. It also maintained the judgment that the risks to attaining sustainable growth over the next few quarters are ""roughly equal"". In the other change, the FOMC said the data since its last meeting ""indicate that output is continuing to expand at a solid pace"". Fed officials believe its commitment to be patient has helped hold down long-term interest rates, without tying the committee's hands as might have been the case with its previous formulation that policy accommodation can be maintained for a ""considerable period"". Investors saw the FOMC as inching closer to the start of the tightening cycle when it dropped the considerable period language at its last meeting, and said in December that the risks that the US could slip into deflation had diminished. The economic data have changed little since the Fed's last meeting, with healthy growth in consumer spending and business investment. Industrial output growth was stronger than expected last month, helped partly by the weak dollar. The labour market still disappoints. The Federal Reserve first referred to policy being ""accommodative"" at the start of 2002, when the Fed funds rate was at 1.75 per cent.

614,120.0,1996-07-04,"The underwriters of the forthcoming FFr 40bn issue of asset-backed floating-rate bonds for Cyber-Val 07-96 - the largest-ever international bond offering - yesterday were busy preparing its launch next week. An investor presentation in Paris today will kick off a European roadshow covering Dublin, Brussels, Zurich, Geneva, London and Frankfurt. The deal highlights the growing receptiveness of European investors to buy asset-backed securities, which has spurred the launch of several securitised deals denominated in European currencies in recent months. The Cyber-Val issue will be backed by one third of the loan made by Credit Lyonnais to EPFR, a vehicle set up and guaranteed by the French state as part of the bank's restructuring package approved last year. The transaction, which will be lead-managed by Credit Lyonnais, Merrill Lynch and Morgan Stanley, is set to be launched around the middle of next week. It will consist of four tranches: a FFr 8bn one-year portion expected to be priced between 1 basis point below and 1 basis point above three-month Pibor; a FFr 8bn two-year tranche at between 1 and 3 basis points over Pibor; a FFr 8bn three-year tranche yielding between 4 and 6 basis points over Pibor and a FFr 16bn five-year tranche which pays back FFr 8bn at the end of the fourth year, set to yield between 7 and 9 basis points over Pibor. The issue is expected to obtain a triple-A credit rating. While the short tranches will be aimed at French institutions, the longer-dated bonds will be aimed at investors - banks, funds and corporates - across Europe. The bonds will be zero-risk weighted in France, and some dealers were speculating other countries might follow suit since bonds recently issued by Cades, the French agency set up to manage the country's social security debts, have been accorded a zero-risk weighting in the UK and Germany. Elsewhere, the meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee and today's US Independence Day holiday caused issuance to slow to a trickle. With institutional investors lying low, retail-targeted, high-yielding bonds were one of the main themes of the day. In the South African rand sector, the World Bank issued R200m of 13 5/8%, three-year bonds via Hambros Bank and Deutsche Bank Finance launched R200m of 14%, five-year bonds led by Deutsche Morgan Grenfell. The paper was aimed mainly at yield-hungry retail investors in Germany and Switzerland. The South African market has begun to shake off the currency crisis that sent bond yields soaring earlier this year; the rand is now back in a range of R4.30 to R4.35 against the dollar and South Africa's 10-year benchmark government bond now yields 14.88%, down from 15.5% about two months ago. The European Investment Bank meanwhile made its debut in the Czech Koruna market with Kc1.5bn of 10 3/4%, three-year bonds via Wood Commerz, a Prague-based joint venture between Germany's Commerzbank and a local brokerage - the first koruna bond underwritten by a domestic institution.

615,121.0,1996-07-04,"Most European bond markets traded quietly in a tight range while the US Fed's FOMC meeting was taking place. However prices of Italian BTP futures surged in late afternoon when Moody's, the US credit rating agency, announced an upgrade of Italy's domestic and foreign currency sovereign rating to Aa3, from A1. September BTP futures jumped to a high of 117.40 on APT, Liffe's after-hours screen-based trading system, after having settled at 116.83, up 0.01. In the cash market, the 9 1/2% BTP due 2006 was 0.04 higher at 101.86 at the official close, its yield spread over bunds 1 basis point tighter at 287. Final inflation data for June is due to be released tomorrow, and market participants expect a rate cut by the Bank of Italy to follow. * German bunds were supported by encouraging economic data and bullish comments by Mr Ernst Welteke, a member of the Bundesbank's council. Liffe's September bund future settled at 95.50, down 0.03, but off the day's low. Industrial production rose by 1% month-on-month in May, which made economists at HSBC Markets confident that ""the real economy is on the mend"". Analysts at UBS in Frankfurt concurred, adding that against a background of subdued inflation they expect ""the Bundesbank will help keep the momentum going with further modest reductions in the repurchase rate"". This view was echoed by Mr Welteke, who predicted a decline in M3 money supply and said there was still room to ""further lower the repo rate"". * Trading in UK gilts was subdued. The market was kept in check by the Fed's FOMC meeting as well as by the policy meeting between the chancellor of the exchequer and the governor of the Bank of England. Liffe's September long gilt future traded in a narrow range of 106 5/16 -106 9/16 before settling at 106 11/32, down 3/16. The volume of transactions, approximately 28,000 contracts, was less than half the 60,000 average of a ""normal"" session. In the cash market, the 10-year benchmark gilt closed at 96 15/16, down 5/32. After last week's rally, traders have adopted a ""safety first attitude"", said Mr Andrew Roberts, a bond analyst at UBS. ""Gilts have appreciated both in absolute terms and relative to bunds, so there is little incentive to adopt aggressive strategies"". Mr Roberts predicts the 10-year spread over bunds will soon reach 150 basis points, against 155 yesterday. * Spanish bonds closed lower, but the positive market sentiment seemed intact. The September futures contract on 10-year bonos settled at 100.44, down 0.33. In the cash market, the benchmark 8.8% bond 2006 was 0.43 lower at 99.46, its yield spread over bunds 5 basis points wider at 232. An auction of 5-and 15-year bonds was well bid, with yields falling by 28 and 35 basis points respectively from the levels of the previous auction. * French OATs traded in line with bunds. Matif's September notional future closed at 121.76, down 0.06. In the cash market, the 10-year OAT yield was 4 basis points below that of the equivalent bund, compared with 3 basis points on Tuesday. * US Treasury bonds posted gains yesterday after the Federal Reserve's Open Market Committee concluded its two-day meeting without raising interest rates. The benchmark 30-year Treasury traded lower through the morning and then rallied as much as a quarter point on reports that the Fed had left rates unchanged. By late in the session, however, the long bond was off its session highs with a gain of 1/8 at 88 11/32 to yield 6.926%. At the short end of the maturity spectrum, the two-year note was 3/32 stronger at 100 5/32, yielding 6.148%. The September 30-year bond slipped 3/16 to 109 1/4. Most economists believed that the Fed would leave interest rates unchanged, but earlier this week some stronger-than-expected data on business activity in June and new home sales in May threw some uncertainty into the discussion. Longer-term interest rates have barely budged since bonds rallied late last week after weak data led to speculation that the Fed would leave monetary policy unchanged. In the wake of the decision by the Fed to leave interest rates unchanged the market's focus moved to tomorrow's release of non-farm payroll figures for clues about whether the central bank might tighten later this summer. Mr Richard Gilhooly, an international bond strategist at Paribas Capital Markets in New York said bonds would probably rally if the jobs figure came in at or below the 150,000 analysts were expecting.

617,123.0,1996-07-04,"MARKETS REPORT: Foreign exchanges were fairly quiet yesterday as markets waited for the US Federal Reserve to announce the outcome of its two-day policy meeting. A measure of concern, however, did enter the markets about the health of President Yeltsin. Although exit polls suggested he would triumph in the presidential election, the uncertain state of his health has focused markets on who, or what, might follow him. The dollar finished little changed in London at DM 1.5252 from DM 1.5270. Against the yen it closed at Y 110.570 from Y 110.140. The Yeltsin worries contributed to D-Mark weakness in the morning, which saw the French franc dip below FFr 3.3799 and the Swiss franc rally to 81.87 centimes before finishing at 82.3 centimes. The early poll results suggesting President Yeltsin would triumph over his Communist challenger helped arrest the slide in the D-Mark, contributing to a weaker dollar in the US afternoon. The dollar was trading at DM 1.5222 and Y 110.35 in mid-afternoon New York trading before the Fed's meeting finished. Sterling was little changed, closing at DM 2.3777 and $1.5590 from DM 2.3762 and $1.5562. A late development was the news that the debt rating agency Moody's had upgraded Italy's rating. This saw the lira rally from a London close of L1,006 to L1,003 two hours later. Analysts said the enhanced appeal of Italian assets could well be sufficient to push the lira back through L1,000 against the D-Mark. * So far as the dollar was concerned, the FOMC meeting and Russia were the two events which dominated market thinking. Mr Jeremy Hawkins, chief economist at the Bank of America in London, said the market had become increasingly nervous about the prospect of US rates rising, especially after some strong data this week. He said the odds had probably shifted from 80:20 against to only 55:45 against, especially in the light of the strong purchasing managers survey, and new homes sales well above market expectations. Those who though the Fed might tighten used these data to support their case. Those who thought they would hold off invoked the authority of unnamed Fed officials who, a few weeks ago, said the Fed would not tighten policy until there were definite signs of inflation picking up. Mr Hawkins said the health of President Yeltsin had now become an issue in the market. ""Even if he does win, how long is he going to be there and who will succeed him?"" He said this issue looked likely to act as a medium-term ""D-Mark negative"". A side note to these issues was the performance of the Swiss franc. Although it was the beneficiary of the early D-Mark weakness, there were also reports out of New York of a large purchase of D-Marks against the franc. One analyst said this probably reflected the growing perception that the Swiss economy was the weakest in Europe - arguably one headed for a currency devaluation in the same way that the yen and D-Mark have lost ground over the past year. The yen itself slipped back on news that Mr Eisuke Sakakibara, the influential Ministry of Finance official associated with a ""strong dollar"" policy, will be staying in his job. * The recent rally in sterling has forced analysts to re-do their sums. Yesterday Goldman Sachs announced that it had revised its forecast higher against the D-Mark on the basis that the Labour party ""pro-EMU"" argument is likely to enjoy increasing weight in the market. Goldman is now forecasting DM 2.45 instead of DM 2.35 in six months time. Mr David DeRosa, a director of foreign exchange at Swiss Bank in New York, offers two possible reasons for sterling strength: * ""the speculative money wants to be short the yen and long somewhere else that has more kick on the upside than the dollar."" * ""a side bet on oil with the pound"". Mr DeRosa believes that the Likud victory in the Israeli elections has boosted Arab solidarity and hence the Arab bloc within Opec. This could favour a stronger oil price, which would help sterling as the UK is an oil producer. (In fact the benchmark price of oil is about 30 cents/barrel higher over the past month).

618,124.0,1994-12-21,"Wall Street US equities fluctuated in negative territory yesterday, showing little reaction to the Federal Reserve's decision not to raise interest rates at its open market committee meeting, writes Lisa Bransten in New York. At the close the Dow Jones Industrial Average was 23.55 lower at 3,767.15. The more broadly based Standard &Poor's 500 lost 0.59 at 457.32 and the American Stock Exchange composite eased 0.43 to 425.30, but the Nasdaq composite improved 0.62 to 728.51. New York SE volume was a substantial 327m shares. The Dow moved up near to Monday's closing level just after a spokesman for the Federal Reserve said the meeting had adjourned with no announcement, but proved unable to sustain that level. Few on Wall Street expected another interest rate increase, but the market was jittery all morning as investors waited for some official word. There was some speculation that the Fed might raise rates as much as 50 basis points. So far this year, the Fed has tightened six times, bringing the rate to 5 1/2%, from 3% in January. Reaction was muted to news that the trade deficit for October widened to $10.14bn from a revised September figure of $9.35bn. Although the trade deficit continues to grow, the October figure was generally in line with economists' forecasts. Several important announcements in the high technology sector moved share prices yesterday. Microsoft, which trades on the Nasdaq, dropped $3 5/8 to $59 after the software maker announced that a new computer operating system may not be available until August of next year. Intel advanced $3 3/8 to $61 1/4 after the company said it would replace Pentium chips on demand. Intel shares had been under pressure in the wake of growing publicity surrounding a flaw in the chip. Also benefiting from Intel's announcement were computer makers Gateway 2000 and Dell Computer, which are among the primary users of the Pentium chip. Just after Intel's announcement, Gateway said it would broaden the lifetime warranty on all of its Pentium-based computers. Its shares were unchanged at $22 1/2. Dell was up $1 at $38 3/4. Other technology shares were mixed. Hewlett-Packard rose $2 1/4 to $97 3/8, while IBM shed $7/8 to $70 3/4 and Apple Computer dipped $1/4 to $38 1/2. Monsanto fell $4 to $68 7/8 after the chemical company agreed to buy a specialty chemicals business from Merck. An analyst at PaineWebber, the broking house, downgraded the company, saying the agreement created the impression that Monsanto was not focusing on cutting costs. Merck put on $1/2 at $38 5/8. American Depository Receipts of Glaxo Holdings gained $3/4 at $20 1/2 after the drugs maker announced that it believed recent Gatt-related changes to US law would allow for the extension of the patent on its ulcer drug Zantac in the US. The announcement pushed up Bristol-Myers Squibb, which also faces uncertainty regarding a patent expiration. The stock rose $1 3/8 to $59 1/2. Telmex lost nearly 5% after the Mexican government announced that it was widening the band in which the peso trades against the dollar. ADRs of the Mexican telephone monopoly fell $2 3/8 to $46 1/8. Canada Golds led a firmer trend in Toronto which lifted the TSE 300 composite index 17.38 to 4,154.13, in spite of continued weakness in New York. Rising issues outpaced declines by 441 to 374 after volume of 72.3m shares. Eleven of the 14 sub-indices gained ground, led by communication, gold, real estate and paper stocks.

619,125.0,1994-12-21,"The dollar yesterday showed little response to the decision by the Federal Open Market Committee to leave US interest rates unchanged, writes Philip Gawith. The decision had been expected, but the chance of a surprise monetary tightening had left traders cautious ahead of the meeting. The US currency closed in London at DM 1.5720, from DM 1.5738, and at Y 100.13 from Y 100.155. Soon after the meeting finished, around 19.15 GMT, the dollar was trading at DM 1.57. It ended in New York at DM 1.5701 and Y 100.17. The main excitement came from Mexico, where the government sanctioned a 15% devaluation of the peso. The upper limit of the peso's trading band against the dollar was raised by 53 centavos. The daily rate at which the peso is permitted to slide against the dollar, equivalent to 4.3% in a year, was maintained after the devaluation. The peso finished in London at 3.885 against the dollar, 12% down from Monday's close of 3.4647. In Europe the lira remained the main focus, ahead of the no confidence vote later this week. It touched a record low of L1,049.80 against the D-Mark, but the market shied away from pushing it through the L1,050 barrier. Sterling had a quiet day, with the trade-weighted index ending unchanged at 80.3. The decision to devalue the peso was taken by members of the Pact for Well-Being, Stability and Growth. They include government, business, labour and campesino leaders. The Pact said the decision to allow the peso to slide was taken in response to rebel threats in the Chiapas region that have recently unsettled Mexican financial markets. A growing current account deficit, however, provides an economic explanation for currency weakness. Before yesterday's move, some observers had considered the peso overvalued, in spite of having fallen by more than 10% against the dollar during the year. Mexico's current account deficit is expected to widen to about $28bn this year, more than 7% of gross domestic product. With capital flows insufficient to finance the deficit, reserves have fallen by about $10bn since February, and short-term interest rates have risen above 14%, more than 7% in real terms. Some economists argued that for interest rates to come down and economic growth to accelerate, above the 3% expected for this year, a devaluation was necessary. Until yesterday, the government had been opposed to a devaluation, arguing that interest rates would still rise, to quell concerns about imported inflation, while Mexican companies with large foreign currency loans would suffer heavy losses. Last week Mr Jaime Serra Puche, finance minister, said the peso would be defended with higher interest rates, at the expense of 1995 growth targets. The bellwether interest rate on the 91-day tesobono, a dollar-denominated money market instrument, rose after the announcement by 88 basis points to 8.28%. The Pact said, however, that Mexico would be able to meet its economic goals in 1995, particularly that of price stability, supply and economic growth. The dollar showed little response to the release of October trade figures, in spite of a widening in the bilateral deficit with Japan. Ahead of the FOMC meeting, analysts said the dollar had limited downside if interest rates were kept on hold. Mr Neil MacKinnon, chief economist at Citibank in London, said investors were expecting the dollar to move higher in 1995. After meeting recently with a cross-section of the firm's US clients, he said he 'did not come across anybody who was bearish on the dollar'. His view that the dollar would reach DM 1.65/70 next year, possibly in the first quarter, 'seemed to be generally accepted'. Mr MacKinnon added that rising German interest rates - he expects the first upward move in the first quarter of 1995 - would cap the dollar's progress. He said it was also his impression that the Bundesbank did not like the D-Mark slipping through the DM 1.70 level against the dollar. The Bank of England cleared an #850m money market shortage, mostly through late assistance. (c) The Financial Times Limited 1994.

Although Mr Berlusconi's government already faces motions for three no-confidence votes, a cabinet spokesman said that under Italy's constitution a motion for a confidence vote takes precedence over a no-confidence vote. If Mr Berlusconi loses the vote and resigns, he would demand immediate elections, the spokesman said. Many observers said that if the government loses the vote - which is seen as increasingly likely - the president might set up an interim 'institutional government' to restore political calm. Ultimately, however, 'another general election is likely in the spring, irrespective of whether Berlusconi survives the vote or an institutional government is established,' said Mr Ken Wattret, international economist at HSBC Markets. The market shrugged off the final approval by the lower house of Italy's parliament to the 1995 budget, which now becomes law. The budget, consisting of three separate items of legislation, aims to reduce next year's deficit by L48,000bn to L138,600bn. The March BTP futures contract on Liffe ended at 98.99, down 0.01 point on the day. German government bonds ended a lacklustre session little changed in spite of lower-than-expected money supply data. Annualised M3 growth fell to 6% - the top of the Bundesbank's target range - in November, from 6.8% in October. The market also shrugged off the Bundesbank's announcement of a 10-year bund issue planned for December 28 and 29 - the government's traditional New Year bond. Some were disappointed that Bonn was not issuing a 30-year bond. 'The Finance Ministry said last year that they would issue at least one 30-year bond each year, but they haven't,' said a Frankfurt dealer, adding: 'The market needs fresh 30-year supply to keep the long end liquid.' The 10-year March bund future on Liffe closed at 89.65, down 0.05 point. UK gilts ended a slow day slightly weaker on thin volume. Prices softened slightly on strong M4 lending data for November, but dealers reported little trading activity. 'People are mainly tying up loose ends and closing their books,' said one trader. However, another dealer reported some demand for index-linked gilts, which rose by about 1/4 point. The March long gilt future on Liffe ended at 102 3/16, down 1/8 point. US Treasury prices were mixed yesterday after the Federal Reserve's open market committee ended its last meeting of the year without taking any action. Late in the session the benchmark 30-year government bond was down 5/32 at 95 31/32 yielding 7.845%. At the short end of the market, the two-year note was up 1/16 at 99 7/16, yielding 7.545%. As the FOMC meeting began, most analysts discounted the chances of another interest rate increase. Still, some economists had said they thought the Fed might boost rates as much as 50 basis points, and the market was skittish all morning as the committee met in private. Prices hardly moved after a spokesman for the Fed said the FOMC meeting had adjourned and there would be no statement. Since the last FOMC meeting, the yield spread between two-year and 30-year bonds narrowed as the market became convinced that the Fed's tightening would restrain the robust economy. Over the past week it widened slightly after mild inflation figures led investors to bet against a rate increase in December. Release of the October trade figures drew only muted reaction. The Commerce Department reported the trade deficit widened to $10.1bn from a revised September figure of $9.35bn. In spite of the increase in the trade deficit, the market held steady as the figure was well within the range of consensus estimates. Also, a steady dollar helped stabilise the bond market.

621,127.0,1994-12-21,"Takeover stories, actual and rumour-based, continued to dominate the UK equity market yesterday with news of De La Rue's #682m bid for Portals, and the prospect of many more bids and mergers in coming months, overriding the market's fundamental concerns over the short term prospects for domestic and international interest rates. As the London market closed, no hard news had emerged from the Federal Open Market Committee's meeting held to discuss monetary policy, although Wall Street was under renewed pressure for much of the afternoon and down over 20 points an hour after London closing. The feeling remained in both Europe and the US that the Federal Reserve would want to examine all the economic evidence from the fourth quarter before it moved to increase its interest rates so soon after the last move. That took place in mid-November when the Fed increased its Fed Funds rate by 75 basis points to 5 1/2%. On top of the previous session's 16-point fall, dealers said the latest weakness had produced some tremors around UK dealing desks during the last two hours of trading. But the general consensus among traders was that London would probably wind down for the Christmas holiday in good form, given no shift in US interest rates. Helping to sustain all European equity and bond markets was more good news on inflation and money supply from Germany. Germany's M3 money supply grew by an annualised 6% in the year to end-November, much better than the consensus forecast of 6.3% and the annualised 6.9% for the year to end-October. Inflation figures for November from Bavaria were also seen as bullish for markets. 'The German numbers were very good for the markets, well within target ranges,' said the head trader at one of the leading European banks in London. He added that London's equity market would take heart from any strength in Euro bourses, especially Frankfurt. The Bundesbank Council meets in Frankfurt tomorrow to decide the course of German interest rates. By the close of trading the FT-SE 100 index had risen a further 23.7 to 3,058.1, its highest level since the end of November and a rise of 114.7, or 3.9% since December 12 when the market was reeling from a combination of political and economic worries. The FT-SE Mid 250 Index was left behind by its senior index, closing only 3.7 higher at 3,463.7. Earlier, the market had begunon a quiet note, mindful of the overnight fall on Wall Street. Down 3.9 at the outset the FT-SE 100 index quickly rallied as news of the De La Rue bid for Portals - at a much higher than expected price - and other potential bids hit the market. Helping the market move ahead was a #30m-plus programme trade which was said to have been weighted on the buy side and executed by UBS. Turnover, boosted by the UBS programme trade, increased to a highly respectable 798.4m shares, with non-Footsie stocks providing almost 66% of that figure. Customer business on Monday was worth #1.275bn. De La Rue, although feeding the market's takeover appetite with its agreed offer for Portals, suffered from the view that the company was paying a full price for the paper manufacturer. The merchant banks and securities houses attracted yet another wave of strong buying interest as speculators continued to bet on a series of rationalisation moves in the UK securities business. Kleinwort Benson and Smith New Court, both highly-rated and sizeable players in London markets, moved near their highest levels since February, when bond and equity markets began their interest rate driven descent.

622,128.0,1994-12-21,"Politics was a mixed blessing for bourses yesterday, writes Our Markets Staff. It kept Milan volatile, currently on the upside, and yet another strategist, Mr Jerry Evans at Kleinwort Benson, said that political concerns were overdone and that Italian equities offered solid value. But political developments continued to depress Madrid. MILAN continued to forge ahead with the weak lira, at an all-time low against the D-Mark, offering an apparent bonus to foreign investors. The Comit index rose 5.65 to 612.91. Analysts commented that the market was looking beyond the political chaos surrounding Mr Silvio Berlusconi's government, and hoping that it would soon be replaced by a caretaker institutional administration, with a prime minister selected from outside the political parties. Blue chips were broadly higher. Fiat which set the pace early in the day finished L54 higher at L5,849, off a high of L5,885. Telecom Italia, under pressure recently over the concessions that it pays to the government on its mobile telephones, rebounded L120 or 3.0% to L4,095. Credito Italiano picked up L16 to L1,660, with no takers seen for its Credito Romagnolo bid, but a fresh offer still not ruled out. Rolo finished L66 down at L18,850. MADRID, already depressed about the political future of its prime minister, Mr Felipe Gonzalez, dropped again after Monday's detention of a former state security chief in connection with anti-Eta undercover operations in the 1980s. The general index fell 2.91 to 293.46. Banesto dropped another Pta27 to Pta929 after an intraday low of Pta904 as its former chairman, Mr Mario Conde, resumed his high court testimony related to criminal charges filed last week. FRANKFURT recovered some of Monday's post bourse losses in the morning, but it could go no further in the afternoon as the Ibis indicated Dax ended at 2,080.16, up 13.57 after a session close of 2,079.93. Turnover fell from DM 5.2bn to DM 4.5bn. Dealers said that the market was waiting to hear the result of yesterday's FOMC meeting in Washington, although the Fed was not actually expected to act on US interest rates this week. There were contrasts in automotive stocks. BMW continued to rise, although analysts had said that its supply contract with Rolls Royce was a boost to sentiment, rather than BMW profits on any scale; the shares closed the afternoon another DM 12 ahead at DM 766; but Continental fell DM 3.10 to DM 218 after strength last week on a progress report from the tyremaker. PARIS moved in a narrow range as investors remained quiet ahead of events in the US. The CAC-40 index drifted down 3.37 to 1,924.72. Kleinwort Benson's French equity team remained neutral on the market, noting that in spite of a modest return of overseas institutions recently, upside was limited in the absence of the domestic investor and support from the bond market. In addition, the broker said, sentiment remained pressured by the overhanging privatisation programme, as well as political uncertainty ahead of April's presidential election. Danone rose FFr 4 to FFr 777, as the foods group took a controlling stake in Russia's biggest biscuit manufacturer. The acquisition fits in with the company's efforts to establish operations in emerging markets; it recently announced that it had taken a 50% stake in an Argentine biscuit producer. ZURICH was higher in low volume, supported by gains in Roche and UBS, and the SMI index rose 14.0 to 2,614.7. UBS bearers gained SwFr 18 to SwFr 1,078, with the bank again said to be a buyer of the stock. Roche certificates rose SwFr 55 to SwFr 6,190 and BBC was SwFr 13 higher at SwFr 1,120 amid indications that some foreign investors were raising their holdings of dollar sensitive stocks. Ascom was SwFr 50 ahead at SwFr 1,350 in further response to the weekend news that the group had a new chief executive. Hero, the food group, saw its bearers up SwFr 13 to SwFr 658 and the registered SwFr 5 higher to SwFr 175, extending Monday's sharp gain on rumours that it was to be acquired by Del Monte for an estimated SwFr 1bn. AMSTERDAM barely moved, the AEX index retreating 0.21 to 410.64. Hoogovens outperformed, up Fl 1.40 to Fl 75.80; brokers said that it was supported by local investors. KPN, rising 70 cents to Fl 58.60, got similar treatment ahead of its expected listing as a constituent of the blue chip index.

623,129.0,1994-12-21,"World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific) - Arbitrage buying lifts Nikkei for fifth day in a row. Tokyo Arbitrage buying pushed share prices higher for the fifth consecutive trading day, as the rise of the Nikkei index above a technical resistance level cheered investors, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. The Nikkei 225 average rose 136.13 to 19,406.98, having fluctuated between 19,193.64 and 19,417.88. Having lost ground in the morning on profit-taking, futures purchasing in the afternoon prompted index-linked buying, and the Nikkei's rise above 19,340, considered by traders as an important resistance level, prompted short-covering. Volume was 250m shares, against 254m. 'Most of the trading is still arbitrage linked, but some foreign investors are buying to cover their short positions ahead of the year-end,' said Mr Yasuo Ueki at Nikko Securities. Institutional investors remained absent ahead of yesterday's FOMC meeting in the US. The Topix index of all first section stocks rose 10.59 to 1,524.90, while the Nikkei 300 moved up 1.79 to 281.76. Advances led declines by 724 to 265, with 192 issues unchanged. In London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index gained 0.59 at 1,272.74. Overseas investors bought financials: Industrial Bank of Japan and Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank rose Y 30 apiece to Y 2,830 and Y 1,880 respectively. Brokers were also higher, with Nomura Securities adding Y 30 at Y 2,030. Reports of the popularity of new 32-bit electronic games lifted Sony Y 50 to Y 5,550. Sega Enterprises, the video game maker which has also recently introduced its new game hardware, climbed Y 110 to Y 5,750. But some high-technology issues lost ground on profit-taking: Fujitsu fell Y 7 to Y 970. Steel issues rallied on bargain hunting, having been sold off by overseas investors. NKK put on Y 5 at Y 274 and Nippon Steel Y 3 at Y 362. Sakai Ovex, a synthetic fabrics manufacturer, lost Y 6 at Y 657 after fluctuating in speculative trading. Privatisation stocks were higher, with Nippon Telegraph and Telephone up Y 5,000 to Y 844,000. Investors were encouraged by reports that the government had approved NTT's plan to lift basic subscription charges and directory assistance rates from February next year. In Osaka, the OSE average rose 118.91 to 21,045.85 in volume of 106.9m shares. Roundup The region was mixed, with many investors awaiting the outcome of yesterday's US FOMC meeting. HONG KONG reversed an early 99-point loss but trading was relatively thin ahead of the US rates decision. The Hang Seng index ended 88.99 ahead at 8,267.33, in turnover of HKDollars 2.2bn, down from Monday's HKDollars 2.8bn. Brokers said that the late rally was fuelled by buy orders from Europe for Hang Seng index constituents. Overall market sentiment remained bearish and activity was subdued as many foreign fund managers had already closed their books for the year. Banks were the best performers, with the sub-index rising 2.1%. HSBC and Hang Seng Bank added HKDollars 1.50 each at HKDollars 83.75 and HKDollars 57. Bank of East Asia surged HKDollars 1.55 to HKDollars 30.80 on news that it will disclose its inner reserves. SEOUL remained worried about liquidity and the composite index dipped 4.63 to 1,023.99, a sixth consecutive decline. Brokers said that unfounded rumours that the government would soon scrap cash deposit requirements for institutional investors failed to boost blue chips before government officials denied that such a step was planned. Korea Mobile Telecom again went limit down, losing Won10,000 to Won443,000, and Samsung Electronics fell Won1,900 to Won107,000. KUALA LUMPUR reversed an easier morning trend to end higher, led by institutional buying of Tenaga Nasional and Telekom Malaysia. The composite index rose 8.94 to 966.19, although activity was subdued. Telekom advanced 40 cents to M$17.70 and Tenaga was up 30 cents at M$10.50. Pernas International added 38 cents at M$3.62 after its proposed one-for-two bonus issue was approved by the securities commission. TAIPEI lost Monday's gains on a bout of heavy profit-taking. The weighted index fell 1.8% or 130.02 to 6,925.28. Turnover was TDollars 104bn. The financial sector was the hardest hit, with ICBC falling TDollars 5.50 or 5% to TDollars 104.50 and Chang Hwa Bank down TDollars 10 or 4.8% to TDollars 198. Textiles were also weak, Chung Shing Textile slipping 40 cents to TDollars 21.40. Shinkong Synthetic Fibres went against the trend, appreciating TDollars 1.10 or 2.55% to TDollars 44.90. MANILA saw selective buying of heavily weighted stocks, including PLDT and San Miguel, which helped to lift the composite index 16.78 to 2,740.04. Turnover totalled a moderate 2.37bn pesos. Some brokers commented that many investors were taking positions in blue chips ahead of dividend declarations in the first two months of 1995. The commercial-industrial sector led advancing areas, gaining 17.61 at 4,037.17. SYDNEY was easier as it tracked the overnight performance of Wall Street. The All Ordinaries index was off 1.4 at 1,898.6 but after an intraday low of 1,890.8. Trading was modest, with shares valued at A$397m changing hands. Mining stocks were generally higher, however, with the exception of CRA, 2 cents softer at A$17.82. Banks were mixed, with NAB retreating 14 cents to A$10.30, mainly on options-linked deals, as Westpac rose 5 cents to A$4.33 and CBA 4 cents to A$8.17. BANGKOK picked up just before the close on late speculative buying in the finance sector. The SET index improved 14.90 to 1,352.68 in moderate turnover of Bt4.7bn. The finance sector rose 2.6%, with Phatra Thanakit firming Bt7 to Bt199. KARACHI plunged to a year's low on continuing worries about trouble and violence in the city. The KSE 100-share index shed 61.41 or 3% to 1,937.13. Declining issues led advances by 220 to 45. (c) The Financial Times Limited 1994.

The FOMC is considering statistics which suggest a high pressure of demand and activity, along with reports from member banks which paint a more subdued picture of the economy. The trade figures reflected falls in both imports and exports from their high September values, and the change in the balance was more than accounted for by a sharp rise in export deliveries of aircraft, always a volatile series.

625,131.0,1988-12-15,"There were no surprises in yesterday's (14.12.88) batch of US economic data which were in line with expectations and left Treasury bonds drifting lower in dull trading. By the close, short-dated maturities were quoted around 1/16 point lower, medium-date issues were up to 1/8 point lower and long-dated issues slumped by as much as 3/4 point. Despite the relatively larger losses at the long end, the yield curve remained inverted with the yield on the 8.875 per cent 1990 issue at 9.155 per cent and the yield on the Treasury's benchmark long bond rising to 9.041 per cent. Although yesterday's figures were almost exactly as forecasters had predicted, the dollar slid on foreign exchanges which put some pressure on bonds. In late trading, the US currency was quoted at Y 122.65 compared with an early high of Y 123.45 and at DM 1.7385 from DM 1.7505 earlier. Yesterday's batch of figures confirmed that progress towards reducing the trade deficit is now very sluggish and that manufacturing production continues to be robust. It is still unclear, however, whether there is enough strength in the economy (and therefore a substantial enough threat of inflation) to push the discount rate higher. The Federal Open Market Committee ended its two-day meeting yesterday and the bond market will be focused on the Federal Reserve's money market operations over the next few weeks.

626,132.0,1988-12-15,"The US trade deficit improved by dollars 0.4 bn to dollars 10.3 bn in October, the Department of Commerce announced yesterday. Meanwhile the Federal Reserve Board issued figures showing that output and capacity pressures continue to rise sharply in the final quarter of the year, after a slack third quarter. All the figures were closely in line with market expectations, and the markets continued to drift while awaiting the outcome of the meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee, which ended yesterday. The FOMC is considering statistics which suggest a high pressure of demand and activity, along with reports from member banks which paint a more subdued picture of the economy. The trade figures reflected falls in both imports and exports from their high September values, and the change in the balance was more than accounted for by a sharp rise in export deliveries of aircraft, always a volatile series. Other details showed the effects of high domestic demand; exports of chemicals and paper products, where capacity is under strain, fell sharply. On the import side there was a surge in shipments of manufactures, which rose dollars 2.2 bn from September and stood at dollars 2.8 bn above the monthly average for the first nine months of 1988. Such a surge was widely expected after earlier reports that wholesale and retail stocks had been reduced sharply in earlier months, in an effort to avoid the excess inventories which built up in the final quarter of 1987. The November industrial output figures from the Federal Reserve showed a volume increase of 0.5 per cent for the second successive month, with manufacturing output up 0.6 per cent. Capacity utilisation is reported to have risen to 84.2 per cent, the highest figures since 1983. This compares with 84 per cent in October and a revised 83.7 per cent in September. Yesterday's figures generally confirmed what the markets already knew about the economy: that progress in cutting the trade deficit is now very slow indeed and that manufacturing industry continues to produce at a healthy rate and is running at very high capacity levels. The economic releases did not give much strength to arguments either for or against a US discount rate rise and it was the dollar's weakness yesterday which prompted falls in stocks and bonds.

627,133.0,1988-12-15,"The UK government bond market put a positive initial interpretation on yesterday's announcement by the Bank of England that it would hold an experimental reverse auction in January, when it would undertake to buy back a maximum of 500 m pounds sterling of gilt-edged bonds from the short end of the yield curve. The two outstanding issues in question are 2.4 bn pounds sterling worth of 10 per cent Exchequer and 2 bn pounds sterling of 11 per cent Exchequer, both due 1989. The auction would be January 13, for settlement three days later. Corporate tax payments usually peak around this time, draining cash from the market. The Bank has been using repurchase facilities to inject the additional liquidity required; the reverse auction is effectively a repo without the buyback. There is not much precedent for central banking techniques of buying back government stock, a necessity forced on the Old Lady by the UK budget surplus. But market makers initially welcomed the experiment as a cleaner method of operating. Previously, the dealers had simply rung the Bank with offers of stock, and no one quite understood on what basis the issues were bought or refused. Now the bidding will be more in the open, although the Bank reserves the right to buy nothing if the market's pricing is too aggressive. Clearly the Bank of England sees a structural surplus continuing for a while. Participants interpreted this positively in terms of continuing artificially high support for prices. The implications for their job security in a shrinking market were another matter. Previously, the market had assumed the Bank would buy in stock primarily at the long end, but the move yesterday suggested purchases might be more evenly spread. Immediately afterwards, the short stocks through to about six-year maturities rose about 1/2 point on the news, whereas the long end was up 9/32 point or so, quickly falling back some 5/32. Thus the yield curve, which is steeply negative, flattened a little. After much consideration, the verdict was that the Bank's move was simply a technical adjustment. Yesterday was generally a bouncy day. Sterling weakness depressed morning prices, as the currency dipped below DM 3.18 by lunchtime. Gilts were then buffeted by a choppy US market, first cheered by predictable October trade numbers but quickly upset by higher capacity utilisation data which portends continuing strength in the US economy. A fall in UK industrial output was one of the few positive influences on the market, but not enough to prevent the benchmark 2002-2007 bond closing a full point down. * * * European talk was again of higher interest rates, as both the Dutch and Belgian central banks raised rates. German government bonds rose 15 basis points before yesterday's repurchase agreement, and up to a further 5 or 10 points afterwards, on the news that the Bundesbank had set rates between 5 and 5.5 per cent, in contrast with levels between 4.70 and 4.95 on the expiring facility. Although the amount of the repo was unexpected, the liquidity was necessary to meet cash needs for tax demands. There was little reaction by German bunds to US trade number. They finished the day roughly 15 basis points ahead. * * * Mr David Lange, New Zealand's Prime Minister who let slip in another context that he took no notice of markets, chose, probably unintentionally, the day the New Zealand Futures Exchange was closed to announce the sacking of Mr Roger Douglas, the Finance Minister. Markets fell sharply on the news that Mr Douglas's long-running dispute with Mr Lange had ended in dismissal, but sadly the automated, screen-based NZFE was shut because of a power workers' strike. Traders were thus unable to adjust their government bond book via futures, as the 5-year benchmark fell about their ears, and yields rose to 14.70 per cent from 14.14 before the news. The NZ dollar dropped 3 cents. * * * There were no surprises in yesterday's batch of US economic data which were in line with expectations and left Treasury bonds drifting lower in dull trading. By the close, short-dated maturities were quoted around 1/16 point lower, medium-date issues were up to 1/8 point lower and long-dated issues slumped by as much as 3/4 point.

",Government Bonds: Bank Auction Plan Cheers Dealers,1988-12-14,The Financial Times
628,134.0,2006-06-30,"The Federal Reserve fuelled a rally in the markets yesterday after it issued an unexpectedly nuanced statement to accompany the 17th successive rise in interest rates to 5.25 per cent. While the Fed hardened its previous language on inflation, and signalled a bias to tighten further in the future, it fell short of suggesting a cast iron commitment to raise rates again at the next policy meeting on August 8. The S&P 500 index, which was already up 0.7 per cent before the Fed issued its statement, jumped nearly 1.5 per cent on the news. Bond prices also rose, while the dollar tumbled more than a cent against the euro as investors reconsidered the interest rate outlook. Futures traders, meanwhile, priced in a reduced probability of an August rate rise - still about 70 per cent, but down from about 90 per cent the day before. Fed officials will probably be happy with that result, as it reduces the risk that they will be boxed in by market expectations as to what their next policy move will be. ""Flexibility seems very important to the Federal Open Market Committee now, suggesting we may be close to the peak in rates,"" said Tony Dolphin, director of economics at Henderson Global Investors. The statement has two main components, a renewed emphasis on inflation and inflation risks, partly offset by a confident assertion that the slowdown in growth, which the Fed desires in order to ease inflation pressure, is taking place. The Fed said ""economic growth is moderating"" - a shift from May, when it said only that growth was ""likely to moderate"". But it toughened up its description of inflation, stating that ""readings on core inflation have been elevated in recent months"" and that high levels of capacity utilisation and energy prices ""have the potential to sustain inflation pressures"". As if to underline that the Fed is paying close attention to inflation, the statement mentioned the word six times, compared with four times in its previous statement. The most significant change came towards the end of the statement, where the Fed junked the phrase ""some further policy firming may yet be needed to address inflation risks"". It replaced this with a new sentence that said: ""Although moderation in the growth of aggregate demand should help to limit inflation pressures overtime, the committee judges that some inflation risks remain."" The Fed said the ""extent and timing of any additional firming that may be needed to address these risks"" would depend on the way current data revises its forecast for ""both inflation and economic growth"". The mention of growth alongside inflation was taken by investors to signal that the Fed would be careful not to overtighten and kill economic growth in response to short term inflation data. The statement appeared to reflect the preference of Ben Bernanke, the chairman, for more natural language, greater emphasis on the forecasts.

629,135.0,2006-06-30,"The dollar continued to fall on Friday, adding to the sharp losses of the previous session prompted by expectations that US interest rates will soon be held in check after two years of steady increases. The Federal Reserve lifted the main refinancing rate by 25 basis points to 5.25 per cent on Thursday, a widely expected move and the 17th consecutive increase. But the central bank was less hawkish on inflation than many in the currencies market had anticipated, sending the dollar, which had stood near a two-month high against the euro, to a three-week low. Inflation remained a concern, the Federal Open Market Committee said, putting more emphasis on moderating growth conditions. ""The dollar will lose its interest-rate support and cyclical growth support here,"" said analysts at BNP Paribas. Standing at $1.2529 ahead of the FOMC statement, the euro spiked 1 per cent against the dollar to $1.2658 within minutes. The euro resumed its rise into Asian trade, and by mid-morning in London was up to $1.2711. The pound got an additional boost from an upward revision to first-quarter UK growth. Year-on-year gross domestic product growth in the quarter was revised modestly up to 2.3 per cent. ""The upward revisions to GDP growth since 2001 will increase the Bank of England's concern about the amount of spare capacity in the UK economy, which was highlighted as one of the main upside risks to inflation in the June Monetary Policy Committee minutes,"" said Howard Archer at Global Insight. He added: ""This increases the odds of an interest rate hike before the end of the year, although the MPC currently seems in no hurry to act and we believe that it will wait until 2007."" Sterling also spiked 1 per cent within minutes of the FOMC announcement and continued its rally against the dollar to $1.8329, up 0.3 per cent on the session.

Bond prices also rose, with 10-year yields falling 4 basis points to 5.21 per cent, while the dollar tumbled, losing more than a cent against the euro. Asian bourses leapt on Friday morning led by exporters, on the prospect that a possible end to US rate rises may boost its demand for Asian products. Japan's Nikkei stock average rose 2 per cent in morning trading, led by carmakers such as Nissan, which soared 5.6 per cent. South Korean shares rose 2.35 per cent to four-week high, while India's BSE jumped 3.4 per cent by early morning. The Fed statement was a jolt to market expectations, but did not obviously represent a major shift in thinking inside the Fed.

632,138.0,2007-08-08,"It is not Ben Bernanke's job to make money for anyone. The chairman of the Federal Reserve's remit is to limit inflation while safeguarding full employment - not to bail out traders who made a bad bet.  But there is still money to be made on the back of Bernanke's statements. Someone made a packet out of yesterday's bulletin from the federal open market committee.  Look at the S&P 500 investment banks index, highly exposed to Fed policy. After opening lower, it gained 4.4 per cent by midday. Once the Fed had spoken, it dropped 3.8 per cent: and then, from there, it gained 3.1 per cent - huge gains if you picked your moments right, huge losses if you did not. This volatility owed more to positioning by traders than to the message Bernanke was attempting to send.  The salient points of that message were as follows. First, the Fed acknowledged that ""credit conditions have become tighter for some households,"" and that ""the housing correction is ongoing"". This raised the downside risks to growth ""somewhat"". So the Fed at least feels the market's pain.  But it insisted that inflation was the ""predominant"" risk - so the next move in the Fed Funds rate is more likely to be up than down. Some traders took heart from the former, others were disappointed by the latter, and many more took advantage. The end result, after some very lucrative noises, left the markets where they started.  That is where they should be.  Bernanke will only bail out the markets with a rate cut if he is convinced that the credit crunch is so severe as to threaten a recession. Should he decide to do so, his own research as an academic showed that he would have more effect if he took the market by surprise. So even if he thinks a ""rescue"" rate cut may be necessary, he had no incentive to say so now.  Rather, he will look for any sign of economic fallout from the credit crunch. And the markets will be doing the same.  ",THE SHORT VIEW - MARKET COMMENT.,2007-08-07,The Financial Times

Stocks were modestly higher before the Federal Open Market Committee concluded its policy meeting and, as expected, leftits overnight borrowingrate unchanged. Investors focused on the FOMC's policy statement, and the initial reaction was negative.  The FOMC maintained its focus on the risk posed by inflation and continued to forecast a moderate pace of expansion for the economy. In terms of the recent turmoil that has roiled markets, the FOMC said: ""Financial markets have been volatile in recent weeks, credit conditions have become tighter for some households and businesses, and the housing correction is ongoing.""  Scott Wren, senior equity strategist at AG Edwards said: ""This was a harsher statement than what the market was looking for. It leaves us with a couple of months of uncertainty and the Fed could have helped ease that with a sentence or two saying 'we stand ready to inject liquidity into the system'.""  At midafternoon, the S&P 500 index was 0.2 per cent lower at 1,465.43, off a high of 1,476.60 earlier in the day. The Nasdaq Composite was down 0.4 per cent at 2,537.31, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average was 0.3 per cent lower at 13,424.47  Equity volatility, as measured by the Chicago Board Options Exchange's Vix index, pared much of its early losses after the Fed meeting. At midafternoon, the Vix was 0.2 per cent lower at 22.89, up from a low of 21.97. The Vix hit a peak of 26.47 on Monday, its highest reading since April 2003.  TJ Marta, strategist at RBC Capital Markets, said: ""The statement supports our view that, in the next six to eight weeks, we will know whether the 'wheels are going to come off', either from a financial crisis or a greater than expected economic slowdown due to tightening financial conditions, or (if) the financial markets and economy are going to successfully weather the current storm.""  Among the main S&P industry groups, the financials sector was in the spotlight.After the FOMC meeting, the sector was down 0.3 per cent, and had reversed a 1.3 per cent gain.

634,140.0,2007-08-08,"What in the markets can we rely upon? It was hard, ahead of yesterday's announcement from the Federal Reserve's federal open market committee, to discern patterns in the extreme volatility of the past weeks. But one or two trends were clear.  First, markets have lost faith in small-cap stocks. That is a logical response to more expensive credit. Small stocks are more likely to be bought out by private equity - justifying a premium while debt was cheap - and have debt on their balance sheet.  The Russell 2000 index of smaller US stocks has endured a true ""correction"", down more than 10 per cent from its recent high, even after Monday's rally.  Another long-term pattern that seems to be over is the dominance of ""value"" investing (buying stocks that are cheap compared to the underlying value of their assets) against ""growth"" investing (picking stocks with fast-growing earnings). It had grown difficult for bargain-hunters to find true ""value"" after a lengthy bull market, and investors are now attracted by the relative safety of stocks with strong earnings.  What has endured the mess of the past few weeks? First, faith in emerging markets remains almost undimmed. Normally in risk aversion, emerging markets would be expected to fall further than the market as a whole. They have budged but barely any more than the rest of the market. By Monday's close, MSCI's emerging markets index had fallen 7.5 per cent since July 19, when the MSCI world index peaked. The world index itself was down 6.1 per cent. For the year, emerging markets were up 16.5 per cent, against 4.8 per cent for the world index. Compared with other risky assets, faith in emerging markets remains robust.  Faith in human frailty also remains constant. Las Vegas Sands and Wynn Resorts have both gained more than 40 per cent in less than a month.  ",THE SHORT VIEW.,2007-08-07,The Financial Times
635,141.0,1997-03-26,"US shares slipped yesterday after the Federal Reserve's Open Market Committee moved to boost the federal funds rate by 25 basis points to 5 1/2%, writes Lisa Bransten in New York. By the close the Dow Jones Industrial Average was off 29.08 at 6,876.17 and the more broadly traded Standard &Poor's 500 had fallen 1.82 at 789.07. Volume on the NYSE came to 485m shares. Most Wall Street economists had expected the rate increase and the market initially rallied after the news, with the Dow jumping more than 47 points before quickly reversing course. Economists were divided about whether the move was a one-off tightening or the first in a series of moves to slow the economy. In a statement the FOMC said the ""action was taken in light of persisting strength in demand, which is progressively increasing the risk of inflationary imbalances developing in the economy"". The interest rate increase weighed heavily on cyclical shares, which would be hit hardest by an economic slowdown. The Morgan Stanley index of cyclical shares shed 1.2%, while the counterpart index of consumer shares was just 0.4% weaker. Falling cyclical shares in the Dow included Aluminium Company of America (Alcoa) off $2 at $70, Du Pont dropping $2 3/8 at $111 7/8, and International Paper, which shed $7/8 at $42. Meanwhile, the Dow got some support from rising shares in consumer goods companies. Merck added $1 at $90 7/8, Philip Morris rose $2 5/8 to $118 1/2 and McDonald's was $1/8 stronger at $47 1/2. Technology shares, which have been falling for most of the month, held on to modest gains despite the rate increase. The Nasdaq composite, which is weighed toward technology shares, was 5.42 stronger at 1,248.06 and the Pacific Stock Exchange technology index was 0.4 stronger. Intel, the semiconductor giant that is the biggest issue on the Nasdaq, regained $2 5/8 at $133 1/4. Since February 4, the company has lost $34 1/8 or nearly 21% of its value as some investors took money out of the technology sector. TORONTO ended flat after a morning rally was cut short by the US Federal Reserve's decision to raise interest rates. The TSE-300 composite index fell just 0.49 or 0.01% to 6143.76. Declines outpaced advances 477 to 462 and trade of 87.8m shares worth C$1.60. Ten of the 14 stock groups rose. Metals dropped 1.83%, Falconbridge falling C$1.30 to C$30.45 and Alcan Aluminium sliding C$1.20 to C$48.80. Golds declined 0.92%, with Barrick Gold easing 50 cents to C$35.

636,142.0,1997-03-26,"The dollar remained steady following the decision to raise US rates by 25 basis points yesterday, and was trading almost unchanged from its London close immediately after the announcement by the US Federal Reserve. Ahead of the US Federal Open Market Committee policy making meeting, the dollar remained firm on technical activity. It closed up Y 1.1 against the yen in London at Y 123.9 and 0.3 pfennigs against the D-Mark at DM 1.691. Hedge funds sold the yen aggressively against the D-Mark, triggering yen selling against sterling. The D-Mark closed Y 0.56 against yen to Y 73.29 while the pound finished Y 2.7 higher at Y 200.6. The yen was also hit by a decline in Japanese short term interest rates. The Bank of Japan's accommodative stance in its daily money market operations reconfirmed expectations of low interest rates in the foreseeable future as did comments by a leading Japanese banker. Traders are concerned about extra volatility over the next few days due to the Easter holiday weekend and the end of the Japanese fiscal year. The increase in technical activity amid low trading volumes is likely to boost price volatility. ""Our primary concern is a liquidity problem,"" said Mr Michael Wallace, senior currency economist at MMS International, adding that the pound and the dollar which have gained on hopes of higher interest rates could see some profit taking. Nervousness that higher rates in the US could lead to rate increases in Europe affected Swiss short term rates. Short term deposit rates edged up to the 2% level on comments by German officials over a possible US interest rate increase earlier in the week. However, the Swiss central bank has expressed its resolve to counter factors which would hamper an economic recovery, and analysts expect the phenomenon to be temporary. * The Italian lira closed unchanged at L1001 after a volatile day. Comments by Mr Lamberto Dini, the Italian foreign minister, that he would have preferred to see the launch of European monetary union put back by a year pressured the lira, although he added that it was impossible for Italy to backtrack at this point. Reports that the IMF's draft forecasts for Italy's budget deficit came to four per cent of GDP in 1997 also added to the pessimism. An Italian financial daily said that the country needed extra budget deficit cutting measures worth L20,000bn this year if it wanted to reach the three per cent deficit to GDP ratio required to join Emu. Strategists said comments by politicians were unnerving investors. ""The clever course for Italy is to say nothing. The problem is that the more the politicians try to calm the markets, the more the markets are perturbed,"" said Mr Mark Fox, chief European strategist at Lehman Brothers in London. The government is expected to announce its mini-budget with up to L16,000bn in budget cutting measures later this week, and may choose to release it on Friday since its financial markets are scheduled to remain open. * Concerns over Emu and the Swedish government's budget weighed on the krona. A flurry of selling sent the currency lower against the D-Mark although the currency finally closed down SKr0.007 at SKr4.513. The Norwegian krone saw support from investment bank buying yesterday, rising NKr0.034 against the D-Mark to NKr3.946. While some analysts see the krone undervalued, there are worries of an overheating economy and the central bank's continued priority to focus on currency stability over inflation. Last week's first quarter inflation report highlighted the risk of rising price pressures due to a tightening labour market and higher capacity. The krone has appreciated by 5% since the start of the year on the back of its strong economic growth. However, there are some fears of an inflationary boom and a subsequent bust if the central bank does not increase its rates, said Mr Paul Meggyesi, senior currency economist at Deutsche Morgan Grenfell.

637,143.0,1997-03-26,"London's equity market looked to have come to terms with the prospect of a rise in US rates after the FOMC meeting held in Washington yesterday. After six consecutive sessions of losses, the FTSE 100 index yesterday rallied strongly, largely on the back of thebig rally on Wall Street. On Monday the Dow Jones Industrial Average picked up a confidence-restoring 100 points, and it built on that performance at the outset of trading on Wall Street yesterday when the Dow pushed up a further 26 points in quick time. The FTSE 100 index, which had fallen over 200 points during the previous six sessions recouped 55.9 or 1.3% to end the day at 4,270.7. Demand for the leaders spilled over into the second liners, where the FTSE 250 put on a more sedate performance, finishing a net 15.8 ahead at 4,552.7. But the market's smaller stocks were overlooked with the FTSE SmallCap index showing a 0.4 decline at 2,311.7. There was no news on the Fed during London market hours; a decision on rates was expected shortly after 7pm London time. Dealers said a rise of 25 basis points in US interest rates was fully priced into global markets and that Wall Street would probably consolidate its gains if that was the extent of the policy change. Some warned, however, that a no change policy or a 50 basis points increase would be unwelcome and could trigger another setback on US markets. But the overall feeling in London was that Mr Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, had done an expert job in softening up markets to expect a rate rise. ""He's warned of irrational exuberance, overheated asset prices and pre-emptive strikes,"" said one trader. Gilts gave a measure of support to the equity market, climbing in a range of 6 to 11 ticks in front of today's auction of #2.5bn-worth of 10-year stock. The big recovery in UK stock prices was evident from the start of trading when marketmakers, who added to the market's weakness on Monday by unloading all their remaining long positions ahead of the FOMC meeting, had to cope with buyers chasing UK shares after the Dow's rise. They hoisted their opening levels, hoping to head off any big buying orders, but encountered a flurry of buyers adopting the view that a correction had run its course in the short term. Demand for good quality stocks continued throughout the morning and carried on into the afternoon when the Dow's early strength gave London a second wind, driving the FTSE up more than 50 points. There were hints, however, that the big marketmakers were becoming increasingly reluctant to make aggressive prices in large sizes because of the extreme volatility in stock markets. Turnover remained at relatively high levels, reaching 975m by 6pm, well ahead of Monday's 805.9m. Customer business on Monday was valued at #3bn. Copyright Financial Times Limited 1997.

FRANKFURT saw the dollar clear the DM 1.69 mark, the German domestic bond market gain from better than expected consumer price data, and a further rise in US share prices by the American mid-morning. The Dax index responded with a rise of 72.36 or 2.2% to an Ibis-indicated 3,374.93, turnover rising from DM 9.7bn to DM 12.4bn. The response to corporate news was mixed. In steels, Thyssen dived DM 35.50 or 8.7% to DM 375 after Krupp Hoesch called off its reverse takeover bid. This setback, however, followed a gain of more than 50% this year. Krupp, relatively strong against the market but on a less hair-raising trajectory than its target, fell DM 8 or 2.4% to DM 329. On the brighter side, BMW reported higher profits, aimed for higher productivity and profits this year and said that it wanted to raise its return on sales from 3.2% to 7% in the longer term. The carmaker's shares rose DM 61 or 5.1% to DM 1.253. In pharmaceuticals, meanwhile, Merck climbed DM 2.35 or 3.6% to DM 68.35 after the company reported that its 1996 profits surged 36%, and said that the current business year had started well. PARIS pitched in with a gain of 1.7%, the CAC 40 index closing 44.97 higher at 2,624.25 and turnover rising from FFr 4.8bn to FFr 6.7bn. There was another twist in the Suez/Lyonnaise des Eaux merger speculation after the newspaper, Le Monde, suggested that Lyonnaise would be the bidder. Suez recovered FFr 3.70 or 1.3% to FFr 281 but Lyonnaise fell FFr 2 to FFr 572. Sanofi rose FFr 19 or 3.6% to FFr 542; it signed an agreement to sell sophisticated blood sample test equipment to Beckman Instruments of the US. Essilor, the lens maker, talked about cutting its debt and rose FFr 30 to FFr 1,530. Higher profits came from CIC, the banking group, which rose FFr 13.50 to FFr 368.50; and from Damart, the mail order thermal underwear group, which was the biggest riser of the day with a gain of FFr 385 or 8.7% to FFr 4,825. ZURICH looked for support to Wall Street and the rising dollar and, by the close, the SMI index stood 61.3 or 1.4% higher at 4,558.6. Novartis, SwFr 46 higher at SF1,760, was the day's winner among the pharmaceuticals on switching out of Roche. The latter's certificates gave up SwFr 80 to SwFr 12,170 as the market digested details of its 1996 profits, which were released after the market closed on Monday. Banks put in a positive performance with UBS up SwFr 19 at SwFr 1,282 and SBC SwFr 7.50 higher at SwFr 301.50. Credit Suisse rose SwFr 6.50 to SwFr 173. Insurers were mixed, with Zurich Insurance up SwFr 9.50 to SwFr 448 and Swiss Re SwFr 29 ahead at SwFr 1,492, both making up for ground lost recently.

MILAN moved ahead on renewed strong demand for the telecoms sector, traditionally a target for foreign investors, and the Comit index registered a rise of 5.54 to 735.87. Stet, the telecoms holding company, jumped L270 to L7,475 and Telecom Italia was L155 ahead at L4,265; on Monday, the treasury fixed 3% as the maximum stake that any one investor could take in the company after the Stet-TI merger and privatisation. TI was also supported after Salomon Brothers confirmed its buy recommendation on the stock. Tim, the mobile telephone operator, was also in demand, rising L157 to L4,747.

Heineken rose Fl 12.20 to Fl 334, boosted by Lehman Brothers' decision to put the brewer on its European recommended list; but Polygram fell Fl 2.10 to Fl 92.80 although two films from the entertainment group collected three awards at Monday's Oscar ceremonies in Los Angeles. MADRID brokers said that most buying was technicallybased, and influenced by adjustment of positions at the end of the March quarter as the general index rose 7.34 or 1.6% to 5,438.76. Telefonica rose Pta70 at Pta3,450, helped partly by unconfirmed reports of a tariff adjustment; Repsol rose Pta100 to Pta5,900 in the run up to the privatisation of the government's last 10% stake in the oil company after Easter. COPENHAGEN celebrated a 68% rise in pre-tax profits, well above analysts' expectations, from the cement and engineering group, FLS Industries.

640,146.0,1997-03-26,"US shares showed modest losses yesterday after the Federal Reserve's Open Market Committee moved to boost the federal funds rate by 25 basis points to 5 1/2%, writes Lisa Bransten in New York. At 3pm, 45 minutes after the announcement was made, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was off 21.90 at 6,883.35 and the more broadly traded Standard &Poor's 500 had added 1.17 at 789.72. Volume on the NYSE came to 394m shares. Most Wall Street economists had expected the rate increase and the market initially rallied after the news, with the Dow jumpingmore than 47 points before quickly reversing course. Shares fell as the text of the Fed's statement was released. That statement - which referred to ""persisting strength in demand, which is progressively increasing the risk of inflationary imbalances developing in the economy"" - was interpreted by some as a sign that there was more monetary tightening to come. The interest rate increase weighed heavily on cyclical shares, which would be hit hardest by an economic slowdown. The Morgan Stanley index of cyclical shares shed more than 1%, while the counterpart index of consumer shares was just 0.2% weaker. Falling cyclical shares in the Dow included Aluminum Company of America (Alcoa) off $2 at $70, Du Pont dropping $1 3/4 at $112 1/2, and International Paper, which shed $1 1/2 at $41 3/8. Meanwhile, the Dow got some support from rising shares in consumer goods companies. Merck added $1 1/4 at $91 1/8, Philip Morris rose $3 5/8 to $119 1/2 and McDonald's was $1/8 stronger at $47 1/2. Technology shares, which have been falling for most of the month, held on to modest gains despite the rate increase. The Nasdaq composite, which is weighed toward technology shares, was 3.87 stronger at 1,246.51 and the Pacific Stock Exchange technology index was 0.6 stronger. Intel, the semiconductor giant that is the biggest issue on the Nasdaq, regained $3 1/2 at $134 1/8. Since February 4, the company has lost $34 1/8 or nearly 21% of its value as some investors took money out of the technology sector. TORONTO was firm at midday, following through from Monday's rally, but trade was thin and cautious as investors waited for news from the FOMC, and with most already discounting a quarter point increase in interest rates. The TSE-300 composite index rose 21.93 to 6,166.18 in trade of 33.2m shares worth C$586m. Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce rose 45 cents to C$34.25 following news that each CIBC dividend capital receipt and secondary warrant would be split on a two for one basis. The potential merger involving Avenor, Repap Enterprises and Domtar continued to attract attention. Avenor lost 60 cents to C$23.40 while Repap rose 16 cents to C$2.35 and Domtar was flat at C$11.45.

641,147.0,1997-03-26,"Footsie derivatives shook off Monday's gloom as dealers in both futures and traded options came to terms with the prospect of a rise in US interest rates, writes Joel Kibazo. Dealers appeared to settle for a US rate rise of 25 basis points following the FOMC meeting held yesterday. ""A rise any higher than that will see us going back down,"" said one. Traders instead turned their attention to the overnight gains on Wall Street. The higher than expected opening trade in the June futures contract on the FTSE 100 was an indication of the trend that lay ahead. It started at a firm 4,264. But for a brief retreat to 4,260 in the first hour, June moved steadily ahead for the rest of the session. There was a brief pause in the contract ahead of the opening of New York, but a firm start to trading in that market triggered a further bout of buying of June in London. It closed at 4,293, up 55 on its previous session and at a 23 point premium to the underlying cash market. Continued demand in after-hours trading saw June break through the 4,300 barrier to settle at 4,301. Volume in the sector was 11,825 contracts. Increased activity in traded options brought higher turnover. Volume was 55,448 lots against 42,765 dealt on Monday. BG was the busiest stock option with a total of 4,173 trades.

642,148.0,1997-03-26,"London's equity market looked to have come to terms with the prospect of a rise in US rates after the FOMC meeting held in Washington yesterday. After six consecutive sessions of losses, the FTSE 100 index yesterday rallied strongly, largely on the back of thebig rally on Wall Street. On Monday the Dow Jones Industrial Average picked up a confidence-restoring 100 points, and it built on that performance at the outset of trading on Wall Street yesterday when the Dow pushed up a further 26 points in quick time. The FTSE 100 index, which had fallen over 200 points during the previous six sessions recouped 55.9 or 1.3% to end the day at 4,270.7. Demand for the leaders spilled over into the second liners, where the FTSE 250 put on a more sedate performance, finishing a net 15.8 ahead at 4,552.7. But the market's smaller stocks were overlooked with the FTSE SmallCap index showing a 0.4 decline at 2,311.7. There was no news on the Fed during London market hours; a decision on rates was expected shortly after 7pm London time. Dealers said a rise of 25 basis points in US interest rates was fully priced into global markets and that Wall Street would probably consolidate its gains if that was the extent of the policy change. Some warned, however, that a no change policy or a 50 basis points increase would be unwelcome and could trigger another setback on US markets. But the overall feeling in London was that Mr Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, had done an expert job in softening up markets to expect a rate rise. ""He's warned of irrational exuberance, overheated asset prices and pre-emptive strikes,"" said one trader. Gilts gave a measure of support to the equity market, climbing in a range of 6 to 11 ticks in front of today's auction of #2.5bn-worth of 10-year stock. The big recovery in UK stock prices was evident from the start of trading when marketmakers, who added to the market's weakness on Monday by unloading all their remaining long positions ahead of the FOMC meeting, had to cope with buyers chasing UK shares after the Dow's rise. They hoisted their opening levels, hoping to head off any big buying orders, but encountered a flurry of buyers adopting the view that a correction had run its course in the short term. Demand for good quality stocks continued throughout the morning and carried on into the afternoon when the Dow's early strength gave London a second wind, driving the FTSE up more than 50 points. There were hints, however, that the big marketmakers were becoming increasingly reluctant to make aggressive prices in large sizes because of the extreme volatility in stock markets. Turnover remained at relatively high levels, reaching 975m by 6pm, well ahead of Monday's 805.9m. Customer business on Monday was valued at #3bn. Copyright Financial Times Limited 1997.

643,149.0,1997-03-26,"With the FOMC decision on US interest rates expected after European hours, bourses decided that they had discounted a 25 basis point increase and did their best to match the Dow's overnight gain of 100 points or 1.5%. FRANKFURT saw the dollar clear the DM 1.69 mark, the German domestic bond market gain from better than expected consumer price data, and a further rise in US share prices by the American mid-morning. The Dax index responded with a rise of 72.36 or 2.2% to an Ibis-indicated 3,374.93, turnover rising from DM 9.7bn to DM 12.4bn. The response to corporate news was mixed. In steels, Thyssen dived DM 35.50 or 8.7% to DM 375 after Krupp Hoesch called off its reverse takeover bid. This setback, however, followed a gain of more than 50% this year. Krupp, relatively strong against the market but on a less hair-raising trajectory than its target, fell DM 8 or 2.4% to DM 329. On the brighter side, BMW reported higher profits, aimed for higher productivity and profits this year and said that it wanted to raise its return on sales from 3.2% to 7% in the longer term. The carmaker's shares rose DM 61 or 5.1% to DM 1.253. In pharmaceuticals, meanwhile, Merck climbed DM 2.35 or 3.6% to DM 68.35 after the company reported that its 1996 profits surged 36%, and said that the current business year had started well. PARIS pitched in with a gain of 1.7%, the CAC 40 index closing 44.97 higher at 2,624.25 and turnover rising from FFr 4.8bn to FFr 6.7bn. There was another twist in the Suez/Lyonnaise des Eaux merger speculation after the newspaper, Le Monde, suggested that Lyonnaise would be the bidder. Suez recovered FFr 3.70 or 1.3% to FFr 281 but Lyonnaise fell FFr 2 to FFr 572. Sanofi rose FFr 19 or 3.6% to FFr 542; it signed an agreement to sell sophisticated blood sample test equipment to Beckman Instruments of the US. Essilor, the lens maker, talked about cutting its debt and rose FFr 30 to FFr 1,530. Higher profits came from CIC, the banking group, which rose FFr 13.50 to FFr 368.50; and from Damart, the mail order thermal underwear group, which was the biggest riser of the day with a gain of FFr 385 or 8.7% to FFr 4,825. ZURICH looked for support to Wall Street and the rising dollar and, by the close, the SMI index stood 61.3 or 1.4% higher at 4,558.6. Novartis, SwFr 46 higher at SF1,760, was the day's winner among the pharmaceuticals on switching out of Roche. The latter's certificates gave up SwFr 80 to SwFr 12,170 as the market digested details of its 1996 profits, which were released after the market closed on Monday. Banks put in a positive performance with UBS up SwFr 19 at SwFr 1,282 and SBC SwFr 7.50 higher at SwFr 301.50. Credit Suisse rose SwFr 6.50 to SwFr 173. Insurers were mixed, with Zurich Insurance up SwFr 9.50 to SwFr 448 and Swiss Re SwFr 29 ahead at SwFr 1,492, both making up for ground lost recently. Winterthur edged SwFr 2 lower to SwFr 987 on profit-taking. Nestle was up SwFr 6 to SwFr 1,577; CS First Boston expected the food group to announce earnings growth today of 9.1% to SwFr 81.20 a share for 1996. Among the smaller issues, Surveillance and Richemont underperformed, losing SwFr 80 and SwFr 15 to SwFr 2,950 and SwFr 1,925 respectively. MILAN moved ahead on renewed strong demand for the telecoms sector, traditionally a target for foreign investors, and the Comit index registered a rise of 5.54 to 735.87. Stet, the telecoms holding company, jumped L270 to L7,475 and Telecom Italia was L155 ahead at L4,265; on Monday, the treasury fixed 3% as the maximum stake that any one investor could take in the company after the Stet-TI merger and privatisation. TI was also supported after Salomon Brothers confirmed its buy recommendation on the stock. Tim, the mobile telephone operator, was also in demand, rising L157 to L4,747. AMSTERDAM recouped Monday's losses, the AEX index closing 12.62 higher at 727.84; financials, similarly, recovered from weakness a day before with Fortis Amev up Fl 2.60 or 3.8% at Fl 71.50 after Monday's Fl 2.70 decline. Heineken rose Fl 12.20 to Fl 334, boosted by Lehman Brothers' decision to put the brewer on its European recommended list; but Polygram fell Fl 2.10 to Fl 92.80 although two films from the entertainment group collected three awards at Monday's Oscar ceremonies in Los Angeles. MADRID brokers said that most buying was technicallybased, and influenced by adjustment of positions at the end of the March quarter as the general index rose 7.34 or 1.6% to 5,438.76. Telefonica rose Pta70 at Pta3,450, helped partly by unconfirmed reports of a tariff adjustment; Repsol rose Pta100 to Pta5,900 in the run up to the privatisation of the government's last 10% stake in the oil company after Easter. COPENHAGEN celebrated a 68% rise in pre-tax profits, well above analysts' expectations, from the cement and engineering group, FLS Industries. FLS closed DKr25 higher at DKr845 as the KFX index rose 0.46 to 153.30. ISTANBUL took a 4.5% dive following last week's 10.3% surge, blaming political tensions between the military and the Islamist government wings of the Turkish establishment and a rise in bond yields from last week's 106.77% to 114.71% following the latest auction. The IMKB National-100 index tumbled 74 to 1,577 but turnover plunged to TL26,150bn from Monday's TL40,730bn.

648,154.0,1997-03-26,"The dollar remained steady following the decision to raise US rates by 25 basis points yesterday, and was trading almost unchanged from its London close immediately after the announcement by the US Federal Reserve. Ahead of the US Federal Open Market Committee policy making meeting, the dollar remained firm on technical activity. It closed up Y 1.1 against the yen in London at Y 123.9 and 0.3 pfennigs against the D-Mark at DM 1.691. Hedge funds sold the yen aggressively against the D-Mark, triggering yen selling against sterling. The D-Mark closed Y 0.56 against yen to Y 73.29 while the pound finished Y 2.7 higher at Y 200.6. The yen was also hit by a decline in Japanese short term interest rates. The Bank of Japan's accommodative stance in its daily money market operations reconfirmed expectations of low interest rates in the foreseeable future as did comments by a leading Japanese banker. Traders are concerned about extra volatility over the next few days due to the Easter holiday weekend and the end of the Japanese fiscal year. The increase in technical activity amid low trading volumes is likely to boost price volatility. ""Our primary concern is a liquidity problem,"" said Mr Michael Wallace, senior currency economist at MMS International, adding that the pound and the dollar which have gained on hopes of higher interest rates could see some profit taking. Nervousness that higher rates in the US could lead to rate increases in Europe affected Swiss short term rates. Short term deposit rates edged up to the 2% level on comments by German officials over a possible US interest rate increase earlier in the week. However, the Swiss central bank has expressed its resolve to counter factors which would hamper an economic recovery, and analysts expect the phenomenon to be temporary. * The Italian lira closed unchanged at L1001 after a volatile day. Comments by Mr Lamberto Dini, the Italian foreign minister, that he would have preferred to see the launch of European monetary union put back by a year pressured the lira, although he added that it was impossible for Italy to backtrack at this point. Reports that the IMF's draft forecasts for Italy's budget deficit came to four per cent of GDP in 1997 also added to the pessimism. An Italian financial daily said that the country needed extra budget deficit cutting measures worth L20,000bn this year if it wanted to reach the three per cent deficit to GDP ratio required to join Emu. Strategists said comments by politicians were unnerving investors. ""The clever course for Italy is to say nothing. The problem is that the more the politicians try to calm the markets, the more the markets are perturbed,"" said Mr Mark Fox, chief European strategist at Lehman Brothers in London. The government is expected to announce its mini-budget with up to L16,000bn in budget cutting measures later this week, and may choose to release it on Friday since its financial markets are scheduled to remain open. * Concerns over Emu and the Swedish government's budget weighed on the krona. A flurry of selling sent the currency lower against the D-Mark although the currency finally closed down SKr0.007 at SKr4.513. The Norwegian krone saw support from investment bank buying yesterday, rising NKr0.034 against the D-Mark to NKr3.946. While some analysts see the krone undervalued, there are worries of an overheating economy and the central bank's continued priority to focus on currency stability over inflation. Last week's first quarter inflation report highlighted the risk of rising price pressures due to a tightening labour market and higher capacity. The krone has appreciated by 5% since the start of the year on the back of its strong economic growth. However, there are some fears of an inflationary boom and a subsequent bust if the central bank does not increase its rates, said Mr Paul Meggyesi, senior currency economist at Deutsche Morgan Grenfell.

649,155.0,1997-02-06,"The lira firmed yesterday despite new evidence that Italy might be excluded from the first round of European monetary union. A report in the Financial Times said that European officials were planning to offer Italy a delayed entry in 2000 or 2001, after Emu's planned start in 1999. The lira fell from L984 to L992.5 against the D-Mark when the report broke, but the currency recovered on Bank of Italy buying and the market's gradual perception that a guaranteed if belated entry into Emu could be good news for the lira. The currency closed the day in London L1.7 higher against the D-Mark at L985.1. The peseta and the Portuguese escudo also rose slightly, despite fears that Spain and Portugal might likewise be excluded from the first round of Emu. At one point the Bank of Spain was seen intervening in the market, buying pesetas. The pound soared again, helped by overnight Japanese buying. It broke the key psychologial Y 200 barrier against the yen to close Y 3.6 higher at a 52-month peak of Y 201.3. Japanese purchases of gilts were prompted partly by Mr Robin Cook, the UK Labour Party's foreign affairs spokesman, who had previously suggested that a Labour government might well join the second round of Emu. The yen also suffered on the market's increasing belief that the Group of Seven industrialised nations, which meets in Berlin on Saturday, would not try to weaken the dollar. The pound also rose against the dollar and D-Mark. It gained 1.4 cents against the dollar to $1.632 and 3.4 pfennigs against the D-Mark to DM 2.691. Sterling, which plunged last week, has now recovered 6.7 pfennigs against the German currency since Monday. The D-Mark fell despite the news that Emu might start without some of Europe's traditionally weaker currencies, thus pointing to a stronger future single European currency. The D-Mark was hit by weak German industrial orders for December. The dollar rose further against the D-Mark and the yen, climbing 0.7 pfennigs to DM 1.649 and Y 1.1 to Y 123.3. * Yesterday's events have clarified what currency markets expect of Italy and monetary union. Mr Jim O'Neill, chief currency economist at Goldman Sachs in London, said: ""Everybody already knew Italy was not going to be in the first round of Emu."" Therefore, strong evidence that it would indeed be excluded hardly hit the lira. In other words, the bond and currency markets have not been pricing in that Italy will join Emu in 1999. They have merely been betting that Italy will receive a public guarantee saying it will enter in the second wave. So when the Financial Times reported that that is precisely what would happen, the lira rose to slightly higher than it had stood before. Mr O'Neill said: ""If there is really a deal to guarantee that Italy can go in at any stage, it actually makes the Italian interest rate market very attractive."" In short, the only news that would send the lira tumbling is if no such guarantee of membership were given. * Mr O'Neill also said yesterday that Saturday's G7 meeting was unlikely to stall the dollar's rise.

Mr Luca Jellinek, bond strategist at Paribas in London, said: ""Italian bonds made good gains on the back of strong domestic buying. 1999 was never a realistic target date for Italy's entrance to Emu, so the reports on its delayed but guaranteed entry could be taken as a positive development."" Mr David Brown, chief economist at Bear Stearns in London, said: ""The market's reaction was a little bit surprising. Italy is not off the hook at all. If Germany fails to give Italy less than resounding support at the summit between Mr Romano Prodi [prime minister of Italy] and Chancellor Helmut Kohl on Friday, then BTPs could take a dive."" Traders said that the resolution of Italy's long-running metal-workers' wages dispute on Tuesday, and the slowing in the annual rate of growth of Italy's consumer price index to 2.6% - the lowest since 1969 - had fuelled expectations of further interest rate cuts by the central bank. The recovery of the lira on the foreign exchange markets, where it had dropped to L990 against the D-Mark in the morning but rose to L985 in the late afternoon, directly tracked the BTP rally. March futures on 10-year BTPs closed 0.83 higher at 130.55 on Liffe, while in the cash market the yield spread of BTPs over German bunds tightened to 155 basis points. Spanish bonos also recovered, in spite of yesterday's report by a government minister that Spain's public debt had risen by 4 percentage points in 1996 to 69.3% of GDP. Spanish 10-year bono futures rose by 0.23 to close at 113.39 in Barcelona. In the cash market, bonos' 10-year yield spread over bunds widened slightly to 109 basis points.

651,157.0,1997-02-06,"The lira firmed yesterday despite new evidence that Italy might be excluded from the first round of European monetary union. A report in the Financial Times said that European officials were planning to offer Italy a delayed entry in 2000 or 2001, after Emu's planned start in 1999. The lira fell from L984 to L992.5 against the D-Mark when the report broke, but the currency recovered on Bank of Italy buying and the market's gradual perception that a guaranteed if belated entry into Emu could be good news for the lira. The currency closed the day in London L1.7 higher against the D-Mark at L985.1. The peseta and the Portuguese escudo also rose slightly, despite fears that Spain and Portugal might likewise be excluded from the first round of Emu. At one point the Bank of Spain was seen intervening in the market, buying pesetas. The pound soared again, helped by overnight Japanese buying. It broke the key psychologial Y 200 barrier against the yen to close Y 3.6 higher at a 52-month peak of Y 201.3. Japanese purchases of gilts were prompted partly by Mr Robin Cook, the UK Labour Party's foreign affairs spokesman, who had previously suggested that a Labour government might well join the second round of Emu. The yen also suffered on the market's increasing belief that the Group of Seven industrialised nations, which meets in Berlin on Saturday, would not try to weaken the dollar. The pound also rose against the dollar and D-Mark. It gained 1.4 cents against the dollar to $1.632 and 3.4 pfennigs against the D-Mark to DM 2.691. Sterling, which plunged last week, has now recovered 6.7 pfennigs against the German currency since Monday. The D-Mark fell despite the news that Emu might start without some of Europe's traditionally weaker currencies, thus pointing to a stronger future single European currency. The D-Mark was hit by weak German industrial orders for December. The dollar rose further against the D-Mark and the yen, climbing 0.7 pfennigs to DM 1.649 and Y 1.1 to Y 123.3. * Yesterday's events have clarified what currency markets expect of Italy and monetary union. Mr Jim O'Neill, chief currency economist at Goldman Sachs in London, said: ""Everybody already knew Italy was not going to be in the first round of Emu."" Therefore, strong evidence that it would indeed be excluded hardly hit the lira. In other words, the bond and currency markets have not been pricing in that Italy will join Emu in 1999. They have merely been betting that Italy will receive a public guarantee saying it will enter in the second wave. So when the Financial Times reported that that is precisely what would happen, the lira rose to slightly higher than it had stood before. Mr O'Neill said: ""If there is really a deal to guarantee that Italy can go in at any stage, it actually makes the Italian interest rate market very attractive."" In short, the only news that would send the lira tumbling is if no such guarantee of membership were given. * Mr O'Neill also said yesterday that Saturday's G7 meeting was unlikely to stall the dollar's rise. ""There's a growing view from a lot of market insiders that there's not going to be any communique from the G7, and that's a green light to sell the yen."" He said the Japanese currency could drop to Y 220 against the pound.

653,159.0,2000-03-22,"LITTLE SIGN OF SLOWDOWN AS QUARTER POINT RISE TAKES KEY LENDING FIGURE TO 6%. The Federal Reserve redoubled its efforts to slow the pace of US economic growth yesterday with another quarter point increase in short-term interest rates. The central bank's open market committee raised its key lending rate to 6 per cent, and hinted there was more to come. It was the fifth time in nine months the fed funds target rate had been raised. The Fed's board also raised its largely symbolic discount rate by the same amount to 5.5 per cent. ""Against the background of long-run goals of price stability and sustainable economic growth ... the committee believes the risks are weighted toward conditions that may generate heightened inflation pressures in the foreseeable future,"" the FOMC said. It remained concerned that increases in demand would ""continue to exceed the growth in potential supply, which could foster inflationary imbalances that would undermine the economy's record economic expansion"". The latest increase sends short-term rates to their highest level since the spring of 1991, when the Fed began aggressively cutting them to stimulate recovery from the last recession. Financial markets had been expecting the increase and were largely unmoved. Since last June, the Fed has raised short-term rates by 1.25 percentage points, but has so far failed to damp the economy's fires. Gross domestic product grew at an annual rate of 6.9 per cent in the last three months of 1999, and early data for the first quarter of this year suggest that, while growth is slowing somewhat, the pace remains well above 4 per cent. This is still in excess of what Alan Greenspan, the Fed chairman, and his colleagues regard as a safe rate. Most economists expect another half point increase in rates, probably in two instalments beginning with the next FOMC meeting on May 16. What happens next will depend on whether the economy shows clear signs of a slowdown. Interest rate changes tend to work with relatively long time lags of up to a year, and there are now indications that the higher rates may be starting to bite into some sectors of the economy such as the housing market. Higher oil prices are also expected to damp demand. And in spite of a surge in prices of technology stocks over the past year, broader financial market indices are little changed on a year ago. Fed officials have said they are not targeting stock prices - but they believe increased equity market wealth has fed directly into faster rates of consumer spending growth. If there are no clear signs of a broader-based slowdown soon, the Fed may feel it needs to take more aggressive action, perhaps raising rates by more than the incremental, quarter-points it has made so far. Behind the Fed's gradual approach is uncertainty about the performance of the so-called ""new economy"". Most economists agree that technological and other changes have improved the economy's long-run performance, enabling it to grow faster without prompting inflation. But no-one can say what the new rate of sustainable growth is. Lex, Page 32 European technology stocks slide The slide in European technology stocks captured some high-profile victims yesterday, as recent internet debutants fell below their offer prices.

654,160.0,2000-03-22,"From Dr Richard Hadfield. Sir, I am always intrigued by the notion that some companies are immune to interest rate levels. No companies are so fortunate. It is suggested that the FOMC, the US Federal Reserve's interest rate setting committee, will force the ""old economy"" into recession before technology stocks will be affected (""American business feels the squeeze"", March 21). I would argue that the first companies to feel recession will be those currently relying on private equity funding rather than those already borrowing money. There will be a rate level at which investors will rather receive guaranteed income than vague promises of future earnings and at that point the new equity process will dry up. The old economy's interest expense will have increased monotonically with the interest rate whilst the new economy's interest expense will be more step-function in nature, from zero to actual. At that point, the old economy may be straining but the new economy will suffer worse as it suddenly has to borrow money from lenders wanting interest payments, not stock options.

655,161.0,2000-03-22,"The Federal Reserve should consider raising margin requirements, instead of interest rates, to remedy its concerns about share valuations, urged economists and lawmakers yesterday at a congressional hearing. The testimony before a House of Representatives banking subcommittee pointedly questioned why the Fed's concerns for skyrocketing technology shares could not be better handled by curbing the flow of borrowed money into the market. The testimony echoed a rising Wall Street concern that the Fed's use of interest rates to cool the stock market could do more harm than good in the long run. In the meantime, the Fed's policymaking Federal Open Market Committee raised its key interest rate yesterday for the fifth time in nine months to 6 per cent. The Fed has not changed the margin requirement, currently 50 per cent, since 1974. Stocks bought on margin, or with borrowed money, rose 8.9 per cent in February and 6.5 per cent in January. Overall, margin debt has reached $265bn, and risen by $83bn since last October. Since it appears that the Fed's goal is to temper the stock market to ease consumer spending fostered by the wealth effect, panellists testified a rise in margin requirements might be a more precise instrument. ""Why not use a scalpel instead of a sledgehammer,"" said Charles Schumer, a US senator from New York, who hoped a study by the Fed and the Securities and Exchange Commission could help crystallise the issue with its release in a month. Alan Greenspan, Fed chairman, has argued there is no direct correlation between margin changes and share prices. Others argue that margin increases hurt smaller investors, who are an increasing user of borrowed money to finance investments. Many market observers have credited the Nasdaq's recent rise to a surge in borrowing to buy stocks. Moreover, it raises concerns that a sudden drop in the market could prompt investors to sell shares to cover margin calls, which could potentially send the market reeling.

656,162.0,1993-07-08,"A WELL-RECEIVED bond auction in Germany provided an impetus for bund investors yesterday. The DM 4.25bn auction of bonds issued by Treuhand, the state agency responsible for privatising companies in the former east Germany, resulted in an accepted bid price of 99.49 and a yield of 6.7%. There was no official statement of the demand but dealers said it was well-covered with considerable domestic interest. Traders said investors were selling bund futures to buy the Treuhand bonds, which form part of a DM 10bn issue announced on Tuesday. The sale was the main factor in a generally quiet day with no signals coming from the repo rate announcement - the variable rate was left unchanged at 7.3% - and little indication that the Bundesbank intended to cut rates when it next meets on July 15. However, economists hope to glean some information from the next money supply growth figures, due at that central bank meeting. The last M3 figure of 6.7% was above the central bank's target range and if next week's figure is within the range there is a greater chance of a further monetary easing at the final council meeting before the summer break on July 29. Futures selling to buy the Treuhand bond saw the bund contract for September lose earlier gains and close only 2 basis points higher at 95.39. THE UK government bond market ran out of steam yesterday as both sterling and gilts had been considered overbought. With no economic data on the horizon and the tap of 9% stock dated 2008 said to be finally exhausted, the gilts market drifted. Any support that it received was psychological and came from overseas. Gilt futures for September were down on the previous close but 1/8 up on the day. FRENCH government bonds held steady yesterday despite a growing belief that they have hit a short-term high and are ripe for profit-taking. Bond prices were helped by a slightly stronger franc, which recovered from recent weakness against the D-Mark. The yield spread between French and German 10-year government bonds remained very low, closing at 6 basis points, according to JP Morgan. On the Matif, September futures rose 0.18 to 119.78. JAPANESE debt prices were weaker in Tokyo as the Bank of Japan sought to pour cold water on increasingly heated rate cut rumours. Speculation has gathered pace that the central bank will cut its official discount rate, presently at 2 1/4%, by as much as 50 basis points. Although it is considered unlikely that the bank will ease before the general election on July 18, traders have been busily discounting any change. At its money market operations yesterday, the central bank provided far less supply than expected and forced short-term rates higher. The yield on the JGB No 145, which has been below 4.3% in the past few days, rose to 4.35% and when Japanese bond futures began trading in London, the September contract slipped 7 basis points to 109.13. Following comments from a Japanese government official that the pain threshold for Japanese exporters could be Y 95 to Y 105 against the dollar, the September contract recovered to close at 109.30. AFTER posting early gains on cheaper commodities, US Treasuries fell back as commodity prices retraced their steps. In late trading the benchmark 30-year government bond was down 1/32 at 105 11/32, yielding 6.679%. At the short end of the market, the two-year note was unchanged at 100 7/32, to yield 3.992%. After Tuesday's steep rise in the Commodity Research Bureau index had deflated Treasury prices, yesterday morning's retreat in the index prompted some buying among market participants, mostly the professional dealers. Treasuries fell back from their early gains, however, when the CRB index began to recover. Otherwise, attention was focused on the Federal Reserve's Open Market Committee, which was meeting to discuss monetary policy. Although the rise in the CRB index raised some fears that the FOMC would keep its strategy tilted towards tightening monetary policy, most analysts believe it will vote to return the bias to neutral in the wake of weak employment data.

657,163.0,2002-08-14,"For now, at least, Alan Greenspan, the US Federal Reserve chairman, is content to stick to his guns. The Federal Open Market Committee maintained its 1 3/4 per cent target for the federal funds rate, although it has become considerably more cautious about US economic prospects since it last met in June. Then it described monetary policy as ""accommodative"" and said that on the ""information currently available"", the risks to price stability and sustainable economic growth were ""balanced"". Now it admits that the weakness in aggregate demand has been ""prolonged"" and the ""the risks are weighted mainly toward conditions that may generate economic weakness"". The Fed's stance is somewhat strange. On the information now available, the economy is considerably weaker than was thought at the time of the last FOMC meeting and ominous clouds have appeared on the horizon. In June, the Fed thought economic activity was increasing at a healthy pace but we now know that growth slowed sharply in the second quarter. The economy grew at an annualised rate of just 1.1 per cent. To this, the Fed must add the weakness of equity markets since July, which will severely weaken household balance sheets, and the prospects of a rebound in corporate investment. On their own, these two changes are enough to render the Fed's forecast of 3 1/2 per cent to 3 3/4 per cent economic growth in 2002 all but impossible to achieve. Prospects for 2003 have also dimmed. Consistency would suggest that as the facts have changed, so should interest rates. Instead, the Fed's reluctance to do more than change its assessment of economic prospects suggests it feared really spooking financial markets. It is an unfortunate irony that the Fed recently published and promoted an internal working paper on the lessons from Japan's experience in the 1990s. The paper convincingly concluded that as Japan's economy turned down from 1990 onward and as interest rates and inflation approached zero, both monetary and fiscal policy should have responded with greater vigour than usual. Although US monetary policy responded with much greater speed to the first signs of recession last year than did the Bank of Japan in the early 1990s, it seems that the Fed's willingness to learn those lessons is waning. The risks to US economic prospects are uneven. While a double-dip recession is a distinct possibility and could start a vicious circle of consumer retrenchment, declining confidence and further output cuts, the risks associated with somewhat higher inflation are minimal. The Fed missed a trick yesterday. It should reconsider when the FOMC meets again on September 24. London Edition 1. ",LEADER - Fed's misplaced caution.,2002-08-13,The Financial Times
658,164.0,2002-08-14,"It was another difficult session in London's equity market until the final hour of trading, when a strong rally on Wall Street prompted a similar trend in UK stocks and left all the main indices in good heart at the close. The UK's benchmark index, the FTSE 100, ended a session of surprisingly brisk activity a net 50.1 higher at 4,271.7, having been down 59.1 at 4,162.5 an hour before the US market opened for the day. Before the late rally, sentiment in London had taken another knock ahead of the outcome of last night's meeting of the US Federal Reserve's open market committee and after some disappointing domestic economic news. Fears that the committee would leave US interest rates on hold, while shifting to an easing bias because of a weakening US economy and a deteriorating earnings outlook, triggered further pockets of profit-taking among many of the FTSE 100's constituents for much of the session. There was little enthusiasm in markets, either, after some as-expected news on US retail sales. The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost more than 80 points early in the US session, before rallying to show a 56-point gain before London traders closed their dealing books. Adding to the market's initial problems was a handful of bearish stories in the utilities sector, normally one of the most defensive areas in underperforming markets. The performances from second and third-tier stocks, even when the leaders were being punished, gave market bulls cause for optimism. The FTSE 250 index was never under that much pressure, in spite of disturbing falls in British Energy and Waste Recycling. The midcap index ended 21.6 firmer at 4,723.1. The FTSE SmallCap, meanwhile, was always in positive territory and finished the day with a 5.9 gain at 2,008.4. The bearish domestic economic news came with the July retail price index data, which came in higher than the market had expected. The core figure was up 2 per cent, year-on-year, compared with a consensus forecast of 1.8 per cent. Jonathan Loynes, chief UK economist at Capital Economics, said: ""While the numbers are clearly a little disappointing, they are certainly not a disaster. ""After holding at about 2 per cent next month, RPIX should fall back for the rest of this year and next."" The global economics team at ING Financial Markets said: ""There is little likelihood of a move in UK rates any time soon."" Rather surprisingly, given the potential for shocks from the FOMC after the market closed, turnover in the equities market picked up strongly to reach 2.4bn shares, boosted by programme trading and exceptionally heavy business in Vodafone.

659,165.0,2002-08-14,"Washington, August 14, 2002 I, George W. Bush, being the chief executive officer of the United States government, do hereby certify that the account I have given of my government's financial performance in the recent reporting period is an accurate and fair picture of our operations. In accordance with new rules that take effect today, I fully understand that this certification carries with it personal legal liability. Accordingly, it has been necessary for me, in the course of reviewing previous accounts of my government's financial performance, to make a number of material restatements of earlier operating estimates, forecasts and accounting policies and guidelines. To wit: o 1 - My senior officials and I stated last year that our budget proposals, notably a $1,700bn (GBP1,080bn) 10-year tax cut, were prudent and would ensure fiscal stability over the medium term. We said the US would, even after the tax cut, still record a surplus of almost $4,000bn over the next 10 years. Furthermore, we insisted that, in line with best accounting practice, we had no plans to spend the surplus in the Social Security Trust fund, the country's pension fund. It now seems, regrettably, that the surpluses we confidently projected a year ago have disappeared faster than documents at an Arthur Andersen shredding party. About four-fifths of the 10-year surplus has gone. And we can only get to any kind of surplus at all if we make fanciful assumptions about spending (how does an increase of 1.5 per cent per year sound?) and taxes (no renewal of tax breaks that will terminate by law in the next few years). Further, there is no way now to pay for the tax cut without raiding the pension fund. If we didn't use the pension money, we would be looking at a 10-year deficit of about $2,000bn, which is about the same size as the tax cut. But after consultation with our auditors (Karl Rove LLP), we have decided we have no obligation to take any action to rectify these problems, which, despite our commitment to personal responsibility and integrity, we blame entirely on others. We suggest any questions about the resolution of these accounting issues be directed to Thomas A. Daschle, US Senate. o 2 - I claimed repeatedly this year that I said during my campaign for chief executive in 2000 that I would accept a fiscal deficit only in the case of war, recession or a national emergency; and, lucky me, I got all three. It now appears that there is no evidence to support the claim that I said any such thing. o 3 - I said, as recently as Tuesday of this week, at the President's Economic Forum in Waco, Texas, that the US economy was on a firm footing. It now appears that more authoritative and independent assessments of our trading conditions (cf Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, statement of the Federal Open Market Committee, the same day) actually suggest the economy is weakening and could be in a hole. o 4 - My chief financial officer, Paul H. O'Neill (who is available to answer all questions on this certification) said on September 17 last year that the stock market would recover its losses and soon be establishing new records. It now appears that, with the Standard and Poor's index of 500 stocks currently 38 per cent below its peak, and investors having lost $1,700bn on their wealth, his comments may have been about as helpful to our investors as Jack Grubman's ""Buy"" recommendations for WorldCom stock. o 5 - Last year and earlier this year Mr O'Neill made various statements to the effect that the ""plumbers and carpenters of America"" would not pour their money into suspect Latin American governments so that it could be siphoned straight off into ""Swiss bank accounts"". It now appears that the decisions to support international lending of $8bn to Argentina, $30bn to Brazil, and a direct US loan to Uruguay were a prudent use of taxpayers' money, and a wise investment. We reject any notion that there could be a ""moral hazard"" risk in our advancing such large loans and we stand ready to provide similar support wherever it is needed. o 6 - Richard B. Cheney, the chairman of the board (who has declined to make himself available for this certification), stated in a speech in San Francisco last week: ""We are glad that Congress came together to pass the president's corporate integrity proposals."" On closer examination, we understand that the bill passed by Congress last month was in fact, the bill drawn up by a political opponent, one Paul S. Sarbanes of Maryland, that I offered no support for this bill whatsoever until it was clear it was going to pass with no opposition, and to say it was ""my bill"" is about as reliable a statement as Kenneth Lay's assurance last autumn that Enron had sound long-term prospects. o 7 - On a number of occasions, I may have misled investors in the United States and overseas about the basis on which my government would conduct international trade policy, in particular when I said last year (passim) that free trade was in ""America's best interests"". Following my imposition of tariffs on world steel and Canadian lumber, I now wish to restate the basis on which US trade policy will be conducted. It is to be conducted on a simple calculation of what is most likely to get me re-elected in electorally tight steel-and wood-producing states in the north east and north west. o 8 - On a number of occasions I may have misled investors in the United States and overseas about my government's approach to subsidies and public spending. I said I would not support large increases in spending, especially to subsidise inefficient operations. Following my decision to support a $150bn package of support for farmers, I now wish to restate the basis on which fiscal policy will be conducted. It will be conducted on a simple calculation of what is most likely to get me re-elected in electorally tight farm states in the mid-west and the south. I believe that these restatements faithfully reflect the condition of my government. Wheretofore I place my seal, this 14th day of August 2002. George W.

660,166.0,2008-06-26,"GLOBAL OVERVIEW Other central banks tighten policies Investors heartened by falling oil price There was volatile trading in US Treasury bonds, equities and the dollar yesterday after the Federal Reserve expressed concern about inflation and kept investors guessing about rate rises later this year. As expected the Fed kept its overnight rate steady at 2 per cent, and brought to an end a series of rate cuts that started last September. Richard Fisher, president of the Dallas Fed dissented and sought a rate increase. The Fed's policy statement policy makers read in part: ""Although downside risks to growth remain, they appear to have diminished somewhat, and the upside risks to inflation and inflation expectations have increased."" Stephen Stanley, chief economist at RBS Greenwich Capital said: ""The Federal Open Market Committee chose to talk about how conditions have changed but not about their leanings. What the committee was unwilling to say for a second straight meeting is which set of risks predominates."" The Fed, also noted that ""labour markets have softened further and financial markets remain under considerable stress."" Given falling house prices and higher energy costs, investors believe the Fed faces a difficult job balancing its twin objectives of sustaining economic growth and containing inflation. William Strazzullo, market strategist at Bell Curve Trading, said: ""In the end it comes down to growth for the Fed, rather than inflation. I find it hard to believe the Fed will tighten when the unemployment rate is rising."" Other central bankers were also in the spotlight yesterday as Jean-Claude Trichet, the president of the European Central Bank, clarified his recent remarks about a rate hike when the ECB meets on July 3. ""I said we could decide to move our rates by a small amount in our next meeting in order to secure the solid anchoring of inflation expectations,"" Mr Trichet said. Norway's central bank raised its key interest rate by 25 basis points to 5.75 per cent in response to higher inflation and confounded the view of some economists who had expected no change. That came after India tightened policy on Tuesday to counter inflation, running above 11 per cent. US government bond prices weakened in a knee-jerk fashion after traders heard from the Fed and then rebounded sharply. The yield on the two-year note topped out at 3 per cent and then plunged down to 2.81 per cent as traders trimmed the chances of a rate hike in August. The market is pricing in a funds rate just above 2.50 per cent by the end of the year. The yield on the 10-year note was steady around 4.11 per cent after a brief spike to 4.18 per cent in post-Fed trade. Bond yields in the UK fell, led by a 8bp drop in the two-year gilt to 5.21 per cent. UK retail sales were negative in June according to the Confederation of British Industry. European bond yields rose after Mr Trichet's remarks. European and US equity markets rallied as oil prices slumped earlier yesterday. The FTSE Eurofirst 300 index closed up 1.1 per cent, while in London the FTSE 100 rallied 0.6 per cent. The S&P 500 index closed up 0.6 per cent in New York, and pared a 1.6 per cent gain after the Fed news. US corporate credit spreads moved wider. Asian equity markets were mixed, with export companies lower after weak US data on Tuesday. Japan's Nikkei 225 index fell 0.1 per cent, while in an abbreviated session, Hong Kong rose 0.8 per cent. Taiwan fell 0.2 per cent and Korea rallied 0.4 per cent. Shanghai rose 3.6 per cent and closed higher for the second day in a row. India's Sensex closed 0.8 per cent higher after rebounding from an early slide of 1.9 per cent. Pakistan's Karachi Stock Exchange 100 index rose a further 2.5 per cent, extending Tuesday's 8.6 per cent gain. In currency trading , action and words from central banks dictated moves. The dollar slipped after the Fed meeting as the euro was boosted by the ECB's tougher talk on rates. Norway's krone gained against both the euro and dollar and India's rupee hit a three-week high versus the dollar. Trading was also volatile in crude oil prices . US oil inventories rose for the first time in six weeks. At one stage, oil fell more than $5 a barrel, before it pared some of its losses to settle at $134.55.",Volatile trading after Fed leaves rates at 2%,2008-06-25,The Financial Times
661,167.0,1997-05-21,"Wall Street was cheered by yesterday's decision not to raise interest rates, writes Jane Martinson in New York. The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed not far from its all-time high with a 74.58 increase to 7,303.46. The market had initially reacted with enthusiasm before falling off. Most of the gains were then made in the last hour of trading. Mr David Shulman, chief strategist at Solomon Brothers, echoed other bullish commentators when he said: ""The Fed has given the green light to the stock market."" The decision by the Federal Reserve's Open Market Committee, announced yesterday afternoon, had a more positive impact on stock prices than on the bond market, which was relatively muted. The benchmark 30-year bond rose 5/16 to 96 9/16 although it had fallen during the afternoon on fears about a rates increase in July. Other analysts believed that the Fed should have raised rates to slow recent fast growth. Mr Byron Wein, US strategist at Morgan Stanley, said: ""The bond market is smarter than the stock market"". He said it was too soon to say what the long-term effect of the decision would be, although he predicted a difficult summer. Analysts had been more than usually divided over the possible outcome of the FOMC meeting, although the bond market appeared to have factored in no change. The enthusiastic response was widespread. The technology-driven Nasdaq composite index rose 22.64 or 1.7% to 1,363.88, while the broader based S&P 500 gained 8.39 to 841.66. Financial blue chips rallied strongly after the decision, having suffered from some uncertainty in morning trade. J.P. Morgan rose 2.7% to $105 1/4 while Travelers Group gained $1 7/8 or 3.4% to $57 7/8. IBM rose almost 3% or $4 3/4 to $173 1/2, helped by a positive broker's note. Ford, the motor giant, also benefited from rumours of an upbeat analysts presentation and the possibility of a share buy-back. It rose $1 or 2.8% to $37 3/8. Even Informix, the troubled database company which has lost almost half its share price value, rose 4% or $3/8 to $9 5/16 in the upbeat market. It had fallen sharply in recent weeks. However, C-Cube Microsystems lost 22% or $5 5/8 to $19 7/8 as the company warned of lower than expected second-quarter earnings. TORONTO closed higher after a late afternoon rally sparked by Wall Street. The 300 composite index rose 12.76 or 0.20% to 6,260.14. Declines slightly outpaced advances 482 to 475. Trading volume was 83.2m shares, down from Friday's total of 88.7m. Trading value rose to C$1.52bn from C$1.36bn. The golds sub-index weighed on the market, falling 0.34%.

662,168.0,1997-05-21,"The dollar tumbled further late yesterday after the Federal Reserve left US interest rates unchanged following its Open Market committee meeting. The dollar, which had already fallen sharply in overnight Asian trading, immediately dropped another Y 0.75 on news of the meeting to stand at Y 112.95 against the yen. That was Y 3.25 below its Monday London close. The Fed's announcement sent the dollar falling 1.3 pfennigs against the D-Mark to DM 1.6860, 2.1 pfennigs down on Monday's close. The yen had surged even before the FOMC meeting, on fresh signs that Japan might raise interest rates soon. The currency jumped to Y 112 against the dollar after Mr Koko Sato, a senior member of Japan's ruling Liberal Democratic party, said there was growing political support for a rise in interest rates. Low rate levels were ""negatively affecting pensioners and could also invite further fund outflow from the domestic financial market to high-yielding overseas assets."" A panel of LDP politicians is due to issue a report within days which will indicate that the low rate climate may also be distorting the financial system. The Bank of Japan's official discount rate has stood at a record trough of 0.5% since September 1995. The markets largely ignored an attempt by Mr Taku Yamasaki, chairman of the LDP's policy research council, to play down Mr Sato's remark. Mr Yamasaki said now was not the time to discuss the possibility of a rate rise. Also yesterday, the Japanese trade union confederation said it would soon formally ask the Bank of Japan for a rate rise because low interest rates were hurting pensioners and savers. The dollar came under further pressure after Mr Robert Rubin, US treasury secretary, repeated that Washington's policy towards the currency was unchanged but failed to reel off his usual mantra that the US supported a strong dollar. The yen has now gained almost Y 15 or 12% against the dollar in the last fortnight, on hopes of a Japanese rate rise and attempts by Tokyo officials to talk down the dollar. The same officials are now trying to support the US currency. Yesterday Mr Eisuke Sakakibara, the senior finance ministry official known as Mr Yen, said: ""The pace of the yen's strengthening is too rapid."" Japan would ""deal appropriately"" with excessive volatility. That boosted the dollar somewhat. The dollar's slide buoyed the Swiss franc, largely because many traders had funded dollar purchases by borrowing the Swiss currency at low interest rates. The Swissie rose from SwFr 1.428 to SwFr 1.406 against the dollar, and from SwFr 0.837 to SwFr 0.830 against the D-Mark in London. * Mr Ron Leven, currency strategist at J.P. Morgan in New York, believes the dollar may stop sliding sooner than many in the market think. The reason, he says, is that many Japanese investors are hedging rather than selling their overseas assets. For instance, rather than disposing of their US Treasuries and repatriating the income, they are selling dollars forward. That means that if they change their view on the yen, they can return to overseas markets simply by buying dollars forward for the same period. ""If the Japanese had left the US market completely, it would be much more difficult for them to come back in again,"" Mr Leven said. * Mr Paul Chertkow, head of global foreign exchange research at UBS in London, warned that the dollar could fall through support at Y 110 against the yen soon because the market no longer believed the US currency had much upside. The only way Japan could boost the dollar would be by changing policy, he said. Tokyo could hardly cut interest rates, so it would have to encourage Japanese life companies to increase their holdings of overseas assets again, and also to buy Japanese bonds in order to reduce their yields. If the dollar did bounce, many Japanese investors would quickly sell it in order to cut their losses on its recent slide, said Mr Chertkow. Not Available for Re-dissemination.

663,169.0,1997-05-21,"The US Treasury market greeted the Federal Reserve's decision not to change interest rates with enthusiasm yesterday. The benchmark 30-year bond rose 5/16 to 96 9/16, yielding 6.892%. Uncertainty about the longer-term outlook appeared to put pressure on prices after the immediate euphoria had worn off, however. Prices at the long end had fallen during the afternoon. Some strategist were surprised at the muted reaction in bond prices, which was much less bullish about the decision than the stock market. Volumes were also relatively low. Mr Kevin Logan, senior market economist at Kleinwort Dresdner Benson, said the reaction indicated that the Fed had not been expected to raise rates after a raft of economic data had pointed to slightly weaker growth rates. ""The people who place the bets appeared to expect no change, despite opinion among analysts being divided,"" he said. He predicted a continuation of market sensitivity in the run-up to the next meeting of the Federal Reserve's open market committee in six weeks time. ""I don't expect it to rally too far,"" he said. ""After this meeting people will start thinking about July."" Mr Bruce Steinberg, chief economist at Merrill Lynch, said the markets were likely to continue to ""have a bumpy ride"", reacting to each piece of economic data until the next Fed meeting. Yield curves steepened after the news. The two-year note rose 1/8 to 100 5/16 yielding 6.182% and the yield spread between the two-year and 30-year securities widened from about 65 basis points to 71 basis points. European government bond markets trod water yesterday waiting for the outcome of the Fed committee meeting. FRENCH OATs were the only leading European bonds to give any ground, settling at the day's low of 129.64, down 0.24 on Monday's close. Analysts said there was little to explain the drift downwards. ""There's been some profit-taking ahead of the FOMC. Some minor positions have been liquidated,"" said Mr Philip Tyson, European bond analyst at HSBC. ""Other than that, everyone was content to remain on the sidelines."" UK GILTS barely moved, in spite of a big turn-out for the auction of #1.5bn of 7% 2002 stock. Cover was 3.03 times and there was no yield tail. ""We expected a tail of a couple of basis points so we were pleasantly surprised,"" said Mr Edmund Nonis, gilts analyst at Nikko Securities. The auction was small, however, and Mr Nonis warned about reading too much into it. The June long gilt future settled at 113 15/32, up 1/32 on the day. In the cash market the 10-year yield spread of gilts over bunds tightened 3 basis points to 142 points. Preliminary May inflation data from five Italian cities was in line with expectations and elicited few reactions from ITALIAN BTPs. Having jumped to 131.02, the June BTP future settled at 103.89, up 0.12 on the day. The 10-year yield spread of BTPs over bunds tightened 4 basis points to 137 points. May inflation figures from a further six Italian cities are due today. Yesterday's figures suggested that Italian annual inflation would slow to 1.5% in May, down from 1.7% in April, analysts said. Traders in SPANISH BONOS were taken aback by a late rally which coincided with the sudden rise in Italian BTPs. ""I was a bit surprised ... maybe it was just one buyer,"" said Mr Jose Ramon Arechederra of ABN Amro in Madrid. Bonos eventually settled at 116.08, up 0.41 on the day. The 10-year yield spread of bonos over bunds touched a new low of 69 basis points before settling at 70 basis points. Not Available for Re-dissemination.

664,170.0,1997-05-21,"An already weak derivatives sector came under further pressure yesterday as concerns about US interest rates combined with a sharp fall in defence-related stocks to prompt a sell-off in stock index futures, writes Joel Kibazo. Hopes of a recovery after the June contract on the FTSE 100 opened for business at 4,654, faded when strong selling emerged within the first hour of the session. June, which just managed to touch 4,658, retreated sharply. An attempt to stabilise it around the 4,650 level proved fruitless. June continued to fall, breaking through the 4,620 resistance level over lunch, on its way to the day's low. That was reached after the poor opening on Wall Street when the contract fell to 4,601. Dealers said the decline of defence stocks had come as a surprise to a market already nervous about US interest rates ahead of the outcome of the FOMC meeting. One trader said: ""The buyers are still around but they are simply waiting their turn."" Some buying interest was seen towards the close as the contract recovered from the day's low. It closed at 4,610, down 47 on its previous close and at a 3 point premium to the underlying cash market. Dealers said the contract had traded at a discount to cash on several occasions during the course of the session. Volume was 12,514 contracts.

665,171.0,1997-05-21,"Interest rate uncertainty hit the dollar and equities in Europe ahead of yesterday's FOMC meeting; some late closing bourses, back from a long weekend, were also digesting the third fall in the Dow in three consecutive days; and the effect was compounded where there was bad corporate news. FRANKFURT, with bad news among blue chips and in the mid-cap sector of the market, put it all together and fell 1.5%, the Dax index closing 53.06 lower at an Ibis-indicated 3,516.20, in turnover down from DM 13.8bn to DM 11.2bn. Cyclicals, primarily carmakers and chemicals, were predisposed to fall on the dollar; but BASF led the big blue chips down on news of a billion-dollar lawsuit against Knoll, its US-based pharmaceuticals unit. It lost DM 2.60 or just under 4% at DM 63.25. Hoechst was right behind, down DM 2.50 at DM 64.85, and Volkswagen closed DM 32.50 lower at DM 1,115.50. However, there was worse in mid-caps where Gerresheimer, the glassmaking subsidiary of Viag, plummeted DM 9.90 or 27.6% to DM 26; the company forecast a fall in operating profits this year due to price pressures in container glass. A month ago, said Mr Stefan Muelheim at Dillon Read, Gerresheimer had attributed a slide in first quarter profits to one-off problems. Now, he said, earnings hopes of DM 2.80 to DM 3 a share, after last year's DM 2.35, would have to be written off, and the shares were a sell. PARIS swept lower with the CAC 40 index retreating 33.17 to 2,751.11 after touching a session low of 2,731.17. Volume was said to be average at 11.9m shares. US rate uncertainty and the soft start on Wall Street did most of the damage, but renewed election jitters, some downside pressure from ex-dividends and disquieting news from LVMH also hit sentiment. The luxury goods giant did its best to smooth over the failure of its newly acquired DFS operation to win two Hong Kong airport concessions, but the shares took little notice, sliding FFr 41 or 2.8% to FFr 1,447. Total paid more attention to the softening oil price than to an upgrade from Goldman Sachs which moved to ""market outperform"". The shares came off FFr 5 to FFr 553, as Elf Aquitaine dipped FFr 9 to FFr 592. Motors were out of favour. Renault fell FFr 3.10 or 2% to FFr 153.9 and Peugeot FFr 10 to FFr 646. Accor, the hotels leader, stood out against the selling pressure, adding FFr 11 at FFr 889. ZURICH was depressed by the dollar and the Dow, and a string of index heavyweights came under pressure as the SMI index dropped 76.5 or 1.5% to 5,081.0. Novartis bearers lost SwFr 46 at SwFr 1,973, Roche certificates SwFr 290 at SwFr 13,205 and Nestle registered SwFr 39 at SwFr 1,818. However, the real pain was in other well-known names: Julius Baer, the banking group, was cut from ""buy"" to ""hold"" by CS First Boston after recent out-performance and fell SwFr 59 to SwFr 1,971; and Schindler, the maker of lifts and escalators, dropped SwFr 127 or 6.6% to SwFr 1,788. Mr Matthew Windridge, head of research at Standard &Poors MarketScope, noted that Schindler was up 68% since its low last July, and 28% since S &P's own buy note on Schindler only three months ago, which took in a target price of SwFr 1,850. AMSTERDAM ended off 6.85 at 787.45 on the AEX index. A handful of stocks made upward progress, notably Nedlloyd ahead of today's results and ING following publication of its US listing prospectus. Nedlloyd rose 70 cents to Fl 48.80 and ING added 40 cents at Fl 80.10. But the broad market came under pressure. Aegon lost Fl 3 to Fl 140.70 and KLM, which puts out results today, fell 80 cents to Fl 58.20. Speculation that Unilever was poised to launch a major US takeover left the shares off Fl 7.50 at Fl 377.90. Among smaller capitalisation stocks, Baan slipped Fl 3.40 to Fl 108.80 in spite of a buy note from HSBC James Capel predicting sales growth this year of 63% for the software group. MILAN threw caution to the wind and opted for a modest upward movement on talk of a cut for interest rates, possibly today should May's preliminary CPI data prove positive. The Mibtel index hardened 8 to 12,435. Ambroveneto, winner in the race to link up with Cariplo, the big savings bank, fell L296 to L4,125 on worries about a capital increase to finance the deal. But there were steady gains elsewhere. BCI, which also bid for Cariplo, improved L29 to L3,585 and Edison gained L123 to L8,155. MADRID was the major exception to the day's downtrend, the general index closing 5.70 higher at 547.56, with turnover up from Pta40.51bn to Pta119.55bn on news that Morgan Stanley had upgraded Spain's weighting from 3% to 4.5% in its European model portfolio. Mr Richard Davidson, Morgan's European equity strategist, said he had been growing increasingly convinced that Spain would be in the first group of countries joining in European monetary union in 1999. Endesa, the broker's choice, rose Pta230 or 2.1% to Pta11,330. VIENNA registered a new all-time closing high, the ATX index coming in 19.05 or 1.5% better at 1,270.36. OMV, the oil and chemicals group, rose Sch98.20 or 6.8% to Sch1,535 on continued investment interest. ISTANBUL put on 1.2% ahead of an acrimonious censure vote in parliament against the Islamist-led coalition government, the IMKB National-100 index closing 18 higher at 1,510. ATHENS had been waiting a long time to set a new all-time high; and although it got there in early trading - with an intra-day peak of 1,695.03, its best since July, 1990 - the mere fact of it was taken as a signal for profit-taking.

667,173.0,1997-05-21,"Wall Street was instantly cheered by the decision not to raise interest rates yesterday, writes Jane Martinson in New York. The blue chip Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 35.44 to 7,264.32 just five minutes after the decision was announced at 2.15pm New York time. However, the initial enthusism was tempered soon after. Analyst said this was partly due to fears of a July increase. The gains echoed those in the bond market, which saw an instant marked turnaround in sentiment after a lacklustre morning. Enthusiasm for equities overturned weak morning trading, during which the Dow had fallen by as much as 65 points. Analysts had been more than usually divided over the possible outcome of the FOMC meeting. Amid the uncertainty, Mr Warren Epstein, director of trading at Rosenblatt &Co, had played down the impact of the long-awaited decision. After an initial sell-off, he said, any decision to raise rates ""might be seen as a positive"", especially if economic data continued to show strong growth. Early trading in other markets was mixed. Technology stocks staged a fightback, allowing the technology-driven Nasdaq composite index to outperform the blue chips after a period of weaker growth. It rose 6.29 to 1,347.53 while the broader based S &P 500 fell 3.83 to 829.44. Financial blue chips to suffer from the Dow's uncertainty included J.P. Morgan, which fell 1.5% or $1 1/2 to $101, and Travelers Group which lost $1 or 1.8%, to $54 3/4. IBM continued to confound the blue-chip trend and echo other computer groups after a positive broker's note. It rose $2 1/8 or 1.3% to $170 7/8. Intel, also benefiting from upbeat research, helped the Nasdaq increase with a gain of $3 5/8 or 2.4% to $158 3/8. Informix fell $1/32 to $8 29/32 in some of the most active trading on Nasdaq as the market continued to take a negative stance on the troubled database company. A rally sparked by takeover speculation last week had failed to prevent the shares losing half their value in the past month. C-Cube Microsystems lost $5 3/8 to $20 1/8 as the company warned of lower than expected second-quarter earnings. TORONTO tracked Wall Street from the opening with leading stocks moving lower across a broad front. At noon, the 300 composite index was off 26.08 at 6,221.30. Most industrial sectors eased. Worries about a rise for US interest rates cast a cloud over the banks while golds found little comfort in a stable, but still weak bullion price.

Volume had been relatively low as traders waited for the Fed to announce its decision. Mr Kevin Logan, senior market economist at Kleinwort Dresdner Benson, had said ""nobody wants to hold the risk on the day it could happen"". The difference in yield between the two-year and 30-year note had already been hovering around its lowest levels for the year so far at about 65 basis points. Mr Logan had said this spread could fall to about 60 basis points with the yield for the benchmark bond rising back above 7%. Traders had suggested selling by hedge funds which have taken advantage of the strong dollar against the Japanese yen to buy shorter notes was also behind some of yesterday's downward pressure. European government bond markets trod water yesterday waiting for the outcome of the Fed committee meeting. FRENCH OATs were the only leading European bonds to give any ground, settling at the day's low of 129.64, down 0.24 on Monday's close. Analysts said there was little to explain the drift downwards. ""There's been some profit-taking ahead of the FOMC. Some minor positions have been liquidated,"" said Mr Philip Tyson, European bond analyst at HSBC. ""Other than that, everyone was content to remain on the sidelines."" UK GILTS barely moved, in spite of a big turn-out for the auction of #1.5bn of 7% 2002 stock. Cover was 3.03 times and there was no yield tail. ""We expected a tail of a couple of basis points so we were pleasantly surprised,"" said Mr Edmund Nonis, gilts analyst at Nikko Securities. The auction was small, however, and Mr Nonis warned about reading too much into it. The June long gilt future settled at 113 15/32, up 1/32 on the day. In the cash market the 10-year yield spread of gilts over bunds tightened 3 basis points to 142 points. Preliminary May inflation data from five Italian cities was in line with expectations and elicited few reactions from ITALIAN BTPs. Having jumped to 131.02, the June BTP future settled at 103.89, up 0.12 on the day. The 10-year yield spread of BTPs over bunds tightened 4 basis points to 137 points. May inflation figures from a further six Italian cities are due today. Yesterday's figures suggested that Italian annual inflation would slow to 1.5% in May, down from 1.7% in April, analysts said. Traders in SPANISH BONOS were taken aback by a late rally which coincided with the sudden rise in Italian BTPs. ""I was a bit surprised ... maybe it was just one buyer,"" said Mr Jose Ramon Arechederra of ABN Amro in Madrid. Bonos eventually settled at 116.08, up 0.41 on the day.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed not far from its all-time high with a 74.58 increase to 7,303.46. The market had initially reacted with enthusiasm before falling off. Most of the gains were then made in the last hour of trading. Mr David Shulman, chief strategist at Solomon Brothers, echoed other bullish commentators when he said: ""The Fed has given the green light to the stock market."" The decision by the Federal Reserve's Open Market Committee, announced yesterday afternoon, had a more positive impact on stock prices than on the bond market, which was relatively muted. The benchmark 30-year bond rose 5/16 to 96 9/16 although it had fallen during the afternoon on fears about a rates increase in July. Other analysts believed that the Fed should have raised rates to slow recent fast growth. Mr Byron Wein, US strategist at Morgan Stanley, said: ""The bond market is smarter than the stock market"". He said it was too soon to say what the long-term effect of the decision would be, although he predicted a difficult summer. Analysts had been more than usually divided over the possible outcome of the FOMC meeting, although the bond market appeared to have factored in no change.<The enthusiastic response was widespread. The technology-driven Nasdaq composite index rose 22.64 or 1.7% to 1,363.88, while the broader based S&P 500 gained 8.39 to 841.66. Financial blue chips rallied strongly after the decision, having suffered from some uncertainty in morning trade. J.P. Morgan rose 2.7% to $105 1/4 while Travelers Group gained $1 7/8 or 3.4% to $57 7/8. IBM rose almost 3% or $4 3/4 to $173 1/2, helped by a positive broker's note. Ford, the motor giant, also benefited from rumours of an upbeat analysts presentation and the possibility of a share buy-back. It rose $1 or 2.8% to $37 3/8. Even Informix, the troubled database company which has lost almost half its share price value, rose 4% or $3/8 to $9 5/16 in the upbeat market. It had fallen sharply in recent weeks. However, C-Cube Microsystems lost 22% or $5 5/8 to $19 7/8 as the company warned of lower than expected second-quarter earnings.

670,176.0,1997-05-21,"The dollar tumbled further late yesterday after the Federal Reserve left US interest rates unchanged following its Open Market committee meeting. The dollar, which had already fallen sharply in overnight Asian trading, immediately dropped another Y 0.75 on news of the meeting to stand at Y 112.95 against the yen. That was Y 3.25 below its Monday London close. The Fed's announcement sent the dollar falling 1.3 pfennigs against the D-Mark to DM 1.6860, 2.1 pfennigs down on Monday's close. The yen had surged even before the FOMC meeting, on fresh signs that Japan might raise interest rates soon. The currency jumped to Y 112 against the dollar after Mr Koko Sato, a senior member of Japan's ruling Liberal Democratic party, said there was growing political support for a rise in interest rates. Low rate levels were ""negatively affecting pensioners and could also invite further fund outflow from the domestic financial market to high-yielding overseas assets."" A panel of LDP politicians is due to issue a report within days which will indicate that the low rate climate may also be distorting the financial system. The Bank of Japan's official discount rate has stood at a record trough of 0.5% since September 1995. The markets largely ignored an attempt by Mr Taku Yamasaki, chairman of the LDP's policy research council, to play down Mr Sato's remark. Mr Yamasaki said now was not the time to discuss the possibility of a rate rise. Also yesterday, the Japanese trade union confederation said it would soon formally ask the Bank of Japan for a rate rise because low interest rates were hurting pensioners and savers. The dollar came under further pressure after Mr Robert Rubin, US treasury secretary, repeated that Washington's policy towards the currency was unchanged but failed to reel off his usual mantra that the US supported a strong dollar. The yen has now gained almost Y 15 or 12% against the dollar in the last fortnight, on hopes of a Japanese rate rise and attempts by Tokyo officials to talk down the dollar. The same officials are now trying to support the US currency. Yesterday Mr Eisuke Sakakibara, the senior finance ministry official known as Mr Yen, said: ""The pace of the yen's strengthening is too rapid."" Japan would ""deal appropriately"" with excessive volatility. That boosted the dollar somewhat. The dollar's slide buoyed the Swiss franc, largely because many traders had funded dollar purchases by borrowing the Swiss currency at low interest rates. The Swissie rose from SwFr 1.428 to SwFr 1.406 against the dollar, and from SwFr 0.837 to SwFr 0.830 against the D-Mark in London. * Mr Ron Leven, currency strategist at J.P. Morgan in New York, believes the dollar may stop sliding sooner than many in the market think. The reason, he says, is that many Japanese investors are hedging rather than selling their overseas assets. For instance, rather than disposing of their US Treasuries and repatriating the income, they are selling dollars forward. That means that if they change their view on the yen, they can return to overseas markets simply by buying dollars forward for the same period. ""If the Japanese had left the US market completely, it would be much more difficult for them to come back in again,"" Mr Leven said. * Mr Paul Chertkow, head of global foreign exchange research at UBS in London, warned that the dollar could fall through support at Y 110 against the yen soon because the market no longer believed the US currency had much upside. The only way Japan could boost the dollar would be by changing policy, he said. Tokyo could hardly cut interest rates, so it would have to encourage Japanese life companies to increase their holdings of overseas assets again, and also to buy Japanese bonds in order to reduce their yields. If the dollar did bounce, many Japanese investors would quickly sell it in order to cut their losses on its recent slide, said Mr Chertkow. Not Available for Re-dissemination.

671,177.0,1997-05-21,"The US Treasury market greeted the Federal Reserve's decision not to change interest rates with enthusiasm yesterday. The benchmark 30-year bond rose 5/16 to 96 9/16, yielding 6.892%. Uncertainty about the longer-term outlook appeared to put pressure on prices after the immediate euphoria had worn off, however. Prices at the long end had fallen during the afternoon. Some strategist were surprised at the muted reaction in bond prices, which was much less bullish about the decision than the stock market. Volumes were also relatively low. Mr Kevin Logan, senior market economist at Kleinwort Dresdner Benson, said the reaction indicated that the Fed had not been expected to raise rates after a raft of economic data had pointed to slightly weaker growth rates. ""The people who place the bets appeared to expect no change, despite opinion among analysts being divided,"" he said. He predicted a continuation of market sensitivity in the run-up to the next meeting of the Federal Reserve's open market committee in six weeks time. ""I don't expect it to rally too far,"" he said. ""After this meeting people will start thinking about July."" Mr Bruce Steinberg, chief economist at Merrill Lynch, said the markets were likely to continue to ""have a bumpy ride"", reacting to each piece of economic data until the next Fed meeting. Yield curves steepened after the news. The two-year note rose 1/8 to 100 5/16 yielding 6.182% and the yield spread between the two-year and 30-year securities widened from about 65 basis points to 71 basis points.

672,178.0,1997-05-21,"An already weak derivatives sector came under further pressure yesterday as concerns about US interest rates combined with a sharp fall in defence-related stocks to prompt a sell-off in stock index futures, writes Joel Kibazo. Hopes of a recovery after the June contract on the FTSE 100 opened for business at 4,654, faded when strong selling emerged within the first hour of the session. June, which just managed to touch 4,658, retreated sharply. An attempt to stabilise it around the 4,650 level proved fruitless. June continued to fall, breaking through the 4,620 resistance level over lunch, on its way to the day's low. That was reached after the poor opening on Wall Street when the contract fell to 4,601. Dealers said the decline of defence stocks had come as a surprise to a market already nervous about US interest rates ahead of the outcome of the FOMC meeting. One trader said: ""The buyers are still around but they are simply waiting their turn."" Some buying interest was seen towards the close as the contract recovered from the day's low. It closed at 4,610, down 47 on its previous close and at a 3 point premium to the underlying cash market. Dealers said the contract had traded at a discount to cash on several occasions during the course of the session. Volume was 12,514 contracts.

673,179.0,1997-05-21,"Interest rate uncertainty hit the dollar and equities in Europe ahead of yesterday's FOMC meeting; some late closing bourses, back from a long weekend, were also digesting the third fall in the Dow in three consecutive days; and the effect was compounded where there was bad corporate news. FRANKFURT, with bad news among blue chips and in the mid-cap sector of the market, put it all together and fell 1.5%, the Dax index closing 53.06 lower at an Ibis-indicated 3,516.20, in turnover down from DM 13.8bn to DM 11.2bn. Cyclicals, primarily carmakers and chemicals, were predisposed to fall on the dollar; but BASF led the big blue chips down on news of a billion-dollar lawsuit against Knoll, its US-based pharmaceuticals unit. It lost DM 2.60 or just under 4% at DM 63.25. Hoechst was right behind, down DM 2.50 at DM 64.85, and Volkswagen closed DM 32.50 lower at DM 1,115.50. However, there was worse in mid-caps where Gerresheimer, the glassmaking subsidiary of Viag, plummeted DM 9.90 or 27.6% to DM 26; the company forecast a fall in operating profits this year due to price pressures in container glass. A month ago, said Mr Stefan Muelheim at Dillon Read, Gerresheimer had attributed a slide in first quarter profits to one-off problems. Now, he said, earnings hopes of DM 2.80 to DM 3 a share, after last year's DM 2.35, would have to be written off, and the shares were a sell. PARIS swept lower with the CAC 40 index retreating 33.17 to 2,751.11 after touching a session low of 2,731.17. Volume was said to be average at 11.9m shares. US rate uncertainty and the soft start on Wall Street did most of the damage, but renewed election jitters, some downside pressure from ex-dividends and disquieting news from LVMH also hit sentiment. The luxury goods giant did its best to smooth over the failure of its newly acquired DFS operation to win two Hong Kong airport concessions, but the shares took little notice, sliding FFr 41 or 2.8% to FFr 1,447. Total paid more attention to the softening oil price than to an upgrade from Goldman Sachs which moved to ""market outperform"". The shares came off FFr 5 to FFr 553, as Elf Aquitaine dipped FFr 9 to FFr 592. Motors were out of favour. Renault fell FFr 3.10 or 2% to FFr 153.9 and Peugeot FFr 10 to FFr 646. Accor, the hotels leader, stood out against the selling pressure, adding FFr 11 at FFr 889. ZURICH was depressed by the dollar and the Dow, and a string of index heavyweights came under pressure as the SMI index dropped 76.5 or 1.5% to 5,081.0. Novartis bearers lost SwFr 46 at SwFr 1,973, Roche certificates SwFr 290 at SwFr 13,205 and Nestle registered SwFr 39 at SwFr 1,818. However, the real pain was in other well-known names: Julius Baer, the banking group, was cut from ""buy"" to ""hold"" by CS First Boston after recent out-performance and fell SwFr 59 to SwFr 1,971; and Schindler, the maker of lifts and escalators, dropped SwFr 127 or 6.6% to SwFr 1,788. Mr Matthew Windridge, head of research at Standard &Poors MarketScope, noted that Schindler was up 68% since its low last July, and 28% since S &P's own buy note on Schindler only three months ago, which took in a target price of SwFr 1,850. AMSTERDAM ended off 6.85 at 787.45 on the AEX index. A handful of stocks made upward progress, notably Nedlloyd ahead of today's results and ING following publication of its US listing prospectus. Nedlloyd rose 70 cents to Fl 48.80 and ING added 40 cents at Fl 80.10. But the broad market came under pressure. Aegon lost Fl 3 to Fl 140.70 and KLM, which puts out results today, fell 80 cents to Fl 58.20. Speculation that Unilever was poised to launch a major US takeover left the shares off Fl 7.50 at Fl 377.90. Among smaller capitalisation stocks, Baan slipped Fl 3.40 to Fl 108.80 in spite of a buy note from HSBC James Capel predicting sales growth this year of 63% for the software group. MILAN threw caution to the wind and opted for a modest upward movement on talk of a cut for interest rates, possibly today should May's preliminary CPI data prove positive. The Mibtel index hardened 8 to 12,435. Ambroveneto, winner in the race to link up with Cariplo, the big savings bank, fell L296 to L4,125 on worries about a capital increase to finance the deal. But there were steady gains elsewhere. BCI, which also bid for Cariplo, improved L29 to L3,585 and Edison gained L123 to L8,155. MADRID was the major exception to the day's downtrend, the general index closing 5.70 higher at 547.56, with turnover up from Pta40.51bn to Pta119.55bn on news that Morgan Stanley had upgraded Spain's weighting from 3% to 4.5% in its European model portfolio. Mr Richard Davidson, Morgan's European equity strategist, said he had been growing increasingly convinced that Spain would be in the first group of countries joining in European monetary union in 1999. Endesa, the broker's choice, rose Pta230 or 2.1% to Pta11,330. VIENNA registered a new all-time closing high, the ATX index coming in 19.05 or 1.5% better at 1,270.36. OMV, the oil and chemicals group, rose Sch98.20 or 6.8% to Sch1,535 on continued investment interest. ISTANBUL put on 1.2% ahead of an acrimonious censure vote in parliament against the Islamist-led coalition government, the IMKB National-100 index closing 18 higher at 1,510. ATHENS had been waiting a long time to set a new all-time high; and although it got there in early trading - with an intra-day peak of 1,695.03, its best since July, 1990 - the mere fact of it was taken as a signal for profit-taking.

The blue chip Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 35.44 to 7,264.32 just five minutes after the decision was announced at 2.15pm New York time. However, the initial enthusism was tempered soon after. Analyst said this was partly due to fears of a July increase. The gains echoed those in the bond market, which saw an instant marked turnaround in sentiment after a lacklustre morning. Enthusiasm for equities overturned weak morning trading, during which the Dow had fallen by as much as 65 points. Analysts had been more than usually divided over the possible outcome of the FOMC meeting. Amid the uncertainty, Mr Warren Epstein, director of trading at Rosenblatt & Co, had played down the impact of the long-awaited decision. After an initial sell-off, he said, any decision to raise rates ""might be seen as a positive"", especially if economic data continued to show strong growth. Early trading in other markets was mixed. Technology stocks staged a fightback, allowing the technology-driven Nasdaq composite index to outperform the blue chips after a period of weaker growth. It rose 6.29 to 1,347.53 while the broader based S &P 500 fell 3.83 to 829.44. Financial blue chips to suffer from the Dow's uncertainty included J.P. Morgan, which fell 1.5% or $1 1/2 to $101, and Travelers Group which lost $1 or 1.8%, to $54 3/4. IBM continued to confound the blue-chip trend and echo other computer groups after a positive broker's note. It rose $2 1/8 or 1.3% to $170 7/8. Intel, also benefiting from upbeat research, helped the Nasdaq increase with a gain of $3 5/8 or 2.4% to $158 3/8. Informix fell $1/32 to $8 29/32 in some of the most active trading on Nasdaq as the market continued to take a negative stance on the troubled database company. A rally sparked by takeover speculation last week had failed to prevent the shares losing half their value in the past month. C-Cube Microsystems lost $5 3/8 to $20 1/8 as the company warned of lower than expected second-quarter earnings. TORONTO tracked Wall Street from the opening with leading stocks moving lower across a broad front. At noon, the 300 composite index was off 26.08 at 6,221.30. Most industrial sectors eased.

And tending to make the possibility of any progress by London stocks even more awkward was the latest raft of domestic economic data, all of which tended to surprise a market expecting evidence of a slowing of the UK economy. In the event, the news turned those expectations upside down. The latest monthly survey of UK house prices by the Nationwide revealed prices rose by 2.5 per cent in January, the biggest monthly gain since October 1994, while the UK purchasing managers' index of manufacturing for came in at 52.0, compared with last month's 51.3. And the Confederation of British Industry's January Survey of Distributive Trades said that retail sales were rising at their fastest rate since May last year. ""The market is telling us that 25 basis points will come off UK interest rates after next week's monetary policy committee meeting,"" said one trader. But Richard Jeffrey, economist at ING Barings Charterhouse Securities, said: ""When looking at the strength of recent UK data, particularly the CBI retail survey, you could be forgiven for asking the question whether rates should be going up rather than down."" Wall Street performed reasonably well, the Dow pushing up 43 points as London closed and the Nasdaq 14 points, in response to more worryingly weak US economic data. That showed the National Association of Purchasing Management's business activity index slipping to 41.2 from 44.3, its lowest level since March 1991. The market view, in the wake of those numbers, was that another reduction in US interest rates, possibly even before the next FOMC meeting, scheduled for March 20.

679,185.0,2001-02-01,"Foreign exchange traders gave a muted reaction to the decision by the Federal Reserve to cut rates by 50 basis points. But traders said the dollar could suffer over the coming sessions. ""There had been some suggestion that the Fed would boost the equity markets with a 75 basis point cut, now the focus will continue to be on the deteriorating economy,"" said Robert Lynch of BNP Paribas. The dollar had been under pressure for most of the day, depressed by the continued flow of poor economic figures from the US. Gross domestic product data showed the US economy growing at a puny annualised rate of 1.4 per cent in the fourth quarter - well below expectations of around 2 per cent. Most worrying perhaps was the sharp slowdown in investment spending by businesses. From a rise of 7.7 per cent in the third quarter, business investment fell by 1.5 per cent in the fourth - the sharpest slowdown since 1991. The Chicago manufacturing purchasing managers index also made fairly grim reading - falling to its lowest level since 1982. ""It is being made painfully apparent that the manufacturing sector is in a deep recession,"" said Russell Jones, head of currency research at Lehman Brothers. When added to Tuesday's poor consumer confidence figures, the GDP release caused some in the market to suggest the prospect of a 75 basis point cut in US interest rates. By middle of London trading, the Fed funds futures - seen as the best gauge of US rate expectations - were pricing in the risk of a 75 basis point fall. The euro ended London trading at $0.93, half a cent higher on the previous day. * But while the economic data continued to affect the interest rate futures markets the damage to the dollar was relatively contained. The euro managed to probe only modestly above $0.93 in early London trading. Analysts said this reflected the reluctance of investors to write off the US economy just yet. ""There are certainly few who want to take big bets ahead of the FOMC decision and there is always the risk that the non-farm payroll figures on Friday will disappoint,"" said Tony Norfield, head of currency research at ABN Amro in London. In addition traders said that the euro continued to labour under the weight of long positions. Many traders were quick to buy into the currency as it surged at the end of last year and are now reluctant to add to these positions. The latest IMM data from the Chicago Mercantile Exchange showed that these positions had been pared back. ""These should soon be cleared, allowing the euro to move higher,"" said Mr Norfield. ""But for the moment they continue to hold the euro back."" * With the Fed decision out of the way, one question uppermost on European traders' minds is likely to be whether the European Central Bank will follow suit. The bank holds its fortnightly monetary policy meeting today, but recent comments by ECB board members have suggested a reluctance to ease monetary policy. ""Our central view is that the refinancing rate will remain on hold at 4.75 per cent throughout 2001,"" said David Page at Investec in London. But he adds that this view hinges on ""a visible recovery"" in the US by the second half of 2001. ""Without this the slowdown in the global economy will be sharper this year, with the repercussions felt more strongly in the euro area, thus prompting the ECB to cut rates."" Yesterday's slew of euro-zone producer price inflation data all pointed to moderating price pressures. Italian producer price growth registered its first month-on-month decline in two years, with the annual rate slipping to 6.2 per cent from 6.7 per cent. Producer price inflation in France fell to 4.7 per cent from 5.9 per cent. ",CURRENCIES &MONEY - Dollar unmoved as Fed cuts rates.,2001-01-31,The Financial Times

In a related action, the board of governors approved a 50 basis point reduction in the discount rate to 5 per cent. Consumer and business confidence has eroded further, exacerbated by rising energy costs that continue to drain consumer purchasing power and press on business profit margins. Partly as a consequence, retail sales and business spending on capital equipment have weakened appreciably. Manufacturing production has been cut back sharply, with new technologies appearing to have accelerated the response of production and demand to potential excesses in the stock of inventories and capital equipment. Taken together, and with inflation contained, these circumstances have called for a rapid and forceful response of monetary policy. The longer-term advances in technology and accompanying gains in productivity, however, exhibit few signs of abating and these gains, along with the lower interest rates should support growth of the economy over time. Nonetheless, the committee continues to believe that against the background of its long-run goals of price stability and sustainable economic growth and of the information available, the risks are weighted mainly toward conditions that may generate economic weakness in the future.

682,188.0,1999-07-01,"For the second straight meeting of the Federal Reserve's policy-making open market committee, it was not what the central bankers chose to do immediately with interest rates but what they hinted they might do in the future that had most impact on financial markets. Yesterday's quarter point increase in the committee's target for the Fed funds rate had been so widely flagged in advance of the meeting that only a financial hermit can have been surprised by it. However, the Fed's decision to change, and to announce the change, in its inelegantly named ""inter-meeting policy directive"" - the bias that indicates which way policy-makers are leaning for future policy - was a welcome shock, at least for stock and bond holders. Having adopted a ""tightening bias"" at the May meeting - the first clear signal that a rate rise was coming - the committee members, led by Alan Greenspan, the chairman, yesterday shifted the bias back to neutral. This reflected, in their words, that the balance of risks to the economy was now even. Money markets have been discounting for the last few weeks not just yesterday's rate rise but at least one, and possibly two more later this year. The expectation was that, aware that markets were anticipating those further tightenings, the Fed would maintain its policy bias in favour of raising rates. However, yesterday's gear-shift casts more than just a little doubt now on whether, in fact, Mr Greenspan and the Fed will go much further in the coming months. ""It's one and he's done!"" as Richard Yamarone, senior economist at Argus Research, a consultancy in New York, put it. Some keen observers of the Fed cautioned against over-confidence, in the veiled world of central bank semiotics, that this was indeed the Fed's intentions. When the Fed raised interest rates in 1994-5, and again in 1997, on each occasion when it went into the relevant meeting with a tightening bias, it shifted the bias back to neutral after the rate rise Yet that did not stop the committee from voting to raise rates again at the subsequent meeting. The explanation for that approach, according to Fed insiders, was that, a reversion to neutrality was self-prescribing. Since they can, in principle, choose to raise interest rates by as much as they like, the committee members must, by definition, feel they had put policy on an even keel when they changed rates. To raise rates and maintain a tightening bias might indicate the Fed was not convinced it had raised rates by enough - an odd position to be in. However, the difference with yesterday's change is that it was announced immediately. Last December, in a genuflection towards greater glasnost at the Fed, the FOMC members decided that they would, in future, sometimes announce a bias change immediately, rather than wait for the publication of the meeting's minutes, six weeks or more hence. And it is this ""sometimes"" that is so important in understanding yesterday's announcement. According to the minutes of that meeting last year, the FOMC decided it would announce changes ""on those occasions when it wanted to communicate to the public a major shift in its views about the balance of risks or the likely direction of future policy"". Such announcements would not be made after every change in the symmetry of the directive but only when it seemed important for the public to be aware of an important shift in the members' views."" It could hardly be clearer. Yesterday's decision to publicise the change in bias must have been made with that paragraph at the forefront of members' minds. If the change in directive had merely been a piece of semantic, internal housecleaning, it could hardly have been deemed important enough to be announced. Of course, notwithstanding all this Kremlinology, the shift in the bias does not guarantee the Fed will not raise rates at its next meeting. If the economic data in the next seven weeks shows any renewed signs of inflation, the Fed will almost certainly tighten policy, whatever its predisposition. However, yesterday's surprise move, greeted euphorically by financial markets, and with good reason, almost certainly indicates the Fed is much less predisposed to raise rates than almost anyone had suspected.

683,189.0,1999-07-01,"The Federal Reserve yesterday raised US short-term interest rates for the first time in more than two years in an effort to take some heat out of the pace of economic growth - but hinted it was in no hurry to put rates up again soon. The central bank's policy-making open market committee lifted the target for its key short-term lending instrument - the fed funds rate - by a quarter of a percentage point to 5 per cent, the first increase since March 1997. The increase had been widely signalled by Fed officials, most notably Alan Greenspan, the chairman, and was no surprise to financial markets. But policymakers sweetened the pill with an announcement that they were shifting their policy bias - their view on the likely next move in rates - back to neutral from a bias towards tightening which was adopted at the May committee meeting. Stock and bond prices rose sharply on the news. The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed up 155.45 points, or 1.4 per cent, at 10,970, reversing a loss of 50 points before the Fed announcement. The benchmark 30-year US Treasury bond jumped more than a point, and the yield slid to 5.97 per cent, against Tuesday's closing yield of 6.07 per cent. In a statement, the central bank indicated the rate increase had been driven mainly by a return to normality in domestic and international financial markets after the global crisis of the last year, which prompted the central bank to cut rates by 0.75 percentage points in two months. But the decision to accompany yesterday's rate increase with a reversion to a neutral bias hinted that the Fed saw no pressing reason to go further than the one increase and raise rates again in the immediate future. ""Owing to the uncertain resolution of the balance of conflicting forces in the economy going forward, the FOMC has chosen to adopt a directive that includes no predilection about near-term policy action,"" the statement said. It added that the Fed ""in the current dynamic environment must be especially alert to the emergence, or potential emergence, of inflationary forces that could undermine economic growth."" ""The Fed is saying it still has a very slight bias towards raising rates. But basically, this was a big surprise and a buy signal for the markets,"" said Jim O'Sullivan, economist at J.P. Morgan, the investment bank, in New York. The US economy has grown at an annual rate of 4 per cent or more for the last three years. Some Fed officials, including Mr Greenspan, believe the rapid growth has been in part the result of a radical improvement in the long-term potential of the US economy, but they do not believe such a rate of growth can be sustained without a resurgence of inflation. Most analysts had expected the Fed to signal its readiness to raise rates again. Yesterday's decision to drop that stance does not mean the central bank will not raise rates again, but suggests policymakers may be confident the economy will slow of its own accord.

684,190.0,1999-07-01,"The US Federal Reserve's decision to raise interest rates by a quarter of a percentage point comes as no surprise. It will do little to slow domestic demand. Yet it marks a shift in Fed policy, and a significant change in the international economy. At the height of the international crisis last autumn, as US financial markets seized up, the Fed cut interest rates in three steps by a total of 0.75 percentage points. The Fed's injection of liquidity, together with the strength of US consumer demand, helped the financial storm to blow itself out. Since then the US has continued to grow at above a 4 per cent annual rate, and the euro-zone now shows encouraging signs. Moreover, there has even been some - perhaps temporary - good news from Japan. And developing Asia is recovering too. With the world on the mend, the Fed is now turning its attention back to domestic matters. It is doing so carefully. Having prepared the ground by signalling a bias towards tightening in May, the Federal Open Market Committee has followed up with a cautious quarter point increase. Inflation remains subdued. But Alan Greenspan, Fed chairman, has made it clear that pre-emptive action is needed to stop growing imbalances in the economy from sparking off inflation. The OECD forecasts US growth of 3.6 per cent this year. But domestic demand has been growing at a 7 per cent rate, much faster than domestic supply. Weakness in the international economy - and the US's growing current account deficit - have so far kept domestic inflation under control. But a weaker dollar, as the world recovers, would renew inflationary pressures. Moreover, with unemployment at 4.2 per cent, a thirty year low, the drying up of the labour pool risks re-igniting inflation. One quarter-point increase will do little to slow domestic demand growth. For now, the Fed is relying on the bond market to do that. Long term interest rates - which dipped below 5 per cent last autumn - are back above 6 per cent, tightening credit conditions throughout the economy. The Fed has judged that shifting back a little from its emergency footing is enough for now. It reinforced this point by announcing a ""neutral bias"" in monetary policy in the near future. If this approach was influenced by concerns over upsetting an equity market where valuations look stretched, this was a mistake. It is not the central bank's role to target asset prices. Rather, its job is to head off inflation and sustain the US economy's remarkable expansion. The Fed has left itself more work to do. Copyright Financial Times Limited 1999. All Rights Reserved.

685,191.0,1999-07-01,"The US dollar initially weakened on the foreign currency markets after the Federal Reserve nudged interest rates 25 basis points higher yesterday, but tempered the increase by returning to a neutral bias. The Fed said while US labour markets were tight, productivity gains had contained inflation. Despite the return to a neutral bias, the committee said it would remain alert to inflationary pressures. A rally in US bonds and stocks immediately after the decision failed to translate into dollar strength and the US currency was weaker against the euro and the yen in New York trading. The Fed's decision divided analysts over its longer-term impact. ""By encouraging a rally in bond markets and avoiding alarm in the equity markets, this move should be good for the dollar,"" said Paul Chertkow, head of global currency research at Tokyo-Mitsubishi. But Robert Lynch, currency analyst at Paribas in New York, said most of the good news was now priced into the dollar. The Fed's decision overshadowed signs of recovery in one of Europe's most sickly economies, with Italian gross domestic product data beating expectations. But the euro failed to take heart, closing the London session down at $1.031 against the dollar. Analysts said the accumulation of positive economic data could prevent the euro declining to parity with the dollar. ""From German GDP to the latest Insee survey, there are signs that things are turning around,"" said Avinash Persaud, global head of research at State Street. * The yen once again strayed perilously close to the intervention danger zone yesterday, lifted by rising Japanese bond yields. Reports in the Japanese press that new bond issuance would be necessary to fund support for bank depositors provided an initial boost for JGB yields. Comments from Masaru Hayami, Bank of Japan governor, that the zero interest rate policy could not last forever, gave added momentum to the move, taking yields to their highest level in three months. The yen rose in sympathy, pushing the dollar back below Y121 and the euro under Y125. Paul Chertkow, head of global currency research at Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi, said rises in JGB yields could further push the yen upwards. He added the market may also have been emboldened by a belief that the BoJ would not intervene until after the FOMC meet, but said official resolve to prevent a rising yen damaging Japanese stocks should keep the dollar above Y120. * Although yesterday's widely expected Fed decision took US interest rates above those in Canada and Australia, only sterling has so far been singled out for punishment. Though still uncomfortably strong against the euro, the pound has recently slipped below its two-year trading range against the dollar in expectation that rates would cross over. Meanwhile the Australian and Canadian dollars, whose official rates were at 4.75 per cent at the time of the Fed decision, have remained relatively resilient. Analysts said this disparity was partly due to the near-unanimous decision by the Bank of England's monetary policy committee in favour of the latest rate cut. With UK inflation undershooting its target last month and sterling strong, most believe it will be some time before the MPC follows the Fed. By contrast, said Mark Cliffe, chief economist at ING Barings, Canada is more likely to be carried along by further US rises. ""Though not expected to follow through immediately on rates, the latest GDP figures show the economy in robust form,"" he said. Analysts said stronger commodity prices had also enabled the Australian and Canadian dollars to withstand interest rate pressure. But others were more mystified that sterling alone had suffered. ""Interest rate futures markets have been pricing in a cross over in UK and US interest rates since the start of the year,"" said Michael Metcalfe, currency analyst at NatWest GFM. ""Given that UK rates have clearly troughed and the economy continues to gather momentum, the move in sterling is hard to justify."" * In late afternoon in New York, the dollar was trading at Y121.21 to the yen and at $1.0346 to the euro.

686,192.0,1999-07-01,"A promising start to yester-day's London trading soon gave way to another dose of uncertainty as investors preferred to sit out the final session of the second quarter. At the finish of a rather tense, but generally thinly traded session, the FTSE 100 index closed 11.4 ahead at 6,318.5. During the previous two sessions the index gave up 128.3 or 2 per cent as London became increasingly uneasy over the prospect of a rise in US rates. There were no such fireworks in the FTSE 250, 6.8 firmer at 5,858.2, or the FTSE SmallCap, 0.6 off at 2,650.6. Dealers said it was no surprise that the institutions refused to trade ahead of the decision by the US Federal Reserve's open market committee on whether to raise interest rates. Before the announcement last night, observers said a 25 basis points increase in US rates had already been priced into Wall Street. There was no further support for London as Wall Street opened yesterday, however, with the recent upsurge by the Dow Jones Industrial Average halted by growing unease ahead of the FOMC result. Overnight, the US market had delivered another stunning performance, the Dow registering its second consecutive three-figure gain, following up Monday's 103-point rise with a 160-point upsurge, for a two-day gain of 263 or 2.5 per cent. And that performance saw the FTSE 100 make rapid early progress and record a 64.5 gain before running out of steam and slipping all the way back into negative ter-ritory just before midday. There was more switching activity being carried out by the big tracker funds to accommodate Vodafone AirTouch's increased weighting in the FTSE 100, which involved the institutions adjusting weightings across the rest of the index via a series of programme trades. Turnover in Vodafone AirTouch was 51m shares - around 4.5 per cent of the overall market total which reached a hefty 1.16bn. It was also inflated by renewed heavy trading in Asda, where Dresdner Kleinwort Benson, acting for Wal-Mart, continued to mop up Asda shares. Turnover in Asda was 75m shares, or 6.5 per cent of the total. The resumption of the tennis at Wimbledon, after Tuesday's washout, and the involvement of the two leading UK players, provided a substantial diversion. The big winner in the FTSE 100 was Bass, whose shares were top of the FTSE 100 table on the view that the Bass/Punch Taverns offer for Allied Domecq's pubs business might still emerge victorious despite Whitbread's statement that it is planning to up its bid. Mining stocks in the FTSE 100, Anglo American, Billiton and Rio Tinto, also progressed after the surprise news that Phelps Dodge, the big mining group, is cutting its US copper output, hard on the heels of a similar move by BHP last week. There was plenty of bid action in the minnows to keep the speculators happy; bid news was behind the spectacular gains in Euclidian, the Lloyds insurance group, which attracted a management buy-out and Hicking Pentecost, where Coats Viyella trumped the existing US offer.

The Fed said that while US labour markets were tight, productivity gains had contained inflation. Despite the return to a neutral bias, the committee said it would remain alert to inflationary pressures. Immediately after the decision a rally in US bonds and stocks failed to translate into dollar strength and the US currency was weaker against the euro and the yen during trading in New York. The Fed's decision divided analysts over its longer-term impact. ""By encouraging a rally in bond markets and avoiding alarm in the equity markets, this move should be good for the dollar,"" said Paul Chertkow, head of global currency research at Tokyo-Mitsubishi. But Robert Lynch, currency analyst at Paribas in New York, said most of the good news was now priced into the dollar. The Fed's decision yesterday overshadowed signs of recovery in one of Europe's most sickly economies, with Italian gross domestic product data coming in above expectations. But the euro failed to take heart, closing the London session down at $1.031 against the dollar. However, analysts said the accumulation of positive economic statistics could now prevent the euro declining to parity with the dollar. ""From German GDP to the latest Insee survey, there are signs that things are turning around,"" said Avinash Persaud, global head of research at State Street. * The yen once again strayed perilously close to the intervention danger zone yesterday, lifted by rising Japanese bond yields. Reports in the Japanese press that new bond issuance would be necessary to fund support for bank depositors provided an initial boost for JGB yields. Comments from Masaru Hayami, Bank of Japan governor. The yen rose in sympathy, pushing the dollar back below Y121 and the euro under Y125. Paul Chertkow, head of global currency research at Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi, said rises in JGB yields could put further upward pressure on the yen. He added the market may also have been emboldened by a belief that the Bank of Japan would refrain from intervention until after the FOMC decision, but said that official resolve to prevent a rising yen damaging Japanese stocks should keep the dollar above Y120. * Although yesterday's widely expected Fed decision took US interest rates above above those in Canada, Australia, only sterling has so far been singled out for punishment. Though still uncomfortably strong against the euro, the pound has recently slipped below its two-year trading range against the dollar in expectation that rates would cross over. Meanwhile the Australian and Canadian dollars, whose official rates were at 4.75 per cent at the time of the Fed decision, have remained relatively resilient. Part of the reason for this disparity, analysts said, had been the near-unanimous decision by the Bank of England's monetary policy committee in favour of the latest rate cut. With UK inflation undershooting its target last month and sterling strong against the euro, most believe it will be some time before the MPC follows the Fed. By contrast, said Mark Cliffe, chief economist at ING Barings, Canada is more likely to be carried along by further US rises. ""Though not expected to follow through immediately on rates, the latest GDP figures show the economy in robust form,"" he said. Analysts said stronger commodity prices had also enabled the Australian and Canadian dollars to withstand interest rate pressure. But others were more mystified that sterling alone had suffered. ""Interest rate futures markets have been pricing in a cross over in UK and US interest rates since the start of the year,"" said Michael Metcalfe, currency analyst at NatWest GFM.

690,196.0,2007-11-01,"The US Federal Reserve cut interest rates by a quarter point to 4.5 per cent yesterday, but warned investors against banking on further monetary easing, sending short-term government bond yields soaring.  The central bank signalled that it was shifting to a neutral stance on future rate cuts, saying ""the upside risks to inflation roughly balance the downside risks to growth"".  This means that Fed policymakers see the likelihood of further rate cuts as being no greater than the likelihood of increases in contrast to the market, which before the decision was pricing in substantial further easing in the months ahead.  One Fed governor, Thomas Hoenig of Kansas City, Missouri, dissented. He preferred to leave rates unchanged in another signal that the Fed may be more hawkish than the markets might have hoped.  ""This should not be read as the Fed closing the door on easing, but they are signalling that the bar will be set quite high for them to cut at the next meeting,"" said Alan Ruskin, chief international strategist at RBS Greenwich Capital.  The yield on the two-year note, which is particularly sensitive to short-term changes in monetary policy, rose 13 basis points to a high of 3.93 per cent. Interest rate futures reflected sharply lower odds of further rate cuts when the FOMC meets in December and January.  The dollar also fell to a record low of Dollars 1.4504 against the euro, while stocks staged a strong rally late in the day, amid optimism that the Fed had done enough to insulate the broader economy from problems in the housing and credit markets.  The central bank predicted in its statement accompanying the rate decision that ""the pace of economic expansion will likely slow in the near-term"" as the housing slump intensifies.  But it added that the second successive rate cut ""should help forestall some of the adverse effects on the broader economy that might otherwise arise from the disruptions in financial markets and promote moderate growth over time"".  The statement from the Fed played down expectations of future rate cuts.  Disappointing earnings in the banking sector and downbeat corporate forecasts have added to concerns about a slowdown.  However, US gross domestic product rose at an annual rate of 3.9 per cent in the three months to the end of September.  ""This one was for the banks. The cut is intended to keep money flowing freely and stem the risk of spillover from the financial markets to the real economy,"" said Jeoff Hall, an economist at Thomson Financial.

Equity investors were initially disappointed by the statement, but buyers soon emerged and stocks closed sharply higher.  The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 1 per cent to 13,930.01 after being up 0.4 per cent before the Fed's move. The S&P 500 rallied 1.2 per cent to 1,549.38, while the Nasdaq Composite rose 1.5 per cent to 2,859.12.

""Once investors digested what the Fed had to say, they started to run the market higher.""  The Federal Open Market Committee said: ""The committee judges that, after this action, the upside risks to inflation roughly balance the downside risks to growth."" The FOMC also said this cut, along with September's 50-basis-point cut, ""should forestall the hit to economy caused by recent financial turmoil"".  Drew Matus, economist at Lehman Brothers said: ""More generally, when the FOMC discusses rate moves in cumulative terms, they are coming to or at the end of whatever cycle they had been in.""  The yield on the two-year Treasury note rose 13bp to 3.94 per cent and interest rate futures reduced expectations of further cuts when the FOMC meets in December and early next year. The yield on the 10-year note rose 8bp to 4.465 per cent.  ""The prospect of further rate cuts is not looking good,"" said Tom di Galoma, head of Treasury trading at Jefferies &Co. ""The economy and the markets have improved in the last six weeks and until housing weakness rolls over into the broad economy, the Fed will not aggressively ease.""  The latest Fed cut came after US gross domestic product in the third quarter rose by an annualised 3.9 per cent, beating market expectations. Yesterday's numbers also showed household spending and business investment remained robust.  On currency markets , the dollar fell to a record low of Dollars 1.4504 against the euro after the rate cut was announced. The dollar index, a measure of the US unit's strength against a basket of other major currencies, also hit a new low.  ""This outcome will keep the dollar's longer term downtrend intact,"" said Marc Chandler at Brown Brothers Harriman. Sterling rose to a 26-year peak against the dollar after a stronger-than-expected rise in UK house prices in October contrasted with recent data showing slowing mortgage demand and weaker buyer confidence. UK Gilt prices fell on the data, driving the yield on the 10-year note 3.9bp higher to 4.97 per cent.  The Bank of Japan kept interest rates on hold at 0.5 per cent, offering no support for the weak yen. Furthermore, the central bank's semi-annual outlook on economic activity revealed expectations of lower growth and inflation, limiting the likelihood of any further near-term interest rate increases. The dollar was up 0.6 per cent to Y115.33.  Oil prices rose sharply after a surprise drawdown in US stockpiles. Commodity markets had expected weekly inventory data to show a rise of 400,000 barrels of crude oil following the previous week's massive 5.3m-barrel fall. A further drain of 3.9m barrels last week shocked the market and Nymex West Texas Intermediate jumped Dollars 4.17 to close at a record Dollars 94.55 a barrel, while London's Brent crude climbed Dollars 3.19 to a new record of Dollars 90.63.  Gold prices surged back towards recent 28-year highs as the dollar outlook softened. Spot gold was up 1.3 per cent to Dollars 791.70 an ounce.  Equity markets in Asia and Europe closed before the Fed's rate decision.  Hong Kong's Hang Seng index broke a four-day winning streak and edged off its record high as Tuesday's oil price decline took its toll on stocks such as CNOOC and Sinopec.

697,203.0,2007-11-01,"There were no nasty Hallowe'en surprises from the Fed. The Federal open market committee cut the Fed Funds rate by 25 basis points to 4.5 per cent, fulfilling market expectations.  But markets did not behave as this news was already in the price. Stocks sold off, and then resurged. Bond yields rose (suggesting the chances of future rate cuts had reduced). That should help the dollar, but it fell to new record lows.  The keys to this ride lay in the Fed's 173-word statement. The key words are that ""the upside risks to inflation roughly balance the downside risks to growth"". So it has no bias, towards tightening or easing.  Is the rest of the statement neutral? The Fed does not declare victory over the credit squeeze, saying only that strains in the money markets have ""eased somewhat on balance"". It also expects economic growth to slow because of the intensifying housing correction. Points for the doves. For the hawks, recent rises in energy and commodity prices ""may put renewed upward pressure on inflation"".  Also note that the Fed did not speak with one voice, as one governor voted not to cut at all.  In short the Fed, like any central bank, does not much want to cut rates. But it plainly fears that it may have to do so.  On balance, the chances of a rate cut at the next two meetings, in December and January, have reduced. That is how Fed Funds futures reacted. On Tuesday, they signalled that a 4.25 per cent Fed Funds rate was a certainty by February. Those odds were slashed by a third after the Fed statement.  So why did the dollar fall? The chances of rate cuts in the eurozone this year look to have been eradicated by yesterday's high inflation reading. The Fed is dependent on the data once more. With more bad housing data, it may cut. Forex traders decided it was still safe to bet against the dollar.

698,204.0,2007-11-01,"Interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve are bearish for base metals such as copper and aluminium, says John Reade at UBS. ""The FOMC cut both the Fed funds and discount rates by a further 25 basis points as was widely expected [on Wednesday] helping to underpin base metals and rallies are possible as economic growth will be stimulated.  ""Indeed, this was the case in September when the Fed made a surprise 50bp cut in Fed funds. However, an historical examination of the relationship between US interest rates and base metals prices shows a positive correlation.  ""That is to say, base metals will struggle in an environment of falling interest rates; central banks are cutting because economic growth is weakening.""  Mr Reade notes that: ""The strong rally in base metals over the past six years came amid rising interest rates which were a sign of strengthening economic growth.  ""We are witnessing a synchronised deceleration in global growth exacerbated by the credit crunch and very high oil prices.""

701,207.0,1994-02-05,"Wall Street US stocks yesterday suffered their worst setback in over two years after the Federal Reserve announced that its policy-making body had decided to tighten credit conditions, writes Frank McGurty in New York. The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished down 96.24 at 3,871.42. It was its biggest fall in the single day since November 15, 1991. The more broadly based Standard and Poor's 500 plunged 11.41 to469.81. In the secondary markets, the American SE composite was 8.89 lower at 478.29, and the Nasdaq composite 20.51 off at 777.28. Volume on the NYSE was very heavy, with 377m shares traded by the close. Declining issues outnumbered advances by 2,032 to 296. After a soft opening, the market went into a tail spin after Mr Alan Greenspan, the Fed chairman, said that the Federal Open Market Committee had voted to increase pressure on reserve positions, a move associated with a slight rise in short-term rates. Share prices, which have prosperedunder the Fed's long-held policy of accommodation, plunged on the news, with the Dow index falling about 40 points within minutes of the statement. Stocks pulled off of their session lows soon after, helped in part by indications that the Fed would nudge up its target for the key Fed Funds rate by only 25 basis points to 3.25%. While an early move had been expected, the financial markets were nevertheless surprised by the unprecedented announcement of the Fed's intentions. At first, the bond market displayed a cooler reaction than equities in the face of the long-anticipated Fed move, intended to staunch incipient inflationary pressures in the economy. But losses started to mount in the afternoon, especially in the intermediate segment of the maturity range, with the five-year note down 19/32 at 98 21/32 and the yield rising to 5.303% late in the day. When bonds started to sag, the sell-off in stocks accelerated, with the Dow finally hitting bottom at the close. Financial issues and utilities, which are the most sensitive to fluctuations in interest rates, were among the worst performers. Citicorp was marked down $2 to $40 1/2, Chase Manhattan $1 1/2 to $33 3/4 and Wells Fargo $6 5/8 to $128 7/8. Brokerage houses were also hit hard, with Morgan Stanley dropping $3 5/8 to $74 5/8 and Merrill Lynch shedding $2 3/4 to $41 1/2. Amid the fresh indication that the economy may not have fared as well as expected last month, cyclical issues, including automobile, metals and heavy equipment companies, were also down. General Motors dropped $1 3/8 to $61 5/8, Alcoa $2 1/8 and 3M $2 1/4 to $104 1/2. On the Nasdaq, technology stocks led the retreat. Microsoft lost $3 1/4 to $82 1/4, Sun Microsystems $1 5/8 to $25 1/2 and Wellfleet Communications $3 3/8 to $70 3/8.

The statement, which echoed recent testimony by Alan Greenspan, Fed chairman, also noted that inflation and inflation expectations had declined recently, in spite of the high oil price.

The Fed has taken care to communicate its message to the market and lay out the expected course of increases to return rates to a more neutral level at a ""pace that is likely to be measured"", widely seen as meaning quarter-point moves. The federal funds rate is seen as too low to be consistent with stable inflation over time. But officials stress that rate moves will be determined by economic data. Futures markets are pricing in a further increase when the Fed meets in November but are betting it will leave rates on hold when it meets close to Christmas before raising them again in February. The market is pricing in about a 3 per cent rate by the end of next year, the lower end of the range for neutral rates commonly seen as 3-5 per cent. Recent economic data have supported the Fed's case that the economy is bouncing back after a soft patch at the end of the second quarter, though the August retail sales data were mixed. The high oil price is seen as a risk, but the Fed has no evidence so far that the oil price has knocked expansion fundamentally off course.

The Fed, in its statement yesterday, noted that ""labour market conditions have improved modestly"" since its August meeting. The decline in inflation and inflation expectations in recent months, in spite of the high oil price, makes it easier for the central bank to pay close attention to the risks that the high oil price poses for growth.

Since June, before the Fed started raising rates, the yield on the 10-year Treasury note has fallen from almost 4.9 per cent to below 4.1.

By midday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down more than 100 points, or 1.1 per cent, while the technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite index was 1.4 per cent lower. Morgan Stanley, the US investment bank, saw its shares fall sharply after its third-quarter earnings fell short of expectations, while network equipment maker Cisco Systems was dented by a downgrade from Deutsche Bank.

Nymex October futures were above $48 a barrel at midday, within striking distance of the all-time high of $49.40 hit last month. The markets may have got what they wanted from the Fed on Tuesday but there was still uncertainty about the timing of the next tightening. ""Currently, the futures market is expecting rates to end the year at 2 per cent and surveys suggest that this is the level that economists generally expect as well,"" said James Knightley, economist at ING Financial Markets. ""However, in our view there is a good chance that they will raise rates by 25 basis points at both the November and December FOMC meetings to leave the Fed funds target rate at 2.25 per cent by year-end."" The dollar rallied as investors brushed aside comments by the Fed that inflationary pressures had eased, which had prompted some speculation that the central bank would try to hold back from further rate increases. But Treasury bond prices remained supported by the inflation comments, with the yield on ten-year paper hovering around 4 per cent, a five-month low.

However all eyes were on the accompanying statement, and many market participants seized on the suggestion that ""despite the rise in energy prices, inflation and inflation expectations have eased in recent months."" Some took this as a signal that the Fed might not, as most analysts previously predicted, deliver further rate hikes in both November and December. ""These comments reinforced the belief that the Federal Open Market Committee will withdraw policy accommodation only one more time this year, raising the federal funds rate an additional 0.25 point following either the November or the December meeting,"" said Paul Chertkow, head of global currency research at Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi, although Mr Chertkow himself does not subscribe to this view. Mr Chertkow added that: ""The characterisation of economic activity appeared less upbeat than the previous characterisation."" In August the FOMC had said that the US economy ""appears poised to resume a stronger pace of expansion"". On Tuesday that was replaced with ""output growth appears to gave regained some traction"". ""Although the dollar had been sold off earlier on position-squaring prior to the meeting, the market seemingly interpreted the Fed's statement as a signal that the Fed may skip a hike in its return, or potentially back away from hiking rather than accelerating the pace of hikes,"" added Robert Lynch, currency analyst at BNP Paribas.

The greenback did manage to firm to $1.7907 against sterling, however, with the pound undermined by the release of the minutes of the Bank of England monetary policy committee's meeting earlier this month. As expected, the MPC voted 9-0 to leave rates on hold, but the picture it painted of the UK economy was seen as a touch pessimistic. The committee said the pace of growth in the third quarter ""might be a little slower than had been envisaged"" and that recent labour market data had been ""surprisingly weak"". In addition, there was an ""increasing weight of evidence"" that the housing market was cooling. ""These minutes demonstrate a growing sense of comfort that earlier rate hikes are already doing enough to head off any inflationary bubble,"" said Daragh Maher, senior FX strategist at Calyon. ""Further signs of easing in the housing markets should also head off any hawkish fightback in October."" ""The minutes also mentioned a rising risk of an abrupt correction in the UK housing market, which do little to calm sterling sentiment,"" added Paul Mackel, currency strategist at ABN Amro. Sterling drifted lower to GBP0.6851 against the euro, SFr2.2576 versus the Swiss franc and A$2.5355 against the Australian dollar, a one-month low.

709,215.0,1998-05-20,"UK gilts stole the show in European bond markets yesterday, see-sawing in reaction to UK inflation figures as other markets held their fire pending a decision from the Federal Reserve on US interest rates. Investors were seen holding back until this morning before taking positions, although the consensus - rightly, as it proved - was for no change in US rates. Analysts said markets were looking further ahead to the release tomorrow of the Federal open market committee's March minutes for indications of any shift in underlying sentiment. Markets ended higher across the board but were locked in tight ranges, having apparently shrugged off the latest political developments in Indonesia. US TREASURY bond prices remained largely unchanged in quiet trading yesterday morning in New York, as traders marked time ahead of the Fed committee meeting. The benchmark 30-year bond was 1/32 higher, at 102 25/32, in early afternoon trading in New York, putting the yield at 5.924%. Two-year notes were unchanged at 100 1/16, leaving the yield at 5.589%. Bond prices held on to their gains of the day before, which followed the rising dollar. The long bond yield remains about 10 basis points below its level of late last month, reflecting receding fears that a US rate rise might be imminent and a partial return of its status as a safe haven. UK GILTS initially took fright at higher than expected retail price index data, falling sharply after it appeared these spelled a resurgence of inflation and concern over a possible interest rate rise. The statistics office said headline inflation hit a six-year high of 4%, up from 3.5% in March. In addition, the April retail price index came in above forecasts at 3%, against a forecast of between 2.8% and 2.9%. That, coupled with last week's average earnings data which showed a bigger rise than had been expected, helped stoke fears that the Bank of England's year-end inflation target of 2.5% may be unrealistic. The short end of the yield curve saw some flattening as short-dated bonds were hit, with economists predicting more of the same if tomorrow's retail sales figures are perceived as strong. However, gilts recovered after concluding the headline figure was boosted by Budget items and that there were still no convincing reasons to alter current views on interest rates. ""For once I think the markets are listening to the economists rather than the headlines. It's clear the acceleration in the headline index is a one-off,"" said Julian Jessop, European economist at Nikko. Nevertheless, there are still lingering fears that the headline figure may encourage wage deals that are inflationary. Yesterday, retailer Marks &Spencer fuelled such concerns by announcing a a 5.25% staff pay rise. ""It (today's official data) doesn't change our view that interest rates are more likely to remain at 7.25% for the rest of the year than to rise, but the risks are still on the upside,"" said Steven Andrew, gilt strategist at Merrill Lynch. ""The problem is that the higher number may feed through to inflationary pressures at a later stage. The ball we should be watching is the labour market."" The June gilt future settled 11 basis points higher at 107.78 with 76,000 contracts traded. Figures showing that the government had been able to repay #3.4bn in debt - largely thanks to robust tax revenues - was seen pushing gilt prices higher, as it would reduce the need for further auctions and point to the prospect of scarce supply. The spread over German bunds narrowed to 104 from the previous day's 105 basis points. BUNDS ended higher, hardly reacting to comments by Ernest Welteke, a Bundesbank council member, warning a small interest rate rise could not be ruled out, though it was too early to speculate when to make any adjustment. The IFO business climate data were slightly weaker than expected but analysts said the market had already priced this into their expectations, as weak production data had told a similar story last week. The June bund future settled 13 basis points higher at 106.95 after nudging technical resistance at 106.98. Copyright Financial Times Limited 1998. All Rights Reserved.

710,216.0,2001-11-07,"The Federal Reserve on Tuesday took another bold step in its aggressive efforts to revive the US economy, cutting short-term interest rates once again by 0.5 percentage points to their lowest level in almost four decades. The central bank's policymaking open market committee slashed its key monetary policy instrument - its target for the federal funds rate - to 2 per cent, and hinted of more to come. The Fed also cut its largely symbolic discount rate by the same amount to 1.5 per cent. ""Heightened uncertainty and concerns about a deterioration in business conditions both here and abroad are damping economic activity,"" the FOMC said on announcing the move. In opting for a half-point cut, the FOMC seemed to brush aside concerns among some economists that it might have been overly aggressive in reducing rates already and should move instead by a more cautious 0.25 percentage point cut. Short-term rates have now fallen from 6.5 per cent a year ago to 2 per cent. Using its standard verbal formula that for the foreseeable future, ""the risks are weighted mainly toward conditions that may generate economic weakness"", the Fed indicated it stood ready to cut rates again, and financial markets immediately began to price in the probability of rates falling below 2 per cent by early next year. Investors cheered the Fed's move as stocks erased earlier losses. The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed up 150.09 to 9,591.12 and the Nasdaq Composite rose 41.44 to 1,835.09. While expressing concern about the deteriorating immediate prospects for the US economy, the Fed reiterated its belief that longer-term prospects remained good, although they might be affected by business responses to the terrorist attacks of September 11. For the first time in a decade, the Fed's monetary policymakers met yesterday amid firm evidence that the US economy was in recession. Inflation-adjusted gross domestic product contracted at an annual rate of 0.4 per cent in the three months to September, and the early figures published so far for employment, consumer confidence and manufacturing in October suggested output plunged lower last month. And on Tuesday, several members of the National Bureau of Economic Research - the body that historically sets official dates for US business cycles - said they were actively discussing the possibility of officially declaring the first US recession in a decade. Tuesday's rate cut takes overnight interest rates below most estimates of annual consumer price inflation, meaning the real cost of short-term borrowing is now negative. Real short term rates have not been below zero for an extended period since the 1970s. Additional reporting by Peronet Despeignes. ",Fed cuts rates to 40-year low.,2001-11-06,The Financial Times
711,217.0,2003-09-16,"Wall Street traded lower in a quiet session as investors looked ahead to today's Federal Open Market Committee meeting and the coming earnings season. ""Today's action is just treading water,"" said Ned Riley, global strategist for State Street Global Advisors. ""There's little to go on in terms of corporate news, and the intent of the Fed going forward is on investors' minds. This period can be notoriously dangerous for the market, being the last month of a quarter, and given the amount of negativity that surrounds pre-announcements."" He said he expects a better quarter than earlier in the year, noting that the ratio of downgrades to upgrades has improved. For example, 60 per cent of revisions in profits forecasts for technology companies have been higher. Yet this winning streak did little to improve investors' attitudes towards the sector, which was hit by profit taking. The S&P 500 semiconductor and equipment maker sector slid 1.6 per cent, the biggest loss on the index. Altera led the group lower, down 3.2 per cent to $21.25. Applied Micro Circuits was off 3.3 per cent to $5.50, while PCM-Sierra followed, down 3.2 per cent to $13.54. The negative sentiment toward the sector would not be deterred, with Applied Materials shares slipping 1.9 per cent to $20.58 despite an upbeat note from Merrill Lynch. By the close, the Dow Jones Industrial Average had slipped 22.74 to 9,448.81, while the broader S&P 500 was down 3.83 to 1,014.80. The Nasdaq fell 9.33 to 1,845.70. While the FOMC meeting is the highlight of the week's economic calendar, manufacturing activity was again under scrutiny at the start of the week. Industrial output rose 0.1 per cent in August - less than the previous month's upwardly revised 0.7 per cent increase - as summer shutdowns and holidays, reflected in the pullback in manufacturing payrolls, hit the sector. Analysts expected a rise of 0.3 per cent. But the September Empire State index of manufacturing in New York beat expectations to move further into the expansion zone as factories reopened after the summer. The New York Federal Reserve district reported a fifth consecutive rise, with the index hitting 18.35, from 9.98 in August. By the close, the losses were spread across the S&P 500, with most sectors posting slides of 1 per cent or less. But the day was not without bright spots. Alphapharma, the generic drug maker, joined the ranks of biotechs to post gains on the back of new drug news. Shares rose 7.4 per cent to $20.23 after the company announced late on Friday that it received US regulatory approval for its version of Neurontin, Pfizer's epilepsy drug. Elsewhere in the sector, Vaxgen continued to benefit from an announcement on Friday that research indicated that its smallpox vaccination may help prevent HIV. Traders said it was also buoyed among retail investors by a perception the company could benefit from US government spending on vaccines to combat terrorist attacks. Shares added 23.9 per cent to $8.05. Golden State Vintners,a small California winery, was another winner, leaping 44.2 per cent to $3 after announcing a reverse share split. Footstar, a maker of athletic shoes, declined by 17 per cent to $8.65 after the company's chairman and chief executive resigned over an accounting discrepancy. The company plans to restate financials from 1997 to 2002, which are expected to reduce earnings in that period. Elsewhere in retail, investors were feeling more comfortable with consumer spending and the sector posted gains of 1.5 per cent, the best performance on the S&P 500. Home Depot, the home improvement chain, added 3.8 per cent to $32.78, while rival Lowe's climbed 2.4 per cent to $52.70 as investors bet on homeowners in the US north-east buying hurricane-proof articles ahead of the expected arrival of Hurricane Isabel, which is currently off the coast.

712,218.0,2003-09-16,"The US Federal Reserve's open market committee meets today amid wide expectation among investors that it will leave interest rates on hold at 1 per cent. Futures markets yesterday were pricing in a probability of around 5 per cent that the FOMC would raise rates by a quarter-point, underlining the consensus among investors and economists that they will remain on hold for the next few months. Data released yesterday continued the slightly disappointing tone of figures released last week, showing that the Fed's view that the economy is moving into a sustained period of faster growth remains at risk. Industrial production in the US edged 0.1 per cent higher in August, below economists' expectations of a 0.3 per cent rise. The new figure, however, was offset partially by an upward revision of July's increase, to 0.7 per cent, from the previously announced 0.5 per cent. Most forecasters still think the US economy is gathering steam. The National Association of Business Economists said yesterday a survey of forecasters had raised their expectations for growth, with predictions for 2004 rising to 4 per cent, up from 3.6 per cent in the previous survey in May. In its regular report on its members' expectations, the NABE said consumer spending and business investment would rise more quickly than previously thought. But the panel reduced its expectations for growth in corporate profits. Speaking at the NABE's annual meeting, Greg Mankiw, chairman of the White House Council of Economic Advisors, said: ""Most of the recent news has been better than we expected. The signs of a rebound are now numerous."" But it could be a while before the improvements feed through to increases in interest rates. While most officials in the Fed share Wall Street's confidence that the economic recovery is gaining momentum, they have so far seen little evidence companies are regaining pricing power and that inflation is likely to take off. Accordingly, it would be a shock if the FOMC did anything other than leave rates on hold today. One possibility is that the Fed will tweak further the wording of the statement it will release with its decision, which is likely to attract most of the interest when it announces today's decision. After the disappointing reaction in June - when investors responded to a statement they regarded as ambiguous by ratcheting up long-term rates - the Fed has been at pains to try and fine-tune its language. It has tried to give the clearest possible indication that the risk of falling inflation is its dominant concern, and that rates are likely to be kept low for the foreseeable future until this risk has dissipated. Markets have taken this with some scepticism, continuing to price in substantial rises in rates next year, in the belief that the Fed will find itself compelled to raise borrowing costs relatively soon. As part of the assessment of its communications strategy, the Fed is continuing to review its practice - adopted earlier this year - of giving separate assessments of the balance of risk around inflation and growth. Although that review seems unlikely to reach definitive conclusions soon, some of the thinking within the process may well emerge during its course and be reflected in FOMC statements. In a separate report yesterday, the US current account deficit in the second quarter was nearly unchanged at $138.7bn (Euros 122bn, £86bn), holding near the record set in the first quarter.

714,220.0,2003-09-16,"It is an overwhelming probability that the Federal open market committee will leave interest rates unchanged when it meets today. The evidence pointing to a third-quarter growth spurt has accumulated since the last meeting. It is no clearer whether this will prove to be sustainable. But, if committee members happen to feel creative, then a definition of what the FOMC sees as price stability would be an invaluable addition to every market participant's tool kit. Though the yield on 10-year bonds is returning to a more sensible level, the market is still pricing in one percentage point of Fed tightening by the end of next year - at odds with the FOMC's on-hold rhetoric. The committee's somewhat schizophrenic policy stance may be part of the problem. The FOMC states that the risks to sustainable growth are balanced, while the remote threat of deflation outweighs any concern about inflation. Third quarter growth will be supported by strong consumer spending, supported by tax cuts and the last legs of the mortgage refinancing cycle. Any disappointment in August's retail sales data stems from the inability of Detroit auto manufacturers to sell cars for a profit. There are some positive signs on the capital spending front. What is missing is a labour market recovery. A jobless recovery is not sustainable, as households will eventually raise precautionary saving, and another period of sub-par growth will put the productivity record to the test. If the remote deflation risk is of greater concern than inflation, this derives from the danger than the current spurt will be followed by a return to sub-par growth. It does not obviously make sense to split the two risks. Further note on San Miguel at www.ft.com/lex London Edition 1. ",LEX COLUMN - FOMC THE LEX COLUMN.,2003-09-15,The Financial Times

US TREASURIES rose modestly on the Federal Reserve's confirmation of that in the afternoon and traded narrowly as expected. The benchmark 30-year Treasury rose 3/16 to 98,sending the yield down to 6.720%. Two-year notes were unchanged at 99 15/16, yielding 6.016%, while the 10-year note rose 1/8 to 101 7/16, to yield 6.416%.

These showed a monthly 0.2% fall, compared with monthly 0.3% rise in April. The new 30-year bund was relatively well received, according to Mr Heinz Gunasekera, analyst at UBS, with investors buying the new issue to replace the previous January 2024 benchmark issue. However, Mr Gunasekera pointed out that the demand came almost entirely from trading accounts and not from end-investors, who continue to be wary of 30 year bonds. ITALIAN BTPs were the day's star performer, gaining on renewed enthusiasm about Italy's entry to the European single currency. The September BTP future touched a new contract high of 135.20 before settling at 135.02, up 0.62 on the day. The yield spread over bunds, which has been closing in since the Amsterdam summit in mid-June, gained another six basis points to 108 basis points. Mr David Brown, chief European economist at Bear Stearns, said the convergence trades had ""plenty of momentum left"" and enthusiasm about Italy was reinforced by expectation that there could be further interest rate cuts, following last Friday's half-point cut to 6.25%. FRENCH OATs also gained ground. The September notional future touched a new contract high of 129.72 before settling at 129.66, up 0.24 on the day. Traders warned, however, that profits might be taken this morning ahead of the auction of a new 10-year 5.5% OAT.

""The market had got ahead of itself in recent days, expecting the chancellor to pull a rabbit out of the hat, but he didn't,"" said Mr Andrew Roberts, analyst at UBS. Another analyst said that the Budget announcements of additional petrol duty, an increase in stamp duty and a slight cut in mortgage interest tax relief were far short of expectations. Mr Kevin Adams, analyst at BZW, said: ""This Budget has not done enough to restrain what could be some very strong consumer spending numbers in the coming months."" He repeated his forecast that interest rates would be 7.25-7.50% in about a year.

717,223.0,1997-07-03,"US and European bond markets maintained their upward momentum yesterday as investors bet that the Federal Open Market Committee would leave US interest rates unchanged. US TREASURIES rose modestly on the Federal Reserve's confirmation of that in the afternoon and traded narrowly as expected. The benchmark 30-year Treasury rose 3/16 to 98,sending the yield down to 6.720%. Two-year notes were unchanged at 99 15/16, yielding 6.016%, while the 10-year note rose 1/8 to 101 7/16, to yield 6.416%. While most analysts had expected the Fed to leave interest rates unchanged for now, some believe rates could go higher after the Fed's August meeting. Helping keep prices higher in morning trading was a fall in May factory orders, which slid 0.7% - a steeper decline than analysts were expecting. It follows a revised 1.4-per cent increase in orders for April. In Europe, GERMAN BUNDS led the way, with the September bund breaking through the 102 barrier.

718,224.0,1999-02-04,"The Federal Reserve's key policymaking committee left short-term interest rates unchanged at the end of a two-day meeting yesterday. The decision by the federal open market committee to leave the Fed funds target rate at 4.75% was widely expected but came amid growing concerns among policymakers about the continuing frenetic pace of US growth. The central bank cut the Fed funds rate by 0.75 percentage points last autumn in three rapid-fire changes in response to international and domestic financial turmoil. Alan Greenspan, the Fed chairman, argued the rate cuts were necessary to prevent significant dislocations in financial markets and a possible sharp slowdown in growth. But since the last rate cut in November, the economy has actually accelerated - output growth in the fourth quarter of last year hit a two-year high of 5.6% at an annualised rate. The rate cuts also seemed to have imparted a new momentum to stock prices - broad measures of equity prices have risen by about 10% since the November meeting. A number of FOMC members have already expressed concerns about the strength of the economy and the stock market. The surge in equity prices and an explosion of money supply since that meeting have heightened concerns that domestic imbalances in the economy are growing. At their last meeting in December, committee members voted not to change rates. Yesterday's decision to leave rates unchanged again indicates the clear majority of committee members remain confident that, in spite of the strong growth signals, the US still faces few inflationary pressures. Even as growth accelerated at the end of last year, the broadest measure of inflation fell to its lowest annual rate for 40 years. But financial markets will be on the alert for any signs that members may have agreed to shift their policy stance at yesterday's meeting. When it cut rates in November the committee moved to a neutral stance, having previously been biased towards easing. If committee members voted yesterday to shift to a tightening bias, it may indicate a rise in interest rates could come soon. The committee's decision on the policy stance yesterday will not be made public formally until after the next meeting in March, but members are expected to give hints in the next few weeks about which way the Fed is now leaning.

720,226.0,1999-02-04,"Wall Street shrugged off a cautious morning to send leading shares higher in early afternoon trading, ahead of the Federal open market committee's announcement that interest rates would not be changing this month, writes John Labate in New York. The breadth of the day's buying was focused on key stocks, with the number of advancing shares only slightly ahead of declining ones on the New York stock exchange. The main indices were higher, however, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average up 50.72 or 0.6% at 9,324.84 and the Standard &Poor's 500 index climbing 4.29 to 1,266.28. The Nasdaq composite index, weighted in high-tech shares, was 15.69 higher at 2,479.11. US bonds traded higher as well after the Treasury announced plans to auction $35bn in notes and bonds next week. By early afternoon, the benchmark 30-year bond was 1/4 higher at 100 5/16, sending the yield down to 5.229%. Among Dow stocks, Goodyear Tire and Rubber gained $1 5/8 to $51 7/8 after the company confirmed reports that it would enter an alliance with Sumitomo Rubber Industries of Japan. Boeing was also higher in early trading, gaining $1 3/16 to $35 3/8. Among declining stocks, Minnesota Mining &Manufacturing lost $2 to $73 7/8 and Union Carbide fell $15/16 to $38 5/8. Online trading stocks were mixed, with E*Trade down $2 3/16 to $56 1/16 after the company confirmed it had experienced an outage for one and a quarter hours during the morning. A company spokesperson said the problem had been resolved soon after. Rival Ameritrade Holdings was up $11 3/4 to $122 1/16. Shares of Patriot American Hospitality were $7/16 or 8.6% higher at $5 1/2 after a report that the company was in talks with Hilton Hotels. Hilton was down $1/8 to $14 1/4. In the brokerage sector Morgan Stanley Dean Witter was more than 4% or $4 5/16 higher to 93 1/2 on speculation that the company was in takeover talks with banker Chase Manhattan. Perot Systems, the information technology company led by Ross Perot, gained $16 1/2 to $59 a day after its initial public offering at $16 a share. TORONTO added to Tuesday's declines in early trading with a shakeout among gold stocks mostly dictating direction. The 300 composite index at noon was off 13.28 at 6,670.50 in below average volumes. A soft start for the bullion price overshadowed golds and sector leaders pushed lower from the opening bell. Barrick fell 75 cents to C$29.15 and Placer Dome came off 35 cents at C$17.45. Banks were mixed. Royal Bank of Canada shed 65 cents at C$78.35 and Bank of Nova Scotia 40 cents at C$32.50. Toronto-Dominion Bank, in contrast, improved C$1.15 to C$65 while Canadian Imperial added 15 cents at C$38.35. Paper stocks made a weak start with Domtar off 15 cents at C$8.85 and MacMillan-Bloedel slipping 40 cents to C$14.90. In telecoms, BCE hardened 20 cents to C$65.70.

721,227.0,1999-02-04,"European markets were lower yesterday while US Treasuries were mixed in early afternoon trading as the Federal Open Market Committee decided to leave interest rates unchanged despite strong economic growth. The benchmark 30-year bond was 3/32 higher at 100 5/32, sending the yield lower to 5.239%. The 10-year note fell 1/32 to 99 9/16, yielding 4.806% and the two-year note was unchanged at 99 5/8, yielding 4.7%. Analysts said the Fed fought shy of a sudden change in interest rates, given the fragile state of emerging markets. The US Treasury caught traders by surprise, saying it would auction $35bn of notes and bonds next week. The Treasury said it would auction $15bn in five-year notes, $10bn in 9 3/4 - year notes, and $10bn in 30-year notes. ""They are concerned that trading in the 10-year note has become scarce in the repo market, so they want to alleviate that by reopening the 10-year note,"" said Kevin Logan, senior market economist at Dresdner, Kleinwort Benson in New York. The Treasury decided to issue a new bond rather than reopen the current 30-year and said two-and 30-year auctions may become less frequent. European bond markets sold off in expectation of today's meeting of the European Central Bank, which will determine interest rates in the euro-zone. Most analysts doubt the ECB will cut interest rates. David Knott, at Deutsche Bank, said the markets had been too optimistic by pricing in two interest rate cuts by September. Germany's 10-year bond future fell through the 117 level, closing 0.44 down at 116.75. UK gilts took their cue from euro-zone countries. The 10-year gilt future dropped 0.46 closing at 119.43. Most observers expect the Monetary Policy Committee to cut interest rates by 25 basis points. Yields on Japanese government bonds continued to climb but at a slower pace. The yield on the benchmark 10-year 203 bond rose slightly to 2.335%. Mr Knott argued that provided short-term interest rates stayed unchanged at 0.5% and acted as an ""anchor"" to the yield curve, 10-year JGB yields were unlikely to rise much higher. He likened Japan to the US in 1993, when the Federal Reserve lowered interest rates and let the curve steepen. This allowed US banks to recapitalise by borrowing short-term money at low rates and lending it longer term at higher rates. Copyright Financial Times Limited 1999. All Rights Reserved.

722,228.0,1998-04-01,"The June FTSE 100 future spent much of the day trading sideways but received a powerful push from Wall Street just before the close, writes Martin Brice. June had opened at 5,960, which was 53 points above the cash market with fair value variously estimated at a premium of between 63 and 69 points. June edged up to the 5,974 region, before easing to the 5,955 area before 9.30am, and these levels were to set the restrained tone for trading during much of the day. The FOMC meeting in the US and the continued strength of sterling tended to encourage this restrained tone, and suggestions from trading in the S&P futures that the US market would move ahead just a few points tended to reinforce caution. June touched the low of the day, 5,933, ahead of the US opening, but in the event Wall Street was stronger than anticipated and the contract found a spring in its step. The one-hour shift in UK time left just 40 minutes of pit trading between the US opening and settlement, which was at 5,967. After-hours electronic trading saw June reach 6,008.

723,229.0,1998-04-01,"A strong dollar and window dressing at the end of the first quarter sent ZURICH back into record territory, although analysts cautioned the market looked increasingly overbought and a correction remained on the cards. The SMI index rose 49.2 to 7,585.5, eclipsing the previous peak set last Friday. Exporters gaining from the firmer dollar included Novartis. It jumped SwFr 36 to SwFr 2,710 and was was also recommended by Zurich Kantonalbank as a trading buy. Roche certificates added SwFr 150 to SwFr 16,500, still recovering from last week's losses, and Ems Chemie, SwFr 80 higher at SwFr 7,995. Nestle jumped SwFr 31 to SwFr 2,913 as CSFB reiterated its buy recommendation and raised its 1998 earnings estimates. It was the turn of CS Group to outperform the financial sector with a rise of SwFr 4.50 to SwFr 305. SAir Group, which on Monday said it was cautiously optimistic about 1998 prospects, rose SwFr 22 to SFDr2,129. Food company Hero, which said it expected higher 1998 profit, rose SwFr 15 to SwFr 965. PARIS, too, rallied to a fresh closing high in spite of a mixed reaction to the Opec agreement to reduce oil production. Total lost FFr 11 to FFr 744, but Elf, which announced a boost to its reserves with 15 new offshore blocks in the Gulf of Mexico, was marked FFr 11 higher at FFr 812. Elsewhere, Eridania Beghin-Say, the Franco-Italian food group, rose FFr 42 or 3.5% to FFr 1,240 after announcing net profit for 1997 at the top end of analysts' forecasts. Retailer Pinault-Printemps surged FFr 370 or 8.4% as the group denied more market rumours it was planning to sell its Printemps department stores. A FFr 21.10 or 4.6% rise in Schneider to FFr 477 was attributed to its relatively high proportion of dollar earnings. Bouygues rose FFr 35 to FFr 1,080 ahead of its results announcement expected after the market's close. AGF gave up FFr 4.30 to FFr 348.70 on profit-taking. Analysts said that the share was overbought on Monday after a series of recent broker upgrades. The CAC-40 index closed with a gain of 75.58 at 3,875.81. MILAN was supported by a switch out of bonds into equities and the benchmark Mibtel index reached a fresh high. The index rose 280 or 1.2% to 24,583, with banking shares stronger. Credit Italiano rose L315 to L9,045 after the release of its 1997 earnings, while Banca Intesa added L892 to L11,376. FRANKFURT kept the motor stocks firmly in its headlights on a day in which the broad market managed only a modest advance. The Xetra Dax index was just 27.36 higher at the close of electronic trade at 5,097.25, with investors reluctant to commit fresh funds ahead of the US Federal open market committee. BMW dropped DM 67.50 to DM 2,050.95 in the wake of 1997 and first quarter results, with the carmaker's plans to take over Rolls-Royce Motor Cars still weighing on its shares. Analysts said that while the results were mostly in line with expectations, news that an overvalued pound had significantly hurt results in its Rover division caused some concern. Volkswagen, which declined to comment on reports that it might raise its offer for the UK luxury carmaker, fell DM 34 to DM 1,425. AMSTERDAM was hit by profit-taking in low-volume trade and the AEX index lost 2.57 to 1,126.43. Concerns of oil price volatility hurt Royal Dutch. The group, which owns 60% of Royal Dutch Shell, lost Fl 1.20 to Fl 118. Grolsch, the brewer, was supported by speculation the company could become a takeover target, and rose Fl 4.30 to Fl 59.80. Tulip, the computer maker, plunged Fl 2.10 to Fl 5.10 on reports that it was seeking state aid. MADRID edged marginally higher in spite of weakness in Telefonica. The general index rose 1.08 to 888.67 as Telefonica, which lost Pta100 to Pta6,920, wiped out strength in banks and utilities. Argentaria rose Pta100 to Pta13,000, while Popular gained Pta250 to Pta15,150. ATHENS pulled back as foreign investors took to the sidelines and local funds unloaded stock after the market's spectacular run. The general index, up almost 50% since February 26, dropped 78.07 or 3.8% to 2,005.82. Cement stocks were marked down as ABN Amro recommended Titan and Heracles General, saying that they would continue to outperform the market. Sustained growth in cement demand and the shift from exports to domestic sales would result in a further widening of their operating margins. Titan lost Dr1,717 to Dr23,360 and Heracles was off Dr490 at Dr7,510. COPENHAGEN finished at a record high, fuelled by solid gains for selected stocks in an otherwise mixed market. The KFX top 20 index rose 1.96 to 244.86. A government pledge to close a corporate tax loophole which has allowed some financials to reduce their tax burden hit Den Danske Bank, DKr4 down at DKr921, Tryg-Baltica, which lost DKr18 to DKr554, and Cowdan, which gave up DKr4 to DKr1,250.

Airline stocks made steady advances as UAL, parent to United Airlines, gained $2 1/4 to $92 and AMR shot up $3 1/16 to $142 1/8. Federal Express rose $2 1/2 to $70 3/4. Bond prices also moved higher after the release of the Chicago purchasing managers report. Although the report showed a rise in economic activity, especially in employment and shipments, the closely watched prices-paid component was sharply lower, suggesting that inflation remains well contained. By midday the price of the benchmark 30-year bond was 7/16 higher at 102 15/32, sending the yield to 5.946%. Banking and other financial shares rose as bond prices rallied in morning trade. The Philadelphia Stock Exchange's banking index shot up 18.92 or 2.3% to 852.52. Citicorp gained $3 5/16 to $143, while Bank of New York rose $2 3/8 to $63 3/16.

The Nasdaq composite was up 18.04 or 0.99% to 1,836.74, and the Russell 2000 index climbed 3.18 higher to 479.42. Semiconductor shares were especially strong.

726,232.0,1998-04-01,"A last-minute injection of public funds into the futures market boosted share prices in TOKYO on the last day of trading for the fiscal year, writes Michiyo Nakamoto. However, the Nikkei 225 index ended far short of the 18,000 level, widely regarded as an important benchmark. The Nikkei traded erratically throughout the day. On the positive side was the expectation that public funds would come in to support stock prices. A comment by the head of the government's tax commission calling for tax cuts of Y 10,000bn also spurred positive sentiment. Purchases by public funds were noticed towards the end of the session in the futures market, which triggered arbitrage buying in the cash market. Post office funds reportedly handed Y 971.2bn to trust banks to invest in the stock market. At the same time, however, substantial selling came from financial institutions reducing their cross-shareholdings at the year-end. After a turbulent session, in which the Nikkei moved between a low of 116,178.22 and a high of 16,584.62, the index closed 246.13 higher at 16,527.17. Volume rose to 650m shares, up from 395m on Monday. Winners outnumbered losers 678 to 477 with 103 issues unchanged. The Topix index rose 10.43 to 1,251.70. Nippon Steel gained Y 1 to Y 214 on news that it would use reserves to buy back up to 150m of its own shares, valued at about Y 32bn. The yen's persistent weakness supported exporters such as Honda, which gained Y 180 to Y 4,800. MANILA lost 1.6% as investors became cautious following a drop in Asian currencies and ahead of the US Federal open market committee meeting. The composite index fell 35.38 to 2,238.42, also under pressure from profit-taking in some issues that have done particularly well recently. Among blue chips, PLDT lost 15 pesos to 1,055 pesos and Ayala Land slipped 50 centavos to 18.25 pesos. The heavily traded Metro Pacific fell 6 centavos to 2.34 pesos after it denied rumours of a possible merger between its telephone business, Smart Communications, and Pilipino Telephone. BANGKOK traded lower as investors unloaded bank and finance issues after the central bank tightened rules on loans for local banks that are likely to force them to raise their capital. The SET composite index was marked down for the sixth straight trading day, losing 5.98 or 1.3% to 459.11. Analysts said sentiment was weak even before the government's announcement, after Moody's lowered the long-term subordinated debt ratings and financial strength ratings of the country's five largest banks. That outweighed comments by Mark Mobius, who runs the $15bn emerging markets fund of US financial group, Templeton Worldwide, that large, well-capitalised Thai and Indonesian banks could be big winners from the Asian financial crisis. Bangkok Bank fell Bt3.50 to Bt81.50 and Thai Farmers Bank Bt2 to Bt75.50. SINGAPORE saw late selling after SIA dismissed speculation that it was about to announce plans to merge its foreign and local share tranches. SIA originally said a decision would be made by the end of March and rumours of a briefing led traders to believe that a merger announcement was imminent.

727,233.0,1998-04-01,"Prices ended mixed yesterday as investors awaited the outcome of a meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee, which sets US interest rate policy. Although no rate rise was expected, there was an air of caution about whether the Fed would shift its bias towards higher rates. European markets were also interest rate-sensitive after Luis Angel Rojo, governor of the Bank of Spain, seemed to signal that further cuts in rates would come at a slower pace than expected because the country's economic growth was so strong. Mr Rojo did not rule out further cuts, and the Spanish central bank is still expected to ease its money market rates in the next few weeks because of continued good inflation figures and European monetary union factors. Analysts said, however, that the prospect of no rate cut in Spain this week would hit hopes that Italian rates would also come down. ""Some central bank governors clearly do not want to be rushed into cutting rates while they are still keeping inflation in check. Given the strength of the Spanish economy and potential inflation, there are serious doubts whether Spanish interest rates should be cut now,"" said Jeremy Hawkins, at Bank of America. Mr Rojo's comments hit SPANISH BONOS, which under-performed other European markets in fairly active trading, with the short end taking the brunt. The June future settled unchanged at 108.82 with 105,000 contracts exchanged. The future had been as low as 108.55 but recovered when European markets perked up after the US posted good early gains. ITALIAN BTPs were also undermined in quiet trading but closed well above the day's lows. The June future settled at 119.11, up 0.02, with 55,000 contracts changing hands, while in the cash market the yield spread over 10-year bunds ended at 28 basis points. GERMAN BUNDS were range-bound, with investors awaiting results from the FOMC meeting, but they later firmed with Treasuries on the back of more US figures confirming the lack of inflation in the economy. The June future settled 0.10 higher in London at 107.30, while in Frankfurt turnover was active at 350,000 contracts. UK GILTS were better, outperforming bunds as sterling continued to soar - it climbed above DM 3.10 early in the day before falling back. Analysts said the outlook for gilts in the context of the strong pound was good, because the possibility of another interest rate rise was minimised. The June gilt future settled 11/32 higher at 108 3/16 with 80,000 contracts traded on Liffe by early evening, while the spread over 10-year bunds contracted sharply to 106 basis points. US TREASURIES were higher in morning trading. By early afternoon the benchmark 30-year bond had gained 1/2 to 102 17/32, sending the yield lower to 5.942%. The two-year note rose 1/16 to 99, yielding 5.600%, while the 10-year note gained 9/32 to 98, yielding 5.670%. Despite expectations that the Fed will not raise rates in the near term, the market has been weaker in recent weeks as the latest economic data have failed to show evidence of economic slowdown. A report by the Chicago Purchasing Managers yesterday continued to point to robust growth. The Chicago business barometer rose to 59.5 in March, from 57.8 in February, but the bond market focused on the prices paid component. Prices paid dipped to 48.7 from 55.5. ""The bond market was thrilled to see signs of disinflation in this morning's Chicago report,"" said Patrick Dimick, treasury market analyst at UBS Securities. * The UK debt management office takes over responsibility for gilt market operations today from the Bank of England.

728,234.0,2000-11-16,"The euro, after three days of plain sailing, returns to the spotlight today as the European Central Bank makes its fortnightly rate decision. The European currency kept a low profile yesterday as the market waited for the Federal Open Market Committee to comment on its monetary policy bias. It did, however, capitalise briefly on confusion in Asian trade. A Japanese news agency reported that Lawrence Lindsey, advisor to George W. Bush, had told Japanese politicians that a Bush government could seek a weaker dollar to help curb the current account deficit. A senior spokesman for the Bush campaign subsequently denied the account, saying: ""A Japanese politician is misattributing what Mr Lindsey said. Mr Lindsey has been consistent and unequivocal in saying that Governor Bush would continue to pursue a strong dollar policy."" The dollar climbed steadily against the yen, from below Y108.00 to a peak of around Y108.80. Traders identified some short-term speculative selling of the yen on the hope that Japan's political situation would deteriorate further, putting pressure on the currency. But some think the importance of the political situation is being overstated. ""I think the market is rather clutching at straws,"" said Paul Meggyesi, senior currency strategist at Deutsche Bank. ""It seems a little too neat to reason that if Prime Minister Yoshiro Mori is replaced he might be succeeded by a more reform-minded personality who would pursue a less expansionary fiscal policy, which would inhibit growth and therefore weaken the currency. ""Fiscal consolidation is necessary, but it can't happen without growth. It is likely to follow only once the recovery is assured."" A simpler explanation might be that yen carry trades are simply becoming more attractive because of the low volatility of the yen, in other words people can borrow cheaply in yen and invest in dollars. And this means more short-term selling of the yen. * Sterling weakened against the dollar as UK unemployment was shown to have risen for the first time in two years. The October jobless count rose by 3,500, supporting the view that UK interest rates had peaked. Headline earnings growth rose slightly from 4.0 to 4.1 per cent, but this remained below the 4.5 per cent threshold that the Bank of England deems consistent with its inflation target. Late in London the pound was trading at $1.4260 against the dollar, after a low of $1.4229. The euro peaked at #0.6040 against sterling, slipping back to around $0.6010 in late trade. * Like the euro, the ailing Australian dollar has been receiving some support from the threat of currency market intervention by the Reserve Bank of Australia. The bank confirmed in its semi-annual statement this week that it had been in the market several times in recent weeks to reinforce what it identified as an emerging trend towards stability. The Australian dollar, which has been struggling since last week, staged a brief half-cent rally as intervention rumours hit the market, but fell close to record lows as they proved groundless. Critics of the RBA's intervention policy argue that the bank is fighting against deteriorating fundamentals. They point to signs of weakening domestic growth against a backdrop of lower global growth prospects. This would imply both reduced demand for Australian exports in the key Asian region, and negative price effects as commodity prices decline. Some argue that the impact of the intervention is limited by the fact that the RBA's foreign exchange reserves are relatively modest. The market knows that the bank's capacity to wage a prolonged or heavy intervention campaign is limited. Late in London the Australian dollar was $0.520 against the US dollar, after a low of $0.518. It fell to a record of $0.511 last month. ",CURRENCIES &MONEY - Forex market waits for ECB decision.,2000-11-15,The Financial Times
729,235.0,2009-01-29,"Policy statement The Federal Reserve has grown more concerned about the outlook for the economy and the risk of deflation - and it is inclined to fight those dangers by expanding targeted credit operations rather than purchasing Treasury securities. However, Treasury purchases remain under active consideration and could be implemented quickly in -certain circumstances. Those were the key messages from yesterday's statement by the Federal Open Market Committee, which kept interest rates on hold at virtually zero. The Fed said that since its December policy meeting the economy ""has weakened -further"". In addition to a pull-back in spending by US consumers and businesses, ""global demand appears to be slowing significantly"". While the Fed expected a gradual recovery to begin ""later this year"", the risks of that not happening were ""significant"". The downgrade to the outlook implicitly extends the period for which the Fed would expect to keep interest rates near zero. Moreover, policymakers added two new references that acknowledged the risk of deflation and its close cousin: uncomfortably low inflation. ""The committee sees some risk that inflation could persist for a time below rates that best foster economic growth and price stability in the longer term."" With interest rates at virtually zero, the strategic choice for the Fed is whether to combat risks by expanding targeted credit operations that aim to revitalise specific markets for credit or else by buying long-term US Treasuries. Both options could bring down private borrowing costs - the first directly, by reducing risk premiums in dysfunctional markets, the second indirectly, by lowering benchmark risk-free rates. Fed officials have differing views on the relative merits of those approaches and that debate is likely to have dominated the meeting. In the end, the FOMC appears to have taken the view that targeted credit operations offer the most bang for the buck, though that assessment could change. The Fed said it would ""assess whether expansions or modifications to lending facilities would serve to further support credit markets"". That looks like code for beefing up the term asset-backed securities loan facility (Talf), which provides low-cost finance for investors willing to buy consumer loans bundled up as securities, and potentially using this model to support commercial mortgage-backed securities and municipal bonds as well. The US central bank also held out the possibility of extending its purchases of mortgage-backed securities issued by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, running at the rate of $300bn (€228bn, £211bn) a quarter, to keep mortgage rates low. The Fed said it was ""prepared"" to buy Treasuries ""if evolving circumstances indicate that such transactions would be particularly effective in improving conditions in private credit markets"". Some analysts saw that as hinting it would intervene if Treasury yields moved dramatically higher and pushed up private loan rates. The decision to emphasise targeted credit operations rather than Treasury purchases split the committee, with Jeffrey Lacker, the president of the Richmond Fed, voting against. The statement said he ""preferred to expand the monetary base at this time by purchasing US Treasury securities rather than through targeted credit programmes"". The Fed announced no new programmes. That is not surprising, since lending decisions are formally made by the Washington-based Fed board rather than the full FOMC. In these circumstances, the FOMC sets the overall strategic direction for the Fed but may not provide the occasion for new announcements.",Fed puts faith in targeted credit action,2009-01-28,The Financial Times
730,236.0,2009-01-29,"Is the Federal Reserve calling the Treasury market's bluff - or is the central bank's open market committee seeing divisions between its members? Marc Ostwald, fixed income strategist at Monument Securities, believes there is an element of brinkmanship in the FOMC's latest policy statement, in which it said it was prepared to buy Treasury bonds if it would help improve financial market conditions. ""One could conclude that they hoped that their commitment to buy Treasuries if necessary might drive down Treasury yields in so far as it is effectively a back-stop bid,"" Mr Ostwald says. But he also suggests the statement hints at divisions on the committee about the merits of buying Treasuries. ""Some on the committee may still need to be persuaded, while others may be worried about the ongoing lack of any obvious exit strategy - and, by extension, that current measures are digging an ever bigger hole from which the Fed will find it harder to extract itself from."" Mr Ostwald says the Fed will also be monitoring the progress of the rollover of the commercial paper funding facility, which will arguably offer the clearest signals on whether there has been any genuine easing in credit conditions. ""If the vast majority of the CPFF is rolled over with the Fed rather than in the open/interbank market, then this would signal that credit market strains have not really eased materially.""",View of the Day: Divisions at the Fed?,2009-01-28,The Financial Times
731,237.0,2007-02-01,"There was slightly more worrying news on the growth front when the Institute for Supply Management's manufacturing index unexpectedly fell to 49.3, below the 50 level that divides expansion from contraction, and its lowest since April 2003.  James Knightley at ING noted that there had now been two sub-50 readings on the ISM in the space of three months. ""The rate doves will seize on the fact that whenever we have had a sub-50 ISM reading in the past 30 years or so, the Fed has cut interest rates within around six months,"" he said.  But he added that much broader weakness in the US economy would need to be seen in order to get the Fed in the frame of mind to lower borrowing costs.  Stephen Lewis, chief economist at Insinger de Beaufort, said the US central bank was now likely to be satisfied that 5.25 per cent represented funds rate neutrality. He noted that when the market harbours neutral rate expectations, the two-year Treasury bond yield hovers a few basis points above the federal funds rate. But, the yield is currently about 30 basis points below Fed  funds. ""A significant 'hope factor' is still built into the bond market's expectations, which is not warranted on the basis of the FOMC's statement,"" he said.  Treasuries initially pushed higher after the inflation and ISM data. But the rally ran out of steam following the release of strong data on pending home sales.  The dollar briefly came under pressure from the weak ISM data but recovered as investors positioned themselves for today's crucial US employment report.  Equity markets largely took the data flood in their stride. By early afternoon in New York, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 0.10 per cent, after earlier setting a fresh all-time high of 12,667.03. The S&P 500 was up 0.26 per cent and the Nasdaq Composite was 0.02 per cent higher.  Europe put in an even stronger performance, with heavily-weighted oil and mining stocks providing much of the impetus. The FTSE Eurofirst 300 index rose 1.02 per cent to a six-year high, while the FTSE 100 in London outperformed with a 1.3 per cent advance. Unusually, not a single FTSE 100 stock fell in price.  In Asia, the Nikkei 225 in Tokyo climbed 0.8 per cent to a nine-month peak, Hong Kong rallied 1.6 per cent and there were record highs for Sydney and Singapore.  Oil prices retreated after two days of strong gains, with the benchmark US crude future slipping back below $58 a barrel.  European and Asian equity markets responded strongly to reassuring comments on the US economy from the Federal Reserve on Wednesday, although Wall Street was more subdued as investors digested another barrage of mixed economic data.  The US central bank said the economy was ""somewhat firmer"" and that inflation readings had ""improved modestly"" as it announced its decision to leave interest rates unchanged at 5.25 per cent.  A tame reading yesterday for the December PCE core price deflator - the Fed's favoured inflation indicator - backed up the Fed's relatively optimistic view on pricing pressures.

733,239.0,2007-02-01,"The Federal Reserve yesterday signalled growing confidence that the economy was heading for a soft landing, triggering a broad rally in the stock market.  The statement issued at the end of the Fed's January policy meeting - which kept interest rates on hold at 5.25 per cent - for the first time raised the possibility that the US housing market could be bottoming out.  At the same time, it cited progress on inflation, noting ""readings on core inflation have improved modestly in recent months"".  These comments suggest that the Fed is growing comfortable with the outlook for both growth and inflation.  The Fed's encouraging words came after figures showed the US economy grew at an above-trend rate of 3.5 per cent in the fourth quarter, while inflation and wage growth moderated. Consumer spending grew at a blistering rate, while growth was also supported by a surge in US exports.  Stocks and bonds rose in response to the Fed's outlook. The Dow Jones Industrial Average set a record high in afternoon trading, before closing up 0.8 per cent at 12,621.69. Bond prices rallied, with 10-year yields ending the day nearly 5 basis points lower at 4.83 per cent. The dollar slipped against the euro and the yen, while interest rate futures were broadly unchanged.  The Fed acknowledged the strong economic data in its statement, noting that growth looked ""somewhat firmer"" than it did at the time of the last meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee in October.  However, the Fed hinted that its views on growth had not changed very dramatically since the October meeting.  It cited only ""tentative"" signs that housing might be stabilising and altered only slightly its description of how growth was likely to evolve this year.  The Fed said it expected the economy to expand at a ""moderate pace over coming quarters"" - the same phrase it used in October. This implies that policymakers think the pace of growth will slow from the fourth quarter to the first as the effect of lower oil prices, higher stock prices and mild weather in late 2006 fades.  Yesterday's figures showed gross domestic product rose 3.5 per cent in the last three months of 2006 after a gain of 2 per cent in the previous quarter, while the rate of increase in core prices slowed to 2.1 per cent from 2.2 per cent.  The expansion was led by a 4.4 per cent increase in personal consumption, which showed that Americans continued to spend, in spite of the slowdown in housing.  Exports were also exceptionally strong, rising 10 per cent, compared with an increase of 6.8 per cent in the third period.  Drew Mathus, an economist at Lehman Brothers, said: ""The strong growth shows us that 2006 ended with a bang. It also tells us that the first quarter is not likely to be exceptionally weak.""

It said economic growth was ""somewhat firmer"", helped by ""stabilisation"" in the housing market, while readings on core inflation had ""improved modestly"". Nonetheless, the committee still sounded its familiar note of caution, saying inflation risks remain.  Richmond Fed president Jeffrey Lacker, a dissenter in recent FOMC meetings, has rotated out of voting status, and yesterday's vote was unanimous.

But later figures showed that business activity in the US Midwest contracted in January. Chicago's purchasing managers' index had its lowest reading since April 2003.  Shortly after the release of the statement, the yield on the 10-year Treasury was down 3.3 basis points to 4.843 per cent, while the two-year yield was down 2.9bp at 4.946 per cent.  European government bonds largely tracked the movements in the US Treasury market after finding little direction from mixed eurozone economic data.  In late trading in London, the 10-year Bund was yielding 4.099 per cent, down 0.4bp. The yield on the two-year Schatz was down 0.3bp at 3.958 per cent.  UK gilt prices were mixed, with the yield on the 10-year gilt down 1.1bp to 4.979 per cent and the yield on the two-year up 0.2bp to 5.483 per cent.  Prices rose on Japanese government bonds on news of a fall in wage earners' cash earnings. The figures highlighted companies' reluctance to raise salaries, despite record profits.

This gathered momentum, as UK PSBR data was in line with market expectations, and by late morning, December was trading at 3,996, the peak of the day. Fears of a poor opening in New York, along with some nervousness ahead of the Federal Reserve meeting, saw December surrender some of its earlier gains.

739,245.0,1996-12-18,"A revival of takeover talk at Commerzbank lifted FRANKFURT comfortably off its worst levels of the day. Number three in the German banking league, Commerzbank pushed ahead against the trend as speculation ranged from the possibility of an outright bid for the bank or a strategic acquisition by Commerzbank itself. It was an old story but it brushed up fresh enough to lift the shares by 34 pfg to DM 38.44. Some dealers said that a single big buy order explained the rise. Otherwise traders spent the session tracking Wall Street and positioning themselves ahead of Friday's options and futures expiry for Dax contracts Deutsche Bank closed off DM 1.22 at DM 71.19 and Dresdner Bank ended down 33 pfg at DM 48.83. Volkswagen lost DM 3.70 to DM 608.30. Thyssen shed DM 3 to DM 270. Rumours of management changes left SAP DM 6.90 lower at DM 202.50. At the close, the Dax index was 32.66 lower at an Ibis-indicated 2,808.50. PARIS had a volatile session, recovering strongly from early losses on the news of official rate cuts but finally ending with the CAC 40 index off 28.87 or 1.3% at 2,193.70. Dealers said that turnover was dull with investors uncertain about direction and many holding off the market as the Bank of France spelt out its monetary policy targets. The interest rate moves met with a mixed reaction, as Axa hardened slightly but most financials lost ground. Axa added FFr 2.60 to FFr 304.8. Bancaire came off FFr 13 to FFr 565 and Suez shed FFr 3.50 to FFr 211. Paribas ended down FFr 5.10 at FFr 339. LVMH dipped FFr 25 to FFr 1,243 in spite of a Japanese decision to reduce whisky sales taxes. Dealers said that worries about the group's DFS purchase held sentiment in check. Among second liners, Groupe Andre, the shoe retailer, added FFr 1.60 to FFr 398.6 after announcing a financial restructuring plan. Usinor-Sacilor, something of a high flyer lately on the back of CAC 40 inclusion hopes, came off FFr 1.30 to FFr 76. AMSTERDAM took its cue from a dull bond market and moved lower in subdued volume. The AEX index unwound most of Monday's gains, ending off 3.18 at 612.94. Fortis Amev, the previous day's best performer, turned tail with a decline of Fl 1.20 or more than 2% to DFl 56.80. ABN-Amro dipped Fl 1.60 to Fl 106.3. Forecasts of an oil price drop to $16 a barrel next year from Royal Dutch sent the shares down by 10 cents to Fl 288.40. News of fare hikes at both the airline and its cargo offshoot depressed KLM by 10 cents to Fl 47.10. Philips came off 10 cents to Fl 68. KNP BT was the day's sharpest decline, tumbling Fl 1.70 or 4.6% to Fl 35.30. ZURICH put Ciba and Sandoz in the spotlight as the companies called a news conference about their planned merger to become Novartis. However, the pair turned back from their best levels after they confirmed that the US Federal Trade Commission had conditionally approved the merger. The two companiesinsisted that the conditions left their innovative potential intact.<Ciba finished SwFr 2 weaker at SwFr 1,625, off a high of SwFr 1,649, while Sandoz turned back from SwFr 1,540 to finish SwFr 4 weaker at SwFr 1,525. The new Novartis shares are to begin trading on December 23. The broad market edged lower, with many investors sidelined ahead of the FOMC meeting. The SMI index lost 19.8 to 3,850.4. Baloise fell SwFr 115 to SwFr 2,760 when trading resumed after a suspension due to the insurer's announcement that it planned a share split and a capital payout, rather than a dividend, on 1996 results. Swissair added to Monday's SwFr 38 jump, with another rise of SwFr 14, taking the shares to SwFr 1,069 on expectations that tomorrow's press conference would bring news of a plan to separate some of the company's profitable catering operations from its airline operations. STOCKHOLM featured a 3.6% fall in Scania, the truck maker, after its announcement, late on Monday, that its production in the first quarter of 1997 would be cut. The shares lost SKr6 to SKr162. Scania said that it would cut production by about 15% in Europe to balance delivery delays caused by the French truckers' strike in November. The company added that the dispute hit sales and earnings which could have an adverse impact on results in the current quarter. The Affaersvaerlden general index was down 25.4 at 2,290.0. Stadshypotek eased SKr1.5 to SKr186.5 after the board decided to recommend to shareholders the acceptance of Svenska Handelsbanken's bid. Handelsbanken was SKr5 down at SKr190. ISTANBUL rebounded 3.7%, wiping out Monday's 2.4% fall which followed Standard &Poor's downgrading of the country's long-term foreign currency rating. The IMBK-100 index picked up 3,239.00 to close at a day's high of 90,395.96 on selective buying fuelled by a limited cash influx. One analyst said that the recovery came as investors realised that the S&P action did not affect other instruments and that Monday's early 5.5% plunge had been an overreaction. OSLO fell 1.4%, unnerved by the overnight fall on Wall Street and yesterday's US economic data. The total index finished 13.17 down at 920.03. Analysts noted, however, that the market was likely to see a cash inflow in coming weeks under regulations which give investors tax breaks if they invest in the stock market around new year. BRUSSELS ended lower with a big fall for the Bekaert wire rope group unsettling sentiment. Bekaert lost BFr 3,075 to BFr 19,825 following a profits warning. The BFX index closed 111.16 lower at 1,849.03. Written and edited by Michael Morgan and Jeffrey Brown Copyright Financial Times Limited 1996. All Rights Reserved. Not Available for Re-dissemination. ",TAKEOVER TALK LIFTS FRANKFURT FROM TROUGH.,1996-12-17,The Financial Times
740,246.0,1996-12-18,"Further nervous selling took SEOUL down for a fifth consecutive session and left the composite index 10.57 weaker at 663.35, at its lowest level for almost 45 months. Analysts who warned that the index could fall as low as 620 points before a floor was found, said that the uncertain economic outlook, high interest rates and a floundering currency had made the stock market an unattractive proposition for many investors, especially foreigners. They added that investors were particularly uninspired by the government's recent market boosting measures. Some buying emerged in late trading for banks and securities shares on the view that they had been oversold. Commercial Bank of Korea rose Won180 to Won5,180 and Kookmin Bank gained Won200 to Won11,300. Daewoo Securities rose Won300 to Won11,000. TOKYO finished flat after early losses were mostly offset by fresh buying and short-covering in recently hard hit sectors such as construction and banking, agencies report. The Nikkei 225 average finished 8.58 lower at 20,413.46, after a high of 20,500.90 and a low of 20,230.88. Its March futures fell 10 to 20,410. Conversely, the broader Topix index rose 3.44 to 1,515.42, prompting the view that most weak sectors had now bottomed out. The Nikkei 300 average gained 0.78 to 287.42. Volume on the first section of the TSE was a moderate 341m shares, compared with 266m shares on Monday. Declining issues outnumbered advancers 628 to 430, while 200 issues were unchanged. In London, the ISE/Nikkei 50 index fell 2.00 to 1444.97. Losing sectors were led by insurance, rubber, miscellaneous manufacturing, land transport and gas. Gainers were led by railway/bus, banks, oil, construction and warehousing. Shares in Japan's non-life insurers lost out for a second consecutive day. The biggest loser was Tokio Marine, down Y 50 at 1,070, while Mitsui Marine fell Y 26 to Y 608 and Yasuda Fire lost Y 23 at Y 620. Renewed foreign demand supported the banks. Daiwa Bank jumped Y 25 to Y 637 while Sumitomo Bank and Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank each rose Y 50 to Y 1,840 Y 50 and Y 1,770 respectively. In the new, second section of the over-the-counter market, ATL Systems made a solid debut. The shares, with a subscription price of Y 280,000, climbed to a high of Y 473,000 before turning back to close at Y 424,000. In Osaka, the OSE average rose 18.21 to 20,692,57. SHENZHEN's Aand B shares, targeted respectively at domestic and foreign investors, continued to plunge, closing near their limit-down levels of 10% in further response to Beijing's crackdown on the stock markets. The A index plummeted 41.69 to 375.51 and the B index dived 12.79 to 121.64. SHANGHAI's A shares were also under pressure, losing 100.964 or 9.6% to 946.716, but the B index found some relief after its recent falls, losing 1.431 or 2.4% at 58.498. HONG KONG was weak with yesterday's US Federal Open Market Committee providing an excuse to take profits. The Hang Seng index fell 122.11 to 12,815.37 after bouncing off a low of 12,747.91. Turnover declined but remained healthy at HK$5.7bn, down from Monday's HK$6.5bn. Properties came in for selling in the morning, but utilities were the worst performersover the day. Hongkong Telecom slipped 30 cents to HK$12.90 and China Light lost 50 cents to HK$33.50, while Hongkong Electric added 5 cents to HK$25.75. TAIPEI ended lower after late selling in thin volume. The weighted index gave up early to close off 35.85 at 6,855.57. First International Computer stayed on the upside, adding T$1 or 1.94% to T$52.5 after raising its profit target for this year by around 30%. MANILA finished lower with the main index slipping 22.37 to 3,093.21. Bargain hunting created two bright spots. Centennial City, hit lately by the Manila Bay reclamation controversy, bounced 50 centavos or 18% to 3.10 pesos. Philipino Telephone gained 1.25 pesos or almost 5% to 24 pesos. BANGKOK eased lower as investors put a negative interpretation on the latest economic plan. The SET index slipped 5.53 to 867.23 on weak volume. SYDNEY moved lower in line with the overnight decline on Wall Street. The All Ordinaries index came off 20.5 to 2,315.8. Media stocks provided the main focus on the news that Hollinger is to sell its 25% holding in Fairfax to Brierley Investments. Fairfax dipped 1 cent to A$2.77. SINGAPORE featured a 2.8% drop in Fraser &Neave in further response to its warning that it expected its property earnings to fall by half in the current year. The shares lost 40 cents to S$14.10, at which level, analysts said, F&N should find some support. The broad market was easier with the Straits Times Industrial index losing 6.74 at 2,176.52. Strong demand was, however, seen for Singapore Land which rose 35 cents to S$8.20. Jurong Cement was another gainer, rising 5 cents to S$6.25 on old takeover rumours.

741,247.0,1996-12-18,"The dollar lost nearly a pfennig against the D-Mark yesterday, after robust US housing starts data caused a sell-off in US bonds and persuaded traders that the Federal Reserve might raise interest rates soon to slow the American economy. The D-Mark closed 0.9 pfennigs higher against the dollar in London yesterday at DM 1.545. The German currency was also buoyed by Mr Otmar Issing, Bundesbank chief economist, who told the Financial Times that the stability pact for European monetary union must be implemented strictly. That would stop Emu member states from running loose fiscal policies, and would thus help make the future single European currency a hard one. Mr Kit Juckes, currency strategist at NatWest Markets in London, said Mr Issing's comments showed the Bundesbank was more hawkish than the German government in seeking strict conditions for Emu. Sterling rose against both the dollar and the D-Mark, buoyed by continued belief that the UK would raise interest rates soon but that at the same time inflation was under control. Japanese investors continued buying the pound. It rose 1.1 cents against the dollar to $1.673 and 0.3 pfennigs against the D-Mark to DM 2.585. However these changes came amid thin trading as the quiet fortnight on the currency markets continued. Mr Mark Geddes, analyst at 4Cast, said: ""We're into pre-Christmas trading at the moment."" Traders were also awaiting the outcome of the US Federal Open Markets Committee meeting after the London close. The FOMC left interest rates unchanged. Both France and Sweden cut key rates. The Bank of France cut its intervention rate by 5 basis points to 3.15% and its 5-to-10 day lending rate by 15 basis points to 4.60%. But the French franc barely softened against the D-Mark, and rose against the dollar. The Riksbank, Sweden's central bank, reduced its repo rate for the 25th time this year, by 25 basis points to 4.1%. The market had expected the move, and the krona fell only slightly against the D-Mark, from SKr4.396 to SKr4.414. The Riksbank also said Sweden's inflation outlook had improved since its September report. The bank now expects inflation rates of 1.5% in 1997 and two per cent in 1998. * French and German policymakers yesterday again pointed in different directions regarding the level of the dollar. The Bundesbank's monthly report said the D-Mark had now almost wholly corrected its excessive strength of last year, so that its level was in line with economic fundamentals. The report also suggested interest rates would not move for a while. The message seemed to be that the Bundesbank rejected French demands for a rate cut aimed at boosting the dollar. France thinks a fall in the franc would stimulate its economy. But it can only make very minor cuts to its own rates - as it did yesterday - unless the Bundesbank eases too. Otherwise the franc would cease tracking the D-Mark, and the Emu process could collapse. But although the Bundesbank yesterday seemed to exclude the option of a weaker D-Mark and French franc, Mr Jean Trichet, governor of the Bank of France, simultaneously called for exactly that. ""It is possible that the market has a tendency to underestimate the underlying fundamentals of the dollar,"" he said, suggesting that the US currency was undervalued. He said the Group of Seven industrialised nations should discuss the issue. But France would not appear to have the Bundesbank's backing. * There was more support yesterday for the view that most Japanese officials want the dollar weaker than Y 114 to the yen. That support came after Mr Kabun Muto, director general of Japan's management and co-ordination agency, said to general surprise that the yen should be ""slightly cheaper"" than its present level to help Japanese industry. His comment sent the dollar above Y 114. But other unnamed Japanese officials later said Mr Muto had been speaking on a personal basis, and the dollar lost Y 0.3 on the day to close at Y 113.7.

742,248.0,1996-12-18,"Signs of stronger growth in the US housing sector pushed down bond prices in New York and dampened sentiment in most other markets, as the Federal Reserve left interest rates unchanged. In Europe, prices drifted lower in thin trading with many bigger traders such as hedge funds and bank proprietary desks reported to be on the sidelines. The US housing figures led to a fall in prices in early trading with the yield on the benchmark 30-year bond rising to its highest level since November 4. At mid-afternoon in New York, the long bond was off 13/32 at 97 29/32 to yield 6.657%, while at the short end of the maturity spectrum the two-year note fell 1/16 to 99 19/32 yielding 5.830%. The March 30-year bond fell by 7/16 to 112 5/16. Treasuries started the morning with modest losses and then slipped further after the Commerce Department said that construction was begun on 1.5m homes in November, a 9.2% increase that made up for nearly all of the decline in housing starts seen in September and October. Economists had expected the figure to have held steady at about 1.39m homes. The Fed announced that it had concluded its Open Market Committee meeting without changing interest rates. Few on Wall Street had expected any change in monetary policy, but economists are divided about whether the Fed might raise interest rates in the early part of next year. FOMC members did not issue any statement. Mr John Spinello, a government securities strategist at Merrill Lynch said there was no increase in activity after the Fed's announcement. He attributed much of yesterday's declines to a desire among portfolio managers to lock in gains, especially given the market's strength in November. ""There is some skittishness about lower [bond] prices eating into the returns of managers,"" he said. Concerns about new supply set to hit the market today and tomorrow, when the Treasury is to auction two-year and five-year notes, may also have contributed to yesterday's slide. In Europe, The Italian market started well with early buying in the cash market by domestic institutions. At Liffe, the London futures market, the March BTP contract reached a high in mid-morning of 129.13. Analysts said that investors had been encouraged by the fact that the government had overcome some parliamentary opposition to its 1997 budget plans. Further votes on the package are due to take place this week. Even so, following the decline in the US, prices drifted lower later in the day with the BTP contract settling at 128.29, down more than half a point. In the cash market the 10-year yield spread over Germany, which had narrowed to a low of 165 basis points by mid-morning, later widened back out to close 5 basis points wider at 172 basis points. The Spanish market followed a similar pattern with the March 10-year futures contract settling at 110.91, down 0.70, and the yield spread over Germany widening by 5 basis points to 117. Among the ""peripheral"" markets, however, Sweden bucked the trend, with the local market buoyed by a further cut in the repo rate by the Riksbank. Sweden's 10-year yield spread over Germany fell by 8 basis points to 94. Denmark also outperformed, with its 10-year spread narrowing from 84 to 81 basis points. France and Germany both lost about a third of a point. The markets found little encouragement from the Bank of France's decision to reduce its intervention rate by 5 basis points to 3.15% and also its five to 10-day repo rate, which usually set the ceiling for market rates, by 15 basis points to 4.60%. ""The markets were putting a negative spin on everything,"" said Mr Julian Jessop, chief European economist at Nikko Europe. The poor performance of the US market also dragged down UK government bonds, with the March long gilt contract falling by 3/8, to 108 11/16. Japanese government bonds were also knocked back by the fall in the US, with the yield on the benchmark 10-year JGB No 182 rising in London trading by about one basis point to 2.41%. Earlier in the day in Tokyo, the yield on the JGB had fallen by 3 basis points, with bonds benefiting from a fall in the local equity market. Mr Alex Cooper, manager at Tullett &Tokyo, said traders were watching Japanese yields particularly closely following the fall of yields to historic low levels earlier this month. ""A downtrend in the JGB market could be a catalyst for a nasty sell-off in international bond markets,"" argues Mr Cooper. Copyright Financial Times Limited 1996. All Rights Reserved.

Few on Wall Street had expected any change in monetary policy, but economists are divided about whether the Fed might raise interest rates in the early part of next year. FOMC members did not issue any statement. Mr John Spinello, a government securities strategist at Merrill Lynch said there was no increase in activity after the Fed's announcement. He attributed much of yesterday's declines to a desire among portfolio managers to lock in gains, especially given the market's strength in November. ""There is some skittishness about lower [bond] prices eating into the returns of managers,"" he said. Concerns about new supply set to hit the market today and tomorrow, when the Treasury is to auction two-year and five-year notes, may also have contributed to yesterday's slide. In Europe, The Italian market started well with early buying in the cash market by domestic institutions. At Liffe, the London futures market, the March BTP contract reached a high in mid-morning of 129.13. Analysts said that investors had been encouraged by the fact that the government had overcome some parliamentary opposition to its 1997 budget plans. Further votes on the package are due to take place this week. Even so, following the decline in the US, prices drifted lower later in the day with the BTP contract settling at 128.29, down more than half a point. In the cash market the 10-year yield spread over Germany, which had narrowed to a low of 165 basis points by mid-morning, later widened back out to close 5 basis points wider at 172 basis points. The Spanish market followed a similar pattern with the March 10-year futures contract settling at 110.91, down 0.70, and the yield spread over Germany widening by 5 basis points to 117. Among the ""peripheral"" markets, however, Sweden bucked the trend, with the local market buoyed by a further cut in the repo rate by the Riksbank. Sweden's 10-year yield spread over Germany fell by 8 basis points to 94. Denmark also outperformed, with its 10-year spread narrowing from 84 to 81 basis points. France and Germany both lost about a third of a point. The markets found little encouragement from the Bank of France's decision to reduce its intervention rate by 5 basis points to 3.15% and also its five to 10-day repo rate, which usually set the ceiling for market rates, by 15 basis points to 4.60%. ""The markets were putting a negative spin on everything,"" said Mr Julian Jessop, chief European economist at Nikko Europe. The poor performance of the US market also dragged down UK government bonds, with the March long gilt contract falling by 3/8, to 108 11/16. Japanese government bonds were also knocked back by the fall in the US, with the yield on the benchmark 10-year JGB No 182 rising in London trading by about one basis point to 2.41%. Earlier in the day in Tokyo, the yield on the JGB had fallen by 3 basis points, with bonds benefiting from a fall in the local equity market. Mr Alex Cooper, manager at Tullett &Tokyo, said traders were watching Japanese yields particularly closely following the fall of yields to historic low levels earlier this month. ""A downtrend in the JGB market could be a catalyst for a nasty sell-off in international bond markets,"" argues Mr Cooper. Copyright Financial Times Limited 1996. All Rights Reserved.

746,252.0,1996-12-18,"It was a cautious session in the equity derivatives ahead of the FOMC meeting in the US, though rollover activity boosted turnover in the futures, writes Joel Kibazo. In futures, the overnight retreat on Wall Street set the tone for the opening of trading in the December contract on the FTSE 100 contract. It started trading at 3,975, some 14 points below its previous close. Following a period of sideways trading, buyers of the contract were seen at the lower levels. This gathered momentum, as UK PSBR data was in line with market expectations, and by late morning, December was trading at 3,996, the peak of the day. Fears of a poor opening in New York, along with some nervousness ahead of the Federal Reserve meeting, saw December surrender some of its earlier gains. The publication of US housing data and the initial fall in US bonds caused a further decline, although an improvement on Wall Street saw the contract close off the day's lows. December finished at 3,972, an 8 point discount to the cash market. Volume in the December contract was 22,860 lots, while volume in March was 12,833. Turnover in traded options was 37,917 contracts, of which 12,934 was in the Footsie option and 13,559 in the European-style contract. Railtrack was the busiest stock option with a total of 1,113 lots. Copyright Financial Times Limited 1996. All Rights Reserved. Not Available for Re-dissemination.

747,253.0,1996-12-18,"A revival of takeover talk at Commerzbank lifted FRANKFURT comfortably off its worst levels of the day. Number three in the German banking league, Commerzbank pushed ahead against the trend as speculation ranged from the possibility of an outright bid for the bank or a strategic acquisition by Commerzbank itself. It was an old story but it brushed up fresh enough to lift the shares by 34 pfg to DM 38.44. Some dealers said that a single big buy order explained the rise. Otherwise traders spent the session tracking Wall Street and positioning themselves ahead of Friday's options and futures expiry for Dax contracts Deutsche Bank closed off DM 1.22 at DM 71.19 and Dresdner Bank ended down 33 pfg at DM 48.83. Volkswagen lost DM 3.70 to DM 608.30. Thyssen shed DM 3 to DM 270. Rumours of management changes left SAP DM 6.90 lower at DM 202.50. At the close, the Dax index was 32.66 lower at an Ibis-indicated 2,808.50. PARIS had a volatile session, recovering strongly from early losses on the news of official rate cuts but finally ending with the CAC 40 index off 28.87 or 1.3% at 2,193.70. Dealers said that turnover was dull with investors uncertain about direction and many holding off the market as the Bank of France spelt out its monetary policy targets. The interest rate moves met with a mixed reaction, as Axa hardened slightly but most financials lost ground. Axa added FFr 2.60 to FFr 304.8. Bancaire came off FFr 13 to FFr 565 and Suez shed FFr 3.50 to FFr 211. Paribas ended down FFr 5.10 at FFr 339. LVMH dipped FFr 25 to FFr 1,243 in spite of a Japanese decision to reduce whisky sales taxes. Dealers said that worries about the group's DFS purchase held sentiment in check. Among second liners, Groupe Andre, the shoe retailer, added FFr 1.60 to FFr 398.6 after announcing a financial restructuring plan. Usinor-Sacilor, something of a high flyer lately on the back of CAC 40 inclusion hopes, came off FFr 1.30 to FFr 76. AMSTERDAM took its cue from a dull bond market and moved lower in subdued volume. The AEX index unwound most of Monday's gains, ending off 3.18 at 612.94. Fortis Amev, the previous day's best performer, turned tail with a decline of Fl 1.20 or more than 2% to DFl 56.80. ABN-Amro dipped Fl 1.60 to Fl 106.3. Forecasts of an oil price drop to $16 a barrel next year from Royal Dutch sent the shares down by 10 cents to Fl 288.40. News of fare hikes at both the airline and its cargo offshoot depressed KLM by 10 cents to Fl 47.10. Philips came off 10 cents to Fl 68. KNP BT was the day's sharpest decline, tumbling Fl 1.70 or 4.6% to Fl 35.30. ZURICH put Ciba and Sandoz in the spotlight as the companies called a news conference about their planned merger to become Novartis. However, the pair turned back from their best levels after they confirmed that the US Federal Trade Commission had conditionally approved the merger. The two companiesinsisted that the conditions left their innovative potential intact. Ciba finished SwFr 2 weaker at SwFr 1,625, off a high of SwFr 1,649, while Sandoz turned back from SwFr 1,540 to finish SwFr 4 weaker at SwFr 1,525. The new Novartis shares are to begin trading on December 23. The broad market edged lower, with many investors sidelined ahead of the FOMC meeting. The SMI index lost 19.8 to 3,850.4. Baloise fell SwFr 115 to SwFr 2,760 when trading resumed after a suspension due to the insurer's announcement that it planned a share split and a capital payout, rather than a dividend, on 1996 results. Swissair added to Monday's SwFr 38 jump, with another rise of SwFr 14, taking the shares to SwFr 1,069 on expectations that tomorrow's press conference would bring news of a plan to separate some of the company's profitable catering operations from its airline operations. STOCKHOLM featured a 3.6% fall in Scania, the truck maker, after its announcement, late on Monday, that its production in the first quarter of 1997 would be cut. The shares lost SKr6 to SKr162. Scania said that it would cut production by about 15% in Europe to balance delivery delays caused by the French truckers' strike in November. The company added that the dispute hit sales and earnings which could have an adverse impact on results in the current quarter. The Affaersvaerlden general index was down 25.4 at 2,290.0. Stadshypotek eased SKr1.5 to SKr186.5 after the board decided to recommend to shareholders the acceptance of Svenska Handelsbanken's bid. Handelsbanken was SKr5 down at SKr190. ISTANBUL rebounded 3.7%, wiping out Monday's 2.4% fall which followed Standard &Poor's downgrading of the country's long-term foreign currency rating. The IMBK-100 index picked up 3,239.00 to close at a day's high of 90,395.96 on selective buying fuelled by a limited cash influx. One analyst said that the recovery came as investors realised that the S&P action did not affect other instruments and that Monday's early 5.5% plunge had been an overreaction. OSLO fell 1.4%, unnerved by the overnight fall on Wall Street and yesterday's US economic data. The total index finished 13.17 down at 920.03. Analysts noted, however, that the market was likely to see a cash inflow in coming weeks under regulations which give investors tax breaks if they invest in the stock market around new year. BRUSSELS ended lower with a big fall for the Bekaert wire rope group unsettling sentiment. Bekaert lost BFr 3,075 to BFr 19,825 following a profits warning.

Analysts who warned that the index could fall as low as 620 points before a floor was found, said that the uncertain economic outlook, high interest rates and a floundering currency had made the stock market an unattractive proposition for many investors, especially foreigners. They added that investors were particularly uninspired by the government's recent market boosting measures. Some buying emerged in late trading for banks and securities shares on the view that they had been oversold. Commercial Bank of Korea rose Won180 to Won5,180 and Kookmin Bank gained Won200 to Won11,300. Daewoo Securities rose Won300 to Won11,000. TOKYO finished flat after early losses were mostly offset by fresh buying and short-covering in recently hard hit sectors such as construction and banking, agencies report. The Nikkei 225 average finished 8.58 lower at 20,413.46, after a high of 20,500.90 and a low of 20,230.88. Its March futures fell 10 to 20,410. Conversely, the broader Topix index rose 3.44 to 1,515.42, prompting the view that most weak sectors had now bottomed out. The Nikkei 300 average gained 0.78 to 287.42. Volume on the first section of the TSE was a moderate 341m shares, compared with 266m shares on Monday. Declining issues outnumbered advancers 628 to 430, while 200 issues were unchanged. In London, the ISE/Nikkei 50 index fell 2.00 to 1444.97. Losing sectors were led by insurance, rubber, miscellaneous manufacturing, land transport and gas. Gainers were led by railway/bus, banks, oil, construction and warehousing. Shares in Japan's non-life insurers lost out for a second consecutive day. The biggest loser was Tokio Marine, down Y 50 at 1,070, while Mitsui Marine fell Y 26 to Y 608 and Yasuda Fire lost Y 23 at Y 620. Renewed foreign demand supported the banks. Daiwa Bank jumped Y 25 to Y 637 while Sumitomo Bank and Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank each rose Y 50 to Y 1,840 Y 50 and Y 1,770 respectively. In the new, second section of the over-the-counter market, ATL Systems made a solid debut. The shares, with a subscription price of Y 280,000, climbed to a high of Y 473,000 before turning back to close at Y 424,000. In Osaka, the OSE average rose 18.21 to 20,692,57. SHENZHEN's Aand B shares, targeted respectively at domestic and foreign investors, continued to plunge, closing near their limit-down levels of 10% in further response to Beijing's crackdown on the stock markets. The A index plummeted 41.69 to 375.51 and the B index dived 12.79 to 121.64. SHANGHAI's A shares were also under pressure, losing 100.964 or 9.6% to 946.716, but the B index found some relief after its recent falls, losing 1.431 or 2.4% at 58.498. HONG KONG was weak with yesterday's US Federal Open Market Committee providing an excuse to take profits. The Hang Seng index fell 122.11 to 12,815.37 after bouncing off a low of 12,747.91. Turnover declined but remained healthy at HK$5.7bn, down from Monday's HK$6.5bn. Properties came in for selling in the morning, but utilities were the worst performersover the day. Hongkong Telecom slipped 30 cents to HK$12.90 and China Light lost 50 cents to HK$33.50, while Hongkong Electric added 5 cents to HK$25.75. TAIPEI ended lower after late selling in thin volume. The weighted index gave up early to close off 35.85 at 6,855.57. First International Computer stayed on the upside, adding T$1 or 1.94% to T$52.5 after raising its profit target for this year by around 30%. MANILA finished lower with the main index slipping 22.37 to 3,093.21. Bargain hunting created two bright spots. Centennial City, hit lately by the Manila Bay reclamation controversy, bounced 50 centavos or 18% to 3.10 pesos. Philipino Telephone gained 1.25 pesos or almost 5% to 24 pesos. BANGKOK eased lower as investors put a negative interpretation on the latest economic plan. The SET index slipped 5.53 to 867.23 on weak volume. SYDNEY moved lower in line with the overnight decline on Wall Street. The All Ordinaries index came off 20.5 to 2,315.8. Media stocks provided the main focus on the news that Hollinger is to sell its 25% holding in Fairfax to Brierley Investments. Fairfax dipped 1 cent to A$2.77. SINGAPORE featured a 2.8% drop in Fraser &Neave in further response to its warning that it expected its property earnings to fall by half in the current year. The shares lost 40 cents to S$14.10, at which level, analysts said, F&N should find some support. The broad market was easier with the Straits Times Industrial index losing 6.74 at 2,176.52. Strong demand was, however, seen for Singapore Land which rose 35 cents to S$8.20. Jurong Cement was another gainer, rising 5 cents to S$6.25 on old takeover rumours.

749,255.0,1996-12-18,"The dollar lost nearly a pfennig against the D-Mark yesterday, after robust US housing starts data caused a sell-off in US bonds and persuaded traders that the Federal Reserve might raise interest rates soon to slow the American economy. The D-Mark closed 0.9 pfennigs higher against the dollar in London yesterday at DM 1.545. The German currency was also buoyed by Mr Otmar Issing, Bundesbank chief economist, who told the Financial Times that the stability pact for European monetary union must be implemented strictly. That would stop Emu member states from running loose fiscal policies, and would thus help make the future single European currency a hard one. Mr Kit Juckes, currency strategist at NatWest Markets in London, said Mr Issing's comments showed the Bundesbank was more hawkish than the German government in seeking strict conditions for Emu. Sterling rose against both the dollar and the D-Mark, buoyed by continued belief that the UK would raise interest rates soon but that at the same time inflation was under control. Japanese investors continued buying the pound. It rose 1.1 cents against the dollar to $1.673 and 0.3 pfennigs against the D-Mark to DM 2.585. However these changes came amid thin trading as the quiet fortnight on the currency markets continued. Mr Mark Geddes, analyst at 4Cast, said: ""We're into pre-Christmas trading at the moment."" Traders were also awaiting the outcome of the US Federal Open Markets Committee meeting after the London close. The FOMC left interest rates unchanged. Both France and Sweden cut key rates. The Bank of France cut its intervention rate by 5 basis points to 3.15% and its 5-to-10 day lending rate by 15 basis points to 4.60%. But the French franc barely softened against the D-Mark, and rose against the dollar. The Riksbank, Sweden's central bank, reduced its repo rate for the 25th time this year, by 25 basis points to 4.1%. The market had expected the move, and the krona fell only slightly against the D-Mark, from SKr4.396 to SKr4.414. The Riksbank also said Sweden's inflation outlook had improved since its September report. The bank now expects inflation rates of 1.5% in 1997 and two per cent in 1998. * French and German policymakers yesterday again pointed in different directions regarding the level of the dollar. The Bundesbank's monthly report said the D-Mark had now almost wholly corrected its excessive strength of last year, so that its level was in line with economic fundamentals. The report also suggested interest rates would not move for a while. The message seemed to be that the Bundesbank rejected French demands for a rate cut aimed at boosting the dollar. France thinks a fall in the franc would stimulate its economy. But it can only make very minor cuts to its own rates - as it did yesterday - unless the Bundesbank eases too. Otherwise the franc would cease tracking the D-Mark, and the Emu process could collapse. But although the Bundesbank yesterday seemed to exclude the option of a weaker D-Mark and French franc, Mr Jean Trichet, governor of the Bank of France, simultaneously called for exactly that. ""It is possible that the market has a tendency to underestimate the underlying fundamentals of the dollar,"" he said, suggesting that the US currency was undervalued. He said the Group of Seven industrialised nations should discuss the issue. But France would not appear to have the Bundesbank's backing. * There was more support yesterday for the view that most Japanese officials want the dollar weaker than Y 114 to the yen. That support came after Mr Kabun Muto, director general of Japan's management and co-ordination agency, said to general surprise that the yen should be ""slightly cheaper"" than its present level to help Japanese industry. His comment sent the dollar above Y 114. But other unnamed Japanese officials later said Mr Muto had been speaking on a personal basis, and the dollar lost Y 0.3 on the day to close at Y 113.7.

750,256.0,1994-07-07,"Nervousness regarding progress at the US Federal Open Market Committee meeting increased yesterday and UK shares turned down smartly in mid-afternoon. Trading volume remained light, however, and equities closed above the day's lows. The second half of the session was dominated by the dollar and the US Federal bond markets, both of which turned lower as New York absorbed strongly worded comments from the German economics minister. Markets grew fearful that the Federal Reserve might either take no action on rates or lift them by 1/2 percentage point. Either course would threaten problems for currency and bond markets. The FT-SE 100 Index closed 18.3 down at 2,946.7. Around 4 points of the Footsie fall reflected the heavy setback in GEC, which was among the most actively traded shares after severely disappointing City analysts with virtually unchanged profits. A market now looking for growth of around 6% overall in UK corporate earnings this year is no longer prepared to be forgiving of slow progress, even when accompanied by a cash mountain, as is the case with GEC. The reaction to GEC's figures helped to upset equities in early trading. However, news that UK manufacturing output had grown by 0.3% in May, and industrial output by 0.1%, was favourably received, as was the UK Treasury monthly report which said that economic indicators signal steady economic recovery. The market was also helped by a trading programme, said to be from NatWest Securities, investment arm of the UK investment bank. A second programme was later identified, with Smith New Court believed to be the house responsible. Weakness in sterling against the German D-Mark was a discouraging factor at first for UK blue chip exporting stocks, although domestic interest rate concerns remained more closely focused around the dollar's progress. The fall in the US currency as New York opened brought a rash of red on to trading screens in the London equity market. The earlier low point for the day was quickly lost as investors shied away, but nerves steadied as the dollar picked itself up off the floor. London traders went home to watch television for any move by the Federal Reserve. Once again, a contrary performance from the FT-SE Mid 250 Index, 2.4 firmer at 3,438.2, suggested determined bargain hunting across the broad range of the market. Seaq trading volume of 506.2m shares showed improvement against recent levels, although it remained well short of acceptably profitable levels. Non-Footsie stocks made up around 59% of the day's total. Retail business, the more convincing valuation of investment activity in equities, remained disappointing as the big investors waited for the FOMC and G7 meetings to bring a guide to near term prospects. On Tuesday, retail business was worth only #968.8m, still well below the levels to which the stock market has become accustomed during its bull phase. The comments from Herr Rexrodt, the German economic minister, that the Bundesbank had not favoured the last round of dollar intervention further dispelled hopes for concerted action from the G7 meeting. They also served to focus attention on the meeting this morning of the Bundesbank policy council. (c) The Financial Times Limited 1994.

751,257.0,1994-07-07,"Wall Street Blue chip issues posted solid gains yesterday, but otherwise US stock prices were mostly flat to lower in light trading after the Federal Reserve's open market committee meeting ended with no hint of any change in monetary policy, writes Patrick Harverson in New York. At the close the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 22.02 at 3,674.50. The strength in the Dow, however, masked weakness in the wider market. The more broadly based Standard and Poors 500 ended 0.24 off at 446.13, the American SE composite eased 0.15 to 423.55 and the Nasdaq composite was 2.59 weaker at 701.00. Trading volume on the New York SE totalled a moderate 236.2m shares. As on Tuesday, trading yesterday was hamstrung by the unwillingness of many participants to become involved in the market while the FOMC was still holding its meeting. When the meeting started on Tuesday, there was considerable speculation that the FOMC might vote to raise interest rates to support the dollar, which has dropped steadily against the yen in recent weeks. Although by yesterday the consensus was that the FOMC would not change monetary policy, and would wait until it saw tomorrow's June employment report before deciding whether to act, uncertainty about the outlook for interest rates continued to restrain demand. There was little subsequent reaction when the meeting ended during the afternoon with no announcement from the Fed, which was taken by analysts as a sign that monetary policy had not been changed. While much of the market languished, the one bright spot was the Dow, which outperformed other indices thanks to strength in a few cyclical stocks, including International Paper, which closed $1 3/4 ahead at $68 3/4, Alcoa, up $1 at $76 7/8, and Caterpillar, climbing $2 3/4 to $104 1/2. Texaco advanced $1 5/8 to $62 1/2 as investors bought more stock following Tuesday's announcement of a major restructuring by the oil group aimed at cutting costs. The share price was given an additional lift yesterday by rat-ings upgrades from two broking houses, Wertheim Schroder and Dean Witter Reynolds. Dime Bancorp was one of the most active stocks on the NYSE, dropping $1 3/8 to $9 1/4 in volume of 3.2m shares after investors signalled their displeasure at news of the savings bank's acquisition of Anchor Bancorp in a $1.2bn stock swap. The news also failed to lift Anchor shares, which ended $3/8 cheaper at $15 1/2. Salomon fell $2 to $45 1/2 after the company warned that it would incur a loss of $200m in the second quarter because of poor results at its Salomon Brothers brokerage unit. The warning hit other brokerage stocks: Morgan Stanley softened $1/4 to $55 5/8, PaineWebber $1/4 to $15 1/2 and Dean Witter Discover $3/8 to $37. Canada Toronto closed modestly lower in light trading after the falling gold bullion price again pushed gold shares downward. The TSE 300 composite index lost 10.2 at 4,043.4 and declines led rises by 409 to 311 after volume of 42.8m shares. Ten of the 14 sub-indices lost ground, with the golds group weakening 1.5% as the price of gold in New York dipped $2.10 an ounce to $383.85. The transportation group gained 1.4%. Laidlaw 'B' rose C$1/4 to C$9 5/8 in anticipation of its third-quarter financial results, expected to be released soon. Brazil Sao Paulo rose 5.3% in local currency terms in strong volume, on optimism over the government's anti-inflation plan and a presidential election poll expected later this week. The Bovespa index ended 1,892 higher at 37,535 and turnover was about RDollars 221.5m ($242.1m). Traders saw local and foreign investors coming back into the market and said a dip in the Sao Paulo price of the basic basket of goods of 0.69% between Monday and Tuesday provided a boost to stocks, given that inflation was running at 1 or 2 percentage points a day before the government's latest anti-inflation plan came into operation.

752,258.0,1994-07-07,"The dollar lost more ground against both the D-Mark and the yen yesterday as markets assumed that the Federal Reserve would leave interest rates unchanged for the time being, writes Motoko Rich. The US currency lost about 1 1/2 pfennigs against the D-Mark to close in London at DM 1.5685 from DM 1.5826. Against the yen the dollar ended above the session's low of Y 97.70 in London at Y 98.125, down from Y 98.825. In New York, however, it rallied to finish at DM 1.5778 and Y 98.90. Germany's currency remained strong in Europe as investors continued to pressure the Swedish krona, Belgian franc and Italian lira while markets focused on these countries' budget deficits. Sterling followed the dollar down against the D-Mark, hitting a 15-month low against the German currency. As South African President Nelson Mandela reassured businesses that economic policy would remain unchanged under new finance minister Mr Chris Liebenberg, the financial rand held steady against the dollar. As the markets awaited an announcement on the final day of the meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee, the policy-making arm of the Federal Reserve Board, investors bearishly assumed that a dollar support package was not forthcoming and pushed the US currency down to a 14-month low against the D-Mark. Markets were not expecting a rise in US interest rates, and when the Fed added reserves to the banking system it signalled no monetary policy changes. In late trading the dollar came off the session's lows as analysts suggested that the Fed could be waiting to make an interest rate move tomorrow when the US employment figures are released. Hopes for concerted intervention or the emergence of co-ordinated interest rate pol-icies to rescue the dollar collapsed when German economic minister Mr Guenter Rexrodt indicated that the Bundesbank had been opposed to the most recent round of interven-tion on behalf of the dollar. Mr David Cocker, economist at Chemical Bank, said Mr Rexrodt could be playing a psychological game and setting a bear trap. 'But I do not think the German administration or the Bundesbank are overly concerned about the level of the dollar against the D-Mark,' he added. The dollar rallied slightly after Mr Lawrence Summers, undersecretary of the US Treasury for international affairs, said the US currency would be discussed at the G7 economic summit meeting which begins tomorrow in Naples. In addition to benefiting from the dollar's weakness, the D-Mark performed well as it continued to play the safe haven currency for investors repelled by gaping budget def-icits in Sweden, Italy and Belgium. The Swedish krona sagged to SKr5.004 from SKr4.955, breaking through the psychologically important barrier of SKr5.00 against the D-Mark as jittery markets took a negative view of Sweden's raised budget deficit forecast. The Italian lira was also flirting with an important level of L1,000 against the D-Mark as the markets waited for today's publication of Italy's three-year plan, in which the government will need to address its budget deficit. In London the lira closed at L995.5 from L993.8. Mr Steve Hannah, head of research at IBJ International, said the Belgian franc weakened quite sharply against the D-Mark by Belgian standards, as it normally trades within very narrow margins. 'There is a growing concern that the budget will not be settled in a satisfactory way, and that the political coalition is breaking down,' he said. The Belgian franc finished in London at BFr 20.67 from BFr 20.63. Sterling fell to a 15-month low against the D-Mark, mirroring the sickly dollar and further depressed by a rumour that an unnamed UK official said the Treasury would be indifferent even if the pound fell to DM 2.00. Mr Tony Norfield, economist at ABN/Amro, said sterling performed poorly against the D-Mark in spite of good industrial production figures. UK industrial production rose a seasonally adjusted 0.3% in May after 1.6% in April. Analysts said these figures indicated a healthily steady industrial recovery. In the UK money markets, the Bank of England provided #217m liquidity at established rates after forecasting a shortage of #850m. The Bank gave late assistance of #590m. The markets held their ground with the financial rand as Mr Nelson Mandela reassured businesses that economic policy was on course after the resignation of Mr Derek Keys as finance minister. Mr Mandela said Mr Chris Liebenberg, who replaced Mr Keys after he resigned on Tuesday, would 'follow government policy'. The rand finished in London at R4.84 against the dollar from R4.845. The December short sterling futures contract closed at 93.67 from 93.73. The December Euromark contract finished at 94.97 from 94.95. (c) The Financial Times Limited 1994.

753,259.0,1994-07-07,"Longer-dated US Treasury prices slipped lower in light trading yesterday as traders and investors remained on the sidelines following the conclusion of the meeting of the Federal Reserve's open market committee. In late afternoon trading, the benchmark 30-year government bond was down 3/16 at to 84 3/16, yielding 7.600%. However, the two-year note was up 1/32 at 99 13/16, to yield 6.084%. Prices at the long end declined from the start in the wake of a modest weakening in the dollar during early trading. The dollar fell because the perception on Wall Street overnight was that the FOMC would not vote at its meeting to raise interest rates to support the ailing US currency. Analysts said the Fed realised it would send the wrong signal to financial markets if it allowed the foreign exchange speculators, who have been selling the dollar, to dictate the direction of monetary policy. Once the meeting ended without an announcement, it was judged the FOMC had decided to leave policy unchanged, at least until more is known about the state of the economy. The next set of important data is due tomorrow when the June employment report is published. Traders said nervousness ahead of the jobs figures explained why longer-dated prices were stuck in negative territory and trading remained subdued. European government bonds traded nervously yesterday, with dealers eyeing the FOMC meeting and currency volatility. German government bonds ended a directionless session slightly higher on short-covering in the futures market. Investors remained sidelined as they awaited the outcome of the FOMC meeting, today's Bundesbank Council meeting, tomorrow's US employment data and the weekend Group of Seven summit in Naples. Bunds shrugged off the three-basis-point reduction in the Bundesbank's minimum securities repurchase rate to 4.93% and the downward revision of May M3 money supply growth to an annualised 13.4%, from a provisional 13.7%. Although most market participants expect another cut in the Bundesbank's 4.5% discount rate this year, few expect to see it today. 'Cutting again with M3 growth so much above target would damage their credibility,' said one trader. The Bundesbank's M3 growth target range is 4% to 6%. UK gilts ended a jittery session slightly lower in thin volume as investors eyed the FOMC meeting. Trading was dominated by activity in the futures pits and dealers reported sporadic and trendless activity in the cash market. D-Mark strength against sterling added to pressure on gilts, causing the UK market to underperform Germany. French bonds ended the day slightly weaker, depressed by the prospect of today's auction of FFr 19bn-FFr 21bn in medium-and long-dated bonds. Weakness in the French currency against the D-Mark reduced hopes that the Bank of France might follow the Bundesbank's latest rate cut with an easing move today. Swedish bond yields hit a new high for the year, pressured by currency weakness as the krone fell to a low for the year. After Tuesday's auction of government bonds had gone better than expected, many of Tuesday's buyers became sellers yesterday. 'The auction went well because the currency had weakened sharply and yields were high - you got some opportunistic investors into the auction stock who were looking to make money quickly and get out,' said Mr Jouni Kokko, international economist at S. G. Warburg Securities. The yield on the nine-year benchmark bond closed at a new high at 10.73%, a rise of 20 basis points from Tuesday. Spanish bond yields hit a high for the year, dogged by political uncertainty and fears that heavy funding at the short end will push short rates higher. The 10-year benchmark yield rose as high as 11.11%. In Belgium, reports that domestic troubles were weakening prime minister Jean-Luc Dehaene's government, and recent nervousness over the budget outlook, caused short-dated yields to rise sharply.

754,260.0,1994-07-07,"Nervousness regarding progress at the US Federal Open Market Committee meeting increased yesterday and UK shares turned down smartly in mid-afternoon. Trading volume remained light, however, and equities closed above the day's lows. The second half of the session was dominated by the dollar and the US Federal bond markets, both of which turned lower as New York absorbed strongly worded comments from the German economics minister. Markets grew fearful that the Fed might either take no action on rates or raise them by as much as 1/2 percentage point. Either course would threaten problems for currency and bond markets. The FT-SE 100 Index closed 18.3 down at 2,946.7. Around 4 points of the Footsie fall reflected the heavy setback in GEC, which was among the most actively traded shares after severely disappointing City analysts with virtually unchanged profits. A market now looking for growth of around 6% overall in UK corporate earnings this year is no longer prepared to be forgiving of slow progress, even when accompanied by a cash mountain, as is the case with GEC. The reaction to GEC's figures helped to upset equities in early trading. However, news that UK manufacturing output had grown by 0.3% in May, and industrial output by 0.1%, was favourably received, as was the UK Treasury monthly report which said that economic indicators signal steady economic recovery. The market was also helped by a trading programme, said to be from NatWest Securities, investment arm of the UK investment bank. A second programme was later identified, with Smith New Court believed to be the house responsible. Weakness in sterling against the German D-Mmark was a discouraging factor at first for UK blue chip exporting stocks, although domestic interest rate concerns remained more closely focused around the dollar's progress. The fall in the US currency as New York opened brought a rash of red on to trading screens in the London equity market. The earlier low point for the day was quickly lost as investors shied away, but nerves steadied as the dollar picked itself up off the floor. London traders went home to watch television for any move by the Federal Reserve. Once again, a contrary performance from the FT-SE Mid 250 Index, 2.4 firmer at 3,438.2, suggested determined bargain hunting across the broad range of the market. Seaq trading volume of 506.2m shares showed improvement against recent levels, although it remained well short of acceptably profitable levels. Non-Footsie stocks made up around 59% of the day's total. Retail business, the more convincing valuation of investment activity in equities, remained disappointing as the big investors waited for the FOMC and G7 meetings to bring a guide to near term prospects. On Tuesday, retail business was worth only #968.8m, still well below the levels to which the stock market has become accustomed during its bull phase. The comments from Herr Rexrodt, the German economic minister, that the Bundesbank had not favoured the last round of dollar intervention further dispelled hopes for concerted action from the G7 meeting. They also served to focus attention on the meeting this morning of the Bundesbank policy council. (c) The Financial Times Limited 1994.

755,261.0,1994-07-07,"Wall Street Apart from gains in a few blue chip issues, US stock prices were mostly flat to lower in directionless trading yesterday morning as the market's attention remained fixed on the dollar and the second day of the Federal Reserve's open market committee meeting, writes Patrick Harverson in New York. By 1 pm, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 18.13 at 3,670.61. The strength in the Dow, however, masked weakness in the wider market. The more broadly based Standard and Poors 500, for example, was down 0.12 at 446.25, while the American SE composite eased 0.31 to 423.39 and the Nasdaq composite declined 2.06 to 701.53. Trading volume on the New York SE came to 135m shares by 1 pm. As on Tuesday, trading yesterday was hamstrung by the unwillingness of many participants to become involved in the market while the FOMC was still holding its meeting. When the meeting started on Tuesday, there was considerable speculation that the FOMC might vote to raise interest rates to support the dollar, which has dropped steadily against the yen in recent weeks. Although by yesterday the consensus was that the FOMC would not change monetary policy, and would wait until it saw tomorrow's June employment report before deciding whether to act, uncertainty about the outlook for interest rates continued to restrain demand. A modest weakening in the dollar during the morning, and a slight decline in bond prices which pushed the yield on the benchmark 30-year issue back above 7.6%, also contributed to the mostly downbeat session. The one bright spot was the Dow, which outperformed the rest of the market thanks to strength in a few stocks, most notably Texaco, which rose a further $1 3/8 to $62 1/4. Investors have been buying the stock since the company announced a major restructuring on Tuesday aimed at cutting costs, and the share price was given an additional lift yesterday by ratings upgrades from two broking houses, Wertheim Schroder and Dean Witter Reynolds. Another Dow constituent on the rise was Caterpillar, which climbed $2 5/8 to $104 3/8. There was no specific piece of news behind the rise, although it may have been sparked by hopes that the long running industrial dispute between the company and unions may be nearing a resolution. Dime Bancorp was the most active stock on the NYSE, falling $1 1/8 to $9 1/2 in volume of 2.5m shares after investors signalled their displeasure at news of the savings bank's acquisition of Anchor Bancorp in a $1.2bn stock swap. The news, however, lifted Anchor shares $1/16 to $16. Salomon dropped $1 7/8 to $45 5/8 after the company warned that it would incur a loss of $200m in the second quarter because of poor results at its Salomon Brothers brokerage unit. The warning hit other brokerage stocks, including Merrill Lynch, which eased $1/8 to $35, and Morgan Stanley, $1/2 down at $55 3/8. Canada Toronto eased in sluggish early trade on soft gold shares and weaker conglomerates. The TSE 300 composite index had declined 17.19 to 4,036.37 by midsession in 18.94m shares valued at C$231m. Precious metals showed the worst decline, losing 200.43, or 2.1%, at 9,168.17 as bullion slipped on the New York Comex market. Active issues included Nova Corp, up C$3/8 at C$11 1/8 in 2m shares dealt, and Methanex Corp, which continued its upward march with a rise of C$5/8 to C$18 in 921,744 traded. Brazil Sao Paulo advanced 5.6% in local currency terms in low mid-morning volume, on optimism over the government's anti-inflation plan and a presidential election poll expected later this week. The Bovespa index rose 1,990 to 37,633. Traders said a dip in the Sao Paulo price of the basic basket of goods of 0.69% between Monday and Tuesday provided a boost to stocks, given that inflation was running at 1 or 2 percentage points a day before the government's latest anti-inflation plan came into operation.

756,262.0,1994-07-07,"Tokyo A late rise in the yen triggered arbitrage selling and profit-taking, and the Nikkei 225 average lost ground in low volume, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. The index was down 205.34 at 20,629.03 after a high for the day of 20,878.78 in the morning, and a low of 20,627.43 just before the close. The yen returned to above Y 98 to the dollar, prompting profit-taking in the high-technology sector and depressing the futures market. Volume amounted to 368m shares, against 391m. Small-lot buying by foreigners and institutional investors failed to counter selling by arbitrageurs and dealers. The Topix index of all first section stocks receded 12.84 to 1,670.65, while the Nikkei 300 declined 2.85 to 303.43 and falls led rises by 701 to 330, with 160 issues unchanged. In London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index was 0.07 firmer at 1,352.80. Dealers predicted that equities would trade in a narrow range throughout this week, ahead of the Naples Group of Seven summit tomorrow. A Japanese broker noted large-lot buying orders around the Nikkei 20,500 mark, but more investors waiting to sell around 21,000. Arbitrage selling depressed bank shares. Dai-ichi Kangyo Bank declined Y 40 to Y 1,890 and Bank of Tokyo by Y 40 to Y 1,560. High-technology issues, which had recovered earlier this week on the brief retreat of the yen against the dollar, were sold. Hitachi, Y 1,070, and Fujitsu, Y 1,110, slipped Y 30 apiece. Terumo, the medical equipment maker, rose by its daily limit of Y 200 for the second consecutive day to Y 1,220 on continued bullishness among investors over the company's development of a new three dimensional television screen. Speculative investors continued to buy stocks seemingly linked to the 'hot weather' theme. Traders explained that Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, the most active issue of the day, put on Y 6 at Y 817 due to its popular air conditioner, while Mitsubishi Shindoh, an air conditioner parts maker, gained Y 8 at Y 724. Shikoku Chemicals, a pool disinfectant producer, climbed Y 40 to Y 625. In Osaka, the OSE average slipped 91.07 to 23,252.30 in volume of 41m shares. Roundup Uncertainty about the direction of world and domestic interest rates left most of the Pacific Rim region lower. HONG KONG worried about the weak dollar and the impending end of the US FOMC meeting later yesterday, and a late afternoon sell-off left the Hang Seng index down by 168.27, or 1.95%, at 8,454.92, just off the day's low of 8,449.36. Turnover remained below HKDollars 2bn, registering a preliminary HKDollars 1.84bn against Tuesday's adjusted HKDollars 1.60bn. Brokers said investors were betting on higher interest rates in the short term. Meanwhile, worries about the profits of property developers, the focus of the late sell-off, also dogged the bourse. Cheung Kong weakened HKDollars 1 to HKDollars 31.80 and SHK Properties HKDollars 1.10 to HKDollars 42.20. SYDNEY surrendered recent gains to sink below the 2,000 barrier on the All Ordinaries index, which finished 12.2 points weaker at 1,991.2 and well below an intraday high of 2,010.5. Turnover was nearly A$353m. Trade was marked by Western Mining's announcement of an A$7.5bn alumina merger with Aluminum Co of America and an A$720m rights issue to fund its side of the deal. The stock dipped 50 cents, or 6.7%, to a two-month low of A$7.02. WELLINGTON fell on sell orders just before the close, the NZSE 40 index shedding 13.19 to 1,984.14. SEOUL saw profit-taking in blue chips. The composite index fell 7.01 to 953.48. SINGAPORE's Straits Times Industrial index fell 25.07, or 1.15%, to 2,162.88. Brokers said the sliding US dollar in recent weeks had prompted institutions to sell their Singapore investments as a hedge. KARACHI tried to rise on new account buying early in the day, but institutions and investors took to the sidelines, and attendance at the exchange was poor as rains disrupted communications and power supplies. The exchange closed an hour early, and the KSE 100 index lost 3.32 at 2,296.27 in thin volume. TAIPEI, the exception, concentrated on domestic issues, brokers hoping that the central bank may maintain its loose monetary policy after Tuesday's announcement of June inflation at 2.14%, and the weighted index gained 50.23 at 6,115.18.

757,263.0,1994-07-07,"The dollar lost more ground against both the D-Mark and the yen yesterday as markets assumed the Federal Reserve Board would leave interest rates unchanged for the time being, writes Motoko Rich. The US currency lost about a pfennig and a half against the D-Mark to close in London at DM 1.5685 from DM 1.5826. Against the yen, the dollar closed above session lows of Y 97.70 in London at Y 98.125 from Y 98.825. Germany's currency remained strong in Europe as investors continued to pressure the Swedish krona, the Belgian franc and the Italian lira while markets focused on these countries' budget deficits. Sterling followed the dollar down against the D-Mark, hitting a 15-month low against the German currency. As South African president Mr Nelson Mandela reassured businesses that economic policy would remain unchanged under new finance minister Mr Chris Liebenberg, the financial rand held steady against the dollar. As the markets awaited an announcement on the final day of the meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee, the policy-making arm of the Federal Reserve Board, investors bearishly assumed a dollar support package was not forthcoming and pushed the dollar down to a 14-month low against the D-Mark. Markets were not expecting a rise in US interest rates and when the Fed added reserves to the banking system, it signalled no monetary policy changes. In late trading the dollar came off its session lows as analysts suggested the Fed could be waiting to make an interest rate move tomorrow when the US employment figures are released. Hopes for concerted intervention or the emergence of co-ordinated interest rate policies to rescue the dollar collapsed when German economic minister Mr Guenter Rexrodt indicated the Bundesbank had been opposed to the most recent round of intervention on behalf of the dollar. Mr David Cocker, economist at Chemical Bank, said Mr Rexrodt could be playing a psychological game and setting a bear trap. 'But I do not think the German administration or the Bundesbank are overly concerned about the level of the dollar against the D-Mark,' he said. The dollar rallied slightly after Mr Lawrence Summers, undersecretary of the US Treasury for international affairs, said the US currency would be discussed at the G7 economic summit meeting which begins tomorrow in Naples. In addition to benefitting from the dollar's weakness, the D-Mark performed well as it continued to play the safe haven currency for investors repelled by gaping budget deficits in Sweden, Italy and Belgium.

By midday, the benchmark 30-year government bond was down 9/32 at 84 3/32, yielding 7.610%. The two-year note was unchanged at 99 3/4, to yield 6.118%. The early decline in prices was attributed to the modest weakening in the dollar during morning trading due to the growing perception on Wall Street yesterday that the FOMC would not vote at its meeting to raise interest rates to support the ailing US currency. Most analysts believe that the Fed realises it would send the wrong signal to financial markets if it allowed the foreign exchange speculators who have been selling the dollar to dictate the direction of monetary policy. Those same analysts believe the FOMC would only raise interest rates if awaited economic statistics indicated the economy needed cooling further. The next set of important data is due out tomorrow when the June employment report is published, and nervousness ahead of the release of the jobs figures was partly to blame for yesterday's early losses and the overall lack of trading activity.

760,266.0,2003-03-19,"Uncertainty prompts Fed to hold rates US ECONOMY MARKETS MORE CONFIDENT BUT CENTRAL BANK SAYS GEOPOLITICAL EVENTS MAKE ASSESSMENT OF SITUATION DIFFIC. The US Federal Reserve kept interest rates on hold at 1.25 per cent yesterday, but warned about the huge uncertainty surrounding the US economy. The decision, ahead of an imminent war with Iraq, had been predicted by most economists and priced in by investors. But despite a more confident tone in oil and financial markets in recent days, the Fed's open markets committee (FOMC) said that geo-political risks were making any assessment of the US economy very difficult. In a statement released with the decision, which was unanimous, the Fed indicated it was standing ready to cut rates immediately if the economic outlook deteriorated suddenly. The Fed said it would practise ""heightened surveillance"" of the economy - similar to language used in the past ahead of an interest rate move between scheduled meet-ings. In a highly unusual move, the Fed also said it could not tell whether the risks to the economy were balanced or weighted one way or another, citing ""unusually large uncertainties clouding the geopolitical situation in the short run and their apparent effects on economic decisionmaking"". The FOMC's next scheduled meeting is on May 6. Gloomy data released in recent weeks had put the possibility of a cut back on the table, particularly figures that showed employment and retail sales dropping sharply and confidence among both consumers and the housing industry sinking fast. But economists had predicted that the recovery in financial markets, with the prospect of a quick war blowing away the clouds of uncertainty covering the US economy, would keep the Fed on hold. Financial and commodity markets have taken a much more optimistic tone in recent days, beginning to focus on the possibility of a swift and decisive war with Iraq. Before the Fed's announcement yesterday, the futures market had lowered still further its estimate of the probability of a quarter-point cut to less than 20 per cent. Oil prices dropped sharply yesterday, with most key price indices falling by nearly $2 a barrel. The US benchmark crude oil hit $31.75, 20 per cent below its high of $39.99 last month. Traders have been speculating that a war in Iraq would be short and that the US was likely to tap into its strategic stockpile of crude oil. In the run-up to the meeting, US stocks held their gains after the sharp rally on Monday, while the dollar added to its recent gains against the other large currencies. Interest rates have been on hold at 1.25 per cent since November, when the Fed sprang another surprise by cutting borrowing costs by half a percentage point. London Edition 2.

Sterling retraced another step against the D-Mark since its steep fall last Friday. Traders said sterling was supported by the statement by Tony Blair, the prime minister, that the government's policy had not changed. The pound rose by a pfennig against the D-Mark, to DM 2.853. Overnight buying had pushed up the pound, but its rally faltered as sellers entered the market when the rate was around the DM 2.86 level. Against the dollar, sterling was virtually unchanged by the close of trading in London, at $1.615. In Asia, news of weaker economic performance in the region undermined further the struggling South-east currencies. The Malaysian ringgit, the Indonesian rupiah and the Philippine peso all scraped new lows against the US dollar during trading, after domestic companies there bought dollars to hedge their currency exposures. The Thai baht, however, made a slight recovery. The D-Mark fell early in European trading, after the Bundesbank again left its securities repurchase rate fixed at 3%. The bank last changed the repo rate on 22 August 1996. The dollar was quiet as traders in New York awaited the Federal Reserve's decision on interest rates. The Federal Open Markets Committee meeting also kept the yen sedate, while in Tokyo the latest quarterly Tankan report on business conditions was to be released.

Traders said sterling was supported by the statement by Tony Blair, the prime minister, that the government's policy had not changed. The pound rose by a pfennig against the D-Mark, to DM 2.853. Overnight buying had pushed up the pound, but its rally faltered as sellers entered the market when the rate was around the DM 2.86 level. Against the dollar, sterling was virtually unchanged by the close of trading in London, at $1.615. In Asia, news of weaker economic performance in the region undermined further the struggling South-east currencies. The Malaysian ringgit, the Indonesian rupiah and the Philippine peso all scraped new lows against the US dollar during trading, after domestic companies there bought dollars to hedge their currency exposures. The Thai baht, however, made a slight recovery. The D-Mark fell early in European trading, after the Bundesbank again left its securities repurchase rate fixed at 3%. The bank last changed the repo rate on 22 August 1996. The dollar was quiet as traders in New York awaited the Federal Reserve's decision on interest rates.

765,271.0,2008-03-19,"US stocks staged their biggest rally in more than five years yesterday as confidence in the stability of the financial system grew and the Federal Reserve cut interest rates by 75 basis points to 2.25 per cent.  The rate reduction was smaller than many in the markets had expected but investors overcame their initial disappointment, and shares, which had been up strongly before the Fed action, closed still higher.  In cutting rates, the US central bank tried to balance the threats to growth and inflation. However, in a rare move, two members of the Fed's policymaking Open Market Committee dissented in favour of a 50bp cut, indicating the depth of resistance at the Fed to even a 75bp move.  The size of the cut, while large by historical standards, suggests the Fed believes it will not be able to solve the credit crisis through monetary policy alone.  The central bank said the ""outlook for economic growth has weakened further"" and ""downside risks remain"", leaving the door open to further cuts in the main Fed funds rate at subsequent policy meetings. The Fed also cut the discount rate at which it provides emergency finance by 75bp to 2.5 per cent.  However, the Fed hardened its language on inflation, making it clear that policymakers had not cut rates by 100bp because of concerns about price pressures. ""Inflation has been elevated and some indicators of inflation expectations have risen,"" the Fed said. It said policymakers expected inflation to moderate but believed ""uncertainty about the inflation outlook has increased"".  The Fed's decision reflects policymakers' determination to signal that while they are focused on fighting growth risks, they are not ignoring inflation. Officials worry that if they cut rates too far, the bond market could rebel, pushing up long- term interest rates and, with them, mortgage rates. In recent days, the US central bank has taken aggressive measures to boost the supply of liquidity to markets, including a new emergency finance facility for investment banks.  The S&P 500 yesterday gained 54.14 points, or 4.24 per cent, to 1,330.74. It was the biggest gain in percentage terms since October 15 2002.  ""Initially, the market was disappointed but it appears the market thinks that if the Fed just needs to cut by 75bp, things may not be as bad as feared,"" said Doug Peta, strategist at J&W Seligman. ""It means the Fed can save some bullets.""  The S&P investment bank index advanced 16.7 per cent as investors were buoyed by better-than-expected results from Lehman Brothers and Goldman Sachs. European markets closed ahead, with the FTSE 100 up 3.5 per cent.  Ted Wieseman, Morgan Stanley economist, said: ""The FOMC meeting actually ended up being a relatively minor event compared to the day's main theme - a big sigh of relief about financial sector stability.""  Yields on short-term Treasuries rose as investors turned away from the safe haven of government debt and bought mortgage and corporate bonds. The dollar strengthened.  Hank Paulson, US Treasury secretary, admitted that ""the economy has turned down sharply"", though he avoided the word recession. He told NBC the ""big focus on the part of all policymakers is to minimise the spillover to the real economy"".  Building permits fell 7.8 per cent in February. Investors speculated that a 30 per cent capital surcharge on Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the government-sponsored housing financiers, could be lifted, sending their shares up 27 per cent and 26 per cent, respectively ",Stocks surge on Fed cut.,2008-03-18,The Financial Times
766,272.0,2008-03-19,"Global stock markets rallied strongly yesterday as a cut in US interest rates and better earnings than expected from investment banks Goldman Sachs and Lehman Brothers helped shore up sagging investor confidence.  The US central bank lowered the Fed funds rate by 75 basis points to 2.25 per cent, disappointing many investors who had been hoping for a full percentage point cut. Two members of the Federal Open Market Committee wanted less aggressive action.  James Knightley, economist at ING, said liquidity conditions and market sentiment would need to improve significantly to prevent the Fed having to come in and cut rates further.  He said: ""Default risk and counterparty concerns will linger on and with further writedowns still probable, access to credit will continue to be constrained.  ""This presents an ongoing risk to the economic outlook and so we expect the Fed to push the Fed funds target rate down to 1 per cent in the coming months.""  Credit spreads narrowed sharply on both sides of the Atlantic, with the investment-grade iTraxx Europe and CDX North America indices both falling back from the record highs struck on Monday.  And there was a much more positive tone to equity markets as financials rallied strongly. By mid-afternoon in New York, the S&P 500 was up 1.7 per cent and the Dow Jones Industrial Average was 1.4 per cent higher.  In Europe, the FTSE Eurofirst 300 index jumped 3.5 per cent as the banking sub-index jumped 6 per cent.  Asian stocks staged a more modest rally, with the Nikkei 225 in Tokyo bouncing 1.5 per cent from Monday's 2 1/2-year low, Hong Kong gaining 1.4 per cent and Singapore 1.6 per cent.  But Chinese equities fell 4 per cent to an eight-month low after Wen Jiabao, the premier, pledged ""forceful"" measures to fight inflation, prompting fears of higher interest rates.  After the market closed, the People's Bank of China lifted the bank reserve requirement ratio by 50 basis points to a record 15.5 per cent, the fifteenth increase since mid-2006.  Jing Ulrich, chairman of China equities at JPMorgan, noted that despite inflation running at an 11-year high, China had not raised interest rates since December.  She said: ""This would suggest that China is taking a 'wait and see' approach on interest rate policy, perhaps because the most recent spike in inflation was heavily influenced by a one-off event - record snowstorms that caused supply shortages and transport bottlenecks.""  However, signs of stress remained in the money markets as three-month sterling Libor hit a fresh high for the year of 5.97 per cent, and the three-month euro rate rose for a 15th successive session.  An additional Euros 25bn was pumped into eurozone money markets by the European Central Bank  Lena Komileva, economist at Tullett Prebon, warned that credit markets remained squeezed as recent events ""outline the seriousness of a situation where liquidity problems can quickly translate into insolvency.""  She said: ""As we near the Easter holiday and the quarter-end, this has underpinned banks' preference to hoard cash and their reluctance to take on even good quality credit on their balance sheet"".  Government bonds suffered a steep sell-off as stock markets rallied. The yield on the 10-year US Treasury rose 11 basis points to 3.40 per cent, while the two-year yield added 18bp to 1.52 per cent.  In Europe, the two-year Schatz yield jumped 18bp to 3.13 per cent while the 10-year Japanese government bond yield climbed 5bp to 1.32 per cent.  In the currency markets , the dollar remained under pressure against the euro although it regained some ground against the yen and the Swiss franc.  Sterling bounced off Monday's record low against the euro as robust UK inflation data encouraged investors to scale back expectations for further interest rate cuts by the Bank of England.  In commodities , oil prices rose as the Fed rate cut helped to fuel expectations of increased demand. April West Texas Intermediate rose Dollars 2.12 to Dollars 107.80 a barrel.  Gold trimmed an early advance but managed to hold above the psychologically important Dollars 1,000 an ounce level and base metals prices rallied following Monday's hefty losses.

767,273.0,2008-03-19,"The fire sale of Bear Stearns, the US investment bank, brings the credit crisis to a new, more dangerous phase. Many market participants seem to be hoping for a short-term miracle from the Federal Reserve to end the turmoil. They will be disappointed.  Bear Stearns could not borrow because its creditor banks and counterparties use modern risk management systems that require them to hold enough capital to meet potential losses on their portfolios. When the ""value at risk"" of its portfolio rises, a bank must either raise more capital to support the additional risk or shrink the risk (by selling assets, demanding larger ""haircuts"" - cash safety margins - from investors or not rolling over loans).  As the credit crisis has continued, banks' measured risks have rocketed. At the same time, banks have suffered losses that have depleted their capital. This combination of factors has brought the US financial system to its knees. Credit lines are being withdrawn as banks try to ratchet down the risks they face. That Bear Stearns could fetch only $2 per share, when a week earlier it was trading at $70 per share, is the best available proof that banks' appetite for risk-taking has vanished. This could be the beginning of a massive global credit crunch.  Several conclusions follow. First, since the largest intermediaries do not have enough capital to support their measured risks, they will keep trying to shrink their balance sheets unless they can rebuild their capital (or, magically, their perceived risk falls). This explains why the Fed's liquidity measures such as the term auction facility, the term securities lending facility and the new primary dealer credit facility are likely to be temporary patches that do not stop the distress.  Banks want to shrink risk exposure, not maintain or expand it. Liquidity support by the Fed is an invitation to borrow from the central bank for on-lending to others - that is, to expand balance sheets. On the contrary, the banks and brokers want to contract their balance sheets.  Second, the Fed is not well-equipped to deal with this problem. To create real capital it would need to make outright purchases of impaired collateral at above-market prices. This would amount to a publicly funded shareholder bail-out. This is not the central bank's job and the Fed knows it.  Third, recapitalising the banks should be the priority. For a start, the suspension of dividends (even by well-capitalised banks) will free up lending capacity. However, this is unlikely to be enough and will take time. New capital needs to be found soon. Existing shareholders will no doubt resist dilution, but they must not be allowed to stand in the way of a solution. These are the very shareholders who allowed their banks to create the current mess, which now threatens to cripple the financial system.  The quickest solution is to identify some buyers before the next spiral down. One obvious set of buyers are the Middle Eastern sovereign wealth funds. They have stepped up once and were burnt on their first wave of investments. But since the January meeting of the Fed's open market committee, when the central bank made it abundantly clear that it will try everything possible to stave off collapse, oil prices have risen from roughly $92 a barrel to $109 (as of March 18). Other commodity prices have also risen over this period. Given the deteriorating prospects for the global economy over this time, a plausible interpretation is that some of the financing that might have gone to the financial institutions has instead been directed towards buying commodities such as oil. This portfolio reallocation represents a pure windfall for the oil producers.  Middle Eastern oil countries produce roughly 25m barrels of oil a day. If they could be persuaded to recycle $4 a barrel of the $17 price run up since the January Federal open market committee meeting, this would represent $4bn of capital that could be deployed; Bear Stearns was sold for $250m. Admittedly, this is a conversation for Condoleezza Rice, secretary of state, and not Hank Paulson, Treasury secretary, to have. But it is worth recalling that the firms that bailed out Long-Term Capital Management in 1998 in fact profited nicely, and relatively quickly. Conversely, if a full-blown credit crunch ensues, the fallout to the world economy is likely to be large enough to pull the price of oil back down sharply.  Finally, in case our proposal sounds unpalatable, it should be compared with the alternative in which the banking system deteriorates to the point where a public recapitalisation be-comes inevitable. Direct government ownership should be the last resort but failure to move soon could make it the only option left on the table.

768,274.0,2008-03-19,"Uncertainty reigned in the markets on Wednesday as rumours of further casualties in the financial sector offset another encouraging set of results from US banks and positive news on the housing front.  There was plenty of debate about the Federal Reserve's decision to cut interest rates by 75 basis points on Tuesday, rather than the full percentage point markets had been factoring in.  Peter Possing Andersen, senior analyst at Danske Bank, said that the forward-looking part of the Fed's accompanying statement left little doubt that the Fed continued to be biased towards further easing, although there were important signals that the Fed would be moving forward in a more cautious manner.  ""Generally, Tuesday's action indicates that the Fed is not willing to satisfy market expectations at any level or at any given cost of long-term credibility,"" said Mr Andersen.  ""Moreover, this is a signal that the FOMC is now willing to take charge of market expectations in an attempt to avoid being forced into an undesirable steep path of monetary easing.""  US and European equity markets struggled to build on Tuesday's hefty gains, despite robust figures from Morgan Stanley and news that regulators had eased capital requirements for home finance companies Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, allowing them to inject more money into the mortgage market.  By midday in New York, the S&P 500 index was flat, a day after surging 4.2 per cent - its biggest one-day rally for five years. the Dow Jones Industrial Average was 0.2 per cent lower.  In Europe, the FTSE Eurofirst 300 index fell 0.9 per cent, with Sweden's Ericsson down 7.8 per cent after issuing a profits warning. Steep losses for UK banks in early trade prompted Britain's financial authorities to issue a statement declaring that they were not aware of problems at any bank and would investigate share price moves.  But Asian stocks rallied across the board, with the Nikkei 225 Average climbing 2.5 per cent, Hong Kong 2.3 per cent and Sydney 4 per cent. Even Shanghai managed to break a five-day losing streak as it gained 2.5 per cent.  There was a better tone to credit spreads as the investment grade iTraxx Europe index fell 13.5 basis points to 119.5bp and the CDX North America index dropped 10bp to 151bp. Both measures touched record highs on Monday.  Peter Oppenheimer at Goldman Sachs, said he believed the ""credit clouds"" were beginning to clear.  ""Supportive policy actions by the Fed, in terms of both short-term funding provision and interest rate policy, should help foster stability in the credit markets going forward,"" he said. ""The trend will be towards tighter spreads over the next couple months.""  But there was no sign of a let-up in money market strains as interbank lending rates continued to rise.  Three-month sterling Libor rose to 5.98 per cent, its ninth successive increase and the highest level this year. The three-month euro rate pushed up to 4.67 per cent and three-month dollar Libor increased by more than 5bp - its largest one-day rise for two months.  Government bonds continued to benefit from uncertainty about the economic outlook and volatility in other asset prices.  The Treasury yield curve flattened as the two-year yield fell 2 basis points to 1.61 per cent and the thirty-year fell 10bp to 4.25 per cent. The gap between the two maturities was close to 300bp just a few days ago - the widest for four years.  In Europe, the ten-year Bund yield fell 2bp to 3.74 per cent while the yield on the 10-year Japanese government bond fell 4bp to 1.26 per cent.  In the currency markets, the dollar came under renewed pressure against the yen as an overnight bounce against the Japanese unit following the Fed rate cut ran out of steam.  Sterling dropped sharply as the rumours that a UK bank was in trouble were compounded by increased expectations for near-term interest rate cuts by the Bank of England.  Commodities fell sharply across the board as funds reduced their risk, with gold retreating below the $1,000 an ounce level and silver sliding to a three-week low.

769,275.0,2003-05-07,"Fed's new tools shape expectation - The central bank betrays a fear of deflation by splitting its assessment, says Alan Beattie. The Fed's unusually detailed outlook on the economy that accompanied its decision on interest rates yesterday represents a significant step towards greater transparency in one of the more cryptic central banks. The Fed's decision to split its balance of risks assessment into separate judgments about growth and inflation was hailed by former Fed policymakers as a welcome move towards explaining its thinking. But the fact that it took such an unexpected step suggests it was prodded by concern about deflation, and took a calculated risk in making its views so explicit. The normal assessment of the balance of risks to the economy - which several years ago replaced an even more opaque statement that gave the ""policy bias"" of the committee - weighs the risks of too-low growth against the risk of too-high inflation. But these choices appear redundant at a time when inflation is falling dangerously close to zero, and the Fed is anxious to stop deflationary psychology taking hold. Janet Yellen, a former Fed governor now at the University of California at Berkeley, says: ""A statement where the only possibilities are growth being too weak or inflation being too strong doesn't really characterise the current situation."" By splitting out the assessment of growth and inflation risks, the Fed has given itself more tools to manage expectations. With yesterday's statement, it signalled that higher growth in the absence of imminent inflationary pressure would not necessarily cause it to raise interest rates. Economists said the implicit focus on avoiding deflation was extraordinarily strong. As Robert DiClemente at Citigroup put it: ""Policymakers are comfortable that chances for better growth have improved. That judgment could have run the risk of igniting premature expectations of higher policy-driven interest rates. Today, the FOMC has severed that logic."" In this sense, the statement can be read as a mild version of the strategy that the Fed has already discussed internally: a binding commitment to keep interest rates on hold until the risk of deflation has been banished. ""This statement appears designed to keep bond yields low to protect the stock market,"" Prof Yellen says. That strategy was not without risks: the overall judgment that the risks were weighted towards weakness might have spooked the markets. But if the Fed's intention was as Prof Yellen surmises, it worked just fine yesterday, with interest-rate expectations falling with little dent in the stock market's hefty gains. Other former Fed officials joined Prof Yellen in praising the subtlety of the move. Stephen Cecchetti, former chief economist at the New York Fed, said it was a significant improvement. Larry Meyer, a former Fed governor now at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said: ""This is an intelligent way of signalling that the threshold for cutting rates in coming months has become lower."" But both Mr Cecchetti and Mr Meyer questioned why an overall assessment of risks, adding inflation and growth, was published when separate judgments had been given. ""The only question I would raise is the need to publish a potentially confusing and redundant final sentence (in the statement),"" Mr Meyer said. Indeed, maintaining the overall risk assessment raised the possibility that the disaggregated version would be discontinued if the deflationary threat goes away. But if the pleased reaction of former Fed officials means anything, it might well be here to stay. US Edition 2. ",Fed's new tools shape expectation.,2003-05-06,The Financial Times
770,276.0,2003-05-07,"The Federal Reserve, in its decision to leave its primary interest rate on hold at 1.25 per cent and to fudge its statement, followed the lead set by Alan Greenspan in his testimony before Congress last week. The Federal open market committee is hoping for a noticeable improvement in economic activity now that the war in Iraq and $40 a barrel oil are behind us. So far, consumer confidence surveys aside, the only sign of such a postwar rebound has been a more buoyant stock market and tighter credit spreads. The Treasury market is another story. The recent readings on production and employment - and the balance of data since last November - have been disappointing. With interest rates so low, and the prospect that unorthodox monetary policy might unnerve investors, the FOMC is waiting for a clearer read of the postwar data. That is reasonable. But it is hard to see how the upside and downside risks to growth are roughly equal. The Fed says that ""the probability of an unwelcome substantial fall in inflation, though minor, exceeds that of a pickup in inflation"". In that case, it seems obvious that the balance of risks between maintaining price stability and sustainable economic growth are weighted towards weakness. The tortuous wording of the Fed's statement must reflect disagreements on the FOMC. But, word play aside, if the data remain weak the Fed is going to have to act. London Edition 2.

772,278.0,1990-11-14,"STERLING GAINED a little ground on the foreign exchanges yesterday, despite gloomy economic news and an attack on British government policy towards Europe by Sir Geoffrey Howe, who recently resigned as UK deputy prime minister. The threat to Mrs Margaret Thatcher's position as prime minister showed no sign of abating, amid rumours of a challenge to her leadership of the Conservative party. UK economic news was weaker than expected and tended to confirm a trend towards recession. Industrial production fell 0.4 per cent in September, against a revised drop of 0.6 per cent in August. City analysts were looking for a fall of 0.3 per cent. Manufacturing industry, stripping out energy production, appeared to be even weaker, falling 1.1 per cent, compared with 0.9 per cent the previous month. Forecasts pointed towards a drop of about 0.5 per cent. Dealers said that the data pointed towards a cut in UK bank base rates, although the pound's weak position in the exchange rate mechanism of the European Monetary System restricts the authorities room for manoeuvre. Sterling's overall position at the bottom of the ERM showed little change. The pound improved against the D-Mark, rising to DM2.9075 from DM2.9050. It also gained 20 points to Dollars 1.9645, while rising to FFr9.7775 from FFr9.7625; to SFr2.4600 from SFr2.4525; and to Y254.50 from Y252.50. On Bank of England figures sterling's index eased 0.1 to 93.9. The dollar traded quietly, waiting for any signs of monetary easing after yesterday's meeting of the Federal Open Market committee. Mr John Taylor, a member of the White House council of economic advisers, said that long-term interest rates should fall as a result of the US budget cutting agreement. He added that there was a risk of recession and that the Fed's stated policy would imply lower rates if the economy weakened substantially. At last night's close in London the dollar had eased to a record closing low of DM1.4800 from DM1.4805, but was a little firmer against most other currencies, rising to FFr4.9775 from FFr4.9750; to SFr1.2525 from SFr1.2500; and to Y129.55 from Y128.70. The dollar's index was unchanged at 60.1. This month's rise in the Bundesbank's Lombard rate has provided support for the D-Mark. In Frankfurt the Bundesbank did not intervene when the dollar was fixed at a record low of DM1.4788 against DM1.4793 on Monday. The German currency was also strong in terms of the Japanese yen, rising to Y87.55 from Y86.95 at the London close. The D-Mark improved to FFr3.3612 from FFr3.3607 at the Paris fixing, but higher Italian interest rates helped the lira recover. In Milan the D-Mark fell to L752.21 from a record L752.76 at the fixing. ",Foreign Exchanges: Nervous pound improves,1990-11-13,The Financial Times
773,279.0,1990-11-14,"A RALLY in the British government bond market, based partly on weak industrial production figures, petered out in the afternoon as worries about the leadership of the British government reasserted themselves. However, dealers reported genuine institutional buying over the last two days, based on the confirmation of UK economic weakness. One benchmark government bond - the 11 3/4 per cent of 2003-7 - closed the day yielding 11.41 per cent, compared with about 11.42 per cent at the previous close. More positive interpretations of prospects for real interest rates in the UK appear to have been behind a sharp jump in index-linked issues - particularly at the long-end of the market. The index linked issue maturing in 2024 jumped an unusually sharp 1 5/32 point to 92 5/16 . IN GERMANY, there was a similar picture, though for differing reasons. A continuation of Monday's largely technical rally in the morning was reversed by the close, with the key bund futures contract on the London International Financial Futures Exchange closing at 82.08, against Monday's 82.07, and it weakened further after hours to 82.04. Reports suggesting larger borrowing by the Federal government next year - of up to DM150bn, even after some DM30bn-35bn in spending cuts - depressed the market. So did the prospect of a nudge upwards in money market rates by the Bundesbank today. The new 9 per cent Bund closed at 100.08 to yield 8.983 per cent, up fractionally on the day. US Treasury bonds moved broadly higher yesterday as signs of a further deterioration in the US manufacturing sector added to the market's bullishness. Longer-dated maturities posted strong gains throughout the day following the release of US industrial production figures for October, which fell 0.8 per cent, further than the expected 0.5 per cent.

The gains were less pronounced at the short end of the yield curve, where the two-year note was only 1/32 higher for a yield of 7.57 per cent. The Fed refrained from operating in the open market and Fed Funds, the rate at which banks lend to each other, traded at 7 per cent through most of the day. However, the lack of intervention did not have any policy implications. THE FRENCH government bond market ended generally firmer, although the strength was concentrated at the long end of the market, causing the yield curve to flatten. The 10-year contract on the Matif futures exchange in Paris ended up 32 basis points at 98.38. But short interest rates came under pressure amid speculation that the Bundesbank could tighten German rates again soon, testing the strength of the franc. The strong performance of a FFr3bn 8-year Eurobond issued by the Kingdom of Spain prompted activity at that area of the yield curve, as underwriters covered short positions they had taken.

779,285.0,1999-03-31,"The US Federal Reserve left short-term interest rates unchanged yesterday. The central bank's policymaking Federal Open Market Committee held the rate on overnight loans between banks at 4.75 per cent - its level since November. The decision comes amid continuing signs of strong economic activity in the US and low inflation. The Fed Reserve cut rates three times last Autumn to protect the economy from a slump caused by global financial turmoil. The Fed did not indicate yesterday whether it had changed its ""bias"" towards tighter or looser monetary policy depending on the perceived balance of risks. The Fed has not announced any change in its policy stance since December when it maintained a neutral bias adopted in November. Since then the central bank has altered its disclosure policy so that any significant changes in its bias is publicly announced. Yesterday's position suggested the Fed remained neutral. The decision was announced after a survey suggested consumer optimism, critical to buoyant economic activity in the US, continued to rise as Americans shrugged off last year's concerns about the impact of global weakness. Their expectations of further improvements in economic conditions also rose on the back of a strong job market. The Conference Board, a private sector research group, said its index of consumer confidence edged up in March for the fifth consecutive month, to 133.9 from an upwardly revised 133.1 in February. The expectations index rose to 104.7 from 103.4 in February. Edward McKelvy, senior economist with Goldman Sachs in New York, said: ""The labour market is still looking pretty friendly from the point of view of someone who is looking for a job.""

More than 48 per cent in the survey of 5,000 households said jobs were plentiful, up from last month, and the proportion of consumers claiming jobs were ""hard to get"" remained at an all-time low of 11.8 per cent.

European markets were quiet, distracted by discussions on interest rates in the US and events in Kosovo. Russian prime minister Yevgeny Primakov's talks with Slobodon Milosovic, the Serb leader, gave a little boost in late trading. By late morning, as the Fed continued talks, the 30-year benchmark Treasury bond had gained 3/8 to 94, sending the yield down to 5.616 per cent.

The early rise at the long end of the curve was seen as a partial unwinding from Monday's sharp sell-off as buyers returned cautiously to the market.

""These flight to quality bids don't last and the Dow 10,000 put pressure on the [bond] market,"" said David Ging, market strategist at Donaldson, Lufkin &Jenrette in New York.

The markets await several key reports later this week, including the employment survey on Friday. European markets were ""surprise-free,"" said Alison Cottrell at PaineWebber, ""a continuation of the past few days"". The short end of the European yield curve, especially two-year paper, saw continued firmness in the expectation of interest rate cuts by the European Central Bank next month. The ECB's case for cutting rates will have gained sharpness after the European Commission's downward revision yesterday of euro-zone gross domestic product growth forecasts for 1999. The Commission cut its euro-zone growth forecast from 2.6 per cent to 2.2 per cent, in line with OECD forecasts, although some analysts still consider the number optimistic. In any case, it provided ammunition for those supporting a rate cut. They also saw some hope in Hans Tietmeyer's comments late on Monday that ""continuity does not signify immobility"", which they interpreted as ""not discouraging the expectation of a rate cut"". This represents a subtle shift by officials over the past month as weaknesses have emerged in euro-zone economies. Comments yesterday by Eugenio Domingo Solans, a member of the ECB, also pointed to an easing of monetary policy. In Germany, the 10-year bund futures contract closed up at 113.80, after late gains, while in the cash market the yield on the 10-year bund was 4.04 per cent. UK gilts ended up by a wafer. The June gilt future settled at 117, up slightly on the day in shallow trading. In Japan, weak data helped Japanese government bonds rally as equities lost ground on the last but one day before the end-of-year reporting season, when the country's troubled banks must post capital adequacy ratios in line with international standards. A strong stock market helps banks and others achieve healthier balance sheets. Yesterday's data underlines the problems hitting the Japanese economy. There has been such an flood of weak data that JGBs have become immune to the flow. But the latest figures were so bad that government securities gained firmly. Unemployment reached a record 4.6 per cent in February, up from 4.4 per cent in January, while household spending fell in February month-on-month, dropping to a 13-year low. In Tokyo, the benchmark 10-year 203 JGB rallied by 7 basis points pushing the yield down to 1.58 per cent.

The benchmark 10-year cash JGB tumbled following a six-day rally which had pushed yields to a four-year low of 0.955 per cent earlier in the week. The market also remained under pressure as investors stayed on sidelines ahead of an auction of Y1,900bn worth of five-year bonds offered by the Ministry of Finance on Thursday. The new issue is expected to have a coupon set at 0.3 per cent, a level likely to generate appetite from the market, according to analysts. Bond prices had surged following the government's release of a key economic package last week which did not include explicit extra fiscal spending to support the ailing economy. Traders said the market was likely to stay well supported in coming weeks. The key December 10-year JGB futures contract fell 0.18 to 141.97, while the benchmark 243rd 10-year cash JGB fell 0.181 to 101.122, pushing up the yield by 0.020 to 0.975 per cent.

783,289.0,2003-10-29,"The Federal Reserve had no reason to change interest rates and saw no reason to change its statement significantly. Its view on the balance of risks to growth and inflation/ disinflation remains a fair reflection of the fundamentals. But, as encouraging data continue to accumulate, the policy stance will only become harder to explain. Questions about the recovery's sustainability next year have not gone away. As the Fed noted in the one tweak in its statement, the labour market appears to be stabilising. But employment and wage growth will be required to sustain household spending as the impact of tax cuts and mortgage refinancing fades. Meanwhile, there are positive signs of business confidence - including the flurry of mergers and acquisitions activity - but we await hard evidence of strong business demand. Part of the problem is the lack of business pricing power. The core consumer price index fell to a multi-year low in September. With unemployment above 6 per cent and capacity utilisation below 75 per cent, there is plenty of slack. The Fed's repeated judgment that the risk of disinflation will be the predominant concern for the foreseeable future and that policy accommodation can be maintained for a considerable period is reasonable. Yet the market is pricing in more than 100 basis points of tightening next year. Defining a range for inflation that the FOMC considers consistent with price stability remains the common sense option that Greenspan &Co resist. That would allow market participants to focus on data rather than rhetoric. As it is, the rhetoric suggests there is value at the short end of the curve but actions speak louder than words.

784,290.0,2003-10-29,"The US Federal Reserve left interest rates on hold at 1 per cent yesterday and signalled that the strong growth over the summer had not caused it to shift its signals about future rate movements. The decision to keep rates on hold was almost universally expected. But most attention focused on the statement that the Fed's open market committee released with the decision, which was almost unchanged from previous meetings, defying speculation that the Fed might begin to soften its commitment to holding rates at a low level. The statement maintained the stance taken by the committee in previous meetings that the potential damage from too-low inflation was its predominant concern and that the risks surrounding inflation continued to be on the downside. It also retained the wording used at the previous two meetings that ""policy accommodation can be maintained for a considerable period"", suggesting that the Fed wanted to see more evidence of sustained growth and inflationary pressure before it started signalling future rises in interest rates. The one change in the statement was a tentative acknowledgement of the stronger performance seen from the US jobs market over the past month, following the increase in payroll jobs in September and subsequent falls in new claims for jobless benefits. While the Fed's previous statement in September said that the labour market had been weakening, yesterday's said it ""appears to be stabilising"". Long-term interest rates, which had been drifting up after the release of encouraging economic data in the run-up to yesterday's meeting, reversed after the announcement. The dollar slid as the prospect of lower rates on US assets hurt the currency. Earlier, the dollar had set a fresh three-year low against the yen in Asian trading. Data released before the meeting suggested that the prospects for capital spending and consumption were both good. Durable goods orders rose 0.8 per cent in September, below many economists' forecasts. But orders data for August, which had shown a 1.1 per cent drop, were revised to show a drop of just 0.1 per cent, suggesting there was more underlying strength in investment than previously thought. The durable goods orders raised hopes that business investment, for so long the missing element of the recovery, was at last showing sustained strength. Non-defence capital goods, which are often seen as a proxy for business investment, rose 3.9 per cent last month. A regular survey of consumer sentiment by the Conference Board showed an unexpectedly strong improvement, with the report's headline index rising to 81.1 in October from a revised 77 the previous month. Markets, Page 28 Wall Street gains, Page 30 For continuing reaction to the FOMC decision, see www.ft.com/markets Europe outlook brightens Europe's fragile recovery showed signs of picking up speed yesterday with a key German business confidence indicator improving for the sixth month running in October, writes Tony Major in Frankfurt.The Ifo economic institute said its German business climate index had jumped to its highest level since February 2001, driven partly by a brighter assessment of current economic conditions. The rise coincided with improvements in business sentiment in Belgium and the Netherlands, although in Italy confidence slipped for the second month in a row. The findings were hailed by Otmar Issing, European Central Bank chief economist, as pointers to stronger growth in the second half of the year. US Edition 1.

789,295.0,2008-05-01,"The dollar rebounded and Wall Street stocks staged a solid advance on Thursday as investors digested yet another batch of US economic data and attempted to decipher the implications of the Federal Reserve's rate cut and statement on Wednesday. However, activity was muted by the closure of much of continental Europe and Asia for public holidays. On Wednesday, the Fed cut its key interest rate by 25 basis points to 2 per cent, but offered no clear direction about future rate moves. The remarks were viewed by many as oblique and triggered a welter of analyst comment. ""Given the market's reaction to the FOMC rate decision, it seems it really did not know what to do with it,"" said Rudy Narvas, senior analyst at 4Cast Economics. ""The statement . . . seemed to be a touch more dovish than the last, but kept the window of opportunity open enough for the Fed to offer policy easing if necessary."" Lena Komileva, G7 economist at Tullett Prebon, said the Fed had now taken the stance of an ""active observer"", against a backdrop of adverse developments taking place in real economic growth, financial markets and inflation. She added: ""A 2 per cent level for the Fed funds rate does not represent a natural end of this easing cycle."" But Dean Maki and Julian Callow at Barclays Capital took a different tack. ""We believe that this was the last Fed rate cut in this cycle and expect the Fed to keep rates on hold for most of the next year before raising them in early 2009,"" they said. The day's US economic releases appeared to back that view. Personal consumption grew by 0.4 per cent in March from the previous month, twice as much as expected, while manufacturing activity continued to contract in April but at a slower pace than had been feared. The Institute for Supply Management's manufacturing index for April came in at 48.6, unchanged on the month, against expectations that it would dip to 48. A reading below 50 indicates contraction. However, the employment component of the report dropped from 49.2 to 45.4, the lowest reading since May 2003. Concerns about the labour market had already been heightened by an unexpectedly large 35,000 increase in initial jobless claims in the latest week. The key US employment report for April is due out on Friday. Meanwhile, the Fed's preferred measure of inflation - the price index for core personal consumption expenditure - edged up 0.2 per cent for a year-on-year increase of 2.1 per cent - again slightly more than forecast. On the currency markets, expectations that US interest rates could be at - or at least close to - a bottom offered firm support to the dollar. The euro, by contrast, has been plagued by speculation that the deteriorating economic outlook for the eurozone will pressure the European Central Bank into lowering borrowing costs. However, Marco Annunziata, chief economist at UniCredit, noted that the Fed's more sanguine outlook had come against a background of an improvement in market sentiment and said: ""This could also support the ECB's view that the eurozone can weather the storm, experiencing little more than the cyclical downturn which was already in the cards before the crisis hit,"" he said. The euro fell to a five-week low of $1.5438, while the dollar rose 1.1 per cent against the Swiss franc and also edged up against the yen. The dollar's rebound sent commodities prices sharply lower. Gold briefly fell below $850 an ounce to touch a four-month low. West Texas Intermediate, the US benchmark oil price, fell more than $2 a barrel to trade below $111. At the start of the week, WTI hit a record high just shy of $120 a barrel. Trading in equity markets was limited by holidays.

790,296.0,2008-05-01,"US consumer spending rose more than expected in March but the bulk of the increase reflected higher costs for food and energy as real disposable income declined, a new report showed on Thursday. The economic headwinds facing consumers were also reflected in the latest report on the US labour market which registered the highest number of Americans on unemployment benefits in four years. Personal spending rose 0.4 per cent in the latest month, twice the rate forecast by economists and an improvement on the 0.1 per cent growth rate recorded the previous month. Incomes rose 0.3 per cent, roughly in line with economists' expectations after increasing by 0.5 per cent in March. Adjusted for inflation, real spending increased only 0.1 per cent, having stalled in February while inflation-adjusted disposable income fell by slightly less than 0.1 per cent. The core PCE price index, the Federal Reserve's preferred inflationary measure which strips out food and energy costs, rose 0.2 per cent as expected, marking an increase of 2.1 per cent over the year, a fraction above the Fed's stated comfort level of 2 per cent. The US economy grew at a paltry 0.6 per cent rate in the first three months of this year as consumer spending slowed to a crawl and investment in capital goods and residential infrastructure contracted sharply. Real personal consumption expenditure increased at only a 1 per cent rate in the first quarter, the weakest growth rate since 2001 In its policy statement accompanying Wednesday's quarter point interest rate cut, the Federal Reserve again sounded a warning about the risks of inflation, emphasising that uncertainty about the outlook for rising prices remained high. ""Although readings on core inflation have improved somewhat, energy and other commodity prices have increased, and some indicators of inflation expectations have risen in recent months,"" the Federal Open Market Committee statement said. The Fed's statement was perceived by many economists to have been much more doveish than expected, drawing attention to ""subdued"" spending and labour market weakness. The number of Americans remaining on unemployment benefits rose to the highest level since 2004 as employers cut back on hiring amid an uncertain outlook for the US economy. Continuing claims for unemployment benefits jumped by 74,000 to 3.019m in the latest week while first-time jobless claims rose 35,000 to 380,000. The increase in initial claims was much greater than economists had forecast but this gauge tends to be volatile and fell by about the same amount the previous week. The four-week moving average, a smoother barometer of the labour market, declined from 370,250 to 363,750.

And, to underline its eagerness to prevent financial problems from the computer date changeover to the next century, the committee also said it was leaving its policy ""bias"", which indicates what the next move in rates might be, unchanged, at neutral. But the Fed hinted that this position was only temporary and indicated that, after the Y2K computer bug hurdle, concerns about the frenetic pace of domestic growth would dominate. ""Based on the available evidence the Committee remains concerned with the possibility that increases in demand will continue to exceed the growth in potential supply, even after taking account of the remarkable rise in productivity growth. Such trends could foster inflationary imbalances that would undermine the economy's exemplary performance,"" it said. Most economists believe the Fed would probably have raised rates at its meeting yesterday were it not for lingering fears of financial disruption from the century date change. The Fed is committed to maintaining plentiful liquidity in case of funds shortages over the New Year period and an interest rate increase might have complicated that task. The central bank had been expected to signal a bias towards tightening at yesterday's meeting but policymakers were concerned that the possibility of a Y2K disruption, however small, required the central bank to adopt a more cautious approach. An increase still seems highly likely after the next FOMC meeting on February 2. Money market rates indicate investors are betting on at least a 0.5 percentage point increase in short-term rates over the first half of the year. There are scant signs of inflation in the US economy. In the year to November, core consumer prices rose by a meagre 2.1 per cent, a rate virtually unchanged over the last year. But Fed officials have expressed mounting concern in recent weeks that the rapid pace of US expansion in the last six months is not sustainable and will eventually produce an acceleration in wages and prices. In the three months to September, gross domestic product expanded at an annual rate of 5.5 per cent. That pace has slowed a little in the final quarter of the year, but most private sector economic forecasts put the rate of growth at still above 4 per cent. Domestic demand growth is rattling along at an even faster pace - last month, for example, retail sales grew by 0.9 per cent from a month earlier. Even some formerly sceptical Fed officials acknowledge growing evidence that technological and structural changes have raised the economy's long-term potential rate of growth. But policymakers consider the pace too fast for inflationary comfort. The Fed has raised rates three times this year by a combined 0.75 percentage points. Copyright Financial Times Limited 1999.

793,299.0,1999-12-22,"US Treasuries posted only modest gains yesterday after the Federal Reserve's Open Market Committee left interest rates unchanged in its last meeting of the year, and announced that it had no bias for future tightening of monetary policy. The meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee did not make a statement until after European and Asian markets closed, causing Monday's dearth of trading activity to continue. With interest rates in the US, the UK and continental Europe expected to rise early next year, bond analysts from most institutions are predicting no end to the bear market until the second half of 2000. Investors are likely to avoid shorter-dated bonds where spreads will carry on widening, and instead focus on buying longer maturities. Apart from predictions on the outcome of the FOMC meeting, the market had little data to trade on. The firmer euro helped to support the bond markets, but liquidity did not recover from the low levels of the last week. In Frankfurt, the future on the 10-year German bund settled up 0.53 at 105.15. The future on the 10-year UK gilt rallied during the day but still ended the trading session down 0.1 at 112.70. The Bank of England's Monetary Policy Committee will release its final GDP and balance of payments figures for 1999 at 9.30am today, which could affect the performance of the gilt markets for the rest of the week. In midday trading on Wall Street, the benchmark 30-year US Treasury bond was 5/32 higher at 96, pushing its yield down to 6.428 per cent. Similarly, the 10-year note gained 3/16 to 97 5/8, to yield 6.331 per cent, while the five-year note edged up 5/32 to 98 1/2 to yield 6.233 per cent. Saumil Parikh, analyst at Warburg, Dillon Read, said bond investors' restrained reaction to the news was appropriate. ""It's clear that the Fed is not entering the new year with a neutral bias. They highlighted all the same problems with the economy - namely the build up in supply and inflationary pressures,"" he noted. None of the leading dealers expected the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates at yesterday's meeting, given the proximity of the millennium change-over and the accompanying fears about a lack of liquidity in financial markets. However, many predicted the body would shift to a bias for future tightening of monetary policy to bring a speeding US economy under control. The market has already priced in a 25 basis points increase in the Federal funds rate, which many believe will come at the FOMC's next meeting scheduled for early February. The economic board of Bond Market Association, a securities industries group with a broad Wall Street membership, has predicted two such increases next year that would lift the Fed funds rate to 6.00 per cent. Although headline economic data has yet to reveal any signs of inflation in the economy, those expectations have firmed in recent weeks with new reports that reveal its ongoing strength. Retail sales figures reported for November were almost double analysts' expectations when they were released last Tuesday, touching off a week-long slide in Treasury prices. Yields have since climbed above the 6.40 per cent level that had served as a recent ceiling. The yield on the 30-year benchmark at yesterday's close, 6.440 per cent, was its highest level since October 1997.

794,300.0,1989-11-15,"Wall Street THE EQUITY market struggled to remain steady throughout yesterday's session, but finally buckled under the weight of weak economic data, a late downturn in the bond market and general apathy, writes Janet Bush in New York. The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed 16.18 points lower at 2,610.25 on sluggish volume of 143m shares. The index had closed 0.82 points higher on Monday at 2,626.43. Selling was encouraged in the afternoon, as the futures market reacted to early November car sales, which were the weakest for more than two years. For most of this year, the equity market has reacted positively to soft economic data, because of the hope of lower interest rates, but weak statistics are now regarded negatively. A substantial number of people in the market are worried about recession. The Dow rallied only briefly after the morning's economic reports. Industrial production fell 0.7 per cent in October, a much larger fall than expected. However, much of the drop was due to the Boeing strike and production disruptions after the California earthquake, particularly in the computer industry. The US Federal Reserve said production would have been little changed, had it not been for these special factors. Retail sales fell 1 per cent last month, in line with expectations based on already published weak statistics for car sales in October. Excluding cars, retail sales rose 0.2 per cent. The Federal Open Market Committee, which sets the Fed's target for Fed Funds, met yesterday and the central bank's open market operations were watched carefully. The Fed had been expected to drain reserves from the banking system, with Fed Funds trading some way below 8 1/2 per cent - believed to be the Fed's new target since its easing move last week. However, the Fed refrained from operating in the market when Fed Funds were trading at 8 3/8 per cent, suggesting to some a measure of tolerance for this level. It is difficult to tell exactly where the Fed wants Funds to trade on the basis of one day's market operation, however, and some felt the lack of operation was purely technical. This talk had little impact on equities, although late softness in long-dated Treasuries, after a weaker-than-expected 30-year auction, did undermine prices late in the afternoon. Among featured stocks was Microsoft, which dropped Dollars 1 5/8 to Dollars 86 1/2 , reversing some of its Dollars 3 5/8 gain in over-the-counter trading on Monday. That advance had been on rumours of an agreement with IBM on a joint venture. Once this agreement had been announced late on Monday, traders started taking profits. IBM was unchanged at Dollars 98. Philip Morris fell Dollars 1 3/8 to Dollars 40 7/8 on expectations that Senator Ted Kennedy would introduce a Bill in Congress today which would impose stricter labelling requirements for cigarettes and take other measures to limit smoking. J C Penney added Dollars 1/8 to Dollars 66 7/8 after reporting third-quarter earnings of Dollars 1.65 a share - better than analysts had expected. Longview Fibre rose Dollars 2 1/8 to Dollars 68 1/2 after the company said that it had raised its quarterly dividend by 20 per cent and planned a five-for-one stock split. MGM-UA Communications added Dollars 1 3/4 to Dollars 21 on a US press report that Tele-Communications and its United Artist subsidiary might be putting together a bid for the company, possibly with Turner Broadcasting System. Mack Trucks fell Dollars 3/4 to Dollars 6 5/8 after the company reported a third-quarter loss of Dollars 2.94 a share and said that it expected a substantial loss for the fourth quarter. Canada A SMALL loss came in moderate trading in Toronto, with golds the only sector to shine. The composite index lost 6.60 to 3,943.09 as declines outweighed advances by 344 to 293. Volume was 28m shares worth CDollars 309m. The gold stocks index gained 1.8 per cent, building on the previous day's 2.4 per cent climb, as the price of bullion continued to rise. Unicorp Canada A shares fell CDollars 3/4 to CDollars 5 3/4 after it announced a series of moves, including a CDollars 53.5m rights offering and a reduction in the annual dividend rate to 20 cents from 40 cents.

795,301.0,2007-03-22,"Cub journalists are taught that ""burying the lead"" is a cardinal sin. The most important news in a story must be in the first sentence, not buried at the bottom. The market response to yesterday's communique from the Federal Reserve's open market committee was that chairman Ben Bernanke had done exactly that. Had he?  On the surface, the statement - more important than the decision to keep the Fed Funds rate at 5.25 per cent, which was expected - is hawkish. Core inflation was ""somewhat elevated"" (in January, readings had ""improved modestly""). Inflation is now the FOMC's ""predominant concern"" (whereas in January it merely said ""some inflation risks remain""). That was balanced by the removal of January's reference to ""somewhat firmer economic growth"" - but there was nothing to signal an imminent rate cut.  Then came an innocuous final sentence: ""Future policy adjustments will depend on the evolution of the outlook for both inflation and economic growth."" That is anodyne.After all, the Fed's remit isto limit inflation and foster employment. But previously, the Fed had referred to ""additional firming"" not the neutral ""policy adjustments"".  The market read this as removing the Fed's officialbias towards tightening, and therefore a signal that a rate cut is coming.  The dollar collapsed to two-year lows against the euro; bond yields shot downwards; and US stock indices rallied by about 2 per cent. Continuing the journalistic analogy: the invisible hand of the market acted like that of a good sub-editor and crossed out everything before the critical final sentence that no longer talked of additional firming. It also added a glaring headline: ""Rates are coming down"".  Bernanke may have been trying subtly to make room for manoeuvre - in case the debacle in subprime lending requires sharp easing - while maintaining in his inflation rhetoric an implicit bias towards tightening.  He probably did not wanta market response that would effectively ease monetary conditions. But markets arenot so subtle.

796,302.0,2007-03-22,"US equities and Treasury bonds raced higher and the dollar retreated after the Federal Reserve kept interest rates unchanged but removed a reference to ""additional firming"" in its post-FOMC meeting statement.  ""The Fed has not shifted toward balanced risks but it has taken one solid step away from a clear bias to tighten,"" said Alan Ruskin, chief international strategist at RBS Greenwich CapitalGreenwich Capital Markets. In mid-afternoon trade in New York, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up1.1 per cent while the Nasdaq Composite and the S&P 500 were up 1.4 per cent.  The yield on the 10-year Treasury bond was down 3.6 basis points while the dollar fell 0.4 per cent to Dollars 1.3370 against the euro.  But Rob Carnell, at ING, cautioned markets may be getting carried away. ""Whilst the amendment of the text on additional policy adjustments does perhaps take the Fed to a more neutral setting, the fact that inflation remains a problem means that we should not be rushing to forecast a bout of imminent rate cuts,"" he said.  The mood in equity markets was fairly positive even before the Fed published its statement. In Europe, the FTSE Eurofirst 300 index rose 0.3 per cent amid continued optimism about the outlook for bid and merger activity.  Asian stocks were also broadly higher, despite the closure of Japanese markets for a public holiday.  Shanghai attained a record high, less than a month after the market's 9 per cent slide helped trigger a wave of market turmoil.  Hong Kong managed a 0.8 per cent rise and Mumbai increased by 2 per cent.  Kevin Gardiner, global head of equity strategy at HSBC, believed market nerves about corporate earnings growth and the unwinding of carry trades - where investors sell low-yielding currencies to fund positions in higher-yielding assets - were overblown.  ""We see equities more than recouping their recent losses and hitting new cycle highs by year-end,"" he said. ""We do worry about valuations in parts of the emerging market bloc and about short-term leverage across trading desks. But as equity strategists, we can't get exercised about the carry trade and we think that slower US earnings growth is effectively in the price.""  Bernd Meyer, at Deutsche Bank, noted recent equity market volatility had not spilled over to analysts' earnings estimates.  The FTSE 100 index in London attained a three-week high point.

797,303.0,2007-03-22,"Economists and interest rate strategists were divided on Thursday over whether the changes in Wednesday's Federal Reserve Open Market policy statement had opened the door to rate cuts.  ""The FOMC statement was tweaked to provide a new message whose meaning will be debated for days, if not weeks,"" said Stephen Stanley, chief economist at RBS Greenwich Capital. Although the FOMC warned that inflation might ""fail to moderate as expected,"" policymakers said ""future policy adjustments will depend on the evolution of the outlook for both inflation and economic growth"".  This eliminated its previous reference to ""future tightenings"" and triggered a sharp rally on Wednesday afternoon in stocks and bonds, as traders speculated that the Fed had removed its official bias towards further tightening.  As attempts to analyse the Fed in more detail ensued, markets were more subdued on Thursday. The S&P 500 was flat after a 1.7 per cent surge on Wednesday. While bond prices were lower, the yield on the 10-year was at 4.59 per cent, above that of the two-year note's 4.57 per cent. The 10-year yield had been below the two-year yield since August of last year. Historically, when bond investors have believed the Fed would ease policy, the two-year yield has fallen below longer dated yields and resulted in a steeper yield curve.  ""The Fed's main concern is still inflation, but the new wording suggests an increased likelihood that their next move will be an easing rather than a tightening,"" said William O'Donnell, fixed income strategist at UBS.  Economists at Lehman Brothers emphasised the FOMC's concern over inflation. They said: ""Despite the small change in the boilerplate language, the remainder of the statement was either as hawkish as before or slightly more hawkish than expected. We do not view the change in language to 'future policy adjustments' as a set-up for near-term moves.""  Others said the statement had shown the FOMC was prepared to act should problems in the subprime mortgage market worsen and spill over.  Strategists at Credit Suisse said: ""Although the central bank said that its primary concern is over inflation, this change suggests that its reaction is, in fact, skewed to possible downside economic risks,"" and ""we see the re-steepening of the US curve and the weakening of the dollar as justified reactions.""

800,306.0,2001-08-22,"US leaders were on Tuesday positioning themselves for the final battle over the budget in the autumn and with an eye to next year's congressional elections. President George W. Bush, speaking in Independence, Missouri - home of late President Harry Truman - said a budget report due out on Wednesday would show ""in plain terms"" that the shrinking US budget surplus was still large enough to protect the Social Security and Medicare trust funds, and meet his priorities for education and defence. ""Our budget is in strong financial shape despite an economic slowdown that began last year,"" he said. Harry Truman, he said, had been ""a plainspoken fellow ... who brought a lot of wisdom to Washington"". Not coincidentally, perhaps, it is the image Mr Bush is seeking to project as he vacations at his Texas ranch for a month, flying to other US destinations for occasional speeches in which he refers to Washington DC as if it were a foreign country. But on Wednesday in Washington, the president's Office of Management and the Budget is to issue a mid-session budget review, containing estimates of the extent to which revenues have lagged behind projections made earlier this year. Preparing the ground for bad news, the president warned that ""inevitably, the slowing economy has resulted in slowing tax revenues, lower corporate profits and in some cases, layoffs"". But to loud applause, he said the federal budget would have the second-largest surplus in history ""because this administration took immediate action to address the downturn"". He did not mention that the surplus consisted almost entirely of Social Security funds. Democrats, who have launched their own assault on his tax and budget policies this week, were quick to respond. Gene Sperling, former Clinton economic adviser, noted in a telephone briefing on Tuesday that the Bush administration had originally tendered no plan to distribute tax returns this year, but had only agreed at the last minute to a Democratic proposal for economic stimulus. Congressman Richard Gephardt, the House Democratic leader, called the speech ""an exercise in public relations, pure and simple"". The OMB report would demonstrate that the tax cut had left no funds for other priorities. He went blamed the Bush tax cut for ""wiping out the surplus"" - although the only piece of it implemented so far is in the refund cheques proposed by the Democrats. The president, meanwhile, warned Congress to adhere to fiscal responsibility and not to attempt ""appropriation gamesmanship. I'm going to be watching carefully for the last-minute budget additions,"" he said. Mr Bush also said he would make sure Congress did not use the Social Security funds for the general budget, but to pay down $100bn of the US debt.

Today's action by the FOMC brings the decline in the target federal funds rate since the beginning of the year to 300 basis points. Household demand has been sustained, but business profits and capital spending continue to weaken and growth abroad is slowing, weighing on the US economy. The associated easing of pressures on labour and product markets is expected to keep inflation contained. Although long-term prospects for productivity growth and the economy remain favourable, the Committee continues to believe that against the background of its long-run goals of price stability and sustainable economic growth and of the information currently available, the risks are weighted mainly toward conditions that may generate economic weakness in the foreseeable future.'.

803,309.0,2007-12-12,"""Today, the Bank of Canada, the Bank of England, the European Central Bank, the Federal Reserve, and the Swiss National Bank are announcing measures designed to address elevated pressures in short-term funding markets. Federal Reserve Actions  Actions taken by the Federal Reserve include the establishment of a temporary Term Auction Facility (approved by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System) and the establishment of foreign exchange swap lines with the European Central Bank and the Swiss National Bank (approved by the Federal Open Market Committee).  Under the Term Auction Facility (TAF) program, the Federal Reserve will auction term funds to depository institutions against the wide variety of collateral that can be used to secure loans at the discount window. All depository institutions that are judged to be in generally sound financial condition by their local Reserve Bank and that are eligible to borrow under the primary credit discount window program will be eligible to participate in TAF auctions. All advances must be fully collateralized. By allowing the Federal Reserve to inject term funds through a broader range of counterparties and against a broader range of collateral than open market operations, this facility could help promote the efficient dissemination of liquidity when the unsecured interbank markets are under stress.  Each TAF auction will be for a fixed amount, with the rate determined by the auction process (subject to a minimum bid rate). The first TAF auction of $20 billion is scheduled for Monday, December 17, with settlement on Thursday, December 20; this auction will provide 28-day term funds, maturing Thursday, January 17, 2008. The second auction of up to $20 billion is scheduled for Thursday, December 20, with settlement on Thursday, December 27; this auction will provide 35-day funds, maturing Thursday, January 31, 2008. The third and fourth auctions will be held on January 14 and 28, with settlement on the following Thursdays. The amounts of those auctions will be determined in January. The Federal Reserve may conduct additional auctions in subsequent months, depending in part on evolving market conditions.  Depositories will submit bids through their local Reserve Banks. The minimum bid rate for the auctions will be established at the overnight indexed swap (OIS) rate corresponding to the maturity of the credit being auctioned. The OIS rate is a measure of market participants' expected average federal funds rate over the relevant term. The minimum rate for the December 17 auction along with other auction details will be announced on Friday, December 14. Noncompetitive tenders may be accepted beginning with the third auction. The results of the first auction will be announced at 10 a.m. Eastern Time on December 19. The schedule for releasing the results of later auctions will be determined subsequently. Detailed terms of the auction and summary auction results will be available at www.federalreserve.gov .  Experience gained under this temporary program will be helpful in assessing the potential usefulness of augmenting the Federal Reserve's current monetary policy tools--open market operations and the primary credit facility--with a permanent facility for auctioning term discount window credit. The Board anticipates that it would seek public comment on any proposal for a permanent term auction facility.  The Federal Open Market Committee has authorized temporary reciprocal currency arrangements (swap lines) with the European Central Bank (ECB) and the Swiss National Bank (SNB). These arrangements will provide dollars in amounts of up to $20 billion and $4 billion to the ECB and the SNB, respectively, for use in their jurisdictions. The FOMC approved these swap lines for a period of up to six months.

Shares had traded modestly higher prior to the Federal Open Market Committee's decision but sank in afternoon trade after the Fed cut both the funds rate and the discount rate by a quarter percentage point.  Many analysts had expected a 50 basis point cut, particularly on the discount rate, to help alleviate severe liquidity problems in the banking sector and offset the worst effects of the credit squeeze.  ""It was a bitter pill for the market,"" Bill Knapp, chief investment strategist at MainStay Investments, said. ""It seems like they didn't go far enough and the market is telling us that this is the case.""  Before the Fed decision the S&P 500 was trading 0.4 per cent higher but later fell 1.3 per cent to 1,495.83. The Dow Jones Industrial Average sank 1.2 per cent to 13,565.51 while the Nasdaq Composite declined 1.1 per cent to 2,689.24.  Among the stocks hit hardest by the rate cut disappointment were financials and homebuilders. The S&P financial index shed 3.5 per cent to 414.78 while the homebuilder index lost 9.4 per cent to 362.48.  Rate cuts have historically provided a boon for the S&P, with the futures market fully pricing in at least a 25 basis points cut, analysts said any upside from a cut was discounted with the index this week climbing to its highest level in a month.  Prior to the announcement Barclays Capital had warned against expectations of a sustained Fed-induced equity rally, because a key equity risk indicator now flagged a 90 per cent probability of a near-term sell-off, the most acute reading since 2001.  The Fed was seen as being pressured to act amid mounting losses and constrained liquidity arising from turmoil in the US housing market.  H&R Block , the tax preparer, said yesterday it expected a net loss of Dollars 502.3m for the quarter ended October 31 compared with a loss of Dollars 156.5m during the same period last year.  Some Dollars 366.2m of the expected loss came from the company's Option One Mortgage subsidiary, which is being shut down.  The stock endured a volatile session and fell 1.2 per cent to Dollars 19.72 in afternoon trade.  Shares in Washington Mutual slumped 8.5 per cent to Dollars 18.20 after it said it would raise Dollars 2.5bn via a preferred stock offering to shore up its finances and expected to report a fourth-quarter loss. The mortgage lender also said it planned to cut its dividend by almost three-quarters and set aside Dollars 1.6bn to cover loan losses.  The announcement followed soon after UBS, the Swiss group, unveiled a Dollars 17.2bn recapitalisation plan after revealing another Dollars 10bn in writedowns on mortgage-related securities.  After reporting a Dollars 2bn loss for the third quarter, Freddie Mac yesterday said current quarter performance would be little better. The mortgage agency expects losses on its book of home loans to total Dollars 10bn to Dollars 12bn in the coming years as the housing slump worsens. Last month it sold Dollars 6bn in preferred stock and slashed its dividend. The shares fell 5.7 per cent to Dollars 33.04.

The FOMC was due to publish its decision in mid-afternoon and stocks lacked direction before the announcement.  AT&T provided a boost to telecoms stocks after it raised its dividend. Texas Instruments also cheered US investors by raising the lower end of its guidance.  However, fears of further credit-related losses returned to dog a broad range of financial stocks after H&R Block, Freddie Mac and Washington Mutual further documented the extent of their mortgage market problems.

Rate cuts have historically provided a boon for the S&P, however much of the upside may already be baked in, as the index S&P this week climbed to its highest level in a month.  According to analysts at Bespoke Investment Group, a rate cut has produced an average rise of 0.46 per cent in the S&P 500 since 1990. Of the major sectors, technology has led with an average gain of 0.68 per cent.  ""Other sectors that typically do well on Fed days are consumer discretionary, financials and healthcare,"" said BIG.

807,313.0,2007-12-12,"The co-ordinated central bank moves announced on Wednesday to prevent a meltdown in the world's banking system had their roots in last month's meeting of the world's largest 20 economies in Cape Town.  According to one European central bank, that was when central bank governors agreed that co-ordinated action, rather than a series of disparate moves in each country, was the way forward.  Central bankers wanted to avoid the risk that, by changing policy and devising new ways of providing liquidity, they could be accused of knowing something nasty about their own banking system.  Each central bank said on Wednesdat it had been working on ideas to help resolve liquidity issues at the height of the credit squeeze in August and September, but the urgency had diminished as the markets seemed to improve in late September.  As the situation deteriorated again last month, central banks put aside many of their differences and started talking in earnest about co-ordinated action. The decision to go ahead was taken in principle when they met at the G20 meeting in Cape Town. But it had to be secret, so a bland communique was issued.  The timing of the announcement was made difficult by concerns in some central banks that liquidity support operations should be distinct from monetary policy.  The US Federal Reserve's action in agreeing to lend dollars to the European Central Bank required the approval of the Federal Open Market Committee, so this had to come after the committee met on Tuesday. The ECB and the Bank of England are likely to have urged the Fed to delay the announcement because European central banks maintain a strict separation between official interest rate decisions and money market operations.

808,314.0,2007-12-12,"Wall Street stocks rebounded on Wednesday after the Federal Reserve unveiled a number of measures designed to alleviate money market funding pressures.  The Fed's announcement of a new auction facility and foreign exchange swap lines with other central banks cheered investors who had reacted with disappointment to a quarter-percentage point interest rate cut the previous day.  As interbank lending rates edged lower, stocks enjoyed a broad-based rally as hopes of improved global liquidity drove a bond market sell-off.  ""The market is focused on the fact that the Fed seems to be taking action,"" Peter Cardillo, chief market economist at Avalon Partners, said.  However, after an initial surge financials lost steam in spite of a policy announcement designed specifically to help them. Confidence waned after both Bank of America and Wachovia gave a disappointing outlooks. In the broader market equities failed to recover all the losses sustained after the Fed eased the previous day.  At midday the S&P 500 was up 1.3 per cent at 1,497.09, having earlier climbed as much as 2.3 per cent. The Nasdaq Composite rose 1.6 per cent to 2,695.19 while the Dow Jones Industrial Average was 1 per cent higher at 13,560.96.  ""It seems this is what the markets were looking for yesterday [on Wednesday],"" Brian Gendreau, investment strategist at ING Investment Management, said.  Stocks were hit hard on Tuesday after a 25bp rate cut from the Federal Open Market Committee failed to appease nervous investors and calm fragile areas of the credit and mortgage markets.  Homebuilders suffered their sharpest ever one-day fall while financial companies also felt heavy selling pressure, falling 4.9 per cent.  The S&P financial index rose as much as 2.9 per cent on Wednesday but later traded flat at 405.64.  ""There is going to be a lot of liquidity but is this going to solve all the problems? I don't think so,"" Mr Cardillo said.  The sectors to benefit most from the Fed's move to tackle liquidity pressures were those that have typified the ""globalisation trade"" - energy, materials, industrials and technology.  Traders bet that any improvement in liquidity would see cash channelled towards companies perceived as having better exposure to overseas economic growth.  ""If this is the beginning of the end of the financial crisis, growth abroad will not be threatened and people will be piling onto the globalisation trade again,"" Mr Gendreau said.  The S&P energy index rose 2.9 per cent to 590.70 as crude oil prices climbed back above $90 a barrel. Exxon Mobil rose 2.8 per cent to $92.81 while Murphy Oil put on 4.3 per cent to $79.12. Goldman Sachs sharply raised its outlook for crude prices next year.  In the technology sector Microsoft, up 2 per cent to $34.78, Hewlett Packard, 3.4 per cent higher at $38.06 and IBM up 2.6 per cent at $109.76 were among the Dow's best performers on Wednesday.  In industrials Manitowoc, the diversified manufacturer, soared 9.7 per cent to $47.79 after it raised its 2008 earnings guidance. Cummins, the diesel engine and power generator manufacturer, gained 7.3 per cent to $126.86 after it announced a two-for-one stock split and $500m in share buybacks.  However, there was weakness in financials after Bank of America's chief executive warned the company's fourth quarter results would be ""disappointing,"" and said it would set aside $3.3bn to cover losses and writedowns. The shares fell 1.9 per cent to $43.82.  Wachovia, the fourth-largest US bank, estimated its loan-loss provision for the fourth quarter at $1bn in excess of charge-offs, about double its previous forecast.  Merrill Lynch analysts downgraded Wachovia to ""sell"" as it expects credit losses to rise ""significantly"" next year.  Citigroup shares also lagged after a disappointing reception for newly appointed chief executive Vikram Pandit. The shares fell 4.3 per cent to $31.80 yesterday, and are down 10 per cent since the announcement.  Sallie Mae, the student loan company, slumped 9.1 per cent to $29.02 after it lowered its core earnings outlook and said a buyout consortium led by JC Flowers was unwilling to submit a new takeover proposal.

809,315.0,2007-12-12,"Wall Street stocks were set for sharp rebound and bond yields were higher early on Wednesday, after the Federal Reserve unveiled a number of measures designed to alleviate funding pressures.  ""Today, the Bank of Canada, the Bank of England, the European Central Bank, the Federal Reserve, and the Swiss National Bank are announcing measures designed to address elevated pressures in short-term funding markets,"" said the Federal Reserve.  The Fed will provide a new auction facility, and set up forex swap lines with the Bank Of England, the European Central Bank and the Swiss National Bank. The swap lines will enable these central banks to provide dollar loans and lessen money market pressures, particularly in the sterling and euro Libor markets.  The Fed's auctions will start on December 17 and involve the sale of $20bn in 28-day funds, followed by another $20bn on December 20 for 35 days. Two more auctions are scheduled for January 14 and 28. The new loans will be auctioned at a level linked to the expected actual fed funds over the loan's maturity.  On Wednesday, one-month Libor fell to 5.102 per cent from 5.02 per cent on Tuesday, but Libor was forecast to fall to around 4.95 per cent prior to the FOMC decision.  ""Certainly, a problem exists, as the one-month LIBOR reset 10bp lower this morning, but the spread to the Fed Funds target lies at 85bp, which..represents the most extreme disconnect since Y2K,"" said TJ Marta, fixed income strategist at RBC Capital Markets. Equity index futures surged on the news, and built on earlier gains as investors had expected new measures from the Fed.  Less than an hour before the opening bell, S&P 500 futures were up 31.40 points at 1,509.50, up from 1,492.30 just prior to the Fed's announcement.  Nasdaq futures were up 37 points at 2,127 and futures for the Dow Jones Industrial Average were up 225 points at 13,675.  Meanwhile, Treasury bonds suffered further losses and had more than reversed their sharp plunge in the wake of the FOMC meeting. The yield on the two-year Treasury note was up 22 basis points at 3.19 per cent and the 10-year Treasury note was 14 bp higher 4.13 per cent.  Stocks were hit hard on Tuesday, after a rate cut from the Federal Open Market Committee failed to appease nervous investors and calm fragile areas of the credit and mortgage markets. As expected, the FOMC cut the Fed funds rate to 4.25 per cent, but only lowered the discount rate by a quarter-percentage point to 4.75 per cent, rather than an expected 4.50 per cent.  ""The US financial markets clearly abhor a Fed that exudes a whiff of benign neglect at a time of great financial stress in the banking system,"" said William O'Donnell. strategist at UBS. In company news, financials gained in spite of downgrades from Merrill Lynch. Its analysts downgraded J.P. Morgan Chase and Bank of America to 'neutral' and Wachovia to 'sell' citing exposure to the subprime credit problems.  Wachovia, the fourth-largest US bank, may allocate twice as much money for loan losses in the final quarter than it previously forecast. The bank said it would set aside $1bn in excess of charge-offs, an increase from the previous estimate of $500m to $600m. Its shares fell 2.3 per cent in pre-market trading.  Bank of America's chief executive on Wednesday said that the bank's results in the fourth quarter would be ""disappointing,"" citing expected writedowns and lower trading revenue.  In contrast, Washington Mutual, Wells Fargo led gains in the financial sector after the Financial Times reported, without citing anyone, that the Fed may announce a new system to auction loans to banks as early as Wednesday. Citigroups shares also rose in pre-market activity after the newly appointed CEO Vikram Pandit announced a thorough review of expenses and productivity.  AT&T management said they now expected the sales from online ads and searches to top $1.5bn by 2010, up from about $600m in 2007. Shares rose 2 per cent to $40.24 in pre-market trade.

811,317.0,2004-07-01,"Two years ago, a tightening of monetary policy by the US Federal Reserve might have tipped the balance against Brazil's fight to stave off default. But yesterday there were few signs of distress in Brazil, the world's largest emerging-market debtor. The country's bonds rallied over the past month, and their yield over US treasuries narrowed by roughly 150 basis points. Investors had priced in a more benign scenario of gradual rate hikes by the Fed. With yesterday's confirmation, Brazil's financial markets could rally further. ""Brazil should be the big winner as investors realise that the FOMC will raise interest rates at a gradual pace,"" Walter Molano, head of research at BCP Securities, a Connecticut-based investment firm, said before the announcement. Conventional wisdom has it that higher interest rates in the US will drain capital from emerging markets, put pressure on their currencies, increase borrowing costs and even force a tightening of monetary policy. Brazil's central bank will now have less room to cut interest rates from the current level of 16 per cent. Leading financial institutions expect a cut of only 1 percentage point by the end of the year, down from forecasts in late March of 2 percentage points. But Brazil's economy is in a much stronger position to withstand more hostile capital market conditions than a few years ago. Economists have maintained economic growth forecasts of around 3.5 per cent and may even increase them. Brazil has cut external financing requirements dramatically. Exports grew by 40 per cent in 2003 and are up by an estimated 20 per cent this year. This has turned a current account deficit of 4.6 per cent of gross domestic product in 2001 into a surplus of roughly 0.8 per cent of GDP last year and 1.1 per cent of GDP this year. Foreign debt and exposure to currency volatility have fallen. ""The reliance of the Brazilian private sector on external markets has fallen sharply in the past few years,"" said JP Morgan, the investment bank, in a report last month. The corporate sector ""is well positioned to withstand a reduction in the availability of external credit lines, should that occur"", the bank added. Net foreign debt has fallen from 36 per cent of GDP in 2002 to an expected 26 per cent of GDP by year-end. The government also has reduced its dollar-linked domestic debt by Dollars 26bn to 16.6 per cent of its total public debt, from 37 per cent in December 2002.

812,318.0,2004-07-01,"For many on Wall Street, yesterday's interest rate rise served as a marker to the end of a 20-year-plus bull run for the bond markets. As interest rates have generally fallen since the early 1980s, bond prices have risen as the dividends they offer, or yields, fall in line with interest rates, providing rich capital returns for investors. But yesterday's move is widely forecast to have been the first in a series of rate rises that will push bond prices lower. Expectations of rate rises have already led the Dollars 3,000bn-plus (Euros 2,463bn, Pounds 1,651bn) US Treasury market to its worst quarterly returns in 24 years in the three months to June. ""You're not going to get the gains we saw before in bonds,"" said John Derrick, director of research at US Global Investors. ""There's a floor to how low rates and yields can go."" Despite the rout in bond prices over the last quarter, the markets had steadied in the run-up to the Fed's decision in the belief that future rate rises were largely now priced in to the market. Strategists and fund managers do not predict disaster, though they acknowledge returns will be lower. ""The Fed is most likely to tighten in baby steps,"" said Edward Marrinan, head of North American high grade strategy at JP Morgan. A decline in issuance - an indicator of market confidence - was related to strong corporate profits lessening the need for borrowing, he said. ""Given that Mr Greenspan has bent over backwards to telegraph the FOMC's intention to raise rates, I doubt many companies feel they will have missed the boat on borrowing."" Issuance for riskier high yield, or junk bonds, is up on last year and has risen recently as bond markets steadied. ""Investors are still showing a strong interest in taking on risk,"" said Kingman Penniman of KDP Investment Advisors. Investors have also pointed out that the historically low level of rates means an increase will still mean affordable borrowing. Citing the predicted end-of-year rate, James Kauffmann, head of fixed income at ING Investment Management, said: ""Fed funds at 2.25 per cent . But the low level of rates even after rises - which can take up to 18 months to feed into the economy - might fail to curb the recent pick-up in inflation. Unexpectedly strong inflation could force the Fed to raise rates more aggressively. This would push bond prices lower, and any uncertainty the extra rate rises created could weigh further on prices. ""The real concern is if the market prices in much more"" than 100 basis points this year, said Bill Kohli, bond fund manager at Putnam. Rising yields would force up interest rates on other products such as home loans, and could slow the economy. The good news for bond buyers is that research by ING Financial Markets shows that under Alan Greenspan's leadership of the Fed, the markets have historically overestimated the level of rates by almost a percentage point. The bad news is that the few periods when they have underestimated interest rates coincide with periods of rising rates. ",Rate rise signals the end of bonds bull run.,2004-06-30,The Financial Times
813,319.0,2004-07-01,"The US Federal Reserve raised interest rates by a quarter point to 1.25 per cent yesterday, the first increase in more than four years. The move was expected after the Fed's efforts to prepare the ground for higher rates in recent weeks. But it kicks off what is likely to be a long tightening cycle fraught with risk, after a period in which households, businesses and investors have become used to cheap credit. The policymaking Federal open market committee sounded a slightly more hawkish tone in its accompanying statement. As expected, the Fed maintained its judgment that upside and downside risks to inflation remain balanced. It reiterated the committee's belief that policy accommodation could be removed at a ""measured"" pace, but added: ""Nonetheless, the committee will respond to changes in economic prospects as needed to fulfil its obligation to maintain price stability."" The FOMC acknowledged in its statement that incoming inflation data were ""somewhat elevated"" while adding that ""a portion of the increase in recent months appears to have been due to transitory factors"". Fed officials have been surprised by the sharp rise in inflation in the first half of the year - but expect a moderation in the second half. Alan Greenspan, Fed chairman, and his colleagues have stressed that they would move more aggressively against inflation if their sanguine outlook proved to be incorrect. ""The baseline case is that it is likely the Fed will tighten at a measured pace, but now they have spelled out the risk case,"" said Paul McCulley, Fed-watcher at Pimco, the giant bond fund. A gradual approach to tightening rates will allow the US central bank to gauge the effect on consumer and business spending. Anything other than a quarter-point rate rise would have been a surprise, and there was little market reaction yesterday. Between the start of 2001 and last June, the Fed slashed interest rates from 6.5 per cent to 1 per cent - a 45-year low.

Earnings reports gave the market some impetus. Ford Motor beat expectations with fourth-quarter earnings per share of 49 cents, compared with forecasts of 21 cents. The stock rose at first, slipped and then recovered to end unchanged at $29 5/8. General Motors, at $52 5/8, retraced $1 of its $1 1/4 rise scored on Tuesday when it reported strong fourth-quarter earnings. Philip Morris, the tobacco and food group, pleased the market with fourth-quarter earnings per share slightly above forecast. However, after an initial rise, it lost $2 to $93 as analysts wondered what 1996 would bring. Kimberly-Clark, the paper maker which recently acquired rival Scott, took the opposite course. After reporting earnings below forecasts, the shares fell $3 1/2 to $76. However, they recovered sharply as analysts looked behind the headline figures, showing a gain on the day of $1 1/8 at $80 5/8. Also disappointing was Bethlehem Steel, which as well as producing fourth-quarter earnings below forecasts was cautious for the first quarter of the current year, saying price increases would not take effect until the second quarter. The shares softened $1/8 to $15 1/8. Corning shares were active on hopes that the diversified manufacturer might raise $1bn by selling its faltering laboratory services division. The stock rose $3/4 to $31 1/4. Topping the actives list were Hanson ADRs, following the Anglo-American group's decision to break itself into four new companies. The ADRs lost $1/4 at $15 1/2. Canada Toronto, unable to maintain its torrid pace of late, ended lower on profit-taking in the heavily weighted golds and financial services sectors. The TSE 300 composite index relinquished 19.44 at 4,968.43, while falls outscored rises by 446 to 435. Volume was 101.2m shares valued at C$1.30bn. (c) The Financial Times Limited 1996. ",FED RATES CUT LEAVES DOW AT NEW RECORD - AMERICA.,1996-01-31,The Financial Times
815,321.0,1996-02-01,"The dollar rose on the foreign exchanges yesterday after the US Federal Reserve cut its key interest rates by 1/4 percentage point. The Federal Reserve lowered its Federal Funds rate to 5.25% and its discount rate to 5.0%. The move was followed by the Bank of Canada, which reduced its key interest rates by a quarter-point. The prospect of fresh interest rate cuts had absorbed the attention of the foreign exchange markets throughout most of yesterday's European session, adding a note of uncertainty into trading. With the FOMC announcement coming after the close of European trading, the dollar consequently moved in a limited range for most of the European session. Meanwhile in Europe, the Bundesbank's decision to reduce the German repo rate - by 15 basis points to 3.4% - prompted speculation about further European interest rate cuts. Although the German currency was at first slightly dented by the move, it later recovered as the expectation grew that France and other European countries could follow suit. The Bundesbank's decision to reduce its repo rate did not take the markets by surprise: with growth in Germany having weakened markedly in recent months, most traders had already anticipated a small cut. However, the scale of the cut was slightly larger than the 10 basis points that most dealers had expected. It also fuelled speculation that the Bundesbank might follow the repo rate cut with a reduction in its discount or Lombard rate at its council meeting today. However, most dealers said they thought this was unlikely. They said the Bundesbank would probably wait in order to assess the impact of its last rate cut on M3, its measure of the money supply. But the German move was nevertheless thought likely to trigger further, slight easing elsewhere in Europe. Belgium, which ties its monetary policy closely to Germany, followed immediately: its central rate was reduced to 3.40% from 3.55% and its end-of-day rate to 4.65% from 4.80. The Netherlands is also widely expected to ease policy slightly today, when it sets its special advances pact. Meanwhile, the Bank of France, which also meets today, is expected to cut its own intervention rate by 20 basis points from its current level of 4.2%. Most European currencies were initially buoyed by the German repo rate cut before the D-Mark recovered later in the session. The Italian lira rose sharply to end near to its recent highs, while the French franc closed modestly up against the D-Mark. 'This environment where the Bundesbank is easing rates promotes more rapid growth across Europe and improves countries' chances of meeting the Maastricht criteria for monetary union,' said Mr Lawrence Hatheway, senior currency strategist at UBS in London. The lira found further support from the growing expectation that a new government would be formed soon. It was also supported by comments by Mr Jean-Claude Trichet, governor of the Bank of France, who said the Italian currency had the potential to appreciate against other European currencies. Against the D-Mark, the lira closed higher at L1,071, from L1,074, and the French franc at FFr 3.433, from FFr 3.436. Traders said speculation of a small rate cut in France was likely to weaken the French franc in coming days. Trading in the dollar was subdued during most of the London session ahead of the FOMC meeting. Dealers said the markets had discounted a 25 basis-point reduction in US rates at the meeting. The Canadian dollar rallied strongly, buoyed partly by rumours of a large buy order in London and on speculation that Canadian rates would remain unchanged even if US rates were cut. In London the dollar ended at DM 1.4879, from DM 1.4900. It closed at Y 106.915 against the yen, from Y 107.2. It finished in New York at DM 1.4887 and Y 107.02. The pound finished slightly stronger against the D-Mark at DM 2.2482, from DM 2.2410. It was also ahead against the dollar, at $1.5110 from $1.5040. (c) The Financial Times Limited 1996. ",MARKETS REPORT - FEDERAL RESERVE LOWERS KEY US INTEREST RATES.,1996-01-31,The Financial Times
816,322.0,1996-02-01,"US Treasury bonds jumped yesterday as the Federal Open Market Committee announced an interest rate cut at the end of its two-day meeting. However, the enthusiasm for the cut, announced in the early afternoon, was short-lived and bond prices fell back to end the day with modest gains. The dollar was little changed on the rate cut. The Fed reduced its target rate by a quarter of one percentage point to 5 1/4%, and the discount rate by the same amount to 5%. It cited moderating economic expansion and subdued inflation for its decision. Late in the day the benchmark 30-year Treasury was 1/8 higher at 111 5/8 to yield 6.023%, while at the short end of the maturity spectrum the two-year note was up 1/8 at 100 1/8, yielding 4.917%. Bonds have been firm lately in anticipation of a cut, which came only six weeks after the previous reduction in December. It is the third easing of monetary policy by the Fed after the tightening begun in early 1994. While many economists welcomed the reduction in interest rates, Mr Ken Bercuson, chief economist at Swiss Bank Corporation in New York, said: 'I think it is a mistake they will live to regret.' He expected inflation to rise to around 4% and said the Fed might have to raise rates again later in the year. The market was also weighed down by news that next week's Treasury auctions will be the biggest on record, raising $44.5bn of which $13.2bn will be new cash. The sale will comprise $18.5bn of three-year notes, $14bn of 10-year notes and $12bn of 30-year bonds. Before the auction can go ahead the Treasury must put in place measures to avoid breaching the $4,900bn debt ceiling. In Germany, meanwhile, bonds closed lower despite a 15 basis point cut in the German repo rate to 3.4%. Traders attributed the fall to profit-taking, said to be by hedge funds, and technical trading. Mr David Brown, chief European economist at Bear Stearns International, said the markets had been 'whip-sawed between interest rate expectations on both sides of the Atlantic'. Investors were waiting for the outcome of the Bundesbank council meeting today. Mr Brown said: 'With the Bundesbank accelerating its pace of repo easing, from 8, to 10, to 15 basis points off rates, we reckon the chances of a discount rate cut tomorrow have improved from 55:45 in favour to 65:35 in favour.' Mr Karl Haeling of Deutsche Morgan Grenfell in Frankfurt said the size of the cut had led to a reassessment of German rates by some investors. He said: 'Rightly or wrongly, people are perceiving that the end of the interest rate fantasy is nearly on us. Some are saying that interest rate cuts are so widely anticipated that they can only provide disappointment when they come.' The yield on benchmark two-year paper increased 1 basis point and that on 10-year paper by 2 points, with the spread between the two maturities settling at 224 points. On Liffe the March 10-year bund future closed at 100.27, down 0.21. At the London close, the yield spread of 10-year bunds over Treasuries was up from 17 to 22 basis points. French government bonds were lifted by poor unemployment data and the March Notionnel future on Matif closed up 0.10 at 122.88. Hopes of an imminent cut in the intervention rate buoyed the short end of the curve, and yields on two-year paper fell 6 basis points while yields on the 10-year area rose 2 points with the spread between the two maturities at 193. Ms Phyllis Reed, European bond strategist at BZW, said more steepening could lead the French yield curve to steepen to German levels, where the two to 10-year spread is around 220 points. The spread over bunds tightened 2 basis points to 47 points. Italian bonds followed bunds, and the March bond future on Liffe closed up 0.45 at 112.40 but surged in late afternoon when a resolution of the political crisis was believed to be nearer. The spread over 10-year bunds narrowed 8 basis points to 432. UK government bonds were dragged down by a disappointing gilt auction. Although the auction cover was 1.96 times and the tail was 2 basis points, the lowest accepted price was 5/32 below the pre-auction market level at 105, where it yielded 6.76%. A trader said: 'People don't necessarily want the stock but they are happy to take it on at these levels.' Mr Andrew Roberts, analyst at UBS, said the result was a disappointment because 'the gilt market offers more value than any other European market just now'. On Liffe the March long gilt future closed at 110 7/16, down 7/16. The 10-year yield spread over Germany moved from 169 to 173 basis points. On two-year paper yields rose 3 points and on 10-year paper by 5 points, with the spread between the maturities at 124 basis points. The yield spread of 10-year Swedish government bonds over bunds narrowed by 6 basis points to 242 points on hopes of further repo rate cuts from the Riksbank. Ms Wike Groenenberg, an economist at Salomon Brothers, said 20 or 25 basis points could come off the repo rate within two weeks. (c) The Financial Times Limited 1996.

817,323.0,1996-02-01,"Another aggressive repo rate cut, 15 basis points, saw FRANKFURT set an emphatic new high on the session. It closed official business with the Dax at 2,470.14, wobbled in the afternoon as the dollar, bonds and the Dow moved against it, and ended Ibis trading with a 6.91 gain at 2,463.00. Turnover rose from DM 11.1bn to DM 13.4bn; Daimler, Deutsche Bank and Siemens traded in DM 4.4bn between them. Mr Eckhard Frahm at Merck Finck in Dusseldorf calculated that the official close left the Dax up 9.6% on the month, compared with a 7% gain for the whole of 1995. The market, said Mr Frahm, was being driven by the dollar and corporate restructuring prospects, as well as by liquidity and the interest rate environment. DAX 30 earnings per share were expected to rise by 30% this year, and by 13% in 1997, and dollar-related stocks dominated the best Dax performers in January, led by Continental, Bayer and BMW, up 21.5, 17.6 and 15.1% respectively. Lufthansa rose another DM 5.80 yesterday to DM 223.80; the flag airline told a German business magazine on Sunday that it could treble its earnings by the year 2,000. SAP prefs dropped DM 9.70 or 4.3% to DM 217.50 after a 44% rise in 1995 earnings, and confident predictions for 1996. PARIS, down at one point, rose for the sixth consecutive session on late foreign buying, the CAC-40 index ending 17.90 higher at 2,021.03, with turnover inflated to FFr 7.23bn by expiry-related arbitrage. Stocks which got a poor early reception improved. Bouygues, after its news of heavy provisions against the 1995 accounts, fell to FFr 492.50 before closing a net FFr 15 down at FFr 517; L'Oreal, relatively flat in its initial reaction to higher turnover and profits for 1995, ended FFr 19 ahead at FFr 1,448. Meanwhile, Rhone-Poulenc, the chemicals and pharmaceuticals group, outdistanced most blue chips with a gain of FFr 4 at FFr 119, on higher earnings and plans to sell FFr 10bn of assets to reduce debt. MILAN built up its hopes for an imminent solution to the government crisis. The Comit index rose 6.17 to 619.94, while the real-time Mibtel index was 82 higher at 9,923. Stet forged ahead L224 to L4,971 after newspaper reports that the group's assets might be sold in tranches, although many analysts were sceptical about the practicalities of such an operation. Fiat was weak after its recent spurt, awaiting Mr Gianni Agnelli's last annual letter to shareholders as chairman, which came after the market closed. The shares fell L65 to L5,334. Mr Nicholas Potter at Credito Italiano International described the 1995 results as 'acceptable but nothing special', adding that the company was capable of significantly more. ZURICH continued higher, supported by a steady dollar, but activity was thin as many investors awaited the outcome of the FOMC meeting. The SMI index rose 11.9 to 3,248.7. Bank Baer, which released 1995 figures, picked up SwFr 30 to SwFr 1,260. Registered shares in Elco Looser, the heating equipment manufacturer, which closed at SwFr 491 on Tuesday, were suspended throughout yesterday's session ahead of the SwFr 535 a share bid from Preussag, the German engineering group. MADRID featured a near 3% gain in Repsol, up Pta125 at Pta4,360, on signs that the latest privatisation offer was being well absorbed. The general index rose 27.40 to 3,734.49. BRUSSELS liked a 15 basis-point cut in the Belgian National Bank's central rate, and the Bel-20 index put on 14.56 at 1,690.23. Forestries, with sector indices up 2.7 and 2.3% respectively, lifted HELSINKI, where the Hex index rose 12.50 to 1,752.41, and STOCKHOLM, where the Affarsvarlden General index closed 16.1 better at 1,765.1. However, the Swedes also enjoyed a 1.6% lift in the drugs sector, where Astra rose SKr5 to SKr282, and Pharmacia &Upjohn also by SKr5, to SKr282.50, after overnight sector gains in the US. ISTANBUL leapt 6.9% as Turkey and Greece withdrew from a disputed rocky outcrop in the Aegean Sea after a tense stand-off on Tuesday. The IMKB-100 index gained 3,210 at 49,489.5. Analysts noted, however, that the market remained sensitive to domestic politics over efforts to form a coalition government after the inconclusive December elections. ATHENS also reacted to the de-escalation of tension, with a 1.6% rise. The general index moved up 15.08 to 989.45. WARSAW picked up 2.4%, taking the month's advance to 30% and the market to a 52-week high. The Wig index rose 241.6 to 10,413.1 on hopes that the year's second interest rate cut could come as soon as February. Animex, the food processor, jumped 2.70 zlotys to 29.80 on news that it would receive a 19m-zloty refund after paying too much tax in 1990. BUDAPEST was higher for the 13th successive session and the Bux index climbed 65.26 to 2,068.06. Bearer shares in Agrimpex, the agricultural trading company, soared Ft1,500 to Ft13,000 as the group established a subsidiary intended to centralise its trading activity.

819,325.0,1990-08-22,"JAPANESE bond futures prices collapsed yesterday to reach a historical low as a combination of concerns about the Gulf crisis and hedging orders before today's 10-year bond auction pushed prices lower. The December Tokyo futures contract tumbled to 89.77 from Monday's close of 90.16 as volume surged to over 60,000 lots. Cash bond prices were not affected as much by the weakness and yields on the 119 benchmark bond remained just over 8 per cent in a volatile day as the Ministry of Finance supported the market for the second day running by buying bonds. Futures traders were taking positions in the market in advance of the MoF's auction today of Y800bn of 10-year bonds which are expected to carry a coupon of 7.3 per cent. However, the auction is expected to be greeted with little retail demand. Some American banks have indicated that they have few investors willing to buy the new issue of Japanese bonds at a coupon of less than 7.5 per cent. Brokers are selling futures contracts to hedge the holdings of cash bonds they expect to acquire today. This forced futures prices lower. WEST GERMAN bond yields remained firmly above 9 per cent yesterday for the first time since May, as the market is still dominated by inflation concerns and worries about the Gulf. IN THE UK, gilt-edged securities eased upwards in a belated reaction to Monday's money supply figures which were favourable for the market, but failed to impress it initially.

820,326.0,1994-11-16,"It was virtually all good news yesterday for a London stock market celebrating a series of specialist deals, including a #500m share buy-back by one of the leading FT-SE 100 stocks, a huge buy programme, a highly successful bought deal and a series of excellent company news items. Added to that heady cocktail was another strong performance by Wall Street, which gained ground shortly after the opening yesterday ahead of the outcome of the crucial Federal Open Market Committee meeting in Washington. Wall Street shrugged aside another batch of economic data from the US indicating strong growth in the economy. At the close of trading, and with no news from the FOMC meeting available to the market, the FT-SE 100 Index fulfilled recent market optimism, sweeping confidently through the 3,100 barrier and closing a net 40.1 higher at 3,135.4. Second-line stocks shared in the buoyant mood of the market, the FT-SE Mid 250 ending 22.6 stronger at 3,560.7. And there was a general air of optimism around City trading desks, with dealers adopting the view that, within reason, the UK market would take whatever was thrown at it by the Federal Reserve. 'If we get 50 basis points, the market will say it is already in the prices; if we get 75 or even 100 points, the bond market will love it and we will hang on to their coat tails,' was the view of one top trader in London, although he cautioned that the market would definitely not appreciate an absence of movement by the Federal Reserve. The rate rise of 3/4 percentage point was subsequently announced. The overall bullish view was reinforced by a surge of activity in derivatives markets, where turnover was said to have been the heaviest since mid-September. Turnover expanded rapidly throughout the session to reach 961.4m shares, the highest seen for many weeks, with non-Footsie stocks accounting for an unusually low 39% of the total. Dealers picked up the scent of a big market operation before the opening and prices across the board were marked better at the outset, when the FT-SE 100 was around 10 points ahead. News that Boots had sent its broker SG Warburg into the market to buy in around 10% of its shares drove Boots sharply higher until the buy-back operation was satisfied. Boots' move came 24 hours after it sold its pharmaceuticals division to BASF, the German chemicals company. At the same time, AMP Australia, the life assurance group, sold its 3.2% holding in Hammerson to Smith New Court, the UK securities house, who quickly placed the stock in the market, taking a 3p a share turn in the process. While these deals were being unwound, Goldman Sachs, the US investment bank, moved in to execute a #160m-plus buy programme, spanning the FT-SE 100 and 250 indices. These three big operations accounted for more than 270m shares, or 28% of turnover in the market yesterday. At its best, just before the close, the FT-SE 100 was more than 42 points up, with dealers reporting only light profit-taking towards the close. Company trading reports provided numerous features, including De La Rue, the banknote printing group, whose shares sprinted to an all-time high after excellent results, while PowerGen fulfilled even the most optimistic dividend forecasts. General Accident was the one real disappointment in the market as the steep fall in the insurance group's net asset value, and middle of the range third-quarter profits, left the market unimpressed. The best performance among the FT-SE 100 stocks came from Standard Chartered, viewed by many chartists as in the initial stages of a big upside break; dealers noted heavy turnover in Standard shares.

821,327.0,1994-11-16,"US Treasury prices were extremely volatile yesterday afternoon as the market struggled to interpret the implications of the Federal Reserve's announcement that it would increase the target for its Federal funds rate. Late in the session the benchmark 30-year government bond was up 7/32 at 93 23/32, yielding 8.047%. At the short end of the market the two-year note fell 1/8 to 99 19/32, to yield 7.081%. The long-bond yield fell below 8% immediately after the announcement that the Fed's open market committee had voted to boost the target rate by 75 basis points to 5 1/2%. Most analysts had expected an increase of at least 50 points and believed the markets had already accounted for a 50-point increase. The news that the Fed had increased the target rate by more than expected was taken as a sign that it was willing to continue a tough stance against inflation. But the rally was short-lived. Mr John Lipsky, chief economist at Salomon Brothers, the securities house, said the initial rally was more surprising than its later return to near pre-announcement level. 'A move of this magnitude had certainly been contemplated by most market players,' he said. 'There is ample justification for the market to be somewhat better than pre-announcement levels because the Fed has shown more anti-inflation resolve than previously,' Mr Lipsky said. 'There is little justification for any significant rally at this time because, until economic growth shows clear signs of deceleration, the bond market remains vulnerable to disappointing inflation figures,' he added. The Fed cited the highest capacity utilisation figures since February 1980 as its main reason for the increase. Earlier, it had announced that the economy was using 84.8% of its capital stock for the production of goods, and a 0.7% increase in industrial production. Economists had anticipated a 0.6% increase in industrial production and capacity utilisation of about 84.8%, but the actual figures were considered generally in line with expectations. Bond prices dipped early in the morning following the announcement that retail spending for October had grown by 1.1% - analysts had expected an increase of about 0.6% - but bounced back later in light trading as traders awaited an announcement on interest rate policy. European government bond markets drifted higher yesterday as investors waited for the result of the Federal Reserve meeting in the US. Mr Simon Maggs of IBJ in London said: 'Trading has been very thin ahead of the FOMC meeting, but European markets will be moving on the back of that meeting tomorrow.' Most markets followed German government bonds upwards, although Italy registered a fall as investors took stock of the difficulties the government is having in enacting budgetary reforms. German bunds broke through an important resistance point at 90.50 and the December bund futures contract ended at 90.69, up 0.41 on the day, in light trading. Mr Karl Haeling at Deutsche Bank in Frankfurt said: 'Breaking through that point makes it very tempting to get bearish.' However, he pointed out that if there were a rally in bunds, investors were likely to shift into US Treasuries. UK government bonds followed bunds up in thin trading and the December long gilt future closed around 102 1/8, up 13/32. The yield spread over bunds was 135 basis points. A #250m tranche of 8 3/4% Treasury stock due 2017 was exhausted in afternoon trading. The bonds were supplied at 102.28, the Bank of England said. The tranche was one of four tap stocks announced on November 4. Two others, a #250m tranche of 8 1/2% stock due 2005 and #100m of 2 1/2% index-linked stock due 2000 have already been exhausted. Another #100m tranche of 2 1/2% gilts due 2024 has not been sold out. While the sale of the tranche suggested demand for gilts, some analysts believed the bonds had been bought by market-makers and would continue to hang over the market until sold on to investors. A raft of UK data is due out this morning, encompassing figures on government borrowing, inflation, employment and wages, as well as the minutes of the September 26 monetary policy meeting between Mr Kenneth Clarke, chancellor of the exchequer, and Mr Eddie George, governor of the Bank of England. The yield on the 10-year Italian bond rose by 4 basis points to 11.91%. Mr Adrian James at NatWest said this was due to worries over budgetary change. 'Clearly the populace is unhappy about the pension reform,' he said. The yield on the benchmark 11-year Swedish bond fell to 10.84% from 10.88%. Mr Simon Maggs at IBJ said the markets 'believe the honeymoon is over for Swedish bonds'. (c) The Financial Times Limited 1994.

822,328.0,1994-11-16,"The US Federal Reserve surprised the financial markets yesterday with an increase of three-quarters of a percentage point in short-term interest rates intended to keep inflation under control. The increase is the largest adjustment the Fed has made under the chairmanship of Mr Alan Greenspan, who has preferred more gradual changes in monetary policy, and responds to what the Fed called 'evidence of persistent strength in economic activity and high and rising levels of resource utilisation'. The size of the increase unsettled Wall Street, which had expected the Fed to raise short-term rates by only half a percentage point. Share and bond prices immediately jumped sharply as the markets applauded the central bank's resolve to fight inflation. But they later retreated as investors worried that the Fed's comments about its concern at the strength of the economy suggested it might raise rates again soon. By the close in New York, the Dow Jones Industrial Average - which fluctuated wildly all afternoon - was down 3.37 at 3,826.36. The bond market held its modest gains, which pushed the yield on the long bond down slightly to 8.047%. Currency markets, however, reacted unequivocally to the Fed's move, with the dollar rising a pfennig to DM 1.555 and half a yen to Y 98.7. The dollar opened in Tokyo at Y 98.61 and DM 1.5565. 'The Federal Reserve views these actions as necessary to keep inflation contained, and thereby foster sustainable economic growth,' the Fed said after its federal open markets committee, which sets interest rate policy, met yesterday. The move is the sixth interest rate increase this year, and takes the federal funds rate, which banks pay when they borrow from each other's reserves held at the Fed, to 5.5% from 3.0% at the beginning of the year. The discount rate, which banks pay for direct borrowings from the Fed, also started the year at 3% but has risen only to 4.75%. Many commercial banks immediately followed suit, lifting their prime rates by three-quarters of a percentage point to 8.5%. Financial market traders and economists have been beseeching the Fed to act decisively to slow economic activity. But the Fed has not moved rates by more than half a percentage point in either direction since 1981. When the FOMC last met in September, it decided to leave rates unchanged, in spite of the growing conviction of Wall Street economists that another move would be needed. Economic data available at the time of the September meeting showed that US gross domestic product had grown at a 3.8% annualised pace in the second quarter, the unemployment rate had stabilised at 6.1% and the National Association of Purchasing Managers' index showed a slowdown in manufacturing activity. Since then, second-quarter growth has been revised up to 4.1%, with the third quarter still humming along at a 3.4% rate; unemployment has dipped to 5.8% and the NAPM index has risen sharply for the past two months. Industrial production figures yesterday added to the picture of 'persistent strength in economic activity and high and rising levels of resource utilisation'. (c) The Financial Times Limited 1994.

The index closed 130.23 up at 19,391.68 after fluctuating in a narrow range between 19,432.59 and 19,314.76. Brokerage dealers and domestic institutions purchased shares, but foreign investors turned net sellers. Sentiment stayed subdued, with many investors remaining cautious ahead of the US Federal Open Market Committee meeting, and volume eased from 229m shares to 219m. The Topix index of all first section stocks firmed 10.82 to 1,528.64 and the Nikkei 300 moved forward 2.10 to 280.80, while rises outnumbered falls by 738 to 219, with 205 issues unchanged. But in London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index eased 1.06 to 1,259.44. Traders said speculative investors, discouraged by the low volatility in the first section, explored the second section and the over-the-counter market. A branch manager at Nikko Securities said he would recommend that clients focus on small-capitalisation stocks on the second section and in the OTC market backed by strong earnings growth. The second section index climbed 35.25 or 1.7% to 2,147.11. Privatisation issues, which had been battered by recent profit-taking, staged a rally. Reports that the government had abandoned the plan to list West Japan Railways in the current fiscal year cheered market participants. Japan Tobacco recouped Y 30,000 at Y 991,000 on buying by corporate investors, breaking out after six straight sessions of decline. Nippon Telegraph and Telephone gained Y 12,000 at Y 876,000. Brokers, which have been hurt by the recent drop in the stock market, advanced. Nomura Securities rose Y 60 to Y 1,930 and Nikko Securities Y 30 to Y 1,030. Steels and shipbuilders were actively traded but finished mixed. Nippon Steel, the most active issue of the day, moved up Y 3 to Y 385 and Mitsubishi Heavy Industries added Y 9 at Y 749. NKK dipped Y 4 to Y 276. High-technology stocks were firm. NEC improved Y 20 to Y 1,180 and Hitachi Y 4 to Y 974.

However, the view remained that the US situation offered trading, rather than investment, potential. Concerns over US inflation data and rates trends over the longer term were expected to linger after the US credit tightening move widely expected yesterday. Recently weak banks and property shares attracted the most attention, with HSBC, the most active stock, appreciating HKDollars 1.75 to HKDollars 91.25, Sun Hung Kai Properties HKDollars 1 to HKDollars 58.25 and Henderson Land HKDollars 1.50 to HKDollars 49.90. KUALA LUMPUR reported strong retail and institutional buying as the KLSE index rose 25.43 or 2.4% to 1,069.74, its largest single-day gain in more than three months. Volume swelled to 299m shares, its highest in four weeks, from Monday's 132m. Brokers said the market had factored in a 50 basis-point increase in US interest rates, but that a larger rise could put some pressure on the market. Meanwhile, Baring Securities market strategist Mr Alan Butler-Henderson said in his Tiger Talk monthly that the Malaysian market would have the 'best bounce' after any US interest rate increase. BANGKOK surged as the market finally discounted expectations of a rise in US interest rates, and the SET index closed 19.01 better at 1,496.85 in heavy turnover of Bt8.69bn. Buying interest emerged initially in the finance sector, and spilled over to some property issues. SINGAPORE ended off intraday highs, the Straits Times Industrial index finally standing 14.24 up at 2,341.18. Foreign held bank shares were firm, Overseas Union Bank foreign gaining 25 cents at S$8.75, United Overseas Bank foreign 20 cents at S$16.30 and Overseas Chinese Bank foreign 50 cents at S$15.80. WELLINGTON was led down by forestry stocks Fletcher Challenge and Carter Holt Harvey as the NZSE-40 index retreated 11.98 to 2,042.63. Fletcher finished 14 cents off at NZ$4.12 after some forecasters downgraded their expectations, and Carter slipped 6 cents to NZ$3.78 in sympathy. Workers at Fletcher Challenge Canada's three British Columbia pulp and paper mills voted on Monday in favour of strike action over working conditions, which would not have helped the stock's tone, said brokers. SYDNEY's All Ordinaries index rallied 15.0 to 1,941.4, with brokers noting bargain hunting in resource stocks following the heavy selling in this sector in the previous few days. Among the day's best performers, BHP moved ahead 20 cents to A$19.10, CRA 18 cents to A$17.84 and MIM 6 cents to A$2.54. In the media section, News Corp was down 4 cents at A$5.34 after losing an early gain, but Fairfax advanced 12 cents to A$2.72. KARACHI sagged at the close as market sentiment remained depressed by fears of ethnic violence in Karachi, political uncertainty and shortage of funds. The KSE 100-share index fell 18.67 or 0.9% to 2,178.91.

Brokers remarked that turnover had been slow before rising towards the close, although individual share price movements had been restricted by the Federal Reserve's FOMC meeting. One of the features was a rise in the price of bullion, which lifted the golds index a modest 4 points to 2,168, a gain matched by the overall index, which closed at 5,865 after trading in a narrow 10-point range throughout the session.

The three-year tranche is likely to carry a coupon of 3 7/8%, the 10-year tranche a coupon of 5.0% and the 20-year tranche a coupon of 5.5%, market sources said. The deal, due to be launched early this morning, will be lead-managed by Daiwa, with Nomura as joint book-runner on the three and 20-year tranches. The three-year tranche is targeted mainly at Japanese retail investors, while the 20-year tranche hopes to find demand among Japanese institutional investors, Daiwa said. Daiwa hopes that the 10-year tranche will excite some interest among Asian investors outside Japan and among European investors. The offering, the third time Italy has tapped the yen market this year, is likely to complete its foreign borrowing programme for 1994. The Hellenic Republic is also rumoured to be close to launching its global dollar offering, which is expected to focus on the five-year area. Joint-lead manager Salomon Brothers was last night unable to comment on the size and terms of the offering. With market attention occupied by the outcome of the US Federal open market committee meeting and by a series of new US economic statistics, there was little new issuance in the eurobond market yesterday. In the Dutch guider sector, Asfinag, the sovereign Austrian financing authority, launched a Fl 300m offering of eight-year bonds, priced to yield 20 basis points over Dutch government bonds. About Fl 150m of the offering was bought by Dutch institutions, lead manager ABN Amro said, with Belgian retail investors also showing some interest. The proceeds were swapped into floating-rate Austrian schillings. In the dollar sector, Sampo Corporation launched a $50m offering of seven-year bonds offering a coupon of 2.75% and callable after five years. Japan's Electric Power Development Company is rumoured to be poised to tap the dollar sector with a $300m offering of five-year bonds, IBJ is said to have the mandate to lead the deal.

827,333.0,1996-08-21,"AMERICA: Wall Street The Dow Jones Industrial Average continued to edge ahead yesterday in very light trading after the Federal Reserve's policy-making committee left US interest rates unchanged, writes Richard Waters. Wall Street had already come to the view that the Federal Open Market Committee would elect not to raise rates, but yesterday's news still lent support to the more interest-rate sensitive stocks among the Dow's 30 constituents. The index of leading stocks continued where it had left off on Monday, a day which had seen the second-lowest trading volume of the year so far. By the end of the day, the Dow was at 5,721.26, up 21.86 from the previous close. That brought its total gains in the past five sessions to more than 70 points. The broader Standard &Poor's 500, meanwhile, lost ground, falling back 0.89 to 665.69, while the Nadsaq composite eased 6.24 to 1,124.67. The Dow's advance was driven largely by gains among companies whose earnings are most directly tied to the economic cycle, reflecting a belief that interest rates are unlikely to rise until late in the year, if then. Among the biggest movers, Alcoa rose $1 3/8 to $63 1/8, a rise of 2.2%, while Caterpillar was up $1, or 1.4%, at $71 3/8 and Du Pont rose $1 5/8 to $83 5/8. AT&T, which had been the biggest decliner among the 30 shares in the Dow index on Monday, recovered some of its lost ground, adding $1/8 to $54 1/4. That repaired some of the damage done by the departure of its highly regarded president, Mr Alex Mandl, who has left to join Associated Communications, a new wireless telecommunications company. Shares in Associated Group, that company's main shareholder, advanced further yesterday, adding another $2 to $32 1/4 after the $4 3/4 gain on Monday. AT&T's shares remain some 10% below their level of early July, when the company reported disappointing second quarter earnings. Another Dow stock to record solid gains was Philip Morris, which registered a further partial rebound from the sharp drop precipitated by an adverse court ruling 12 days ago. The company rose $1 5/8, or 1.8%, to $91 1/2. The Nasdaq slipped on a fall among some of the biggest stocks traded on the market, among them Intel, which slipped $1 1/4 to $79 1/2 and Cisco Sytems, which fell $1 to $55.

828,334.0,1996-08-21,"Activity in the eurobond market was dampened yesterday by the ongoing meeting of the US Federal Reserve's Open Market Committee and jitters ahead of tomorrow's Bundesbank council meeting. The summer lull also continues to weigh on the market, but dealers said US dollar issuance might resume once the FOMC meeting was over - provided it bore no nasty surprises. ""Given the success of the World Bank's and Canada's issues, I think there's room for more 10-year paper,"" said one. Kansai International Airport is thought to be planning a transaction, with dealers expecting $200m of 10-year bonds via IBJ, with a yield spread rumoured to be in the high 20s. Among the sparse new offerings, Coventry Building Society made a rare appearance in the sterling sector with #100m of five-year floating-rate notes. It replaces a #100m issue which was called yesterday, making it the only outstanding Coventry deal in the market. Lead manager HSBC Markets said Coventry last year jointly topped UBS's annual survey of UK building societies with the Halifax Building Society. Moreover, the offering followed Monday's announcement of well-received interim results, it said. The bonds are rated single-A by IBCA, the European rating agency. HSBC said a sizeable part of the issue was placed away from traditional UK building-society accounts and reported buying by overseas banks, UK corporations and institutions. Other offerings were very much aimed at retail investors in continental Europe. In the D-Mark sector, triple-A rated Nederlandse Gasunie issued DM 200m of five-year bonds, yielding 17 basis points over German government notes, via Rabobank and SBC Warburg. ""Dutch credits are particularly popular in Switzerland,"" a syndicate official said. Another retail-targeted transaction was a NZ$100m issue for Commerzbank - the German bank's first appearance in the New Zealand dollar sector. Pricing of the bonds at five basis points over New Zealand government debt at the offer price compares favourably with a short-dated issue launched on Monday for the Province of Manitoba at a 6 basis point spread, lead manager Hambros Bank said. Commerzbank is rated Aa2/AA-and Manitoba A1/A+. South Africa's Department of Finance has appointed Merrill Lynch as lead manager of its forthcoming Yankee bond issue - its first foray into the US domestic bond market.

829,335.0,1996-08-21,"US Treasury bond prices ended yesterday virtually unchanged on the day after the Federal Reserve's Open Market Committee decided, as expected, to leave US interest rates unchanged. The benchmark 30-year bond first rose by 1/8 on publication of June trade figures and then fell back by 1/4 on news early in the afternoon of the FOMC's decision. By the end of the day, the long bond had returned to where it started in light trading, with the price at 99 3/8 and the yield at 6.794%. The outcome of the FOMC meeting, though widely predicted, brought some relief after caution had set in early in the day, leading to some profit-taking among holders of longer-dated securities. Earlier, the trade figures had showed a deficit for June of $8.1bn, below the $9.6bn that had been forecast and an outcome that underpinned the dollar. That gave a modest, though short-lived, boost to the fixed income markets. Shorter-dated securities were also largely unchanged after the FOMC meeting, with the two-year Treasury note standing at 100 9/16, a rise of 1/32 on the day, to yield 5.937%. * Italian bonds showed the worst performance among European markets for the second consecutive day, as political uncertainty rose. Liffe's September BTP future closed at 115.71, down 0.17, but fell to a low of 115.37 in trading after the exchange's official close. In the cash market the 10-year BTP yield spread over bunds widened by 3 basis points to 329 points. In addition to the ongoing budget-related uncertainty, BTPs suffered when the reformed communist party voiced its opposition to the sale of Stet, the state-owned telecommunications group, and threatened to withdraw its support from the coalition government. The economic environment, although more favourable, failed to support bonds. Wholesale and producer price indices were below market expectations, reinforcing ""the view that the headline inflation rate will fall in August"", according to economists at Bear Stearns, who now expect consumer price inflation to show a headline rate of 3.4% for August, down from 3.6% in July. The Bank of Italy hinted earlier this summer that it would cut official interest rates again when the inflation rate approached 3%. * UK gilts ended a quiet day slightly lower, as uncertainty over the outcome of the FOMC meeting weighed on market sentiment. Liffe's September long gilt future settled at 108, down 1/8. Traders largely ignored the release of mildly bullish money supply data. The M4 monetary aggregate rose by only 0.4% in July, bringing the year-on-year rate of growth down to 8.8%, below its official monitoring range for the first time in 10 months. The Bank of England yesterday announced the details of the August 28 gilt auction. A total of #2.5bn of 7 1/2% treasury stock due 2006 will be tendered. * German bunds weakened slightly, in spite of the release of encouraging money supply data. Liffe's September bund future closed at 98.05, down 0.03. The Bundesbank announced that M3 money supply had fallen in July to an annual growth rate of 8.6%, in line with market expectations. Hopes of a cut in the repo rate tomorrow were intact, with analysts predicting a 10 basis point easing, to 3.20%. ""The data do not increase the chances of a cut"", one trader said. ""But they do not rule them out either."" Although an easing is widely believed to be already priced into bunds, it could ""help put the convergence process [of the high-yielding markets] back on the tracks"", one trader said. Economists at UBS in Frankfurt, however, warn that ""a repo cut is not a safe bet and there is certainly a risk that the Bundesbank might disappoint the market again"". * The weakness of the rand continued to drive activity on the South African market yesterday. Bonds mirrored the state of the currency, which ended a quiet day weaker after the battering it took in New York on Monday following publication of a report which claimed that it was over-valued. Dealers said the bond market had been fairly stable, ""apart from some short-covering"" by local traders in the morning and ""a bit of institutional nibbling at higher levels"". After trading in a range between 15.655% and 15.710%, the yield on the key R150 stock was last pegged at 15.665%, up from 15.565% late on Monday. Copyright Financial Times Limited 1996.

The Dow's advance during the morning was driven largely by gains among companies whose earnings are most directly tied to the economic cycle. That reflected the general belief that US short-term interest rates will remain unchanged, at least until after November's presidential election. Among the biggest movers, Alcoa rose $1 1/8 to $62 7/8, while Caterpillar $7/8 to $71 1/4 and Du Pont $1 1/8 to $83 1/8. AT&T, which had been the biggest decliner in the Dow on Monday, recovered some of its lost ground, adding $1/4 to $54 3/8.

831,337.0,1996-08-21,"MARKETS REPORT: An unexpectedly sharp fall in the US trade deficit helped push the dollar higher against the Japanese yen, when most attention was focused on money supply data and interest rate decisions. Coming ahead of yesterday's Federal Open Market Committee meeting in Washington yesterday, the deficit data finally took the dollar over Y 108, after being range-bound in recent weeks. At the close of trading in London, the dollar was at Y 108.330, from Y 107.950 the previous day. But the dollar was muted against European currencies, ending against the D-Mark at DM 1.4893, from DM 1.4882. Against sterling it was worth $1.5472, from $1.5455. The slight D-Mark weakness came after the announcement of long-awaited German money supply figures. The decline in M3 growth was accurately anticipated by the markets, after comments earlier this month by Mr Otmar Issing, the Bundesbank's chief economist, that it would fall. In Australia, the new conservative government's first budget proved to be a disappointment for those expecting large spending cuts. Mr Peter Costello, the federal treasurer, held out hopes of interest rate cuts to come, and the Australian dollar fell against the US dollar in London, ending at A$1.2718, from A$1.2658. * The only game in town continues to be Bundesbank-watching - at least for the next 24 hours. European cross trades continued to be dominated by expectations of a cut in the repurchase rate or a move by the bank to a variable repurchase rate sooner or later. Germany's July M3 growth fell to 8.6% year-on-year, from 9.6% in the previous month. The M3 fall may herald a cut by the Bundesbank in its repo rate at its central council meeting tomorrow. But rumours circulated in the markets that today's Ifo German business sentiment survey would be very strong. That, if true, would reduce the chances of a rate cut tomorrow. Some areas of the market appear to have already discounted a relatively big rate cut. But Ms Alison Cottrell, international economist at Paine Webber in London, warns that those expectations risk disappointment. She is expecting a cut of only 5 basis points, after the bank's success in talking the D-Mark down in recent months. ""They've exhausted their barking potential, and now they've got to have some bite,"" she said. The bank could also include a switch to a variable repo rate within the next week or two. Ms Cottrell said the Bundesbank would also be looking to help France after its recent currency travails, not for political reasons but because economic recovery in both countries is vulnerable. * The US trade deficit in goods and services declined to $8.11bn, from a revised $10.55bn gap in May. Analysts had expected a $9.4bn deficit in June. Mr Larry Hatheway, senior currency economist at UBS in London, said that the US trade data was the final confirmation that the Federal Reserve had no need to raise interest rates. ""It's a further sign that the economy is not as robust as was thought two or three months ago,"" he said. * The Australian government's budget turned out to be a victim of its own success, as analysts pronounced disappointment with the final deficit figure of A$5.65bn and a headline surplus of A$474m for 1996/97. The disappointment followed speculation of harsher spending cuts, to get the deficit below A$5bn. Mr Peter Costello, the treasurer, said he would like an interest rate cut by the end of 1996. ""I'd like that to be an outcome and I am going to do the best to make sure we are going to get it,"" he said. Mr Costello said a rate cut was possible when the budget was passed by the Senate, the Australian parliament's upper house. That puts pressure on opposition parties in the Senate not to block the new measures. Copyright Financial Times Limited 1996. All Rights Reserved.

'Anything less than a half-point rise will not please the market,' was the consensus view at last night's London close of trading.

A survey of the distributive trades by the Confederation of British Industry was favourably received. Although the awareness that the FOMC meeting would not even start until late in the London trading day inhibited activity in UK stocks, there were plenty of company trading statements to keep dealers on the alert.

Allied-Lyons and Hanson said the year had begun satisfactorily and BOC, seen as an industrial market leader, traded heavily after a very positive interim statement. The stock market remained hopeful that determined action by the Fed would at last settle nerves in the bond market and, by stabilising bond yields, enable the equity market to respond to improvement in corporate dividends and earnings. While the markets will remain on tenterhooks until there is news from the FOMC meeting, London today faces important data on the domestic economy. UK analysts expect these to confirm that domestic inflation has remained subdued, and thus ward off fears that UK base rates will be forced higher later this year. Building and construction issues rose after the latest official statistics showed new orders were 10% up from the 1993 first quarter. But there were further signs that investors are turning away from the engineering and vehicles sec-tors, believed by some analysts to have outrun the economic recovery. Progress was somewhat patchy elsewhere in the market, with the food and brewery stocks showing a mixed picture as investors waited for the March retail sales statistics. Pharmaceuticals stocks continued to move nervously as attention focused on SmithKline Beecham and investors pondered the likely effect of the expiry this week of US patents on Tagamet, SmithKline's high selling anti-ulcer drug. London outperformed other leading European stock markets yesterday and UK traders sounded relatively confident that the Footsie can at last climb away from 3,100, if only the bond markets can establish themselves in a new trading range. Strategists were encouraged by the increase in trading volume as the market rallied yesterday afternoon. (c) The Financial Times Limited 1994.

834,340.0,1994-05-18,"After a morning of quiet anticipation, US Treasury bonds prices jumped yesterday afternoon on news that the Federal Reserve would lift short-term interest rates by 50 basis points. Late in the session, the benchmark 30-year government bond was 1 25/32 higher at 87 9/16, with the yield slipping about 20 basis points to 7.276%. At the short end, the two-year note was up 5/32 at 99 1/4, to yield 5.894%. In early activity, investors were unwilling to make any fresh commitments as most were convinced the Fed would raise rates again after a meeting of the policy-making Federal Open Market Committee in Washington. Although there was a general consensus that a policy move was imminent, there was disagreement among traders over how aggressively the central bank would act. Most believed the discount rate - which the Fed charges on loans to commercial banks - was due for an increase of 50 basis points. In its previous three moves this year, the central bank had left the discount rate unchanged. However, traders were divided on whether the Fed would lift its target for the Federal funds rate - charged by banks on overnight loans to one another - by 50 or 25 basis points. In each of the previous tightenings, the Fed chose the more timid of the two figures. In the event, it decided on a more aggressive approach, lifting both the discount rate and Fed funds target by 50 basis points, to 3.50% and 4.25% respectively. The market's response was immediate. The moves helped the long end of the yield curve by easing any lingering concern over inflationary pressures. Shorter-term securities benefited as well, because the bold strike appeared to dispel the uncertainty engendered by the Fed's earlier gradualism. The decisiveness of yesterday's move suggested it was the last in the current series. This view was reinforced by the central bank in its announcement of the policy change. 'These actions, combined with the three previous adjustments initiated earlier this year by the FOMC, substantially remove the degree of monetary accommodation which prevailed throughout 1993,' it said. Mr Alan Greenspan, the Fed's chairman, had said his goal was to shift the bank's policy until it had a 'neutral' impact on the economy. European trading was also overshadowed by the FOMC meeting, leaving most markets to drift sideways in moderate turnover. After tracking German bonds in the morning, French bonds spurted ahead in the afternoon. Some traders said this was caused by late short-covering in the futures pits in expectation of bond-positive news from the Fed. Moreover, investors were switching from Germany into France, said Mr Brian Hilliard, senior international economist at Societe Generale Strauss Turnbull in London. The June notional French bond future rose 0.34 points to close at 121.10. The June Bund future was down 0.16 points in after-hours trading at 95.67. In Germany, the focus today will be on the Bundesbank's latest allocation of securities repurchase agreements. German money market traders surveyed by MMS International expect the minimum rate to fall by 12 basis points to 5.23%. Trade in the UK government bond market was again quiet ahead of the results of the FOMC meeting and today's UK economic data. The market firmed in afternoon trading, largely on the back of strength in US Treasuries, The June long gilt futures contract was up 5/16 at 105 11/32 in after-hours trading. The Bank of England announcement that its May 25 gilt auction would be of #2bn of 7.0% 1997 stock, convertible into 9.0% 2012 stock, for the first time on August 6, drew little reaction 'This is a very uncertain issue,' said Mr Don Smith of Midland Global Markets. 'There is no other stock like it in the market, which makes pricing it very difficult.' But analysts said there would be sufficient demand. Today's release of UK average earnings and RPI data coincides with the publication of the minutes of the March meeting between the chancellor and the governor of the Bank of England. 'The avalanche of information could cause quite a choppy time in the markets, especially if there is a pick-up in earnings and inflation, and if there are signs of a disagreement between the chancellor and the governor,' said Mr Smith. The Italian bond market is awaiting today's vote of confidence in the Senate on prime minister Silvio Berlusconi's government. Although his coalition is short of a majority in the Senate, most observers expect him to scrape through. Meanwhile, technical distortions at the long end of the Italian yield curve have created buying opportunities, said Mr Jouni Kokko of S. G. Warburg. (c) The Financial Times Limited 1994.

835,341.0,1994-05-18,"Tokyo Investors remained inactive ahead of the US Federal Reserve Board's Open Market Committee meeting, and the Nikkei 225 average declined on index linked selling by arbitrageurs, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. The index was finally 54.91 easier at 20,133.53 after a day's low of 20,067.41 and high of 20,174.93. A fall in futures prices on the overnight Chicago market prompted a bout of arbitrage selling earlier in the session. Small-lot buying by overseas investors later eroded some of the losses. Volume remained low, totalling 251m shares against 285m. The Topix index of all first section stocks dipped 2.58 to 1,636.43 and the Nikkei 300 lost 0.54 at 299.13. Declines led rises by 614 to 369, with 188 issues unchanged. In London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index was 1.19 firmer at 1,335.88. Market participants said many investors were still wary of any surprises from the spate of company earnings announcements and were reluctant to commit funds in spite of the yen's easing against the dollar. Meanwhile, technical indicators were also worrying some dealers. 'The three short term moving averages nearly converging, the lack of volatility and the very low volumes seem to be precursors of a sharp move up or down,' said Mr Yutaka Nakai, analyst at Daiwa Securities. High-technology stocks were higher on buying by foreign investors. Hitachi, the day's most active issue, rose Y 5 to Y 1,000 and Toshiba put on Y 3 at Y 798. Large-capital steels were also firmer, with Kawasaki Steel up Y 2 to Y 385. Some banks were lower on arbitrage selling. Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank slipped Y 10 to Y 1,950. Profit-taking depressed real estate and pharmaceuticals shares, previously bought as laggards. Mitsubishi Estate receded Y 20 to Y 1,220 and Takeda Chemical Y 30 to Y 1,230. The rise in gold and copper prices buoyed mining shares. Dowa Mining advanced Y 12 to Y 585 and Sumitomo Metal Mining added Y 13 at Y 925. The low volume encouraged individual investors' trading in speculative stocks. Ga-jo-en Kanko forged ahead Y 27 to Y 184 and Wakachiku Construction gained Y 9 at Y 669. Brother Industries, however, relinquished Y 13 to Y 706 on profit-taking. In Osaka, the OSE average shed 57.55 to 22,366.93 in volume of 20.4m shares. Aoyama Trading, the men's suits retailer, fell Y 120 to Y 4,180. Roundup Regional markets continued mixed, awaiting the outcome of yesterday's FOMC meeting. HONG KONG closed sharply lower as the brief detention of a prominent Beijing dissident raised worries about the renewal of China's Most Favoured Nation trade status with the US in a market already cautious about US interest rates. The Hang Seng index dropped 208.71, or 2.3%, to 9,044.70. Turnover came to HKDollars 4.88bn, against a revised HKDollars 4.10bn on Monday. The market was also speculating about a possible early agreement with China on financing Hong Kong's new airport, but news that the Sino-British Airport Committee will meet on Friday to discuss the issue emerged after the market close. Among blue chips, HSBC slid HKDollars 2.50 to HKDollars 83.50, China Light HKDollars 1 to HKDollars 40.75, Swire Pacific 'A' HKDollars 2 to HKDollars 55.50 and Hutchison HKDollars 1 to HKDollars 30. TAIPEI retreated 1.6% as profits were taken following the market's recent rally. The weighted index fell 98.95 to 6,015.83 in TDollars 67.3bn turnover. Financials led the falls, with China Development down TDollars 3.5 to TDollars 129.5 and Cathay Life losing TDollars 6 to TDollars 257. SINGAPORE was steady with selective buying seen among blue chips. The Straits Times Industrial index finished 14.08 higher at 2,304.49. Shipyard stocks were firmer amid talk that a foreign brokerage was issuing covered warrants on a basket of shipyard companies. KUALA LUMPUR was easier after a moderate session, a spate of selling near the close having pushed the index down from an early high. The composite index settled 5.88 off at 991.96 in volume of 76.4m shares. Telekoms, facing a competitive telephone system, weakened 90 cents to M$18.70. SYDNEY retreated after Monday's sharp gain.

BHP slipped 30 cents to A$17.94, Western Mining dropped 23 cents to A$7.85 and Pasminco shed 15 cents to A$1.80. CRA contrasted with a rise of 8 cents to A$18.46. Turnover amounted to A$560m. In the banking sector, ANZ slipped 7 cents to A$4.75, Westpac dipped 4 cents to A$4.98 and National Australia eased 2 cents to A$12.04. WELLINGTON eased, with most of the day's activity taking place in Fletcher Challenge. FCL closed 1 cent up at NZ$3.90 as the NZSE-40 Capital index shed 8.21 to 2,118.04 in turnover of NZ$51m. SEOUL turned higher in a technical rebound after its three-day consolidation, and the composite index improved 5.21 to 946.87 ahead of today's market holiday. MANILA rose strongly, helped by an overnight gain on Wall Street for PLDT, together with buying of San Miguel and Manila Electric. The composite index moved forward 34.20 to 2,936.43. Turnover was 950.4m pesos. PLDT put on 50 pesos at 1,955 pesos, San Miguel 'B' increased 5 pesos to 235 and Manila Electric added 5 pesos at 330. BOMBAY's 30-share index registered a 41.59 decline at 3,802.50 after index-weighted shares fell, but the broader market was steady after a dull session. Hopes remained high, however, that forward trading will be allowed to resume after a meeting of the Securities and Exchange Board of India on Friday. The old badla, or carry forward system, was banned in mid-March on the grounds that it led to excessive speculation.

FRANKFURT moved into retreat as Monday's record levels failed to inspire a follow on of momentum. The Dax index eased back 11.40 to 2,259.71 during the official session. Turnover was DM 7.4bn. Sentiment was upset by news that Schneider debt was higher than anticipated, with estimates of between DM 3.5bn to DM 4bn. This report affected the banks who are exposed to the property group with Deutsche Bank, for example, slipping DM 10 to DM 781.50. Lufthansa continued to weaken on a further round of selling following disappointment over its results on Monday, the shares down a further DM 11.30 to DM 190.20, bringing accumulated losses since the start of the week to 8%. In contrast, Volkswagen rose DM 3.20 to DM 528.70 on news that it was extending working hours at some plants. Nikko Europe issued a buy recommendation earlier in the week, noting that the restructuring programmes should begin to bear fruit in the near term. Furthermore, said Nikko, 'Seat should report a considerable reduction in last year's loss of DM 1.8bn, with a return to profit in 1995 the target'. PARIS took a long look at Eurotunnel which held a shareholders meeting yesterday to approve its rights issue plans. The group lost FFr 1.30 to FFr 35.10 but off a session low of FFr 34.70 as the CAC-40 index rose 7.47 to 2,195.17. Turnover was a moderate FFr 3.7bn. Oil stocks were active as Merrill Lynch added Elf Aquitaine and OMV to its stock selection list and deleted Total and Repsol. Of the French groups Elf was FFr 2.70 stronger at FFr 429.70 while Total shed FFr 4.90 to FFr 342.10. Lyonnaise des Eaux-Dumez, down FFr 12 at FFr 598, denied that it was planning to raise fresh capital, while Club Med slipped FFr 1.90 to FFr 446.10 as it forecast a better first half result. MILAN began the new account in resilient mood, the Comit index rising 11.89 or 1.5% to 801.62, as worries subsided about the outcome of today's parliamentary confidence vote. Blue chips led the advance. Generali rose L1,567 or 3.3% to L48,470, Fiat advanced L149 to L7,188 and Olivetti was L128 or 4.5% higher at L3,003. Ciga, the hotels group advanced L76 or 6.8% to L1,188 in heavy volume of 36m shares amid speculation about stock building as its rights issue sold out. Ferruzzi put on L149 or 7.1% to L2,233 as the company launched its L1,340bn rights issue. Cir rose L134 or 4.7% to L2,994 as its L1,060bn rights issue began, although technical problems blocked business in the rights throughout the session. ZURICH continued on the upward track as domestic buying, and an absence of foreign selling, took the SMI index 18.1 higher to 2,727.1. Roche certificates added SwFr 155 to SwFr 6,705 as presentations to analysts yesterday and on Monday were well received and details of the Syntex takeover appeared to be positive. The certificates have picked up 9% since their low on May 9, following 1993 figures and the Syntex acquisition. However, analysts noted that yesterday's demand came from Swiss banks, buying for their own account, and that sentiment remained fragile. Nestle, another recent weak performer, rose SwFr 20 to SwFr 1,135, on the perception that recent falls had been overdone. Brown Boveri rose SwFr 13 to SwFr 1,275 ahead of today's first quarter figures, with some analysts forecasting a rise of up to 75% in profit. STOCKHOLM maintained a strong run with Astra featuring ahead of first quarter results that came out after the close of business. The Affarsvarlden general index added 7.70 to 1,552.50. Turnover was SKr2.6bn. Astra reported a 15% rise in first quarter pretax profits - the B shares ended the day up SKr1 at SKr161. Volvo, which releases its first quarter figures today, picked up SKr13 in the B shares to SKr758. AMSTERDAM struggled to find some incentive to move and, with the exception of a Fl 2.30 loss in KLM to Fl 53.20, due in partly to profit-taking following good gains last week, the AEX index finished the session just 0.81 ahead at 413.81. MADRID overcame some early profit-taking with late demand taking the general index up 0.71 to finish at the day's high of 334.91 in heavy turnover of Pta36.59bn. Banks, however, remained under pressure with Banesto Pta25 easier at Pta1,120. Argentaria lost Pta100 to Pta6,000 and Santander was marked Pta80 lower at Pta6,350. Agroman, the construction company, was the day's leader, rising Pta75 to Pta825. ISTANBUL rose 3.55% on a technical rebound following a reduction in interest rates. The composite index put on 549.02 to 16,032.68. On Monday the index lost 1%. ATHENS ended slightly lower in light trading as investors remained worried about the prospect of devaluation.

Trading remained cautious prior to today's US unemployment figures and as dealers watched the Fed closely for any signs of a change in monetary policy. In late trading, some long-dated issues were quoted 1/2 point higher, while the Treasury's benchmark long bond stood 3/8 point up for a yield of 8.09 per cent. The short end of the market was up around 1/8 point, reflecting some caution after outperforming the long end earlier in the week.

The Fed decided not to execute matched sales to drain liquidity from the money market yesterday, although bond analysts said there was a need to drain to maintain the status quo on the Fed funds rate. The omission suggested to some that an easing move may have begun. The FOMC was due to end its two-day meeting yesterday.

Few had expected any decision to emerge from the FOMC until it had seen today's unemployment figures for June. The consensus forecast is for a rise in the non-farm payroll of just over 200,000 compared with May's gain of 101,000.

The June figures include five rather than four weeks of unemployment statistics, which accounts for the larger expected rise in the non-farm payroll. A figure of anywhere around 200,000 would be construed as showing enough economic weakness for the Fed to ease Fed funds by another 1/4 point. A figure of 250,000 or more would be interpreted as restraining any easing move by the Fed. Bond economists cautioned that there is considerable risk that the bond market could suffer more from a strong gain in the non-farm payroll than benefit from a weak number because expectations of a soft number are so widespread. * * * The French Government yesterday carried out its first auction of Ecu-denominated state bonds, following the successful syndicated sale of the same Ecu bond in April. The Government accepted bids for 352 m Ecus, 45 per cent of the bids submitted, at a cut-off price of 99.55 per cent, giving a weighted average yield of 8.56 per cent. April's placing, bought mostly by individual investors, had a yield of 8.66 per cent. Dealers said that the first auction tranche should go a considerable way towards making the 8.5 per cent 1997 Fcu bond into a reference for the market. Most of the April placing is firmly held, but around 100 m Ecus worth is still to be traded. The dealers said that yesterday's tranche, bought mostly by international institutions, would add perhaps 300 m Ecus to the float. At the same auction, the Government sold FFr 8.7 bn of French franc bonds, including FFr 3.77 bn of the 10-year fixed rate OAT 8.125 per cent 1999. The Government accepted less than a quarter of the bids submitted, and the cut-off price gave an average yield on the 10-year bond of 8.7 per cent, 23 basis points below the last auction of this bond in May. Only FFr 2 bn was sold of the floating rate OAT TME 2001, indexed on the average of government bond secondary market yields. The margin of 40 basis points below the index was considerably tighter than the 63 basis points recorded when the bond was last auctioned in April. The FFr 2 bn accepted at a price of 97.4 per cent was well clear of the rest of the market. The remaining FFr 5.75 bn of bids went no higher than 97.2 per cent. * * * The success of the French auction helped push the Paris government bond market higher, and prices ended the day 20 to 25 centimes above Wednesday's close. It thus provided a contrast to most of the other European markets, where the prospect of today's US unemployment figures and the feeling that the dollar's recent sharp declines may be due for a temporary reversal made for a cautionary approach. Nevertheless, with a current yield differential of more than 2 per cent above its German counterpart, there are still expectations that the French market can outstrip the performance of its neighbours. The German market turned lower, despite purchases in the market by the Bundesbank, even after a firmer start. The announcement of revised inflation figures, showing inflation in the year to June at 3.1 per cent, instead of the provisionally estimated 2.9 per cent, led the market to lose its early morning gains. The market closed about 10 pfennigs weaker, with some US investment banks reported to be switching out of the German market into US Treasuries and into the French market. The Dutch market kept in step with the German, preserving a yield premium of about 40 basis points. The UK market's three-day rally stalled too, with investors becoming cautious about whether sterling can indefinitely sustain the gains of the past couple of weeks. Sterling's trade-weighted index was 0.1 point higher at 91.9, but conventional gilt prices were up to 1/4 point lower.

839,345.0,2004-05-05,"US stocks yesterday took in their stride the much-anticipated announcement from the Federal Reserve that it would leave interest rates on hold, with any eventual raising taking place in a ""measured"" manner. Having spent much of the day locked in a tight range, the indices jerked upward immediately after the central bank declared victory over deflation and said it would be cautious in lifting borrowing costs from their 46-year lows. However, they settled back in a narrow range after traders such as Jay Suskind at Ryan Beck &Co concluded that ""this is the best that we could have hoped for"". By the close, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up fractionally to 10,317.20 while the S&P 500 index inched up 0.2 per cent to 1,119.51. The Nasdaq Composite added 0.6 per cent at 1,950.48. As expected, the Fed's statement accompanying the decision did not contain ""patient"" in reference to the central bank's stance on monetary policy. ""With inflation low and resource use slack . . . the (policy-making Federal Open Market) committee believes that policy accommodation can be removed at a pace that is likely to be measured,"" the statement said. Even though the Fed said price stability had been achieved, several economic indicators have hinted at increasing inflationary pressures. As such, traders and investors are only concerned with, and have struggled to prepare for, the timing of an interest rate increase and its consequences for the economy and profits. Prompted by the amount of talk about monetary policy, Ned Riley, the chief investment officer at State Street Global Advisors, wrote to clients: ""We must end this mindless and useless speculation about which FOMC meeting will mark the beginning of the end. We all know it will happen. . . . What's the big deal?"" Ryan Beck's Mr Suskind concurred. ""I think (a rate rise) is already priced in, the market is already ahead of the Fed"". He added that rising interest rates in a growing economy were preferable to low interest rates in a recessionary climate. ""A gradual slowdown in economic activity may actually be quite beneficial to facilitating positive longer-term prospects for the economy and stock market,"" added Mr Riley. However, last week Citigroup's technical analysis team warned the market might react more sharply to the first interest rate rise of this cycle. On the corporate front, a handful of companies were still left to report earnings. Tyco, the industrial conglomerate, increased its full-year earnings estimate as it reported above-forecast first-quarter results. Shares were up 3.9 per cent to Dollars 29.07 by the close. Cephalon, the pharmaceuticals company, saw its shares lose 1 per cent to Dollars 56.26 after it reported first-quarter revenues below analysts' expectations. Qwest Communications, the telecommunications carrier, reported a loss for the first quarter because of low sales of its local services. Shares lost 0.3 per cent to Dollars 4.01. Other companies reporting earnings included Northrop Grumman, which said profits decreased in the first quarter. The news sent shares of the defence contractor 0.4 per cent lower to Dollars 99.59. Shares in Safeway were 3.2 per cent higher at Dollars 23.50 after the supermarket chain reported lower profits in its last quarter, which was affected by the tail end of a five-month dispute with labour unions in California. The shares of Kroger were 0.8 per cent higher at Dollars 17.53 while Albertsons eased 0.5 per cent to Dollars 22.95. They were also affected by the dispute. MetLife, the largest life insurance group in the US, slid 0.8 per cent to Dollars 34.59 after it reported a 44 per cent increase in profits after the Monday close. Elsewhere in company news, the shares of Siebel Systems edged off 2.3 per cent to Dollars 10.38 following news after the Monday close that the software maker had replaced its chief executive officer with an executive from IBM.

840,346.0,2004-05-05,"Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve, is no longer making a virtue of patience. The outlook for both sustainable economic growth and for inflation is now balanced. That makes the case for retaining the emergency federal funds rate of 1 per cent for much longer look weak. There is, however, a long journey ahead before the Federal Reserve gets within sight of a ""neutral"" level, which many put at above 3.5 per cent. Given the continuing slack in the US economy, high productivity growth and low levels of inflation there is little rush. And there will be fevered debate at what level ""neutral"" really is in today's world. But the Fed's challenge is to kick off the tightening process without unnerving the markets. So far, so good. The Federal Open Market Committee will no longer be ""patient in removing its policy accommodation"", but it will remove it at a pace that is ""likely to be measured"". That should reassure investors that the Fed has learnt from 1994 - when a sharp tightening cycle caused turmoil in the bond markets. It offers no guarantees, however. While the Fed has signalled it is ""likely"" to move gingerly, it has left itself the option of more aggressive action. In reality investors learnt little yesterday they had not worked out for themselves. Interest rates are set to go up. The Fed has no plans to go for a kamikaze increase. But the outlook has already shifted dramatically in a matter of months. The Fed's desire for a ""measured"" approach will remain at the mercy of job creation and inflation data as the year progresses. ",Measure for measure - THE LEX COLUMN.,2004-05-04,The Financial Times
841,347.0,2004-05-05,"US stocks took in their stride the much-anticipated announcement from the Federal Reserve that it would leave interest rates unchanged but would raise them in a ""measured"" manner. Having spent much of the day locked in a tight range, the indices jerked upward immediately after the central bank declared victory over deflation and said it would be cautious in lifting borrowing costs from their 46-year lows. However, they settled back in a narrow range after traders such as Jay Suskind at Ryan Beck &Co concluded that ""this is the best that we could have hoped for"". Shortly after the Fed's announcement, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 0.1 per cent to 10,324.80 while the S&P 500 index inched up 0.2 per cent to 1,119.81. The Nasdaq Composite added 0.5 per cent at 1,949.05. As expected, the Fed's statement accompanying the decision does not contain ""patient"" in reference to the central bank's stance on monetary policy. ""With inflation low and resource use slack . . . the (policy-making Federal Open Market) committee believes that policy accommodation can be removed at a pace that is likely to be measured,"" the statement says. Even though the Fed said price stability had been achieved, several economic indicators have hinted at increasing inflationary pressures. As such, traders and investors are only concerned with, and have struggled to prepare for, the timing of an interest rate increase and its consequences for the economy and profits. Prompted by the amount of talk about monetary policy, Ned Riley, the chief investment officer at State Street Global Advisors, wrote to clients: ""We must end this mindless and useless speculation about which FOMC meeting will mark the beginning of the end. We all know it will happen. . . . What's the big deal?"" Ryan Beck's Mr Suskind concurred. ""I think (a rate rise) is already priced in, the market is already ahead of the Fed"". He added that rising interest rates in a growing economy were preferable to low interest rates in a recessionary climate. ""A gradual slowdown in economic activity may actually be quite beneficial to facilitating positive longer-term prospects for the economy and stock market,"" added Mr Riley. However, last week Citigroup's technical analysis team had warned the market might react more sharply to the first interest rate rise of this cycle. On the corporate front, a handful of companies were still left to report earnings. Tyco, the industrial conglomerate, increased its full-year earnings estimate as it reported above-forecast first-quarter results. Shares rose 3.9 per cent to Dollars 29.07 in mid-afternoon trading. Cephalon, the pharmaceuticals company, saw its shares lose 1.4 per cent to Dollars 56.02 after it reported first-quarter revenues below analysts' expectations. Qwest Communications, the telecommunications carrier, reported a loss for the first quarter because of low sales of its local services. Shares lost 0.5 per cent to Dollars 4.01. Other companies due to report included Northrop Grumman, which said profits decreased in the first quarter. The news sent shares of the defence contractor 0.4 per cent lower to Dollars 99.54. Shares in Safeway were 3.1 per cent higher at Dollars 23.49 after the supermarket chain reported lower profits in its last quarter, which was affected by the tail end of a five-month dispute with labour unions in California. The shares of Kroger were 0.9 per cent higher at Dollars 17.56 while Albertsons eased 0.2 per cent to Dollars 22.95. Both companies were affected by the dispute. MetLife, the largest life insurance group in the US, was up 0.2 per cent to Dollars 34.96 after it reported a 44 per cent increase in profits after the Monday close. Elsewhere in company news, the shares of Siebel Systems edged off 1.6 per cent to Dollars 10.45 following news after the Monday close that the software maker had replaced its chief executive officer with an executive from IBM.

842,348.0,2004-05-05,"The US Federal Reserve yesterday signalled a shift in its stance on monetary policy, leaving interest rates unchanged while saying that inflation risks are now balanced and that rates would be raised ""at a pace that is likely to be measured"". The Fed's latest hints about the looming US rate rise come as the Bank of England's monetary policy committee meets to discuss raising rates for what would be the third time since November. In its statement, released after the meeting of its rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee, the Fed dropped its commitment to be ""patient in removing its policy accommodation"". Instead, it said: ""At this juncture, with inflation low and resource use slack, the Committee believes that policy accommodation can be removed at a pace that is likely to be measured."" The decision to leave the federal funds rate on hold at 1 per cent was universally expected, and attention was focused on changes to the statement for clues to the FOMC's intentions for the future. Futures markets suggest expectations of a quarter point increase in the fed funds rate by the time of the FOMC's August meeting. The statement did little to discourage such expectations or to encourage the idea that the Fed will raise rates when it meets at the end of June. In Britain, independent economists overwhelmingly expect that the Bank of England will raise its main interest rate a quarter point to 4.25 per cent tomorrow. However the MPC is also seen as likely to proceed slowly with further increases. The futures markets, which MPC members have suggested are a useful benchmark for expectations, imply the Bank's main interest rate will be about 4.75 per cent at the end of the year, and about 5 per cent at the end of next year. Household borrowing figures and two business surveys yesterday reinforced the case for higher rates. The CBI reported a surge in retail sales in April; in its distributive trades survey, 51 per cent of respondents said sales were up on a year ago, while 21 per cent said they were down. In the manufacturing industry, for which the official output data have been disappointing in recent months, the Chartered Institute of Purchasing and Supply reported a strong rise in its purchasing managers' index from 53.8 in March to 55.1 in April.

843,349.0,2004-05-05,"The dollar fell to a four-week low against the euro in London morning trade on Wednesday after the US authorities said they could afford to be ""measured"" in raising interest rates from 46-year lows. As widely expected, the Federal Open Market Committee said the upside and downside risks to sustainable growth were now ""roughly equal"" and the risks to price stability have ""moved into balance"". The well-worn phrase that the FOMC could be ""patient"" in removing its policy accommodation also disappeared this time around. But the replacement: ""that policy accommodation can be removed at a pace that is likely to be measured"", created almost as many questions as it answered. Most took the statement to mean that US rates will not rise in June. With no meeting planned for July, August would thus be the first opportunity for a hike - at the dovish end of prior expectations. ""The FOMC has set itself up to where its earliest hike can't come until August 10 because the statement is insufficient to prep the market for a June 30 rate hike,"" said Aziz McMahon, currencies strategist at ABN Amro. Simon Derrick, head of currency research at Bank of New York, argued against a June rise on the grounds that several Fed officials have called for ""several months"" of continued improvement in the jobs market before sanctioning a rate rise, a desire probably not satisfied by the FOMC's assertion that ""hiring appears to have picked up"". National Australia Bank and Credit Agricole Indosuez also plumped for an August tightening, but Ashraf Laidi, chief currency analyst at MG Financial, broke ranks by calling the meeting a ""stepping stone towards a June hike. ""Failure to raise rates in June shall induce risks of being behind the curve in the face of a potentially strong June labour report, due in July 2 when there is no FOMC meeting, and in the face of a strong July labour report, due in August 6."" said Mr Laidi. ""Thus if the Fed stands pat in the June meeting, its next meeting won't be until August, three payroll reports later. Should those reports show strong job creation, the Fed will then have to tighten by 50 basis points in August, which may appear to be too late, always a negative for the markets and the dollar."" However with the more dovish argument holding sway, the dollar extended Tuesday's sell-off, slipping a further cent against the euro to $1.2157, a four-week low. The greenback also fell to a two-week low against sterling at $1.7977 and lost Y1 against the yen at Y109.08. Even the Australian dollar made headway against its US namesake, rising a US cent to $0.7315, despite the Reserve Bank of Australia holding rates at 5.25 per cent overnight.

The Fed has now cut interest rates by 125bp in little more than a week responding to concerns that the US economy is slowing rapidly.  Further evidence of this contraction was provided by a report which showed the economy slowed sharply to a 0.6 per cent growth rate in the last three months of 2007, only half the rate forecast by economists and down from 4.9 per cent in the previous quarter. For all of 2007, the economy expanded at its slowest pace since 2002, growing just 2.2 per cent.  However, a snapshot of private sector employment painted a contrasting picture, as a projection of hiring in January by ADP showed a rise of 130,000 jobs.  Although ADP numbers can be volatile, economists now expect the closely watched January employment report, due on Friday, to show a gain of 65,000, up from 18,000 in December.  ""There are two possible interpretations of the job situation,"" said TJ Marta, strategist at RBC Capital Markets.

850,356.0,2006-03-29,"US Treasury yields jumped yesterday afternoon after the Federal Reserve raised borrowing rates to 4.75 per cent as expected and continued to suggest further rate hikes ""may be needed"". The Federal Open Market Committee, meeting under Ben Bernanke's chairmanship for the first time, raised rates for a fifteenth consecutive time by 0.25 per cent. Although it changed the wording of its economic assessment, the FOMC left policy-related passages of the statement unchanged, leaving the door open for further rate hikes. ""In sticking to the January text, the statement makes clear that the Fed's inclination is to raise rates again,"" said Rob Carnell of ING Financial Markets. Half an hour after the Fed's statement, yields on two-year notes were 5.2 basis points higher at 4.795 per cent, while 10-year yields were up 6.7bp at 4.776 per cent. Longer-dated yields had started rising earlier, thanks to a surprise jump in the Conference Board's consumer confidence index and a surge in German business confidence. That news also propelled eurozone government bond yields to multi-year highs yesterday. The headline business climate indicator of the closely-watched Ifo survey rose to a 15-year high of 105.4, fuelling fears of more aggressive interest rate increases in the eurozone. The sell-off sent the yield on the two-year Schatz 8.1 basis points higher to 3.256 per cent in late trading after earlier hitting its highest level since November 2002. The yield on the 10-year Bund rose 8.4bp to 3.728 per cent, close to a one-year high. Lucy Hartiss, international economist at Capital Economics, said: ""We see rates reaching 3.5 per cent by year-end, with the next move coming in May."" The market is pricing in a rate of 3.25 per cent by year's end with a moderate risk of 3.5 per cent, analysts said. Gilts took a hit from the bearish sentiment. The yield on the two-year gilt added 2.6bp to 4.449 per cent and the 10-year gilt yield rose 3.2bp to 4.370 per cent.

851,357.0,2006-03-29,"US interest rates yesterday moved above those in the UK for the first time in five years as the Federal Reserve reacted to rising inflation and the strength of the US economy with its 15th consecutive quarter-point increase to4.75 per cent. The US move came as Mervyn King, Bank of England governor, told a parliamentary committee that he expected ""a rapidly expanding world economy"" to help support consumer demand and that robust public spending growth would sustain UK economic growth at its long-term average of about 2.75 per cent. His remarks reinforced expectations that the Bank of England's main interest rate would remain on hold at 4.5 per cent. Mr King said that consumer price inflation would rise above its2 per cent target in the short-term because of steep gas price increases but that the overall economic picture was ""benign"". Mr King's optimism on the world economy coincided with figures showing German business exuberance at a 15-year high, Italian business confidence at a five-year high and US consumer confidence at its highest level in four years. German business confidence has been boosted by the country's success in export markets, while eurozone credit figures also point to robust economic growth, boosting the case for an early increase in European Central Bank interest rates from 2.5 per cent, perhaps in May. Sterling weakened against the euro on the strong data, and as Mr King's comments were interpreted as a sign that the Bank of England was in no hurry to change interest rates. In the US, the first meeting of the policymaking Federal Open Market Committee chaired by Ben Bernanke indicated that the current cycle of interest rate increases was nearing a close, while repeating that some further policy firming may be needed dependent on the incoming data. In its statement, the FOMC said the economy had rebounded in the first quarter after a weak end to 2005, and that growth ""appears likely to moderate to a more sustainable pace"". Sounding a somewhat more confident note on the inflation outlook, the committee said that high energy prices appeared to have had only a ""modest"" effect on core inflation, at a time when productivity growth had kept labour market inflation in check. It said that inflation expectations remained contained. But the committee also repeated the warning that rising resource utilisation and elevated energy prices could feed into increased inflation pressure. In a repeat of the language used in its January meeting, it said ""some further policy firming may be needed to keep the risks to the attainment of both sustainable economic growth and price stability roughly in balance"".

852,358.0,2006-03-29,"Eurozone government bond yields hit new multi-year highs on Wednesday in the trading session that followed the interest rate hike by the US Federal Reserve. The move in the US, coupled with more hawkish sentiment from European Central Bank policymakers, put pressure on bond prices and sent yields higher. Bond prices were already bruised from Tuesday's data showing a jump in business sentiment in both Germany and Italy. Evidence that economic recovery in the eurozone is gaining momentum has raised fears of more aggressive interest rate rises by the ECB. ""After a few weeks of consolidation, government bond markets have capitulated again thanks to a combination of the strong German Ifo [business sentiment] survey and the Fed's fifteenth consecutive rate hike last night,"" said David Brown, chief European economist at Bear Stearns. ""Yields should continue to rise from here,"" he added. In afternoon trading, the yield on the two-year Schatz was up 1.2 basis points to 3.284 per cent and the 10-year Bund yield added 0.1bp to 3.746 per cent. But earlier, the two-year Schatz yield had risen nearly 2bp to 3.289 percent, its highest since mid-October 2002, adding to the 8bp rise on Tuesday. The Federal Open Market Committee in the US, meeting under Ben Bernanke's chairmanship for the first time, raised rates for a fifteenth consecutive time by 0.25 per cent to 4.75 per cent on Tuesday. Although it changed the wording of its economic assessment, the FOMC left policy-related passages of the statement unchanged, leaving the door open for further rate hikes. Gilts fared better after data showed that UK mortgage lending slowed in February while retail sales remained subdued this month. But prices were still lower overall and the two-year gilt yield was up 1bp to 4.459 per cent and the 10-year gilt yield rose 1.5bp to 4.385 per cent.

853,359.0,2006-03-29,"The US dollar held onto Tuesday's gains in European morning trade on Wednesday as the market priced-in the near certainty of US interest rates hitting 5 per cent in May. The dollar had actually been soft for much of Tuesday, but rallied on the release of the Federal Open Market Committee's monetary policy statement. The Fed, as expected raised rates for the 15th straight meeting, to 4.75 per cent. More importantly, the accompanying statement hinted at more to come, with the FOMC stating that the US economy had ""rebounded strongly"" in the current quarter, that possible increases in resource utilisation, in combination with elevated energy and other commodity prices, ""have the potential to add to inflation pressures"" and that some further policy tightening ""may be needed"". The market responded by regarding a May rate hike, always a strong prospect, as a done deal. Yet the statement did little to cement prospects for further rises beyond that. As a result although the dollar rose, it did not break out of recent ranges, trading at $1.2018 against the euro, Y117.82 versus the yen and SFr1.3089 versus the Swiss franc. ""The market now has greater conviction in its view that US interest rates will rise to 5 per cent by the summer; but the custom designed flexibility of the FOMC statement, tempered as it now is with conditionality and subjectivity, precludes any clear market insight beyond the next economic data release,"" said Neil Mellor, currency strategist Bank of New York. Chris Gothard, currencies strategist at Brown Brothers Harriman, added: ""The statement was mildly hawkish. Overall though, the message wasn't strong enough to reinvigorate the dollar enough to break out of any significant ranges."" The dollar did however push to $1.7371 against sterling, from $1.7494 prior to the Fed statement, with the pound also falling 0.35c to GBP0.6918 against the euro and Y0.8 to Y204.70 against the yen on Wednesday. Sterling lost ground as UK mortgage approvals fell in February for the first time since October 2004, the CBI's distributive trades survey came in weak and the UK's current account deficit for the fourth quarter of 2005 was revised upwards. Tom Vosa, head of market economics at National Australia Bank, was gloomy on sterling's prospects, adding: ""The pound looks vulnerable today after the increase in US official interest rates overnight took US rates above those in the UK for the first time since January 2001."" Elsewhere the Hungarian forint continued its slide, falling Ft1.5 to a 14-month low of Ft267.23 to the euro, with Claire Dissaux at Calyon warning that Hungary's twin current account and budget deficits will continue to weigh on the currency. ""Short-term interest rates of 6 per cent are nowhere near high enough to justify holding Hungarian forint assets for anything but the short-term,"" she concluded.

855,361.0,2003-09-17,"Wall Street traded higher yesterday morning as investors welcomed news that inflation remained in check while news that the Federal Reserve held interest rates also buoyed the market. In the latest bit of economic data, consumer price inflation showed headline prices rose 0.3 per cent in August, from 0.2 per cent the previous month, in line with forecasts. Chris Wolfe, global equity strategist at JP Morgan's private bank, said the data, plus a Manpower survey that showed US companies intend to boost hiring later in the year, helped buoy investor sentiment. ""The Manpower survey puts the linchpin in place for equity investors - better labour markets,"" he said. He added that the relatively few negative pre-announcements from companies heading into earnings season, plus steadily increasing earnings forecasts from Wall Street analysts, have also helped the market's mood. But trade was thin ahead of the rate decision by the Fed's open market committee. The FOMC did not change rates or policy significantly from its last meeting in August, when it said the economy was picking up speed, with evenly balanced upside and downside risks to the attainment of sustainable growth. By midday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 42.32 to 9,491.13, the S&P 500 added 6.08 to 1,020.89, and the Nasdaq Composite climbed 20.14 to 1,865.84. Technology stocks continued to lead the way, as investors anticipating an economic recovery continued to see chipmakers as the best bet. The semiconductor sector was the best performer in the S&P 500, up 2.1 per cent. The stars of the group were Applied Micro Circuits, 4.6 per cent higher at $5.75, PMC-Sierra, up 3.4 per cent to $14, and Teradyne, which rose 3.1 per cent to $20.83. Nicole Salvatore, a technology trader at Banc of America Securities, said: ""People are really buying the dips."" She reported seeing special investor interest in National Semiconductor, which was among the best performers in the past quarter, rising 70 per cent compared with a gain of 4.7 per cent for the S&P 500. The shares were up 1.3 per cent at $33.93 by midday. Technology hardware followed chips on the best-performers list, up 1.7 per cent. Lucent Technologies climbed 4.5 per cent to $2.32, Sanmina-SCI rose 3.9 per cent to $9.36 and Gateway tacked on 2.8 per cent to $6.23. Economically sensitive financial services stocks were also winners, up 1.1 per cent. Investors bid up Charles Schwab, the online broker, which rose 4.7 per cent to $12.02 after the company said daily trading increased from a year ago, and that it was likely to meet or beat analysts' estimates for the third quarter. Morgan Stanley followed, up 2.8 per cent to $50.46. On the flip side, the relatively few losers were defensive stocks, including consumer staples and food and beverage retailers. The three biggest losers on the S&P 500 were supermarket chains. Kroger, the largest in the US, fell 7.9 per cent to $17.18 after it announced a sharp fall in profits and cut its outlook for the full year. The company cited increasing operating costs and increased competition. Investors fretted about the entire sector and sent shares of rivals Safeway and Albertson's down 4.9 per cent and 4.3 per cent, respectively. Nortel Networks, the Canadian telecoms equipment maker, sold $1.3bn of third-generation equipment to Orange, the French mobile operator. The company also announced it had won new contracts in China worth $139m. Nortel shares rose 6.5 per cent to $4.42. Titan, the defence technology company, was the top performer on the New York Stock Exchange, up nearly 26 per cent to $21.35 on news it would be bought by Lockheed Martin for $1.8bn.

856,362.0,2003-09-17,"The Federal Reserve left interest rates on hold at 1 per cent yesterday, as the vast majority of investors had expected, and reiterated its commitment to keeping rates low until the risk of falling inflation had dissipated. The decision by the Fed's open market committee, which was unanimous, was similar to its judgment at its previous meeting in August, following the quarter-point rate cut in June. In a statement released with the decision, the Fed said that rates would remain low ""for a considerable period"". The statement was almost identical to that issued in August, saying that the risk that inflation would fall further outweighed the risk it would rise. But it was slightly more pessimistic about the labour market, saying it was weakening rather than that indicators were mixed. The use of almost identical wording suggests that the Fed's review of its communications policy, which followed turbulence in the financial markets after the June meeting, has yet to feed into FOMC decisions. Stocks rose after the announcement, probably reflecting relief that the Fed had maintained its commitment to keep rates low. Investors had priced in a chance of less than 5 per cent that the Fed would raise rates rather than leaving them on hold, following clear signals from officials. The Fed has argued that while the US recovery is gathering strength, there is as yet scant evidence that this is translating into higher inflationary pressure. With most estimates showing a degree of slack in the economy, companies have continued to struggle to make price rises stick. ""Business pricing power and increases in core consumer prices remain muted,"" the Fed's statement said. The lack of pricing power was underlined yesterday by the release of figures showing that underlying inflation had fallen to its lowest level in nearly 40 years. The consumer price index excluding food and energy rose just 1.3 per cent in the 12 months to August, its lowest since 1966. The slowing rise in prices of medical services and ""shelter costs"" - principally rent and the implied rent paid by homeowners - contributed to much of the fall in core inflation. Fed officials have privately warned that the calculations used to create those shelter costs may overstate the fall in inflation. But economists said that the lack of much apparent upward pressure in inflation was likely to keep the Fed on hold for several months. London Edition 1.

The Dow closed 1.92 points lower at 2,695.61 on active volume of 186m shares. It had dropped 42.02 points to 2,697.53 on Monday, partly because of concern about bank exposure to pockets of extreme weakness in the housing market. The Bank of New England said last Friday that it had seen a sharp rise in non-performing loans related to the north-east real estate market. That concern continued yesterday although Mr Robert Clarke, Comptroller of the Currency, said that he was surprised by these fears and that investors did not appear to be differentiating between financial institutions with exposure and those with none. The heavy selling in the first 1 1/2 hours of the session yesterday reflected concern that Monday's plunge of more than 40 points could presage a more prolonged decline. According to Mr Newton Zinder, technical strategist at Shearson Lehman Hutton, that decline was the broadest since October 13 and that volume On Monday was the heaviest it has been since the dramatic recovery on October 16. However, the rebound yesterday from mid-morning lows was fairly convincing. Both the selling and the recovery appeared to happen in isolation to yesterday's news events. Those events included the release of the November consumer prices index which rose 0.4 per cent, slightly more than markets had expected and the release of November housing starts which fell 4.7 per cent, in line with forecasts. The Treasury bond market was on the defensive, albeit still trading in a narrow range, as the policy-making Federal Open Market Committee started its two-day meeting.

862,368.0,2009-04-30,"Loans down 5.4% in last quarter of 2008 US economy shrinks at annualised 6.1% Banks retreated from foreign lending at the fastest rate since records began 30 years ago in the final quarter of last year, the Bank for International Settlements said yesterday. The BIS report came as the Federal Reserve held policy unchanged at its April meeting, saying the ""economic outlook has improved modestly since the March meeting"". Meanwhile, new figures showed that US business investment collapsed in the first quarter of this year even as consumer spending grew again, with the economy overall contracting at an annualised rate of 6.1 per cent. The German government cut its forecast to predict a 6 per cent fall in GDP this year. The BIS data is the first to paint a comprehensive picture of the scramble to repatriate funds and reduce leverage amid the financial chaos of late 2008. In the space of just three months from October to December banks globally cut their portfolios of foreign loans by $1,800bn or 5.4 per cent after adjusting for exchange rate movements. The pullback represents the reversal of years of financial globalisation, fuelled by a sharp increase in so-called ""home bias"" as bankers tried to reduce risk while maintaining domestic lending to please the national governments that were acting as their guarantors of last resort. Sharp cutbacks in overseas lending have exacerbated the credit crunch by withdrawing a major source of funding, even as domestic lenders have been hit by the crisis. Almost all of the decline in foreign loans came from banks in western Europe, which had substantially expanded their cross-border lending in recent years. US and Japanese banks, which had not expanded their international lending as aggressively in the pre-crisis period, actually increased slightly their holdings of foreign assets in the quarter. The contraction in lending will compound fears that eastern European economies could face a shortage of credit, although the International Monetary Fund has enhanced capacity to fill the gap. The Fed's decision to stay on hold yesterday reflected a slight upgrade to its economic forecast. The central bank said the economy had ""continued to contract, though the pace of contraction appears to be somewhat slower"". In recognition of the stock market rally, the Federal Open Market Committee removed from its statement a reference to the depressing effect of low stock prices on spending, but added that companies were cutting back on staffing, underscoring concern about fast-rising unemployment. For the first time, policymakers referred to the prospect that ""market forces"" would contribute to a gradual recovery, suggesting some greater confidence in the self-repairing capacity of the economy.

863,369.0,2009-04-30,"News analysis Markets wait to see if the central bank will keep surprising them, writes Aline van Duyn After rising steadily in recent weeks, yields on US Treasuries have this week finally climbed back above the levels at which they were trading before the Federal Reserve started buying US debt a month ago. The ability of the Fed to balance the record amounts of new debt the US government has to sell - supply pressure that tends to raise interest rates - and its desire to keep interest rates low enough to spur fresh lending and mortgage financing continues to drive the Treasury market. Yields on 10-year US Treasury debt yesterday traded above 3 per cent, compared with a low of 2.54 per cent on March 18, just after the Fed announced it was planning to buy long-term debt. The 30-year US Treasury bond yield hit 3.92 per cent against the 3.8 per cent before quantitative easing was introduced. ""It's all about the market's testing the Fed's resolve to keep yields low,"" said Carl Lantz, interest rate strategist at Credit Suisse. ""The markets are waiting to see whether the Fed will keep surprising them in ways that could push yields lower."" Such surprises could involve bigger direct purchases or buying larger chunks of debt at once, he said. The $300bn Treasuries purchase plan announced at last month's federal open market committee meeting was the first time in decades the Fed had committed to buy long-term US debt. The amount might be increased, especially if pressure on yields continues to rise. The large initial impact of the move has been wiped out, partly because of concerns over the scale of the debt issuance needed to fund massive US fiscal stimulus and bank bail-out programmes. However, given the sharp rally in equity markets since early March - the S&P 500 index is up more than 25 per cent - yields would probably have risen much more without the Fed's intervention. Fed analysts suggested the $300bn purchase would reduce the yield on 10-year Treasuries by 25-35 basis points. Officials think the rate today is much lower than it would have been if they had not started buying. ""For yields to reverse their natural course, not only does the Fed have to step up purchase of long-term Treasuries and agencies but bond traders will have to be convinced that such actions are sufficient in capping bond yields,"" said Ashraf Laidi, chief market strategist at CMC Markets. He said the rise of the 10-year yield above 3 per cent ""signals bond traders' constant challenging of the Fed"". The importance of supply issues was clear in the 30-year yield's moves this week. The yield rose partly in anticipation of increased sales of 30-year bonds. Yesterday, the Fed said it would increase the frequency of its 30-year bond sales to monthly, part of a plan to meet an estimated $1,600bn to $2,700bn of new borrowing needs. Minutes of the meeting of the Treasury borrowing advisory committee showed that members discussed adding new maturities to the Treasury market. ""Several members stated that Treasury may need to consider this alternative but should begin with a second reopening of the 30-year bond and monitor developments in the long end of the curve,"" the minutes said.",Rising bond yields present fresh challenge for the Fed,2009-04-29,The Financial Times

In its accompanying statement, the Fed said that following its action, monetary policy remained ""accommodative"" and that the committee expected to continue to raise rates at a ""measured"" pace - commonly taken to mean quarter-point increments. The central bank strongly suggested it would raise rates again at its August meeting, and gave no hint that it was considering a pause in its tightening campaign soon after that. ""Although energy prices have risen further, the expansion remains firm and labour market conditions continue to improve gradually,"" the FOMC said. This was a slightly stronger statement on the growth outlook than at its May meeting, when the committee noted that spending growth had slowed somewhat. ""Pressures on inflation have stayed elevated, but longer-term inflation expectations remain well contained,"" the committee said, maintaining its focus on inflation risks while implicitly acknowledging some better recent inflation data. In May, the statement had referred to inflation pressures that had picked up in recent months. ""The message was consistent with what we have heard from Fed speakers - that there are at least a few more rate increases to go,"" said Peter Hooper, chief US economist at Deutsche Bank. ""They did not want to encourage the view that they are almost done."" The stock, bond and currency markets offered only muted reactions to the statement. Futures markets anticipate a 3.75 per cent Fed funds rate at year-end. The low level of market-determined long-term interest rates, and the booming housing market, have added to the Fed's resolve to continue raising the federal funds rate. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note is below 4 per cent, compared with 4.7 per cent a year ago. Data published by the Commerce Department yesterday, before the Federal Reserve's announcement, showed US consumer spending was a little weaker than expected in May. Spending was flat on the previous month - compared with Wall Street forecasts of 0.1 per cent rise - while income growth also slowed. The core personal consumption expenditures index - the Fed's preferred inflation measure, which excludes volatile food and energy items - rose 0.2 per cent in May. In the 12 months to May, the core PCE index has risen 1.6 per cent, in line with the FOMC members' consensus forecast from earlier in the year: that core inflation would remain in a range of 1 1/2-1 3/4 per cent this year and next. Policymakers, who updated their forecasts at their two-day meeting, have said recently they expect growth to continue at the economy's trend rate, regardless of some recent weaker indicators, and in spite of the high oil price. While they will react to changes in the outlook, they are not overly concerned with volatility in the monthly data. ",Fed more confident as it increases rates again - QUARTER-POINT RISE.,2005-06-30,The Financial Times
865,371.0,2005-07-01,"The dollar spiked to new highs on Friday as buoyant data on the US manufacturing sector added to expectations of more rate rises to come from the Federal Reserve. The greenback surged 1.1 per cent to a 13-month high of $1.1958 against the euro, breaking through a stubbornly defended technical barrier at $1.20, after trading flat for most of the week. The dollar also jumped 0.8 per cent to an 11-month high of Y111.64 against the yen - a week-on-week gain of 2.2 per cent - 1.1 per cent to a 13-month high of $1.7705 against sterling - a weekly rise of 2.9 per cent - and 1.4 per cent to C$1.2416 against the Canadian dollar. The dollar's spike was prompted by strong US data, with the Institute of Supply Management's manufacturing index rising to 53.8 in June, well above the breakeven 50 level, when the market had been braced for a repeat of May's 51.4 reading. Michigan's consumer sentiment index also trumped expectations. ""This shows that the weakest link in the economy is showing signs of improvement now,"" said Michael Woolfolk, senior currency strategist at Bank of New York. However, Mr Woolfolk was among those arguing that the underyling rationale for the dollar's renewed rally was Thursday's comments from the Federal open market committee. As widely expected, the FOMC raised rates to 3.25 per cent, its ninth straight quarter-point hike. But in its accompanying statement the committee said monetary policy remained ""accommodative"" and that it expected to continue to raise rates at a ""measured"" pace. It added that ""expansion remains firm and labour market conditions continue to improve gradually,"" despite higher energy prices. The statement wrongfooted those who had been expecting signs of an imminent pause in tightening, with hawks such as Mr Woolfolk now arguing that US rates could rise to 4.25 per cent by the year-end. This contrasts sharply with a deteriorating yield environment elsewhere, particularly in the UK where speculation over a possible August rate cut intensified in the wake of this week's weak retail sales and economic growth data. With sterling-bears now anticipating two UK rate cuts by December, US rates could soon be higher than those in the UK for the first time since January 2001 - a daunting prospect for a currency that has largely owed its strength to a high underlying yield. ""Rate sentiment has turned around and may the Lord help sterling if rates cross over and are higher in the US. It would be goodnight London then,"" said David Bloom, currency analyst at HSBC, who saw scope for the pound to fall to the low $1.60s. Against this backdrop, sterling fell 1.9 per cent over the week to GBP0.6751 against the euro, hitting a one-month low of GBP0.6798 yesterday, 0.7 per cent to Y197.67 against the yen and 1.3 per cent to SFr2.2940 versus the Swiss franc. This led Tony Norfield, global head of forex strategy at ABN Amro, to argue that most of the bad news for sterling was now priced in. Mr Norfield also drew solace from solid UK manufacturing data released yesterday which, he argued, indicated that sterling's slide from a high of $1.945 in December was already helping to ease the pressure on the UK's beleaguered manufacturers. High-yielding currencies in general performed poorly, with rising US rates leading to further unwinding of dollar-funded carry trades. The Australian dollar fell 2.4 per cent to $0.7516 against the greenback while the New Zealand dollar lost 3.1 per cent at $0.6834. Despite yesterday's slide against the dollar, the euro enjoyed a robust week, firming 1.2 per cent to Y133.53 against the yen, amid signs that the anti-euro sentiment unleashed by the failure of the EU's constitutional treaty was now abating. Yen weakness was prompted by the sharpest fall in Japan's trade surplus for four years - a trend likely to be exacerbated by rising oil prices - as well as claims that the yen was now supplanting the dollar as the funding currency of choice for carry trades.

866,372.0,2005-07-01,"Sterling slumped to a near nine-month low against the US dollar in European morning trade on Friday after the Federal Reserve indicated it would continue hiking interest rates at a ""measured"" pace. This contrasts sharply with a deteriorating yield environment in the UK, where speculation over a possible August rate cut has intensified in the wake of weak retail sales and economic growth data this week. As widely expected, the Fed raised rates to 3.25 per cent overnight, its ninth straight quarter-point hike. In its accompanying statement, the Federal open market committee said monetary policy remained ""accommodative"" and that it expected to continue to raise rates at a ""measured"" pace. The FOMC added that ""expansion remains firm and labour market conditions continue to improve gradually,"" despite higher energy prices. The statement wrongfooted those who had been expecting signs of an imminent pause in tightening, helping to send the dollar higher. ""The Fed has adopted a slightly more hawkish stance than in the previous policy statement. Clearly, the statement does not support a sooner than expected pause in rate hikes,"" said Michael Woolfolk, senior currency strategist at Bank of New York. This allowed the dollar to spike as high as $1.2026 to the euro, close to its recent highs, before falling back to $1.2092. The euro's recovery was aided by signs of hope from the struggling eurozone manufacturing sector. The sector's purchasing managers' index came in at 49.9 for June, just a whisker below breakeven, compared to 48.7 in May, with France and Italy leading the way. The greenback also rose to a fresh nine-month low of Y111.23 against the yen, again before falling back to Y110.87. However sterling bore the brunt of the fallout, tumbling 1.8c to $1.7726 against the dollar, before a modest recovery to $1.7816, 0.3p to GBP0.6783 against the euro, a one-month low, and Y0.75 to Y197.56 against the yen. The pound was little helped by a rise in the UK's manufacturing sector PMI, with the index recovering to 49.6 in June from a downwardly revised 47 in May. The sector thus remained in contraction for a third month. ""A rare piece of better than expected news on the manufacturing sector, with orders growing for the first time in three months as foreign demand improved. Nevertheless, the manufacturing sector is clearly still struggling and the case for an interest rate cut in August is now very strong,"" said Howard Archer, economist at Global Insight. ""Indeed, a move by the Bank of England as soon as July is looking increasingly possible given this week's data on GDP, retail sales and consumer confidence.""

Equities saw a turbulent afternoon as investors responded to the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC). The announcement that there would be no increase in quantitative easing and that the Fed saw economic activity ""levelling out"" saw stocks slip, before jumping, and then selling off shortly before the close. ""The language was pretty optimistic, although with a note of caution,"" said Dan Cook, senior market analyst at IG Markets.

875,381.0,2006-05-11,"The under-fire US dollar staged a modest recovery in European morning trade on Thursday after the US Treasury stepped back from the brink of formally branding China a currency cheat. The Treasury was happy to use aggressive language to describe Beijing's currency policy in its semi-annual foreign exchange report, saying it was ""extremely dissatisfied"" with the pace of reform and that it will continue to ""actively and frankly press China to quicken the pace of renminbi flexibility"". However the Treasury stopped short of formally naming China as a ""currency manipulator"", a move that many in the market believe would have applied more pressure on Beijing to allow the renminbi to appreciate, potentially causing the dollar to weaken against the full range of Asian, and even European, currencies. With this eventuality unforthcoming and the Federal Open Market Committee, which raised rates by 25 basis points to 5 per cent on Wednesday, signalling that ""some further tightening may yet be needed to address inflation risks"", the dollar was able to enjoy a modest reprieve, firming to $1.2713 against the euro, from a fresh 12-month low of $1.2831 it hit prior to the release of the Treasury's report. The greenback also recovered to SFr 1.2271against the Swiss franc, from a one-year low of SFr1.2128, Y111.24 against the yen, from Wednesday's eight-month nadir of Y110.11 and C$1.1056 against the Canadian dollar, having hit a 28-year low of C$1.0980 on Wednesday. ""The failure of the FOMC to indicate more clearly the possibility of a pause at the next meeting on 29 June and the failure of the US Treasury department to cite China as a currency manipulator has helped stabilise dollar sentiment,"" said Derek Halpenny, senior currency economist at Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ. However, Mr Halpenny was among those arguing that the dollar's respite may be short-lived, with the forces pressuring it lower, such as a declining yield advantage and mounting worries over the US external deficit, likely to reassert themselves. ""The point is that nothing significant has changed,"" he said. ""It seems premature at this point to expect a sustained dollar rally against any of the major currencies."" Others pointed out that despite the broadly hawkish Fed statement, the futures market was still only pricing in a 40 per cent probability of a June rate hike. Elsewhere sterling was strong, holding steady at $1.8674 to the dollar and firming 0.45p to GBP0.6809 against the euro, 2 centimes to SFr2.2910 against the Swiss franc and Y1.75 to Y207.74 against the yen, as both UK industrial and manufacturing output rose 0.7 per cent month-on-month in March, outstripping forecasts for rises of 0.2 per cent in both cases. The 0.8 per cent quarter-on-quarter rise in industrial production was the strongest since 1999, helping support forecasts that the next move in UK interest rates will be upward. Kuwait revalued the dinar by 1 per cent to KD0.2891 to the dollar, its first rise for 16 months. The move is likely to put pressure on other major oil exporters such as Saudi Arabia to follow suit.

876,382.0,2000-10-04,"The Federal Reserve yesterday decided to leave short-term interest rates unchanged at its last scheduled policy meeting before the US presidential election - but warned that rising energy prices risked raising inflation expectations. In a widely expected decision, the policy-making Federal Open Market Committee held the benchmark federal funds rate unchanged at a nine-year high of 6.5 per cent. It was the third successive meeting that Fed policymakers voted for no change in rates, after deciding on a 0.5 percentage point increase in May. In its statement accompanying the decision, the Fed said recent figures had indicated a moderation in the expansion of demand to a pace closer to that of the economy's potential rate of growth. More rapid advances in productivity continued to help contain costs and hold down underlying price pressures, it said. But it repeated previous warnings that demand on the pool of available workers was at an unusually high level. And for the first time it sounded a warning about high oil prices. ""The increase in energy prices, though having limited effect on core measures of prices to date, poses a risk of raising inflation expectations,"" the statement said. However, inflation expectations to date remained subdued. Also as expected, the central bank maintained its bias towards future policy tightening, declaring that ""the risks continue to be weighted mainly toward conditions that may generate heightened inflation pressures in the future"". The FOMC vote was accompanied by a report from the US Commerce department showing sales of one-family homes fell 3 per cent in August. A report from the Conference Board, a New York-based business research firm, also showed its index of leading economic indicators, a barometer of future growth, fell for the third time in four months in August. On Monday, a monthly survey of purchasing executives found that manufacturing activity, representing one-fifth of the US economy, shrank for the second straight month in September. The continuing signs of a slowdown have sharply raised market odds of a Fed rate cut early next year. Trading of Fed funds futures contracts suggests speculators see a 50 per cent chance a Fed easing by next spring. But the Fed continues to voice concerns about energy prices, the trade deficit and the tight labour market - symptoms of imbalances it believes reflect an economy that continues to grow beyond its means. Fed rate increases and rising oil prices can take several months to filter through the economy, so the impact of the rate increase in May and the rise over the past year in energy prices have yet to be fully realised.

877,383.0,1998-08-19,"The US Federal Reserve left interest rates unchanged yesterday after the regular private meeting of its main policy-setting committee as consumer price inflation figures for July showed price rises continuing subdued. The Federal Open Market Committee's decision was widely anticipated. The Fed has not changed interest rates since March last year, when the benchmark overnight loan rate to banks was raised a quarter point to 5.5%. The consumer price index rose 0.2% in July, after adjustment for seasonal variations, following a 0.1% rise in June. The rate in the year to July was unchanged on the previous month at 1.7%. The core rate, minus the volatile food and energy components, also rose 0.2% in July against 0.1% in the prior month. Breaking down the figures, vehicle prices rose 0.4%, reflecting in part a shortage arising out of the General Motors strike, while a 3.2% rise in airline fares contributed to a 0.3% increase in transportation prices. On the other hand, clothing prices dropped by 0.3%. Figures released yesterday also showed an unexpected drop in the US trade deficit in June. The US registered a $14.2bn trade deficit in goods and services in June, compared with $15.5bn in May. This was largely the result of a surprise 2% fall in imports which more than offset a 0.5% decline in exports. However, the deficit for the second quarter was a record $44bn, reflecting in part the consequence of Asia's financial crisis. Ed Yardeni, an economist with Deutsche Bank Securities in New York, said US exports were now falling at their fastest pace since the current measurements began in 1986. William Daley, commerce secretary, said the figures showed US exports in the first half of the year had edged up by only 1%, but they had grown ""a remarkable"" 7% once Asia was excluded. Economists doubted the June improvement in the deficit would be more than temporary. Tim O'Neill, chief economist for Harris Bank, said exports would remain under downward pressure because of the strong dollar and the weak Asian economies, while the decline in imports could partly reflect problems east Asian economies are facing in securing trade financing. ""With exports expected to remain weak and imports resuming their upward trend, the US trade balance should deteriorate in coming months, tempering the strength in the economy. This negative impact on GDP growth, alongside past appreciation of the US dollar and weak commodity prices, has contributed to inflation staying low despite a tight labour market,"" he said. Canadian trade surplus rises A sharp drop in car part imports, a result of the General Motors strike, led to a 16% increase in Canada's merchandise trade surplus in June, Scott Morrison reports from Toronto. Canada yesterday said its trade balance in June stood at C$1.5bn ($1bn), up C$213m from May. It was the second consecutive monthly increase in the balance. June imports dropped 0.8% from May to C$24.5bn as the GM strike led to plant closures in Canada. Exports inched up 0.1% to C$26bn. A 7.4% plunge in car product exports negated a strong performance in exports of industrial goods, as well as machinery and equipment. Despite the small gain in exports in June, the trend was flat for the second quarter after a slight decline during the first three months. Statistics Canada said there had been no growth in Canadian exports since the start of the year. Copyright Financial Times Limited 1998. All Rights Reserved. Not Available for Re-dissemination.

879,385.0,1998-08-19,"Prices were weaker yesterday as some of the worry over Russia's financial and political crisis dissipated and US Treasuries opened lower. Inflation data released in the UK and US were within expectations, ensuring no significant price moves in markets already thin due to the holiday period. In the UK, dealers spotted signs of asset switching into equities from gilts but globally there was still solid support for bonds. US TREASURIES ended lower but off their worst losses of the day as US equities rallied and the Federal Open Market Committee decided to leave interest rates unchanged. By late afternoon the benchmark 30-year bond was down 3/16 to 99 5/32, yielding 5.558%. Among shorter-term issues the 10-year note was down 5/32 to 101 19/32, yielding 5.411% and the two-year note was 1/32 lower at 100 1/16, yielding 5.339%. ""A lot of the flight to quality seems to have been removed from the market but it's a day-to-day thing,"" said Terrence Pigott, head of government bond trading at Daiwa Securities America. Data releases showed the US trade deficit to have narrowed to $14.2bn in June from $15.5bn in May and consumer prices to have risen 0.2% in July. GERMAN BUNDS ended lower but dealers say they are expecting prices to continue recent rises, with a yield on the benchmark bund of 4.25% feasible in the short term. Yesterday, it stood at 4.42%. However, Julian Jessop, chief European economist at Nikko said that target would only be reached if the Bundesbank maintained its current interest rate stance. ""You can only be confident holding bunds as long as a rate rise is off the agenda. But today's Bundesbank report left open the possibility of a pre-Christmas rate rise,"" he said. The bank yesterday released its August monthly report on the economy. The September 10-year bund future settled 0.03 points lower at 111.10 in volume of 449,000 contracts traded in Frankfurt. The UK GILTS market was unimpressed by inflation data, which traders said reinforced the view that interest rates had peaked. Gilt futures ended lower after trading in narrow ranges. September 10-year futures settled down 0.07 points at 110.19 in trading volume of 52,000 contracts. The underlying rate of UK inflation fell to 2.6% in July, which is above the Bank of England's year-end target of 2.5%. Neil Parker, Treasury economist at Royal Bank of Scotland, said gilts had sold off because some investors had been over-optimistic that the inflation target would be met. July retail sales data are due today. The spread between the benchmark contracts in the gilt and bund markets narrowed by one basis point to 124 points. Copyright Financial Times Limited 1998.

880,386.0,1998-11-18,"THE AMERICAS - Fed may rest axe for a while - Further interest rate cuts may wait until the new year, reports Stephen Fidler. The US Federal Reserve cut interest rates yesterday for the third time in seven weeks, but strongly suggested that a further reduction would have to wait until at least the new year. The statement accompanying the decision made yesterday by the policy-setting Federal Open Market Committee to reduce both the federal funds and discount rates by a quarter point indicated the Fed believed it had gone far enough for now to stabilise financial markets. In repeated public statements, Alan Greenspan, the Fed chairman, has expressed his concerns about what he has described as the ""extreme risk aversion"" that developed since late August in US financial markets. ""Although conditions in financial markets have settled down materially since mid-October, unusual strains remain,"" the statement said. But it added: ""With the 75-basis-point decline in the federal funds rate since September, financial conditions can reasonably be expected to be consistent with fostering sustained economic expansion while keeping inflationary pressures subdued."" Economists said that, assuming financial markets continued to stabilise, the Fed would wait to see the impact of the rate reductions on the real economy. ""I think they sent a pretty clear signal that they are now in pause mode,"" said Sassan Ghahramani, managing director at Medley Global Advisors in New York. Fed thinking appeared to be ""shifting away from credit dislocation concerns and towards the real economy"", said John Maguire of Medley. William Dudley, director of US economic research at Goldman Sachs in New York, described yesterday's move as ""a sort of insurance that they have done enough for the time being"", which carried little risk because inflation pressures remain subdued. He said he did not expect any further reduction to take place at the next meeting of the FOMC in December, but another drop was likely in the spring, when weakness in the US economy would start to influence Fed thinking. However, it is also clear from the Fed statement that the central bank does not believe the stresses in the financial markets are necessarily resolved. One indicator which Mr Greenspan has cited - the unusually wide liquidity premium that developed in September and October between the most recently issued ""on-the-run"" US Treasury bonds and less frequently traded bonds - has narrowed. Credit risk spreads - the interest rate premium paid by riskier borrowers - have also subsided, though not to the perhaps exaggeratedly low levels that existed earlier in the year. However, there are areas of lingering difficulty. One such, said Mr Dudley at Goldman Sachs, was the US commercial paper market, where most large US companies obtain short-term financing. The highest rated borrowers - ranked A1-P1 by the main US credit rating agencies - can now borrow in the market significantly more cheaply than their lesser-rated counterparts. The spread between A1-P1 borrowers and A2-P2 borrowers is now about 95 basis points, three times higher than normal levels. Moreover, many of the lesser-rated borrowers could not gain access to commercial paper finance over the year-end, leading them to turn to their banks, where they have back-up lines of credit. As a result, the commercial paper market for A2-P2 borrowers has shrunk from $103.9bn to $89.7bn ( #53.3bn) in just eight weeks, he said. ""I would expect the capital market turmoil to subside with the exception of the commercial paper market where you will have problems until the year-end,"" he said. However, where the strains have eased, they have done so almost as rapidly as they emerged. As a result, the Fed is viewed as not being confident that they have disappeared for good. Inflation remains subdued Inflation in the US economy remained tame in October in spite of a jump in petrol prices, the Labour Department said, Reuters reports from Washington. The Consumer Price Index, the government's main inflation gauge, rose 0.2% after remaining flat in September. The closely watched core CPI, which excludes volatile food and energy costs, also rose by 0.2% last month after an identical rise in September. In the year ended in October, the CPI overall was up 1.5%. Copyright Financial Times Limited 1998. All Rights Reserved. Not Available for Re-dissemination.

881,387.0,1998-11-18,"US Treasury prices pushed higher soon after the announcment that the Federal Reserve had again cut US interest rates. Prices were already higher before the Federal Open Market Committee announced it was to cut the key Federal funds and discount rates by 25 basis points each, and European markets had also ended up on hopes of a further easing. In the minutes after the rate cut announcement, the 30-year Treasury bond, the benchmark for US interest rates, was 1/4 higher at 99 21/32, sending the yield lower to 5.273%. Among shorter-term issues, the 10-year note was up 15/32 to 99 9/16, yielding 4.806%, while the two-year note was up 3/16 to 99 1/8, yielding 4.472%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose from its early lows on the rate cut news. ""The bill sector and the two-year note rallied most, but the long end is not reacting that positively,"" said Richard Gilhooly, international bond strategist at Paribas Capital Markets in New York. Ahead of the FOMC meeting, economists and analysts were divided in their expectations. Economists, seeing signs of slowing US domestic growth, had overwhelmingly expected another rate cut. Market analysts and traders were less convinced a cut was coming, because of the strong rebound seen in global financial markets since the Fed first began easing monetary policy in late September. The most recent rate cut, which came by surprise in mid-October, triggered a sharp rally in stocks and bonds soon after. European government bond markets had closed higher in thin trading ahead of the FOMC announcement in anticipation of a reduction. They were helped additionally by further good news on European inflation, especially in the UK, where the annual rate hit the 2.5% target for the third consecutive month. It remains to be seen whether this, combined with the Fed move, will convince the Bank of England to cut UK rates again next month - some market watchers believe there may be no further easing of UK monetary policy until next year - but it was enough in the short term to give a fillip to UK gilts. The December contract on Liffe settled 0.34 higher at 115.49 in light futures trading, while the cash market got a boost from the repayment of nearly #8bn of debt, further limiting the supply of gilts. The Debt Management Office also said it was to auction #450m of index-linked gilts next week, the first time an index-linked issue would be available for several years. German bunds marked time along with other European markets, although there is now a widespread acceptance that, unlike in the US, interest rates will probably not decline before the year end and that interest rates in the eurozone countries will converge at 3.3% when the European single currency is launched in January. The December future settled 0.21 higher at 112.59, while Italian and Spanish bonds also moved marginally higher. Yields on Japanese government bonds fell slightly in Tokyo trading as prices rose despite a move by Moody's Investors Service to deprive Japan of its triple-A rating. The agency cut the country's sovereign rating by one notch, from Aaa to Aa1, a step that had been widely anticipated. Russia's debt market was unaffected by the general mood of anticiapation of the FOMC decision, and staged a small rally, taking its cue from a strong performance the previous day by other emerging debt markets. Principal Notes (PRINs) rose 1 1/4 to 7 1/4 and Interest Arrears Notes (IANs) were up 1 1/2 to 8 1/2 in afternoon trading, although there was no firm direction to the market's trend. Analysts said hopes were rising that Russia would pay all or some of its $407m debt in PRINs and $205m in IANs, which are due next month. Richard Gray, at Bank of America, said that it was in Russia's interest to do so in order to avoid a formal default on the $26bn debt that it owes to its London Club of commercial bank creditors. Other emerging debt was also quiet on the view that no rate cut from the Fed would be bad news for the Brady bond market, but prices remained firm. However, Mexican and Venezuelan paper was affected by the volatility in oil prices, which have begun to ease after the sudden end to the confrontation with Iraq.

882,388.0,1989-10-04,"US TREASURY bonds moved higher yesterday in reaction to a stronger dollar and to remarks from a senior Administration official saying that US interest rates were heading down. In late trading, short-dated issues were as much as 1/4 point higher, while the Treasury's benchmark long bond was quoted 1/2 point up for a yield of 8.17 per cent. The US currency put in a strong performance overnight and dipped only temporarily under the weight of more concerted central bank intervention. In late New York trading, the dollar was steady, near to its day's highs at Y141.15 and DM1.8865. Foreign exchange dealers said that the impact of central bank intervention against the dollar appeared to be diminishing and that the currency remained well bid. The rally in New York appeared to be partly on reports of a possible attempted coup in Panama. The dollar's resilient performance has provided significant support for the bond market which has tended to ignore unfavourable news when the US currency is rising. Yesterday, the short end of the market was bolstered by reported remarks from Mr Michael Boskin, chairman of the Council of Economic Advisors, that interest rates would decline. The desire of the Administration to see lower interest rates is well known on Wall Street and the US Federal Reserve appears to be under some pressure to ease monetary policy. However, given some evidence that the economy is not now slowing as much as it was, it is not at all clear that the Fed, whose Federal Open Market Committee met yesterday, will be prepared to lower rates. The September US purchasing managers' report showed that the economy slowed at a lower rate last month than in August and yesterday offered news of a healthy 2.9 per cent rise in new factory orders in August compared with a revised fall of 2 per cent in July. THE New Zealand government bond market reacted badly to the troubles at DFC New Zealand. The benchmark 1993 bond rose by 12 basis points to yield 12.44, up from 12.32 on Monday, as news of the possible bankruptcy came through to the trading floor. Short maturities had an early slip of about 15 basis points in price, and the currency also weakened. THE GERMAN government bond market opened slightly weaker, but made steady small gains during the day after rates were fixed 25 pfennigs higher on the previous day. There were, however, no calls from leading investors. The market has now convinced itself that Thursday's meeting of the Bundesbank will result in a 1/2 point rise in interest rates and made the necessary adjustments. THE UK gilt market failed to react to the release of the underlying reserves figures, which showed an unexpectedly small reduction of Pounds 142m in September. Given the Bank of England's interventions in the foreign exchange markets, the market was predicting a bigger decline. 'The market responded by standing still,' said a dealer. The futures market traded within a 1/4 point range, the long gilt closing at 92.24 per cent, from 92.21 on Monday. The cash market was even quieter and closed unchanged.

883,389.0,1989-10-04,"WALL STREET THE COMBINATION of a strong dollar, a rally in bonds and the rebound on Monday in the stock market triggered significant institutional buying of equities yesterday which boosted the Dow Jones Industrial Average to a record closing high, writes Janet Bush in New York. The Dow rose steadily throughout the session to end 40.84 points higher at 2,754.56, compared with the previous all-time closing high on September 1 of 2,752.09. Volume was active, with 182.5m shares traded compared with Monday's total of only 127m. The background to yesterday's continued buying included another strong performance by the dollar and modest gains in the bond market. The US currency strengthened considerably in the Far East overnight and proved resilient in the face of more concerted central bank intervention. In New York, the US currency was given an additional boost by reports that General Manuel Noriega had been taken into custody in a coup in Panama. The bond market was helped by the strength of the dollar and by reports of a remark by Mr Michael Boskin, chairman of the Council of Economic Advisors, that interest rates were headed downwards. The policy-making Federal Open Market Committee met yesterday. The Fed is seen as having little domestic economic justification for lowering interest rates at this stage. The US purchasing managers' report for September showed growth slowing less markedly than in August and yesterday there were figures showing a hefty 2.9 per cent rise in new factory orders in August. Another factor in the equities rally was the gain of 20.89 points achieved on Monday - a better performance than many had anticipated at the beginning of a new quarter. In spite of the substantial gain yesterday, however, there are some worrying signs about the long-term health of this week's advance. One of the most obvious is the disappointing performance of IBM, a benchmark stock, which fell to its lowest level for a year. One of several companies which have warned that third quarter profits will be disappointing, IBM fell Dollars 2 3/4 to Dollars 105 3/4 . Equity analysts noted that buying of blue chips was concentrated in those issues which are not expected to report disappointing earnings for the third quarter. IBM's performance was in marked contrast to other blue chips. Philip Morris, for example, piled on Dollars 5 1/8 to Dollars 171 7/8 . Among featured individual stocks, Boeing rose Dollars 3 1/8 to Dollars 59 3/4 , apparently on hopes that the machinists' union would vote to avert a strike due to start at midnight last night. Harley-Davidson surged Dollars 3 5/8 to Dollars 42 3/4 after investor Mr Malcolm Glazer said that he and members of his family might seek control of the company. On the over-the-counter market, McCaw Cellular A shares rose Dollars 1 to Dollars 40 1/2 after the company agreed to buy Metromedia's interest in the New York city cellular franchise and to sell cellular interests in three south-eastern states to Contel Cellular. LIN Broadcasting, which has a right of first refusal on the Metromedia stake, fell Dollars 3 1/8 to Dollars 108 1/2 and Contel's A shares added Dollars 1/8 to Dollars 26. CANADA ACTIVE trading saw Toronto share prices make strong gains. The composite index closed up 39.2 at 4,011.9 on volume of 34m shares, compared with Monday's volume of 22m shares.

At its worst level of the day, within 30 minutes of the opening, the FTSE 100 posted a low of 5,042.7, down more than 50 points. The market's smaller capitalised stocks delivered another worryingly weak performance. The FTSE SmallCap index dropped below the 2,000 mark for the first time since January 19 1996, and is now 28.5% down from its May 26 peak of 2,793.8. The market's extremely nervous performance came before the outcome of the regular meeting of the US Federal Reserve's open market committee in Washington yesterday. A decision from the committee was due shortly after 7pm London time. Dealers in London said the market had behaved reasonably well in front of what was seen as the most crucial FOMC meeting for many months. ""Everyone I've spoken to expects the Fed to cut, but no one is confident about the extent of the cut,"" said one marketmaker. He said the market would take a minimum 25 basis points reduction as read and warned that many had already factored in a 50 basis points reduction. The general view around the stock market was that Wall Street, and therefore London and the rest of global markets, would probably hold or absorb small profit-taking in the event of a 25 basis points cut and would respond positively to a 50 basis points cut. But ominously, many said the market would give a ready and negative response to the Fed leaving rates on hold in the short term. Others said the market would probably run into further pockets of turbulence as the third quarter came to a close and the last quarter, traditionally one of the most volatile of the year, kicked off. There remains a widespread view that London still has to face a further sizeable sell-off, which many expect to drive the FTSE 100 lower before the year-end. That dip would be triggered by further profit downgrades and even more turmoil in other world markets. Those dire predictions would be made even worse by any further failures of hedge funds, after the shock of the near-collapse of Long-Term Capital Management. The erratic behaviour of the FTSE 100 was not mirrored by the second-line stocks, represented by the FTSE 250, which stayed in positive ground all day, eventually closing the session a net 9.0 ahead at 4,562.0. The midcap index was bolstered by some encouraging corporate news from, among others, Business Post and Booker, both of which made rapid gains; the former by evidence of directors buying shares in the company and the latter after the appointment of a new chairman and chief executive who are both highly rated in the City. Turnover in equities reached 970.1m shares by the 6pm count, with FTSE 100 constituents accounting for just over half the overall total. Copyright Financial Times Limited 1998. All Rights Reserved.

888,394.0,1998-09-30,"The US Federal Reserve's decision yesterday to make a small cut in the Fed Funds interest rate left the foreign exchange market disappointed. The market had priced in a cut by as much as half of one percentage point, based on short-dated interest rate future contracts. But the Fed's decision to cut the official rate by just 0.25 percentage points, and to leave the discount rate untouched, caused the dollar to gyrate wildly as traders weighed up the options. In a statement, the central bank's open markets committee said: ""The action was taken to cushion the effects on prospective economic growth in the United States, of increasing weakness in foreign economies, and of less accommodative financial conditions domestically."" It was the first time the Fed had cut rates since January 1996. Marc Chandler, foreign exchange analyst at Deutsche Bank Securities in New York, said: ""In March 1997, when the Fed last raised rates, they said it was cautionary tap on the brake. This was a cautionary tap on the accelerator. ""This will not be enough to satisfy the markets. Many people think the Fed is falling behind the deflation curve."" But Avinash Persaud, head of currency research at J.P. Morgan in London, said the decision not to move the discount rate was an warning to the markets. ""It is very important that the discount rate was not cut - that would have sent a signal that the Fed was erring on the side of further cuts to come,"" Mr Persaud said. ""The Fed is signalling that it is concerned about the international economy. But speculation has been subdued by keeping the discount rate unchanged."" ""A 25 basis point cut was the most likely size of the move, given the US Fed is walking in uncertain territory, with the dichotomy between the international and domestic economy."" Earlier in London, trading had been very subdued as the market awaited the Fed's decision. The dollar had closed at DM 1.678 against the D-Mark, little changed from the previous day. Against the yen it was Y 2.4 weaker, at Y 134. * The US may have cut interest rates. But this does not mean that investors should expect co-ordinated G7 action. When Alan Greenspan earlier this month warned of the risk that international turmoil posed, the Bundesbank waited a day to say that Germany would not cut interest rates - even if the US did. This time round, the Bundesbank got its retaliation in first. Juergen Stark, the bank's vice-president, made clear that there was ""no necessity to discuss"" lower interest rates in Germany or the core countries of the euro-zone, before the FOMC met, indeed before the US was even awake. ""At the moment in Europe we have historically low rates,"" he said. And that was the end of the matter. * There is more hope of a cut when the Bank of England's monetary policy committee decides on interest rates on October 8. Following September's meeting, many analysts thought the MPC mirrored Chairman Greenspan's words that the balance of risks was moving away from domestically-generated inflation to disinflation imported from a turbulent international economy. The MPC kept interest rates on hold at 7.5% last month. But it signalled that the the next move would be down. Now the Fed has taken the plunge, lower UK rates cannot be far off. * The most likely beneficiary of China's decision to repatriate foreign exchange holdings back into the renminbi is the beleaguered Hong Kong dollar. It followed the earlier announcement of foreign exchange controls. While most analysts expect the direct consequences of the move to be small, it may allow the Chinese government to lower domestic interest rates. That would help domestic demand and ease the pressure on the Hong Kong economy. Copyright Financial Times Limited 1998. All Rights Reserved. Not Available for Re-dissemination.

889,395.0,1998-09-30,"US Treasuries were mixed soon after the Federal Open Market Committee's decision to lower the Federal Funds rate by 25 basis points to 5.25%. The 30-year bond, the benchmark for long-term interest rates, jumped 13/32 to 105 29/32, sending the yield down to 5.112%. Shorter-term notes did not do as well. The 10-year note was unchanged at 107, yielding 4.591%. The two-year note was down 1/32 to 100 3/32, yielding 4.45%. The fall in the Fed funds rate was widely expected in the stock and bond markets, coming after Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan's testimony to Congress last week. Many in the market, however, had expected a more aggressive move. ""The general assumption is that the next move will come at the November meeting,"" said Kevin Logan, senior market economist at Dresdner, Kleinwort Benson in New York. The cut was seen as important in stabilising global investment and helping overseas economies. While the US economy remains strong, recent cuts in credit availability, as well as problems at large financial institutions, are seen as a threat to future growth. GERMAN BUNDS closed slightly higher awaiting news from the US. German interest rates will come under the spotlight tomorrow when the Bundesbank council meets, but a hint that it would not adjust German rates came when Juergen Stark, a vice-president, said there was no justification for a relaxation of monetary policy in core euro zone countries. The December bund future settled at 113.73, up 0.12, with just 247,000 contracts changing hands in quiet trading on Eurex. In the cash market, the yield on the 10-year bund was 3.95%. UK GILTS, extremely sensitive to sentiment on interest rates ahead of next week's meeting of the Bank of England's monetary policy committee, fell in quiet trading while sterling strengthened. The catalyst for both was evidence of continued robust consumer spending, which weakens the case for a cut in rates. The figures showed consumers borrowed an additional #1.4bn in August, higher than most observers had expected. Neil Parker, treasury economist at Royal Bank of Scotland, said the data ""may add some ammunition to the hawks' case for leaving rates on hold"" at next week's meeting. ""Consumers are clearly financing consumption with debt, which raises questions about the timetable for interest rate cuts,"" said Joanne Collins at Daiwa Europe. The December gilt future settled at 115.36, down 0.18, on turnover of 46,000 contracts on Liffe. In the cash market, the yield on benchmark 10-year gilts was 4.97%, with the yield spread between gilts and bunds widening to 105 basis points. Copyright Financial Times Limited 1998.

890,396.0,1999-08-25,"The US Federal Reserve's decision to increase interest rates by one quarter of a percentage point, to 5.25 per cent, means that it has now taken back two-thirds of last autumn's emergency 0.75 point cuts. The move was widely expected. The markets are already looking ahead to October's meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee, wondering if it will finish clawing back the cuts then. As the Fed statement stressed, the monetary policy stance adopted after Russia's default, is no longer ""consistent with sustained non-inflationary economic expansion"". Although there are clear risks that the economy could over-heat, consumer price inflation - at 2.1 per cent in July - is hardly threatening. More worrying has been the recent jump in the Employment Cost Index, the broadest measure of wages and benefits. This increased by 1.1 per cent in the three months to June, the biggest increase for eight years. However, the ECI's rise by 0.4 per cent in the first quarter was the smallest on record. The tightness of the US labour market has been a concern for policymakers for some time. Strong productivity growth at the start of the year was a comfort, but this ground to a halt in the second quarter. Again, this should not have been too much of a surprise. Part of the reason for strong productivity growth at the start of the year is that companies expected a sharp slowdown. (This, remember, was why the Fed cut rates). Thus, they held down wages. When the economy roared ahead, at a 6 per cent annualised rate in the last three months of 1998, and at 4.3 per cent at the start of the year, there was a productivity spurt. The slowdown to a more moderate pace, of 2.3 per cent on an annualised basis in the second quarter, is exactly what the Fed wanted. If the economy slows of its own accord, and due to the sharp rise in long-term interest rates, it means that the Fed will not have to raise rates as much to bring this about. But the record trade deficit, as the economy continues to suck in imports, suggest that domestic demand still needs to cool down. International forces that helped keep a lid on US inflation are wearing off. Many commodity prices are rising. The Japanese and European economies, though still fragile, are recovering. The strong dollar has had a significant disinflationary effect, but this will recede and reverse as prospects improve elsewhere - and as the US current account deficit becomes more difficult to finance. The risks of inflation, the Fed says, have been markedly diminished by the two recent rate rises. But it is likely to find it has more work to do at its October meeting.

891,397.0,1999-08-25,"Tito Mboweni's appointment in July last year as South Africa's first black central bank governor took place against the backdrop of a plunging currency and massive interest rate increases as the country fell victim to emerging market upheaval. Yesterday, by contrast, Mr Mboweni's maiden policy address caused hardly a ripple in the domestic markets. Bond traders said his comments were ""pretty much as expected"", adding that they were more worried about the outcome of the US Federal Open Market Committee meeting later in the day. The new governor emphasised the central bank's continuing independence and made clear that he saw inflation as his most important concern. ""In the pursuit of the primary objective of price stability it is essential, as stated in the constitution, that the Reserve Bank performs its functions independently and without fear, favour or prejudice,"" he said. Mr Mboweni, a former ANC politician and a development economist by training, allayed fears that he might bow to populist pressures by saying that a monetary policy that maintained financial stability would make ""the best contribution to improving economic growth, employment and living standards"". He acknowledged that the eclectic monetary approach used by his predecessor, Chris Stals, had been ""useful"" for containing inflation, but said that it had, at times, created uncertainty about the bank's intermediate objectives. Formal inflation targeting would be more transparent, he said, and ought to ""allay some of these uncertainties"". Inflation targeting would be more effective if the government's policies were properly co-ordinated. He proposed a policy target agreement to be signed by himself and Trevor Manuel, the minister of finance. A Monetary Policy Committee, similar to that of the Bank of England, is also to be established, consisting of the governor and deputy governors as voting members and senior officials as non-voting members. Given that inflation targeting was ""a complicated monetary framework requiring careful preparation"", Mr Mboweni said the functions of the central bank's economics department were being revised and reorganised and that the unit would become a research department ""concentrating on monetary issues and co-ordinating research in the Bank"". Mr Mboweni did not announce a date for implementing the policy, or the level at which the target was likely to be set. In July, consumer inflation dipped below the 5 per cent level for the first time since 1970. * Thousands of civil servants belonging to all 12 of South Africa's public sector unions took to the streets in protest yesterday after a breakdown in wage negotiations with the government.

892,398.0,1999-08-25,"US government bond markets rallied slightly after the Federal Reserve raised two key interest rates, while maintaining a neutral bias on future interest rate policy. As expected, the Federal Reserve Open Market Committee raised the key Fed Funds rate by 25 basis points from 5 per cent to 5.25 per cent. However, it also raised the less frequently used discount rate by 25 basis points and maintained its neutral policy stance, signalling it was not necessarily leaning towards raising rates again. The FOMC said its actions should ""markedly diminish"" the risk of inflation appearing in the economy. Bond markets rallied on the news, then fell back slightly in late trading, with the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond up to 102 11/16, sending the yield down to 5.932 per cent. The 5-year note rose 13/32 to 101 9/32, to yield 5.700, while the 2-year note gained 1/8 to yield 5.584. Elsewhere, euro-zone economic data received little attention ahead of the Fed decision, with markets widely anticipating the quarter-point rise in US rates. UK gilts lacked direction amid seasonally light trading and ended very slightly lower, with the long end of the yield curve gently outperforming the short end. The September contract in the gilt future settled 0.08 lower at 110.51 while the long gilt due in June 2028 yielded 4.70 per cent, down 3 basis points. Weaker-than-expected UK trade data had little impact. Concentrating on what was happening in the US, the gilt market largely ignored figures from the Office for National Statistics that showed the UK trade deficit with the rest of the world ballooning to #2.5bn in June. Debt markets also largely ignored higher-than-expected German producer price data which showed July producer prices rising by 0.3 per cent month-on-month and falling by 1.0 per cent year-on-year. Forecasts were for a 0.2 per cent monthly rise and a fall of 1.1 per cent year-on-year. Ten-year bund futures hardly moved at all - settling at 108.80, down 0.03 on the day. There was significantly more action in Japan. An already lethargic Japanese government bond market was battered by sluggish bidding for a Y1,400bn auction of 10-year, 1.9 per cent coupon bonds. The Finance Ministry announced that the lowest price for the issue was 99.70 with a yield of 1.935 per cent, while the average price was 99.85 to yield 1.917 per cent. Trading, however, pushed the new bond briefly to 2 per cent on the secondary market - the highest level the 10-year bond yield has been since February 16, when it stood at 2.02 per cent. The auction highlighted reluctance among private investors to buy more bonds because of continuing fears that the government will flood the market with new bonds later in the year to finance a second supplementary budget. The poor results of the auction spurred hedge-selling of both cash JGBs and JGB futures, and market sentiment darkened ahead of an auction of two-year bonds planned tomorrow and six-year and 30-year bond auctions planned for next week. The price of the March futures contract for 10-year bonds lost 0.43 to 128.18, sending the yield up to 0.042 points to 2.482 per cent. Plan for Rs25bn auction depresses Indian prices Indian bond prices settled sharply lower yesterday, following an announcement from the government of a Rs25bn bond auction, writes Sathnam Sanghera. The Reserve Bank of India said it would be reissuing 10-year, 11.99 per cent bonds on Friday, August 27. Existing 11.99 per cent 2009 bonds fell to a low of Rs102.45 on the news and eventually recovered to 102.50 - much weaker than the morning's price level of Rs102.58. ""The market became more volatile after the bond auction announcement,"" said one dealer at a broking house. Bids on the 12.40 per cent 2013 bond dropped to Rs103.55/57 as sentiment darkened, compared with the central bank sale price of Rs103.62. There has been a bearish mood in the market since Monday, when the Reserve Bank said that it would pay for oil imports from its reserves. This led to fears of a rupee outflow from the system. The RBI also altered its sale list on Monday. The securities on the list included the 11.0 per cent 2002 bond, the 12.40 per cent 2013 bond and two 364-day treasury bills maturing on February 25 and March 24 in the year 2000.

894,400.0,1999-08-25,"Stock markets moved sideways as investors awaited developments at the Federal Reserve amid expectations that only a modest rise in US interest rates would emerge, writes Vincent Boland. While there was speculation in some quarters that recent US economic data showing a continued slowdown in inflation was enough to put any rate rise on hold, the general feeling was that the Fed would act by lifting the rate by a quarter of a percentage point. The dollar held steady in early European foreign exchange trading but was hit by nerves as the FOMC meeting - a rate announcement was expected at 2.15pm Washington time - got closer. The currency slipped to an intra-day low of $1/ Y111.6 and $1.05/EUR1 in New York trading. Asian markets had set the tone overnight, posting modest falls. Tokyo stocks were hit by a bout of profit-taking in the banking sector after big recent gains. European markets remained largely flat as Wall Street opened slightly weaker and traders said there was no real trend ahead of the Fed announcement. Unlike in the US, there is little prospect of a rate rise in Europe until perhaps the second half of next year, according to the latest European market overview from the strategy team at Salomon Smith Barney. The bank says the euro zone economy is set for a benign period of accelerating growth, low inflation and shrinking fiscal deficits. The pick-up in growth - Salomon has raised its forecast for European gross domestic product growth for 2000 to 2.8 per cent - should help stabilise the euro against the dollar in the near term. Meanwhile, the expected rises in European interest rates next year and the likelihood that the US economy will be slowing by then ""probably will lift the euro close to its long-term average of $1.17/EUR1 during 2000"", the bank says. Inflation should also stay below the European Central Bank's target ceiling of 2 per cent throughout next year despite the better economic growth outlook. Copyright Financial Times Limited 1999.

Rheinhyp, a German mortgage and public sector lender, joined the line of Pfandbrief issuers yesterday. It is looking to raise EUR2bn-EUR3bn in the maturity of 5-8 years. This follows the announcement by DePfa, one of the largest mortgage lenders in Germany, to raise EUR3bn-EUR5bn. Algemeine Hypothekenbank (AHB) is set to launch a EUR5bn 10-year Pfandbrief today following the Federal Reserve Open Market Committee meeting. Borrowers, who normally would have spread their issue over a few months, are trying to cram their issues in September. This is because they fear concerns over the millennium bug may cause a liquidity crunch in the market in the last quarter of the year. Since the launch of the euro the Pfandbrief market became the largest and most liquid non-government bond market in the euro-zone. However, many observers doubt whether the market is deep enough to absorb so many issues, particularly as euro-zone governments are also continuing to borrow. Germany, for example, will today auction EUR5bn in 5-year bonds. However, a banker at Commerzbank said jumbo Pfandbriefe have the advantage over corporate issues of being more liquid - something that investors are particularly sensitive to at present.

896,402.0,2008-09-17,"News Analysis Bernanke's decision has been branded brave by some analysts and risky by others, writes Krishna Guha The Federal Reserve defied intense market pressure to cut interest rates yesterday - holding rates at 2 per cent and adopting a neutral all-options-open stance on monetary policy. Analysts said it was a brave decision by Fed chairman Ben Bernanke, while some termed it risky. Many drew parallels with Treasury secretary Hank Paulson's decision not to help rescue Lehman Brothers at the weekend. The new stance keeps open the possibility of a future interest rate cut if financial chaos escalates or growth weakens dramatically, but indicates no predisposition to ease. For the first time in many months, the Federal open market committee was united. The Fed did make it clear that it was paying close attention to financial turmoil. ""Strains in financial markets have increased significantly,"" the committee said. It would monitor developments ""carefully"" and act ""as needed"" - a combination of words that suggests the Fed would not rule out an intermeeting cut in some circumstances. Yet the US central bank did not adopt an easing bias. Instead it explicitly moved to a neutral assessment of the balance of risks, stating ""the downside risks to growth and upside risks to inflation are both of significant concern"". The statement makes it clear that the US central bank has decided in the first instance to battle the storm with liquidity tools. It appeared poised to follow up Sunday's dramatic easing of collateral terms for investment banks with emergency liquidity support for AIG, the troubled insurance group, and possibly an increase in swap lines with central banks in Europe as well. In the short term these moves could act as partial substitutes for a rate cut, buying the Fed time to evaluate market developments and their implications for the economy. Traders said the crisis at AIG rather than the collapse of Lehman was the primary cause of market turbulence yesterday. The concern is that because insurance companies do not theoretically have access to emergency finance from the Fed in the way a bank or now investment bank does, an unwinding process could be abrupt and disorderly, with firesales of assets. The Fed could deal with this in a targeted manner, by brokering a private sector rescue for AIG, making a direct Fed loan to AIG, or providing back-to-back loans via a bank such as JPMorgan Chase. But the moral hazard cost of providing emergency finance to an insurance company could be great. A big increase in the dollar swap lines with European central banks would also provide a targeted way to calm the extraordinary pressures in the money market, which are most intense outside the US. In addition to increased financial stress, yesterday's statement highlighted a further weakening in labour markets, a recent slowdown in US growth and a softening in consumer spending, while warning that ""some slowing in export growth"" would also weigh on growth in the coming quarters. Yet while the Fed no longer expressed concern about some measures of inflation expectations, it still said ""the inflation outlook remains highly uncertain"" - and put inflation risk on a par with growth risk, to the surprise of many analysts. This suggests the hurdle for further rate cuts remains quite high, in part due to uncertainty as to the magnitude of the effect of financial turmoil on the economy. The Fed may also feel that it has some support in the near term from the plunge in Treasury yields, which limits any rise in overall borrowing costs, and from the fall in oil. Unless the current turmoil escalates out of control it could take a significant further deterioration of the economic outlook before the Fed would consider further easing - likely in convoy with other central banks. ""The Federal Reserve took a gamble today,"" said Marc Chandler, a strategist at Brown Brothers Harriman. Alan Ruskin, a strategist at RBS Greenwich Capital, said ""I think it is a mistake, both in substance and in tactics."" However, Peter Hooper, chief economist at Deutsche Bank Securities, said: ""It was the right decision.""",Fed keeps all options open by holding rates,2008-09-16,The Financial Times

898,404.0,1995-08-23,"Weaker than expected July M3 money supply data in Germany yesterday bolstered expectations of a further fall in interest rates this week. The initial focus will be on the outcome of the weekly repo auction today, but a possibility also exists that the Bundesbank council will sanction a cut in the discount rate when it meets tomorrow. There was little expectation of any change in US interest rates ahead of the meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee. The expectation of lower German rates gave the dollar rally renewed enthusiasm. It rose to an intraday high of DM 1.49 before slipping back to finish in London at DM 1.4852, from DM 1.4723. Against the yen it ended at Y 96.6, from Y 96.715. It closed in New York at DM 1.4863 and Y 96.855. The same set of factors saw European currencies such as the lira, peseta and Swedish krona power ahead against the D-Mark. The peseta broke through the Pta85 level to end at Pta84.98 and the krona finished at SKr4.947 from SKr4.998. The pound also firmed against the weaker D-Mark, but lost ground against the dollar. It finished at DM 2.2838, from DM 2.2693, and at $1.5377, from $1.5413. Market opinion polls suggest that a cut in official German rates this week is unlikely. A Reuters poll of 20 economists across Europe found that 85% of them thought there would be no cut now, although the bulk of these expect a cut in the fourth quarter. Curiously, a survey of German money market dealers conducted by MMS, the financial advisory group, reached different conclusions. It found that almost half of those surveyed expected a 50 basis-point reduction in the discount and Lombard rates this week. The repo rate is expected to fall to 4.40% today. Mr Tony Norfield, UK treasury economist at ABN Amro in London, said he was sceptical of a cut this week on the grounds that the key financial data were substantially unchanged from the end of March, when the Bundesbank last lowered rates. The D-Mark has also lost 8% against the dollar since then. Ms Alison Cottrell, international economist at PaineWebber in London, said the M3 figures provided a suitable hook for a change in policy, but predicted that the Bundesbank would probably hold off for a while yet. 'When your crosses are doing well, you might as well save the discount rate until other people need it,' she said. With the Bundesbank assumed to tolerate a 25 basis-point gap between the repo rate and the discount rate, the repo still has some way to fall before it threatens this limit. The repo rate is currently at 4.45%, compared to the 4% discount rate. Ms Cottrell said that on this basis there was still room for 'fairly hefty' falls in the repo rate before the discount rate had to be cut. She said she believed another 50 basis-point cut was on the cards, predicting that the Bundesbank was likely to act before the repo moved towards the 4.25% threshold. For those concerned about the likely duration of the dollar's rally, and the relationship of the yen and D-Mark legs of such an upturn, some advice came from Mr Brian Marber, an independent technical analyst in London. He said his studies of the only four Dollars /D-Mark rallies since the end of the 1970s showed they had all been accompanied by yen rallies. He concluded: 'I am not expecting DM/Dollars to peak for another 14 to 19 days, therefore yen/Dollars can be expected to rally for approximately the same period.' Over this period, he sees the dollar rising to a range of around DM 1.50-60, with a further advance to around DM 1.75 by October 1996 likely. Signs of a slowdown in the UK economy have been well received in the short sterling market. The March and June 1996 contracts both reached record highs, respectively 93.07 and 92.90. Mr Nick Parsons, treasury economist at Standard Chartered in London, pointed out that the longer dated contracts in 1996 and 1997 had, by comparison, underperformed and were ripe for a catch-up. After forecasting an #815m money market shortage, the Bank of England provided #316m assistance at established rates and #420m late support. (c) The Financial Times Limited 1995.

899,405.0,1995-08-23,"Signs of a slowdown in German money supply growth, which appeared to strengthen the case for a cut in German interest rates, failed to lift European government bonds yesterday. Benchmark 10-year bonds across most markets showed little reaction to the data, which pointed to a 0.4% fall in M3 money supply last month. The German bund futures contract on Liffe traded in a narrow range - between 95.04 and 95.23 - and other European markets followed suit. But the reaction to the data at the short-end of the German yield curve was more marked. Two-year bond yields fell to 4.89% compared with 4.95 at the open, suggesting that markets are anticipating a cut in interest rates soon. The data, which follow evidence earlier in the week of weak real economic activity, now turn the spotlight on today's repo market operations. A number of analysts expect a cut in the repo rate of about 5 basis points from 4.45% currently. Attention will also be on tomorrow's Bundesbank council meeting for a possible cut in the discount rate. Ms Ros Lifton, an economist at Daiwa in London, suggested that worries about the inflationary effects of a possible cut in interest rates combined with a weak D-Mark may be a reason for the muted reaction among longer-dated bonds. She added that the weak follow-through in the 10-year area may be due to the lack of demand among domestic German investors for 10-year bonds, because of concerns over European monetary union. 'Institutions have been advising domestic investors to avoid anything with a maturity beyond 1999 since they are worried they may not get their money back in D-Marks,' she said. Trading conditions were thin with dealers waiting for the outcome of the US FOMC meeting, although few expected a change in US interest rates. Disappointment over a higher-than-expected inflation figure depressed Italian government bonds. In the UK, the long gilt future on Liffe settled at 106 11/32, down 1/32 point. US Treasury prices slipped modestly after the Federal Reserve's Open Market Committee left interest unchanged, even though that is what most on Wall Street expected. Late in the session, the benchmark 30-year Treasury was 7/32 lower at 99 27/32 to yield 6.882%. At the short end, the two-year note was 1/32 lower at 99 5/8 to yield 6.063%. Few analysts believed that the Fed would alter interest rate policy at the close of yesterday's FOMC meeting, but many were hoping the policy-making group would issue a statement that might provide some guidance about the course of monetary policy through to the end of the year. However, the FOMC did not issue any statement at the close of the meeting. Also weighing on the market was new supply from the afternoon auction of $17.75bn in two-year notes. Demand was stronger than average, with the ratio of bids offered to bids accepted at 2.74-to-1. Today the Treasury was to auction $11.5bn in five-year notes. The market has fallen in past weeks under the weight of a large amount of new supply, sparking concerns that demand might be off at the auction. The dollar offered some support to bonds late in the session as it edged higher against the D-Mark and the Japanese yen in light trading. (c) The Financial Times Limited 1995.

900,406.0,2005-05-04,"Few 150-word statements are read as widely and as closely as the one accompanying the Federal Reserve's interest rate decisions. The fact that the Fed yesterday chose to own up to an error - and face criticism from traders - demonstrated the importance of making a judgment on inflation expectations in setting monetary policy. The seven words the Fed omitted just after 2.15pm, and reinserted just before 4pm, amounted to the same judgment given in each of its previous four meetings: ""Longer-term inflation expectations remain well contained."" Well behaved inflation expectations, together with still robust productivity growth, have allowed the central bank to proceed in ""measured"" quarter point increments as it has raised its target federal funds rate from 1 per cent last June to 3 per cent yesterday. ""If inflation expectations rise, then that's how you get inflation embedded in wage demands and the pricing system,"" said Joshua Feinman, chief economist at Deutsche Asset Management. ""This is the kind of pernicious inflation they want to avoid."" Having to resort to more aggressive rate increases would have disturbed financial markets considerably more than yesterday's error. The Fed looks at various measures of inflation expectations, including the spread between the yield on the 10-year Treasury note and the yield on Treasury inflation-protected securities. Alan Greenspan, Fed chairman, favours a measure based on disaggregating long-term interest rates, using information from futures markets, to see what inflation expectations look like in each of the next 10 years. Such measures remained reassuring, economists said yesterday. However, the Fed also pays close attention to surveys of consumer expectations. The Michigan survey, released last week, indicated just the kind of increase in long-term expectations that the Fed does not want to see. Yesterday's mistake was embarrassing for a central bank that has placed such emphasis on its communication with markets as a means of driving policy. The Fed said human error was to blame. A spokesman declined to comment on whether the confusion followed a discussion among members of the Federal Open Market Committee as to whether the assurance was still warranted. But the other change on the inflation language did - purposefully - indicate increased concern about inflation pressure. The FOMC dropped its judgment that higher headline inflation was not feeding into higher core inflation. Fed policymakers have been relatively relaxed about the high headline inflation rate, driven by the oil price. But there is growing concern over possible effects on business pricing decisions as well as consumer expectations. Ian Shepherdson, at High Frequency Economics, said the net effect of the corrected statement was to make the Fed's message a bit less stark. But, he added in a note to clients, the clear signal remained that: rates were still too low; inflation pressures were building; and the slowdown was nothing like severe enough to induce a pause in the rate increases. The solid pace of spending growth might have slowed a bit, the statement said, but this was in large part the result of high energy prices. At most this suggested the Fed sees the recent lull as another soft-patch, similar to the short-lived slowdown last summer. Hardening the language on inflation offset the Fed's acknowledgement of recent weaker economic data. Since the FOMC does not meet again until the end of June, it has plenty of time to watch the data. Mickey Levy, chief economist at Bank of America, said in prescient fashion after the first version of yesterday's statement was issued: ""I would not emphasise the tweaking of the language as much as the fact that, after eight rate increases, the Fed acknowledged that policy remains accommodative and said it will continue to raise rates at a measured pace.""

901,407.0,2005-05-04,"The Federal Open Market Committee raised short-term interest rates yesterday for the eighth successive time, by 0.25 per cent to 3 per cent. But the Fed put markets on a roller-coaster ride as it corrected the wording of its statement at about 4pm in New York. Prices of 10-year Treasury bonds fell initially, but then rose after the FOMC added words that suggested a benign view on longer-term inflation to its statement. The 10-year Treasuries were yielding 4.16 per cent in late afternoon trading, down from 4.19 per cent. The text of the FOMC's statement once again suggested interest rate hikes might continue at a ""measured"" pace. Overall, the wording leaves the Fed with flexibility to act ""the way they see fit"" in the light of future economic signals, said John Roberts, managing director at Barclays Capital. Stronger-than-expected data on factory orders prompted selling of bonds before the FOMC announcement but did little to clarify conflicting signals about the economic outlook emerging from the world's largest economy in recent weeks. Activity was muted in the eurozone and UK government bond markets ahead of the Fed decision. But yields on eurozone government bonds hit new historic lows as market expectations for a rate hike this year dimmed. The yield on the 10-year Bund reached 3.373 per cent before rising to 3.376 per cent, down 2.2bp on the day. The two-year Schatz was 2.2bp lower at 2.213 per cent. Though the European Central Bank was widely expected to keep rates steady at 2 per cent when it makes its announcement today, the steady stream of gloomy economic news has stirred murmurings in the market of a possible cut in interest rates later this year. ""The absence of a turnround in the labour market in Germany, and in the eurozone more generally, will therefore be an added reason for the ECB to keep rates on hold this year,"" said Julien Seetharamdoo, economist at Capital Economics. Concerns on growth also came to the fore in the UK, where retailers reported the worst sales volume for over 10 years in April, while data showed that the manufacturing sector had contracted for the first time in almost two years. As a result, prices of gilts rose and yields on the 10-year bond fell 2.9bp to 4.508 per cent, while the two-year gilt yield also lost 2.9bp to 4.483 per cent.

Stronger-than-expected data on factory orders prompted some selling of bonds but did little to clarify conflicting signals about the economic outlook emerging from the world's largest economy in recent weeks. So while it was widely expected that the Federal Reserve would raise short-term interest rates by 0.25 per cent to 3 per cent - to make it the eighth successive increase - investors were poised to react to any change in the outlook on inflation and economic growth, or in the Fed's ""measured"" approach to interest rate rises in the accompanying statement. Ahead of the Fed announcement, yields on 10-year Treasuries were unchanged at 4.198 per cent during New York's mid-afternoon trading. The yield on the two-year note was yielding 3.637 per cent. Activity was also muted in the eurozone and UK government bond markets ahead of the Fed decision.

903,409.0,2005-05-04,"The US Federal Reserve signalled no change in its strategy yesterday, as it raised its target federal funds rate another quarter point to 3 per cent and said it would continue raising rates at a ""measured"" pace. The Federal Open Market Committee acknowledged recent weaker economic data, in its accompanying statement, but also hardened its language on inflation pressures. Fed policymakers had indicated in the run-up to the meeting that inflation remained the committee's primary concern. The Fed repeated in the statement that monetary policy remained ""accommodative"" and that it expected to continue removing this accommodation ""at a pace that is likely to be measured"". Rather than attempting to influence market expectations, the committee can be seen as leaving itself with flexibility to respond to the incoming data, while signalling that it will press ahead with rate increases. The federal funds rate, at 3 per cent, is still seen as too low to be consistent with price stability over time. The FOMC does not meet again until the end of June, a two-day meeting at which members will update their individual economic forecasts ahead of Fed chairman Alan Greenspan's twice-yearly testimony before Congress. Financial markets were little changed following yesterday's announcement. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note has declined significantly since March, and stock markets have been weak as investors have reacted to the recent weaker signs on consumer and business spending. The Fed said ""recent data suggest that the solid pace of spending growth has slowed somewhat, partly in response to the earlier increases in energy prices"". It added that the labour market continued to improve gradually. But it signalled its concern about inflation, repeating that ""pressures on inflation have picked up in recent months"". The Fed also removed its judgment, given at its March meeting, that the rise in energy prices ""has not notably fed through to core consumer prices"". It also deleted from its statement the judgment that it saw inflation expectations as remaining ""well-contained"", an assurance it has given at its last four meetings. Fed policymakers have been relatively relaxed about the high headline inflation rate, driven by the oil price, but the concern is that there will start to be second-round effects on business pricing decisions and consumer inflation expectations. Mickey Levy, chief economist at Bank of America, said: ""I would not emphasise the tweaking of the language as much as the fact that, after eight rate increases the Fed acknowledged that policy remains accommodative and said it will continue to raise rates at a measured pace."" The minutes of past meetings suggest that though some policymakers are not comfortable with maintaining the forward-looking guidance, the bulk of committee members do not think it reduces their flexibility to raise rates more aggressively than quarter-point increases, or pause the tightening campaign. ",Fed raises rates another quarter point FOMC MEETING.,2005-05-03,The Financial Times
904,410.0,2005-05-04,"Since the Federal Reserve started to provide explicit forward-looking guidance in late 2003 it has repeatedly increased its flexibility to respond to events. Some economists think maximum flexibility has been achieved and the forward-looking language is no longer providing much guidance. Paul McCulley, Fed-watcher at Pimco, the giant bond fund, said: ""The statement has been tortured to the point where it is not particularly illuminating now."" When it raised rates to 3 per cent this week, the Federal Open Market Committee maintained that monetary policy remained ""accommodative"" or too low to be consistent with price stability over time. It also said that it expected to continue with a ""measured"" pace of tightening, generally seen as indicating quarter-point increases, but which most Fed policymakers see as consistent with more aggressive rate increases or with no change at the next meeting. It acknowledged the recent slower economic data, while linking this to earlier increases in energy prices, and also increased inflation risks, acknowledging implicitly that energy prices were now feeding into increased core inflationary pressures. Balanced growth and inflation risks are predicated on its assumption of appropriate monetary action. ""Their statement is loaded with contingencies now. The market is getting much more uncertain about where the Fed is going in the next few months,"" said Ethan Harris, chief US economist at Lehman Brothers. Before the recent spate of weaker economic data, futures markets were pricing in a 4 per cent federal funds rate at the end of the year, implying continuing quarter-point increases and just one pause, probably in thin trading before Christmas. The market is now pricing in close to 3.75 per cent at year end and hardly higher during 2006. However, Lehman's ""Fediscope"" model which provides the probability of different outcomes based on futures market pricing and risk spreads points to a 40 per cent chance of a 3.5 per cent federal funds rate after the September meeting, a 26 per cent chance of 3.75 per cent and a 22 per cent chance of 3.25 per cent. That is probably just how the Fed wants it, given the uncertainty in the economic outlook. If over the two months before its next meeting the data show that the slowdown in growth is more than a soft patch, or that inflation risks demand decisive action, the Fed can act accordingly. For now, the market is playing a useful stabilising role. ""Given the recent softness in the data, committee members are probably thankful that the market is not pricing in too much tightening and that broad financial conditions are accommodative. Six weeks ago they were more concerned that their interest rate increases were getting more traction,"" said Brian Sack, at Macroeconomic Advisers, the consultancy. Macroeconomic Advisers, along with many professional forecasters, expects a more aggressive Fed, with stronger growth later in the year leading to a federal funds rate climbing to 4.5 per cent next year. A number of Fed-watchers suggest that the June meeting, before chairman Alan Greenspan's twice-yearly testimony before Congress, will be when the committee chooses to make significant changes to its statement. Mr McCulley, who thinks the Fed has almost finished raising rates, said he expected the Fed to take the same approach as in May 1994, when the statement declared it had ""substantially removed"" its policy accommodation. ""What I think we are coming up to, most likely at the end of June, is that they declare that they have substantially removed accommodation,"" he said, at the same time as they dropped the measured pace language.

But the dollar weakened across the board as the Federal Reserve's accompanying statement prompted speculation that it could take an earlier than expected pause in tightening policy. The US central bank lifted its main lending rate by 25 basis points to 3 per cent - the eighth quarter point rise since last June. It said that long-term inflation remained contained but acknowledged that spending had slowed in the face of high energy prices. That left economists debating how much further rates would rise. ""Despite both recent inflation and activity data giving the Fed a nasty surprise, the FOMC statement showed little change,"" said Tim Drayson at ABN Amro. ""The Fed believes growth will remain robust. We think the growth and inflation trade-off is deteriorating. Either way, the Fed must continue tightening."" But Stephen Roach, chief economist at Morgan Stanley, argued that rates might be at their peak. ""If the US economy were truly healthy, the Fed should target the federal funds rate in the 5 to 5.5 per cent zone,"" he said. ""However, with America's cyclical impetus now fading, post-bubble fault lines could deepen - making it all but impossible for the Fed to normalize real interest rates. This week could mark the Fed's last rate hike of this cycle."" By midday in New York, the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the S&P 500 index were both up 0.7 per cent. Dow component General Motors raced ahead after billionaire investor Kirk Kerkorian said he would buy a significant stake in the ailing company.

Tokyo remained shut for the Golden Week holiday, although Hong Kong climbed to an eight-week high as local banks left their prime rates unchanged despite the Fed's move. The dollar fell to a six-week low against the yen as the Fed's statement disappointed those who had expected more hawkish comments and the Japanese currency continued to find support from speculation about a possible revaluation of the Chinese renminbi. The US currency also eased back from Tuesday's two-week high against the euro, although it trimmed its decline following some shock news from the bond market. The US Treasury said it was considering bringing back the 30-year note, three-and-a-half years since ceasing issuance, sending long-dated bonds tumbling. The prospect of new supply sent the yield on 30-year paper soaring, while 10-year yields also climbed.

And the dollar initially rose as the FOMC omitted the line that ""longer-term inflation expectations remain well contained"" that had appeared in previous statements. However the Fed later rushed out a correction which included the above statement. This led most analysts to view the statement as broadly dovish, weakening the dollar. ""After the initial, almost complete statement, the dollar looked fairly buoyant as the text seemed to support the widespread outlook for regular rate increases.

The yen drew support from the continuing speculation of a revaluation by China, a move seen as heralding a period of broad Asian currency strength. This speculation also allowed the South Korean won to firm 0.7 per cent to Won995 against the dollar and the Taiwan dollar to gain 0.9 per cent to T$31.00, a six-week high. A surge in the Malaysian stock exchange was attributed to foreign investors increasing their exposure in the belief that the ringgit's peg of 3.8 to the dollar could be eased.

The news conference followed the expected announcement earlier in the day that the ECB will keep rates steady at 2 per cent. They have been at 2 per cent since June, 2003. Amid growing gloom about economic growth in the region and expectations of a rate hike in the near future growing ever dimmer, some had priced in the small possibility of a rate cut later this year or next year. The European debt market has rallied over the past week, with yields reaching new historic lows. Mr Trichet said: ""Regarding the current situation and the short-term outlook for economic activity, recent data and survey indicators are, on balance, on the downside.

""After the initial, almost complete statement, the dollar looked fairly buoyant as the text seemed to support the widespread outlook for regular rate increases. However, the addition of the final piece of text put the whole thing into a different light,"" said Chris Gothard, currencies strategist at Brown Brothers Harriman. ""The delayed release of a phrase saying inflation is 'well contained' rather altered the effect of the statement accompanying last night's widely expected quarter point increase to 3 per cent in the Fed funds rate. The dollar has been under pressure all night as a result."" The broader statement was also perceived as broadly dovish, particularly the claim that ""recent data suggest that the solid pace of spending growth has slowed somewhat, partly in response to the earlier increases in energy prices,"" although labour market conditions ""apparently continue to improve gradually"". Neil Mellor, currency strategist at Bank of New York, concluded that: ""The fact is that the Fed's recognition of the negative impact on demand from spiralling energy costs arguably implies genuine doubts as to the plausibility of bestowing further financial pain upon private sector America."" With this mood prevalent, the dollar fell to $1.2942 against the dollar, 0.8c worse than before the statement, Y0.5 to Y104.56 against the yen, 1.2c to $1.9007 against sterling and 0.6c to C$1.2485 against the Canadian dollar. Elsewhere trading was range-bound. The euro held at Y135.33 against the yen with the eurozone services purchasing managers' index beating consensus expectations of 52.6, despite slipping to 52.8 in April from 53 in March. The Australian dollar firmed to $0.7768 against its US namesake as the Reserve Bank held rates unchanged as expected.

909,415.0,2005-05-04,"The Federal Reserve on Tuesday signalled no change in strategy, as it lifted US interest rates another quarter point to 3 per cent and said it would continue raising rates at a ""measured"" pace. While it acknowledged recent weaker economic data that had led to suggestions that the economy was entering a soft patch, the policymaking Federal Open Market Committee hardened its language on inflation pressures. The Fed's statement said monetary policy remained ""accommodative"" and that it expected to continue removing this accommodation ""at a pace that is likely to be measured"". Rather than attempting to influence market expectations, the committee can be seen as leaving itself with flexibility to respond to new data, while signalling that it expects to press ahead with rate increases. Fed policymakers had indicated in the run-up to the meeting that inflation remained the committee's primary concern. The federal funds rate, at 3 per cent, is still seen as too low to be consistent with price stability over time. The tabular content relating to this article is not available to view.

910,416.0,1995-03-29,"Relatively weak demand at an afternoon note auction, a weaker dollar, and data showing consumer confidence increasing rather than waning conspired to send Treasury prices sharply lower yesterday. Late in the session the benchmark 30-year Treasury was down 7/8 at 102 3/4 to yield 7.389%. At the short end of the market, the two-year note was 3/16 lower at 100 9/32, yielding 6.695%. At mid-morning, the market took a strong downward turn after figures released by the Conference Board showed consumers to be much more confident than most economists had expected. The board's general confidence index for March rose to 101 from an upwardly revised figure of 99.4 for February. Economists had forecast a decline to 97%. Bond prices slid even further in the afternoon after poor demand was shown at an afternoon auction of $17.25bn in two-year notes. The ratio of offers tendered to accepted bids came in at 2.45 to one, compared with the much stronger ratio of 2.91 to one in January's auction. In recent days, traders had expressed concern that the market's bullish turn and the drop in yields that accompanied it would decrease demand for new government securities. The Treasury is also to sell $11bn in five-year notes today. There was almost no market reaction to the announcement that the Federal Reserve had adjourned its Open Market Committee meeting without issuing any comment or taking any action as a broad consensus of Wall Street economists had held that the central bank would not alter monetary policy. Government Bonds The weaker dollar also contributed to the falling bond market. By late afternoon, the US currency slipped against the D-Mark and the Japanese yen to DM 1.3871 and Y 88.89, against DM 1.4063 and Y 89.45 late Monday. UK government bonds continued their recent trend of range-trading yesterday, as the Federal Open Market Committee meeting in the US weighed down any progress at the short end of the yield curve and today's gilt auction weighed on the long end. Analysts expect the auction to generate reasonable demand, particularly from domestic investors. The auction will be of #2bn of 8% gilts due 2015. A paper from UBS has pointed out that some investors avoided buying the first tranche in the hope that it would cheapen relative to the curve. These investors will be encouraged to buy today's issue because its weighting in the FT index of gilts with a maturity of more than 15 years will increase as the issue size increases from #2bn to #4bn. The long gilt futures contract on Liffe was around 103 1/8, down 1/8, with resistance seen around 103 1/2. The UK 10-year yield spread over Germany was around 151 basis points in late trading, up from 147 points the day before. German government bonds shifted up slightly yesterday, with little economic news to drive any movement and investors staying firmly on the sidelines until after the Bundesbank council meeting tomorrow. Most analysts expect no reduction in short-term interest rates. The June bund future on Liffe was around 92.04, up 0.01 on the day. Traders say there is a key support level at 91.98, and a strong resistance at 92.25. These two levels are likely to set the range of trading until after Thursday. Italian government bonds ended the day lower, affected by profit-taking from Monday's rise and lack of news on pension reforms. The June BTP future on Liffe was around 93.90 in late trading, down 0.32. The yield spread over bunds was around 623 basis points in late trading, little changed from the 622 points of the day before. (c) The Financial Times Limited 1995.

911,417.0,2006-02-01,"US stocks fell yesterday after investors interpreted comments that accompanied a widely expected quarter-point interest rate rise by the Federal Reserve to mean that the US central bank was not done with its cycle of monetary tightening. The Federal Open Market Committee raised its benchmark interest rate to 4.5 per cent and signalled in its accompanying statement that further interest rate rises might be implemented to keep inflation at bay. The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed down 0.3 per cent at 10,864.86 while the S&P 500 traded 0.4 per cent lower at 1,280.08. The Nasdaq Composite managed to recover most of its earlier losses however and ended the session one point lower at 2,305.82. Scott Wren, senior equity strategist at AG Edwards and Sons, said the statement was more vague than he expected. ""I find it disheartening that they would let economic data dictate what they would do with their (rate) policy,"" he said. ""You want the Fed to be proactive not reactive. By the time they get the data, it's already in the rear view mirror."" Along with the Fed statement, the market was also pondering renewed worries over decelerating earnings growth after Altria and Goodyear Tire &Rubber delivered mixed results. Goodyear was the session's worst perfomer, plunging more than 16 per cent to Dollars 15.64 after it delivered weaker-than-expected earnings for the fourth-quarter. The results prompted analysts at Deutsche Bank to cut their rating on the stock from ""hold"" to ""sell"", citing among other things, concerns over the persistence of high raw material costs. The news also prompted a run on fellow tyremaker Cooper Tire &Rubber, down 8 per cent at Dollars 14.99 Cigarette maker Altria and drugmaker Wyeth added to investors' disappointment. Altria, owner of Kraft Foods and Philip Morris International, fell 2.1 cent to Dollars 72.34 after its fourth-quarter earnings came in below analyst estimates. Although Wyeth swung into a fourth-quarter profit, the figure came in a little below market forecasts, causing its shares to fall 1.5 per cent to Dollars 46.25. On the upside, ailing drugmaker Merck said cost-cutting and strong demand for its asthma and cholesterol medicines helped push its fourth-quarter profit slightly higher to beat Wall Street forecasts. Its shares edged up 0.1 per cent to Dollars 34.50. Fellow drugmaker Sepracor surged 17.6 per centto Dollars 56.91 after it topped market expectations with its results. Elsewhere, Napster, the digital music company, shot up 25.3 per cent to Dollars 3.91following reports that Google might be looking to buy it in an attempt to develop its own online music service.

912,418.0,2006-02-01,"The US Federal Reserve yesterday raised interest rates another quarter point, a decision that brought to a close Alan Greenspan's long chairmanship of the central bank but not necessarily the campaign of rate increases. In its accompanying statement, the policymaking Federal Open Market Committee said ""some further policy firming may be needed"" to keep the outlook for sustainable growth and price stability in balance, dropping the reference to ""measured"" policy firming that was included in December. By changing the language in its statement, Fed policymakers were attempting to avoid the impression of committing Ben Bernanke, the new Fed chairman, to further increases, while signalling that further rate increases remained likely, depending on the economic data. The committee appeared to dismiss concerns about weak growth in the fourth quarter, saying: ""Although recent economic data have been uneven, the expansion in economic activity appears solid."" Maintaining its focus on inflation risks, it repeated the language from its December statement that while whole core inflation had stayed relatively low and inflation expectations were contained, ""possible increases in resource utilisation as well as elevated energy prices have the potential to add to inflation pressures"". ""Decisions now will be pretty much data driven, but the way they see the data at the moment suggests there will be more,"" said Peter Hooper, chief US economist at Deutsche Bank. Mr Bernanke will take over as Fed chairman today. Yesterday's was the 14th consecutive increase since June 2004 and brought the federal funds rate to 4.5 per cent. Market reaction was muted, as the change to the policy outlook was much as expected. In December, the Fed had altered its policy outlook for the first time during the tightening cycle, dropping the judgment that monetary policy remained accommodative and toning down the signal that further rate increases were pre-programmed. Futures markets suggest a high probability of another rate increase at the first meeting Mr Bernanke will chair, at the end of March. The federal funds rate is now virtually the same as the yield on two-year and 10-year Treasury notes. As well as reflecting expectations that inflation will remain under control, the flat yield curve suggests investors expect the Fed will have to cut the federal funds rate from its peak level by the end of this year. In his 18 1/2 years at the Fed, Mr Greenspan has chaired 155 FOMC meetings, including a small number of emergency meetings, and more than 1,000 meetings of the Federal Reserve board.

913,419.0,2006-02-01,"The end of the Greenspan era at the US Federal Reserve was marked yesterday by a subdued reaction to the tone of the central bank's latest statement on interest rate policy. There were no big surprises for investors to emerge from the last meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee to be overseen by chairman Alan Greenspan after 18 years at the helm of the bank. As Ben Bernanke prepared to take over as Fed chairman today, the central bank raised its benchmark Fed funds interest rate by25 basis points to 4.5 per cent. In the announcement of the rate rise, the Fed also dropped its long-standing reference to the likelihood of further ""measured"" rate increases. But shares on Wall Street eased a little after the announcement on the Fed's statement that ""some further policy firming may be needed to keep the risks to the attainment of both sustainable economic growth and price stability roughly in balance"". ""Core inflation has stayed relatively low in recent months and longer-term inflation expectations remain contained."" Some share investors appeared to have hoped for a more dovish statement with a clearer signal that rate rises were coming to an end. By midday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was0.15 per cent lower, the S&P 500 was 0.43 per cent weaker and the Nasdaq Composite was 0.31 per cent down. US treasuries were largely unchanged while the dollar pared early losses. Ian Shepherdson, chief US economist at High Frequency Economics, said Mr Greenspan ""did not leave behind an entirely blank canvas for Mr Bernanke"". ""The Fed's bias remains on the upside, given 'solid' but 'uneven' data. This is realistic; we think strong data will leave Mr Bernanke with no choice on March 28 (to raise rates at the FOMC's next meeting),"" he said. Mr Shepherdson said the ""best bet"" was still that the Fed would raise rates by 25 basis points at the March meeting and there was a ""real risk of more"". The transition overshadowed news of a rise in US consumer confidence to the highest levels in three years in January and weaker-than-expected manufacturing activity around Chicago. In Europe, the FTSE Eurofirst 300 index rose just 0.05 per cent to 1,319.57 in cautious trade.

914,420.0,2006-02-01,"US Treasury prices dipped and yields rose yesterday after the Federal Open Market Committee raised interest rates and left the door open for at least one more increase. Economists had unanimously predicted the quarter-point rate rise to 4.5 per cent at Alan Greenspan's last meeting as Fed chairman. Instead, their focus was on the wording of the FOMC's statement. The committee removed any reference to the need for further ""measured"" tightening, saying only that additional rate increases ""may be needed"". Analysts said the changes were consistent with giving Ben Bernanke, Mr Greenspan's successor, a free hand. ""The Fed has effectively left the March policy direction to be decided with the inclusion of Bernanke, while suggesting the potential for further rate hike(s),"" said analysts at Briefing.com. Data earlier in the day showed employment costs rising in line with expectations and strong consumer confidence. Shortly after the FOMC statement was released, two-year yields were up 2.1 basis points at 4.532 per cent and 10-year yields were 1.8bp higher at 4.549 per cent. Gilt prices pushed higher and yields lower amid mixed consumer data. UK house prices rose more than expected in January and mortgage approvals in December rose. Confederation of British Industry data suggested retail sales in January were unexpectedly weak. ""The mixed news indicates little chance of an imminent rate change,"" said James Knightley, analyst at ING Financial Markets. David Brown, chief European economist at Bear Stearns, said: ""The message from the weaker than expected CBI retail sales survey for January is lower interest rates in the near future.""

919,425.0,2006-02-01,"Ben Bernanke took over on Wednesday as chairman of the Federal Reserve's board of governors and its policymaking Federal Open Market Committee. He is the 14th chairman since the US central bank's founding in 1913. A smooth transition is expected. Mr Bernanke, who was a Fed governor from 2002 until last summer, when he became chairman of President George W. Bush's Council of Economic Advisers, is a widely respected economist whose broad approach to policymaking is expected to be very similar to that of Alan Greenspan, who stood down on Tuesday. Mr Bernanke took the oath of office in the Fed's office at the start of the day, sworn in by Roger Ferguson, the Fed's vice-chairman. He has a four-year term as chairman and a 14-year term as a member of the board. Mr Greenspan, who chaired his last FOMC meeting on Tuesday, led the Fed for 18l years. Mr Bernanke has stressed the importance of continuity at the Fed - hardly surprising after the strong performance of the economy during his predecessor's long tenure - but also made clear at his confirmation hearings that he remained committed to introducing a more formal definition of the Fed's inflation objective. Rather than a radical change, that commitment can be seen as a continuation of the gradual shift to greater transparency at the Fed that has been gaining pace in recent years. On Tuesday the Fed raised interest rates for the 14th time by a quarter-point to 4.5 per cent. Its accompanying statement further toned down the language on the likelihood of further rate increases, to avoid the appearance of tying Mr Bernanke's hands. The committee noted that inflation pressures remained a concern and it judged that ""some further policy firming may be needed"" to keep growth and inflation in balance. Mr Bernanke will deliver testimony before Congress on February 15 on behalf of the FOMC and update lawmakers on the central bank's outlook, when he presents twice-yearly monetary report to Congress. He will chair his first FOMC meeting at the end of March, at which investors are pricing in a high probability of another quarter-point increase, expected to be the last in the long series of rate increases that started in 2004. However, a number of prominent forecasters expect strong growth in the economy and concerns about inflation to prompt a further rate increase in May. Fed policymakers shrug-ged off the slowdown in the economy in the fourth quarter and expect the it to continue to expand this year at close to its trend rate - commonly put at 3-3.5 per cent - following growth of 3.5 per cent for the whole of 2005. One of the key uncertainties in the outlook is the impact that signs of a slowing housing market might have on consumer spending. Futures market pricing and the flat yield curve suggests that investors expect the Fed to have to cut interest rates from their peak level by the end of this year. One question is whether Mr Bernanke will seek to address such expectations in his testimony in two weeks. In contrast to past tightening cycles, when the Fed was trying to slow the economy below its trend rate to reduce inflation, on this occasion the central bank described its strategy as seeking to return rates to a more normal footing. That objective follows the emergency action taken in the wake of the bursting of the stock market, the September 11 attacks, and other shocks that hit the economy, to keep inflation expectations contained.

Perhaps an implication that the Fed has less bias?.?.?.?and will investigate data that 'may' support additional tightening, or may not,"" said Barbara Rockefeller, president of Rockefeller Treasury Services. The game theorists say Mr Bernanke will have to raise rates at least once more when he chairs his first FOMC meeting on March 28 to establish credibility. Fed funds futures contracts are pricing in a better than even chance of that. Others are not so sure. ""A move at Mr Bernanke's first meeting?.?.?.?will not hinge on his desire to flash his anti-inflation credentials or his need to carry on what Alan Greenspan started,"" said David Rosenberg, North American economist at Merrill Lynch. ""Remember, this is the decision of an entire committee, and it would seem a 'wait and see' consensus has finally been cobbled together."" The debate over future rate increases is intensifying because most economists believe the Fed funds rate is now at or near a level that is neutral, neither stoking growth nor stifling it. That has allowed the FOMC to change its message in recent months, and - coincidentally - to leave Mr Bernanke with a relatively free hand. The flexibility only exists because the FOMC's next move is not obvious. This could mean Mr Bernanke's ability to build a consensus among committee members will be tested early. Whether rates go up again or not, he will have to convince the markets he has done the right thing. His views are documented, but Mr Bernanke's style at the Fed remains to be seen. Ed Yardeni, chief investment officer at Oak Associates in the US, noted the new chairman's background as a Princeton academic: ""That's the sort of job that requires herding rather than leadership skills. Mr Bernanke is likely to be more of a consensus builder than a domineering leader. I don't know if this will be good or bad. It will just be different from what we all are used to."" As for managing the market's expectations, early hints could emerge in a fortnight's time when Mr Bernanke is due to present the Fed's twice-yearly monetary policy report to the US Congress for the first time. The new Fed chairman is known to favour transparency in policymaking. But Mr Rosenberg at Merrill Lynch doubts that the Fed would make its thinking completely clear, even if it were inclined to hold rates steady. ""Bottom line as Fed policymaker is that you don't lay down your cards all at once,"" he said. ""The threat of another tightening is there, but not necessarily at the next meeting."" Maintaining the Fed's inflation-beating credibility will be a priority. Market confidence in the US central bank has helped damp volatility, keep longer-term bond yields low and shrink risk premiums on investments in equity and debt in the US and further afield. Kingsmill Bond, head of global emerging markets strategy at Deutsche Bank, sees no reason for that to change. ""Only time will tell, but the gradual increase in Fed Funds rates and low long-term yields have kept the external environment very supportive for emerging markets,"" he said. ""With the US economic growth outlook still solid, we see little risk of a marked change in this scenario under a Bernanke-led Fed.""

921,427.0,2006-02-01,"The US dollar rose on Wednesday as the market concluded that Tuesday's Federal Reserve statement increased the probability of a March interest rate increase. As expected, the Federal Open Market Committee raised US rates by a quarter of a point for the fourteenth consecutive meeting, taking rates to 4.5 per cent. The accompanying statement said that further tightening ""may be needed"". Although this was softer language than the phrase ""is likely to be needed"" that featured in the FOMC's December statement, the wording was taken to mean that the committee was minded to put into effect a further rate rise in March. The futures market is pricing in an 84 per cent probability of such an outcome. ""The new wording still implies a bias towards further tightening,"" said Paul Ashworth, economist at Capital Economics, although he still expected a housing-led slowdown to send rates sliding to 3 per cent by the end of 2007. Derek Halpenny, senior currency economist at Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ, was more hawkish: ""The FOMC erred on the side of tightening. We expect incoming economic data to justify not one but two 0.25 point increases before the FOMC decides to pause."" The dollar rose as high as $1.2075 to the euro, a cent above its level prior to the FOMC statement. However, the gains were pared on the release of soft US economic data. A slide in pending home sales in December to the lowest levels in two years allied to weak mortgage approvals revived fears over the state of the housing sector. The Institute for Supply Management's manufacturing index managed to combine a weaker headline reading with rising inflationary pressures, echoing last week's gross domestic product data. ""The cracks are starting to appear. Inflation numbers are a little bit on the high side but activity data is starting to show some weakness,"" said Ian Stannard, currency strategist at BNP Paribas. Mr Stannard believes the data remain consistent with one more rate rise, but he forecasts a cut by the end of the year, a view starting to be factored into the futures market. The dollar slipped back to $1.2087 to the euro by mid-session in New York trade and sat at Y117.92 to the yen, a gain of 0.9 per cent since the FOMC statement, and $1.7780 against sterling, a rise of 0.3 per cent. Sterling exhibited broad strength, rising 0.5 per cent to GBP0.6797 to the euro and 0.5 per cent to Y209.65 against the yen, a seven-week high. The pound was supported by talk of sterling-positive merger and acquisition flows, with Lloyds TSB and Unilever reportedly on the block, as well as a solid manufacturing survey. The Canadian dollar remained firm at C$1.1406 to the greenback, within 0.3 cents of the 14-year high it set late on Tuesday. With speculative positioning still unstretched, Mitul Kotecha, global head of FX strategy at Calyon, suggested the loonie, which has risen alongside commodity prices and Toronto's buoyant equity market, ""may continue to push higher over the short term"". He said the currency had outperformed weak natural gas prices in recent weeks, breaking a correlation that existed in 2005. ""With potential for some catch-up with the drop in natural gas prices, the Canadian dollar will look increasingly vulnerable over coming weeks."" The South Korean won hit another eight-year high of won957.3 to the dollar, despite a pull-back in Seoul's equity market, before slipping to won962 amid suspected central bank intervention.

However most attention was on the accompanying statement, which said further tightening ""may be needed"". Although this was softer language than the phrase ""is likely to be needed"" that figured in the FOMC's December statement, the wording was taken as suggesting that the committee is minded to implement one further rate rise in March, with the futures market pricing in an 80 per cent probability of such an outcome, compared to 75 per cent prior to the statement.

With speculative positioning still unstretched, Mitul Kotecha, global head of FX strategy at Calyon, suggested the Canadian dollar, which has risen alongside commodity prices and Toronto's buoyant equity market, ""may continue to push higher over the short term"". However Mr Kotecha saw the loonie looking more vulnerable in the weeks ahead. ""One of the biggest drivers of the Canadian dollar over 2005 was natural gas prices, but the correlation with the currency has effectively collapsed over recent weeks, saving it from the negative influence of the sharp fall in natural gas prices recently,"" he said. ""With potential for some catch up with the drop in natural gas prices, the Canadian dollar will look increasingly vulnerable over coming weeks."" Elsewhere sterling made some gains on Wednesday as the UK's manufacturing purchasing managers' index ticked up from 51.3 in December to 51.7 in January, better than expected. Employment growth fell below the 50 break-even level, but rising output prices hinted at inflationary pressures, reducing the scope for looser monetary policy. In contrast, the equivalent measure for the eurozone missed expectations, dipping a fraction from December's reading. As such, the pound firmed 0.25p to GBP0.6809 against the euro and Y0.2 to Y208.75 against the yen. The South Korean won hit yet another eight-year high of Won957.3 to the dollar, despite a pullback in Seoul's equity market, before slipping back to Won962 amid suspected central bank intervention. Hans Redeker, head of currency strategy at BNP Paribas, said a 0.8 per cent month-on-month rise in consumer prices in January ""suggests that the central bank will remain focused on inflation, suggesting rates will move up keeping the won supported.

926,432.0,2009-12-17,"There remain plenty of investors who worry about inflation, not least those still buying gold. However, it is one risk Ben Bernanke and fellow members of the US policy-making Federal Open Market Committee are not concerned about. Statements from the FOMC's monthly meetings have stressed ""subdued inflation"" more than once. Certainly the current inflation picture does not contain much to worry about. The US Consumer Price Index in November rose 0.4 per cent from the previous month. The comparisons with a year ago are not meaningful because those include the effects of a plunge in oil prices (remember, oil fell from more than $145 a barrel in July 2008 to less than $35 a barrel by December). Core CPI - which strips out energy costs - did not rise at all in November in the US. The rises in the overall headline figure largely reflect the higher oil and other energy prices. The cost of oil will be a key factor to watch next year. There can be no doubt that central bankers are eyeballing it too. Indeed, it is likely that the recent halt of oil's rally at around $70 per barrel has come as a relief. For, in the same way that a rise in long-term interest rates can choke off a recovery because it makes it more difficult or expensive for companies to obtain credit and fund their businesses, high oil prices and the resultant higher costs of transportation as gasoline costs rise can dampen economic growth. In 2008, oil prices continued to surge even as economies were slowing down and there has continued to be a debate about just how much of that was due to speculators. There are plenty of signs that speculative pressures are less now than they were. Nevertheless, another huge run up in oil cannot be ruled out. Even as core inflation remains benign, fragile economies can be knocked back by various type of price surges, oil being one of them.

927,433.0,2009-12-17,"The dollar was the chief beneficiary of a sharp spike in risk aversion Thursday as the markets digested Wednesday's policy statement from the Federal Reserve. Adding to the uncertain mood were fresh concerns about the eurozone periphery following another downgrade to Greece's sovereign debt rating. The US currency climbed to a three-month high against the euro and gained ground against most other leading currencies after the US central bank offered a more upbeat assessment of economic conditions. But some strategists were sceptical that the dollar's strength was a reflection of investors bringing forward US interest rate expectations, pointing instead to technical buying related to extended short positions. US rate futures implied a 58 per cent chance that the Fed would raise its target by 25 basis points by the middle of next year compared with 48 per cent immediately after the FOMC statement. But analysts also noted that the three-month dollar London interbank rate had been set at a record low of 0.254 per cent. Dan Greenhaus, chief economic strategist at Miller Tabak, pointed out that credit markets were of crucial importance in gauging expectations of a US interest rate rise. ""In the last tightening cycle, the first rate hike did not occur until June 2004 but Libor began moving higher two full months earlier,"" he said. ""Keeping an eye on this market can only serve one well when gauging market expectations pertaining to a hike."" Lena Komileva, head of G7 market economics at Tullett Prebon, said the important element of the statement was that it highlighted the distinction between the Fed's rate and quantitative easing policies and signalled a cautious move towards an exit strategy. ""Ultimately, the Fed's liquidity exit strategy is determined by liquidity conditions in the financial system and the functioning of core markets of systemic importance, not by the traditional macro policy assessment,"" she said. ""Based on the strength of the economy and the prospects for inflation, the Fed is still a long way away from asset sales and conventional rate hikes."" US government bonds showed few signs of concern about a Fed rate rise following the US central bank's pledge to keep rates ""exceptionally low"" for an ""extended period"". The yield on the 10-year Treasury tumbled 11bp to 3.48 per cent while the two-year yield fell 8bp to 0.75 per cent, keeping the spread between the two maturities just below the record 276bp that was struck on Wednesday. Three-month T-Bill yields hovered near 2009 lows. By contrast, the yield on Greece's 10-year bond jumped as much as 30bp before easing back to stand 19bp higher at 5.69 per cent, with the premium over German Bunds widening 24bp to 256bp. Late on Wednesday, Standard & Poor's cut the country's long-term sovereign rating from A minus to triple B plus and warned of possible further action. Rival agency Fitch downgraded Greece this month. ""While the impact of what the economy of Greece contributes to the eurozone is relatively tiny at around 3-4 per cent, there is still a monetary relationship between Frankfurt and Athens,"" said Andrew Wilkinson, senior market analyst at Interactive Brokers. ""The association is causing international investors concern and fans the embers of the argument that the eurozone might fall apart at the first signs of economic crisis.""

928,434.0,2005-02-03,"The Federal Reserve raised interest rates by a quarter point to 2.5 per cent yesterday and signalled no change in its outlook. The policymaking Federal Open Market Committee left its accompanying statement virtually unchanged from its December meeting. It said that even after yesterday's rate increase, ""the stance of monetary policy remains accommodative"" and repeated that it expects to continue raising rates ""at a pace that is likely to be measured"". Yesterday's decision was widely expected and there was little financial market reaction. Alan Greenspan, Fed chairman, will give his twice-yearly testimony before Congress on behalf of the FOMC on February 16 and 17, in which he will update the committee's views. The central bank has made very clear that it expects to continue raising rates to a more neutral level. Investors are pricing in a 3.5 per cent federal funds rate at the end of the year. Federal Reserve policy-makers are increasingly confident that the US economy has entered a self-sustaining phase of above-trend growth. In spite of some upside risks, inflation pressures are seen as well contained. The economy grew by 4.4 per cent last year although growth in the fourth quarter was slower than expected, at a 3.1 per cent rate on the government's advance estimate. But this reflected the drag of the trade deficit: net exports subtracted 1.7 percentage points from the growth rate at the end of the year. Risks associated with the large US current account and fiscal deficits, and the possibility of a destabilising financial market reaction, are a matter for concern at the Fed, but those deficits are not a direct target of central bank policy. Long-term interest rates are lower now than when the Fed started its tightening cycle last summer. While the dollar has weakened over the past two-and-a -half years, there were only limited signs of this feeding into inflation. The Fed's preferred measure of inflation - the core personal consumption expenditures (PCE) index, which excludes food and energy items - rose by 1.5 per cent in the 12 months to December, down from 1.6 per cent in November. That is right in the middle of the presumed Fed comfort range of 1-2 per cent for the core PCE index. The special subjects of the two-day meeting were the pros and cons of introducing a formal inflation objective. A guide to that discussion will be available when the meeting's minutes are released in three weeks. Mr Greenspan may give a preview in his testimony, or other Fed policymakers in their public appearances. The central bank is keen that the policy statement that accompanies rate decisions remains the chief communication tool, rather than the minutes, which are seen as a less reliable guide. FOMC members are broadly comfortable with the pace of future rate increases being priced in by the market, and there are concerns that the uncertain outlook for productivity growth makes it difficult for the central bank to forecast the inflation outlook.

929,435.0,2005-02-03,"The US dollar moved higher on Thursday, although why it did so was less clear. Most analysts and traders cited the improving yield differential of the US, with the European Central Bank on Thursday holding its key repo rate at 2 per cent just a day after the Federal Reserve sanctioned a 25-basis point rise to 2.5 per cent. Yet no one should have been unduly surprised by these developments, or indeed the simultaneous clues as to the future direction of monetary policy. The Federal Open Market Committee's universally expected hike was accompanied by a near identical statement to that given after December's meeting. ""The statement was a virtual copy of its predecessor,"" said Neil Mellor at Bank of New York. Likewise the 20th straight month of inaction from the ECB came as no surprise, while some viewed the subsequent comments of Jean-Claude Trichet, the president of the ECB, as more hawkish than expected. Sean Callow, currency strategist at IdeaGlobal, took such a view, alluding to Mr Trichet's comments about a pick-up in loan growth. ""The impression is of a slightly more hawkish stance from the ECB,"" he said. Others saw Mr Trichet's comment that inflation is likely to fall below the ECB's 2 per cent target later this year as a dovish signal, although it is a message that has been delivered before. ""ECB rate hike expectations are likely to be priced out,"" said Tania Kotsos, forex strategist at RBC Capital Markets. ""With rate rises expected at the next three FOMC meetings, the yield gap is likely to be 125 basis points by the end of June."" Steven Englander, chief FX strategist at Barclays Capital, sees this as crucial. ""For lack of alternative themes and in the absence of inflation pressures, markets continue to buy yield,"" he said. Mr Englander's number-crunching suggests average 10-year bond spreads between the three highest yielding G10 currencies (Australia and New Zealand dollars and sterling) and the three lowest yielders (yen, euro and Swiss franc) have widened by 15 basis points since January 17, with the high-yielding currencies appreciating by 2.75 per cent, on average. With such sentiment to the fore, the US dollar rose 0.6 per cent to $1.2956 to the euro, approaching its strongest levels since November, 0.9 per cent to Y104.64 against the yen and 0.3 per cent to $1.8794 against sterling. A 2 per cent jump to R6.1213 against the rand was a particularly attributable to the yield argument, amid hints that South African interest rates could be cut once again. Sterling was buoyed by firm data, with the UK service sector purchasing managers' index rising to 55.9 in January, a point above December's level, and the Halifax house price index showing a 0.8 per cent rise in house prices in January. ""This report will be seized upon by those predicting a soft landing for the housing market and will certainly reinforce growing expectations that an early cut in interest rates is unlikely,"" said Ed Stansfield at Capital Economics. This allowed the pound to firm 0.7 per cent to Y196.66 against the yen and 0.5 per cent to SFr against the Swiss franc. The Polish zloty pushed through the 4-zloty barrier to the euro for the first time since January 2003, its move to 3.9721 cementing a rise of 2 per cent in two days. The move was largely propelled by Wednesday's admission from Jerzy Hausner, the Polish economy minister, that his government's ability to control the exchange rate was limited. This led to speculative flows into the zloty, with traders eyeing what appeared to be a one-way bet. Mr Hausner on Thursday called for a rate cut to stem zloty strength. However RBC's Ms Kotsos speculated Miroslaw Gronicki, the finance minister, would be willing to see the zloty rise to 3.8 to the euro.

The Federal Open Market Committee's widely anticipated decision to raise the federal funds rate by 25 basis points to 2.5 per cent was accompanied by a near identical statement to that proffered after December's meeting.

""Bush's commitment to eliminate more than 140 government programmes and limit spending growth for other programmes to the rate of inflation provided little new information."" Mr Redeker also argued that the president's mention of diplomacy towards both Iran and North Korea kept risk aversion in check. There were some dissenters from this view, with Monica Fan, global head of forex strategy at RBC Capital Markets, arguing that the address was bearish for the dollar. Ms Fan pointed to a warning that the social security budget is heading for ""bankruptcy"" and fears that military spending will remain high as ""Iran and Syria have moved to the centre of the US government's attention."" But with most of the market drawing little impetus from these events, and traders wary of increasing their exposure ahead of Friday, which brings US non-farm payroll data, a speech from Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, on the US current account deficit and the start of the meeting of the G7, major currencies were little moved. As a result the dollar was little changed at $1.3020 against the euro and Y103.95 versus the yen, although it did fall 0.3c to $1.8876 against sterling. The pound was buoyed by firm data releases, with the UK service sector purchasing managers' index rising to 55.9 in January, a point above December's level. Furthermore, the Halifax house price index showed a seasonally-adjusted 0.8 per cent rise in house prices in January, backing the findings of the rival Nationwide survey, which also showed a pick-up in January. ""The report will be seized upon by those predicting a soft landing for the housing market and will certainly reinforce growing expectations that an early cut in interest rates is unlikely,"" said Ed Stansfield, property economist at Capital Economics. Sterling firmed 0.2p to GBP0.6898 against the euro and Y0.9 to Y196.17 versus the yen. Elsewhere, the Polish zloty pushed through the 4-zloty barrier to the euro for the first time since January 2003, its move to 3.9834 zlotys cementing a rise of around 1.75 per cent in less than two days. The move was largely propelled by Wednesday's admission from Jerzy Hausner, the Polish economy minister, that his government's ability to control the exchange rate was limited and that the zloty might therefore strengthen further. This led to further speculative flows into the zloty, with traders eyeing what appeared to be a one-way bet. ""Mr Hausner has achieved exactly the opposite of what he would be happy with,"" said Elisabeth Gruie, forex strategist at BNP. The zloty held onto its gains despite Mr Hausner saying on Thursday that he expected the central bank to alter monetary policy to stem zloty strength.

The late rally in futures fuelled strong buying of the underling FT-SE 100 Index ahead of the close of the stock market, writes Joel Kibazo. The June contract on the FT-SE 100 closed at 3,211, which was about 2 points ahead of its fair value premium to cash of 10 points, with the strong finish attributed to a late advance in UK gilts. Volume at the official close was 10,275 lots. Bonds had also been firmer earlier in the day when June opened at 3,208, and good buying drove the contract to the day's peak of 3,229. However, a bout of nervous trading ahead of the US Federal Open Market Committee meeting saw June surrender early gains and it fell to a low of 3,183 in the early afternoon. In Liffe FT-SE Mid-250, June traded 97 contracts and it closed at 3,850. The screen showed no turnover in the same contract on the OMLX. In Liffe traded options, turnover improved to 43,697 contracts ahead of today's expiry of the March stock options. Volume in the FT-SE 100 option was 17,973 lots and 2,594 in the Euro FT-SE option.

932,438.0,1994-03-23,"US Treasury bond prices jumped yesterday afternoon amid relief that the Federal Reserve had ended weeks of anticipation by signalling a small increase in short-term interest rates. Late in the session, the benchmark 30-year government bond was 1 1/32 higher at 92 11/32, with the yield easing by about 10 basis points to 6.853%. At the short end, the two-year note was 7/32 better at 99 11/32, to yield 4.948%. The rally, especially at the short end of the yield curve, was surprising. It suggested that the market had already factored a rate increase into bond prices. News of the move came in a mid-afternoon announcement by the Fed that its policy-making Federal Open Market Committee had decided to increase 'slightly' reserves in the banking system. Analysts interpreted the statement as an indication that the FOMC had voted to lift its target for the Federal Funds rate by 25 basis points to 3.50%. Early on, bond traders were content to remain on the sidelines until the Fed made clear its intentions. Prices across the yield curve were showing moderate improvement in light trading before the announcement. The reaction to the Fed's decision was immediate. Institutional investors poured money into the market, suggesting that yields, after moving markedly higher over the past few weeks, were attractive at current levels. The results of the Treasury's auction of $17bn in new two-year notes suggested as much. The offering, which was awarded at 5.15% only minutes before the Fed's move, drew good demand even though confusion over monetary policy still reigned. European government bond markets pared their gains yesterday afternoon following early indications that the US Fed might leave monetary policy unchanged. Analysts had been surprised by the Fed's lack of action in the morning session, since most traders had expected it to sanction a rise of a quarter-point in the Fed funds rate to 3.5%. The lack of a morning move by the Fed extended the markets' long vigil for evidence that European bonds were in the process of de-coupling from the US market. Analysts said that if the Fed had left monetary policy unchanged, it would have been easier for the Bundesbank to cut its repo rate today. The market had expected the Bundesbank to lower the rate by up to eight basis points from 5.88%. UK gilts generally outperformed other European government bond markets, supported by hopes of favourable inflation data for February due to be released today. The market expects a monthly rise of 0.4% in the retail prices index, bringing the annual rate, excluding mortgages, down to 2.6% from 2.8% in January. Media reports of a Gallup poll showing consumer confidence at a four-year low also supported gilt prices since the findings kept hopes of a further cut in interest rates alive. The June long gilt future on Liffe traded at 109 in the late afternoon, up 17/32 on the day, off the day's high of 109 31/32 but well up on the worst level of 109 5/32. Analysts expressed disappointment at the size of the Bank of England's first floating-rate gilt for 15 years. They had been confident that the novelty value of the issue would encourage the Bank to set the amount at between #3bn to #3.5bn. However, the Bank chose to raise only #2.5bn, indicating to the market that it was comfortable with its funding programme. The other terms of the issue were in line with market expectations - a minimum price of 99.50, a coupon of three-month Libid less 1/8 point and a five-year maturity. German government bond prices see-sawed after news of the Fed's inaction. The June bund future on Liffe stood just under a half-point higher at 96.45 in the late afternoon, below the day's high of 96.60 but off the low of 95.84. (c) The Financial Times Limited 1994.

933,439.0,1994-03-23,"The US Federal Reserve yesterday confirmed US interest rates are on a gradual upward path when it tightened monetary policy for the second time in two months, writes Philip Gawith. The Fed did not specify the extent of the move, but it was taken for granted in the market that the announcement involves a 25 basis points increase in the federal funds rate, to 3.50%. This follows a similar rise to 3.25% on February 4th. The tightening had been largely discounted in the market and there was little reaction. The dollar rose just over half a pfennig to trade at DM 1.6870 from DM 1.68 before the announcement. It was little changed against the yen hovering at the Y 106 level. Mr Alan Greenspan, chairman, said the Fed's policy-making Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) had decided to increase pressure on bank reserves in order to raise interest rates. 'This action is expected to be associated with a small increase in short-term money market interest rates,' said Mr Greenspan. The announcement was made after the FOMC meeting at 19h20 GMT. Attention will now switch to the Bundesbank which is today expected to announce a further cut in its repo rate. The combination of a rise in US rates and a lowering of German rates could well give the dollar a significant upward lift. In the UK, meanwhile, the release of the February retail price index is keenly awaited. Some observers believe a good number could trigger a cut in interest rates, but this is a minority view. Mr Steve Hannah, head of research at IBJ International, said the Fed's action 'confirms that Greenspan is still in a gradualist mode. The strong implication is that it is a 25 basis point increase in the fed funds rate, not an increase in the (more significant) discount rate.' Mr Hannah said the nature of the Fed's move also 'adds a degree of predictability about the timing of Fed interest rate moves. This could help the markets to settle down a bit.' The February 4th tightening - the first increase in US rates in five years - sent financial markets into turmoil with bond yields rising sharply in all western countries. For the second time in a row the central bank acted after an FOMC meeting, in the process also showing that it was not responding to specific economic data. The IBJ analyst described the Fed's move as 'not so much tightening as normalising on a gradualist path.' Mr Greenspan made clear in February that he felt real interest rates had fallen to abnormally low levels. The timing of the move caught the market slightly off-guard. Earlier in the day the Fed had, in its normal open market operations, added reserves with two-day system repos which suggested no change in monetary policy. This led many to believe that the Fed would not act until today. The dollar continues to be wrapped in bearish sentiment. With last night's Fed tightening already in the market, one view was that the fate of the dollar was more in the hands of the Bundesbank than the Fed. Mr Avinash Persaud, head of currency research at JP Morgan (Europe), commented: 'What really matters is if the Fed can tighten in tandem with a Bundesbank move. That is the only thing that will lend significance to a 25 basis point Fed tightening.' Ahead of the Fed announcement, the D-Mark was firmer across the board in Europe. It closed at FFr 3.418 from FFr 3.407 on Monday against the French franc. Analysts warned that if the Bundesbank did not quicken the pace of monetary easing, the steady weakening over the past week of the franc could continue. The Bundesbank announced it was holding another variable rate repo. The lowest bid accepted last week was 5.88%, a reduction of six basis points in the repo rate. Analysts are predicting a fall of up to ten basis points. Overnight rates firmed slightly, from 5.70/5.80% to 5.80/5.90 ahead of the repo, but analysts doubted whether this would have any adverse effect. Ms Phyllis Reed, European bond strategist at BZW, noted that the mid-point of the overnight rate was still below the repo rate and this normally favoured a larger drop in the repo rate. 'Banks tend to be quite ambitious on the bidding,' she said. Last week the overnight rate fell to the repo rate level only at the time of the auction. Sterling finished more than a pfennig weaker against the D-Mark, closing in London at DM 2.5094 from DM 2.5205. Traders said the UK currency was being affected by speculation about an interest rate cut. Mr Robin Marshall, chief economist at Chase Manhattan, warned there was a danger of a rate cut backfiring. If it upsets the gilts market, this will put upward pressure on mortgage rates. In the discount market the Bank of England dispatched a shortage of #750m without difficulty. Sterling futures firmed slightly with the June contract a basis point up at 94.85. (c) The Financial Times Limited 1994. ",MARKETS REPORT - FED LIFTS INTEREST RATES.,1994-03-22,The Financial Times
934,440.0,1994-03-23,"European equity markets marked time yesterday in advance of the decision by the US Federal Reserve's policy-making body, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), to raise the federal funds rate by from 3.25 to 3.50%, as they watched for clues from Washington. Before the close of trading on European bourses the only guidance available was that the committee was still reviewing economic conditions and had not yet discussed the direction it wanted to set for interest rates over the coming eight-week period. FRANKFURT consolidated its position with a day's gain in the Dax index of 10.06 to 2,141.34, but off from the session high of 2,155.31. Traders said that a weakening in the futures market contributed to the easing. Turnover was modest at DM 7.6bn. The banking sector attracted attention with further results due out in the next couple of weeks. James Capel, in a research note issued on Monday, noted that its forecasts for 1994-95 had been shaded down for two main reasons. It said: 'We have probably been too optimistic for the pace of recovery in terms of lending growth and falling bad debts.' The note added: 'This years trading profits have been adversely affected by the markets' reaction to the trend reversal in US interest rates'. Bayerishe Hypo, which pleased the market with results yesterday, added DM 1.50 to DM 469, while Bayerishe Vereinsbank, results due later this week, gained DM 2 to DM 491. Volkswagen, up DM 3.50 at DM 490.50, strengthened on hopes of good 1993 figures due tomorrow. ZURICH finished higher as domestic institutional buyers returned at current lower prices but the day's best levels were not maintained. The SMI index rose 20.4 to 2,824.7, after a high of 2,843.3. Ciba registered rose SwFr 40 to SwFr 855: the company has filed an application with the US Food and Drug Administration to produce a rival to Glaxo's Zantac anti-ulcer drug. Nestle, with results due this week put on SwFr 21 to SwFr 1,241. Sandoz, with results scheduled for tomorrow, rose SwFr 50 to SwFr 3,920 amid suggestions that the introduction of its Lescol cholesterol drug could spark a price war in the US. Georg Fischer rose SwFr 50 to SwFr 1,310: the mechanical engineering group said it expected to break even in this year after a 1993 loss of SwFr 34m. Holderbank rose SwFr 3 to SwFr 963 in response to its 12.3% rise in 1993 net profit. PARIS fell back from its session high in a volatile session, the CAC-40 index finally closing down 2.01 at 2,200.68. The index moved between a high of 2,222.52 and a low of 2,196.12. BNP, which the government said would have its stake in UAP cut from 19% to 15% as part of the insurers privatisation, lost FFr 2.70 to FFr 251.80. UAP was unchanged at FFr 189.90. AMSTERDAM drifted down, with the AEX index losing 1.91 to 414.33. Pakhoed, the storage and transport group, which repeated its forecast that 1994 earnings per share were set to rise, lost Fl 1.50 to Fl 53.80. In a separate development PTT, the Dutch post and telephone utility, announced that its first tranche of shares could be floated on June 7. MILAN was steady, helped by the positive early tone in other European markets and having found technical support at Monday's lower levels. The Comit index edged 0.34 lower to 664.68 as election uncertainties remained at the centre of attention. Industrials led the way. Fiat rose L61 to L4,999, Pirelli L58 to L2,431 and Montedison L43 to L1,238. Olivetti put on L65 to L2,593 as hopes remained high for a swift decision on Italy's second mobile telephone licence. ISTANBUL fell 4.8%, wiping out Monday's gains, in uncertain trade ahead of Monday's local elections. The composite index lost 747.76 to 14,838. The elections are viewed as a key test of whether Prime Minister Tansu Ciller's coalition government can be trusted to tackle the looming economic crisis. Analysts agree that the election will be followed by sharp price rises as the government relaxes restraints on loss making state run companies, but observers are divided on what effect the polls will have on financial markets, hit by a plunging lira and soaring interest rates.

935,441.0,1994-03-23,"Wall Street US stocks reacted with relative calm yesterday to a signal by the Federal Reserve that it had decided to nudge up short-term interest rates, writes Frank McGurty in New York. The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished 2.30 lower to 3,862.55, after jumping about seven points on the Fed's announcement that its policy-making committee had voted to add reserves to the banking system. Analysts said the statement was an indication that the central bank was lifting its target for the federal funds rate for the second time in two months. Other important market indices also showed little change on the day, defying forecasts of a sharp downturn on the news of a rate increase. The more broadly based Standard and Poor's 500 was 0.26 better at 468.80, while the American SE composite inched 0.96 ahead to 471.73. The Nasdaq composite slipped 0.95 to 796.35. NYSE volume, at 282m shares, was moderate. Advancing issues led declines, 1,015 to 929. Investors were tentative as the market opened, as attention was fixed on a policy meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee in Washington. Most analysts were expecting the members of FOMC to vote for a further tightening. But the morning brought no indication of a shift to tighter money, and blue-chip stocks, in parallel with bonds, moved moderately higher in early trading. The Fed's announcement finally came during the mid-afternoon and the reaction was immediate. In the bond market, prices across the yield curve jumped amid relief that the long-anticipated Fed action had finally come to pass. Stocks also improved, but the upturn was more modest and short-lived. By the close, the Dow industrials were barely changed on the day. Among individual issues, Alcoa added $1 1/2 to $78 3/8 and Disney was up $5/8 to $46 3/4, but Philip Morris lost $1 7/8 to $52 1/8 on news of a congressional recommendation to raise federal taxes on cigarettes. In pharmaceuticals, Merck dropped $1 5/8 to $30 1/2 on reports that its cholesterol-reducing drug would soon face competition from a cheaper product from Sandoz. Bristol-Myers Squibb, down $1 1/2 to $53 1/8, was also hit hard by the news.

936,442.0,1994-03-23,"A highly-charged session saw the UK stock market struggle to hold on to the 3,200 mark on the FT-SE Index as it closed just ahead of the US Federal Reserve's decision to signal a modest rise in short-term interest rates. In mid-afternoon, the London stock market plunged sharply to a new trading low for the year of 3,186.9 in the face of a sell-off in stock index futures. The market was dominated throughout the day by the prospects for the meeting of the Federal Reserve's Open Market Committee (FOMC). London closed a few minutes ahead of the Federal Reserve's actions in the US money markets, and UK analysts were left to ponder the implications overnight. The session opened strongly, with UK government bonds leading equities ahead and interest rate confidence heartened in Europe by the Bundesbank announcement of another variable rate money market repos tender today. UK company news also continued to help sentiment, as Prudential, the UK life and general insurance group, joined the list of leading British companies to increase its dividend payment; but the Prudential share price became a casualty of the market setback later in the day. Although trading volume was unimpressive at this stage, the Footsie climbed by more than 22 points and the market appeared confident in spite of the uncertainty ahead of the FOMC meeting. But the stock market was halted in its tracks and then driven sharply downwards when the June futures contract on the Footsie ran into trouble. Although selling of the contract, still in its early days, was not heavy, the price quickly fell through the 3,200 mark and took the underlying stock market with it. Traders suspected that futures selling came from securities houses suddenly nervous ahead of the FOMC meeting. The stock market fell into important support territory before rallying, once again taking its lead from the stock index futures sector. Concern was expressed at the evident power of derivatives markets to influence the underlying stock market. In part, this reflected the lack of volume and nervousness in equities while bond markets remain so fickle. The FT-SE Index struggled back into positive territory to close at 3,201.5, a net gain of 3.5 on the day. London traders were then left on the sidelines to watch the response of the US credit markets to the Federal Reserve's actions which, it was then clear, were likely to lead to an early tightening in credit policies in the US. The FT-SE Mid 250 Index followed the market trend, ending the day with a loss of 1.4 at 3,853.1. Seaq volume picked up in the second half of the session to record a total of 678m shares, a third higher than on Monday, when retail business in equities was worth #1.19bn. The retail number, the most significant guide to genuine investment activity in the stock market, was at the lower end of daily averages for the past twelve months. While some Far Eastern stocks rebounded strongly behind the 4% upturn in the Hong Kong market, the rest of the UK market was unable to escape from the shadow cast ahead of the FOMC meeting. The erratic performance from bond markets over the past week has underlined the dependence of equities on the interest rate drama currently being acted out in Europe and the US.

937,443.0,2003-08-13,"Bond market reaction to the US Federal Reserve's latest interest rate announcement was mixed on Wednesday, with yields on short-dated European government bonds down but the long end of the curve up. The Fed, as expected, kept US rates steady at 1 per cent but indicated that it would keep rates low for a lengthy period to boost a recovery in the economy. Appearing to address recent volatility in the Treasury market, the Fed added that the risk of continued low inflation remained. Bond yields shot up following the Fed's meeting in late June because the central bank appeared to play down the threat of deflation it had previously raised. The Fed said that: ""The [Federal Open Market] Committee judges that, on balance, the risk of inflation becoming undesirably low is likely to be the predominant concern for the foreseeable future."" If the Fed wanted to steer market rates low, the statement did not appear to be an immediate success. Short-dated yields, which are more sensitive to interest rate expectations, fell on the prospect that rates would stay low for a protracted period. But long-dated rates, which are important for the huge mortgage market, and thus the wider economy, rose. European markets on Wednesday tracked the initial reaction in the Treasuries. Two-year German Schatz yields fell 1.2 basis point to 2.482 per cent, but 10-year Bund yields added 4.3bp at 4.115 per cent. Meanwhile, yields on all benchmark Treasury bonds were up. On the gilt market, yields on short-dated paper fell following the release of an unexpectedly dovish quarterly inflation report from the Bank of England. ""The overall risks to growth, and to a lesser extent, inflation are on the downside,"" the BoE said. The economy was likely to return to its trend rate of growth over the next couple of years, based on the assumption that interest rates would be maintained at their current level of 3.5 per cent, the Bank said. It added that inflation would drop back over the next year before edging back up above its 2.5 per cent target in about two years' time. Two-year gilt yields were 3bp lower at 3.953 per cent, while 10-year yields added 3bp at 4.449 per cent. ",Fed decision leaves bonds mixed.,2003-08-12,The Financial Times
938,444.0,2003-08-13,"The Federal Open Market Committee made an effort to improve its communications following recent bond market volatility. As well as reiterating that the risks to growth are balanced and that the risks of inflation/ disinflation are skewed towards the latter, the statement added: ""In these circumstances, the committee believes that policy accommodation can be maintained for a considerable period."" Above-trend growth will not automatically trigger pre-emptive tightening. The FOMC statement is a little more upbeat on growth and a little more downbeat on the labour market than in June. For Kremlinologists, the Fed substituted the risk of ""an unwelcome fall in inflation"" for last time's ""an unwelcome substantial fall in inflation"" - perhaps in an attempt to reassure bond investors after the recent rise in yields. The result of a balanced growth outlook and the preponderance of disinflation over inflation risks is that ""the committee judges that, on balance, the risk of inflation becoming undesirably low is likely to be the predominant concern for the foreseeable future"". What is a reasonable interpretation of the foreseeable future? In July's monetary policy report to Congress the FOMC published forecasts for 2003 and 2004, including inflation falling over the forecast horizon in spite of above-trend growth next year. The futures market has been pricing in an interest rate increase next spring. The Fed has sent a message. However, the reliance on wordplay rather than numbers - in the absence of a numerical range for what the FOMC regards as price stability - means the rules of the guessing game are imprecise.

939,445.0,2003-08-13,"Equity markets in the US and Europe showed little appetite for action yesterday ahead of the outcome of the Federal Open Market Committee's interest rate decision. Confirmation that key rates would remain unchanged at their current 45-year lows was expected although its warning that the risks of an unwelcome fall in inflation exceeded the risks of a pick-up provided a morsel of red meat for the markets to digest. Shortly after the Fed's announcement, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was flat. The tech-rich Nasdaq Composite, which on Monday snapped a six-session losing streak after upbeat investment calls on software companies, put on another 0.4 per cent. Attention will now turn to a raft of economic data due later in the week for clues on the outlook, including retail sales, consumer prices, industrial production and consumer confidence. European markets were higher for a fourth consecutive session but activity was light before the Fed's statement and with many investors away for August holidays. In early evening trade, the FTSE Eurotop 300 index was 0.7 per cent higher at 878.07. The run-up has taken the benchmark of Europe's largest companies to within 1 per cent of its highest level for seven months. Tokyo added to Monday's strong gains, helped by better-than-expected gross domestic product data. Japan's economy expanded 0.6 per cent in real terms in the April-June period for the sixth straight quarterly increase, above the 0.2-0.3 per cent consensus growth forecast for the quarter. Institutional fund managers expect worldwide bond yields to rise although they have not adopted an appreciably more optimistic view of the global economy, according to Merrill Lynch's influential fund managers' survey for August. A growing minority of fund managers viewed the monetary policies of the leading economies to be too stimulative and more managers expected the next move in the Federal Funds rate to be up than down. This view resulted in one of the most widespread underweightings of bonds that the survey has recorded. London Edition 1.

940,446.0,2002-05-08,"US government bonds rose yesterday after the Federal Reserve kept interest rates unchanged and said the pace of economic expansion remains uncertain. The FOMC meeting, as expected, resulted in no change to the Fed's policy or bias. The recent fall in stocks and a weak April employment report had earlier reinforced expectations that the Fed would keep the funds rate at 1.75 per cent. The Fed said yesterday that the risks remained ""balanced"" between price stability and economic growth. Economists expect the Fed to remain on hold through to June. Yesterday's data on non-farm productivity growth will support the Fed's decision. Although growth was stronger than expected, rising 8.6 per cent in the first quarter, unit labour costs fell - indicating that inflation remains benign. The market absorbed yesterday a quarterly refunding sale of $22bn five-year notes, which will be followed by a fresh $11bn in 10-year notes today. The two-year note gained 1/16 to 100 1/2 after the decision to yield 3.104 per cent, while the 10-year note was 5/32 higher at 98 21/32 with a yield of 5.047 per cent. The 30-year bond was up 1/8 to 97 to yield 5.532 per cent. Eurozone government bond prices were flat in a choppy session as weak figures on the health of the German economy were offset by stronger equity markets. The number of jobless people in the eurozone's largest economy rose an unexpected 6,000 in April. In addition, German industrial orders fell by 0.1 per cent in March, pushing investors back into government bonds after many analysts had predicted a positive number.

941,447.0,2002-05-08,"THE AMERICAS - Fed continues dispensing medicine to a still-sick economy - Committee leaves rates at 40-year low, although fears on inflation are beginning to rattle nerves, writes Peronet Despeignes. The Federal Reserve said yesterday inflation remained under control and signalled that short-term interest rates would stay at 40-year lows to help an economy still struggling to recuperate from last year's recession and the colossal investment bust of the past two years. What the US central bank did not say was that economic data have been increasingly mixed and financial news dismal, dragging down stock prices to six-month lows. The Nasdaq stock index, barometer of what is left of the ""new economy"", has over the past month sunk to levels not seen since the wake of the September 11 terror attacks. America's economic recovery is, once again, in serious doubt, with inflation brewing as a potential problem over the coming year. The Fed's worst nightmare remains the prospect of a race between inflation and recovery - the possibility it will be forced into a Hobbesian decision to tighten the noose on money and credit to suppress inflation before clear signs emerge of a genuine recovery. That dilemma would leave its chairman Alan Greenspan - widely thought to be on his way towards a triumphant retirement - with an important, final challenge: navigating between the dual threats of renewed economic weakness and inflation. The Fed's policymaking open market committee (FOMC) decided yesterday to leave short-term interest rates at a low of 1.75 per cent, where they have been since November. The general consensus is that monetary policy remains ""accommodative"" - in other words, adrenalin for a still-sick economy. The big question is how long it can remain so before risking an inflation problem. Mr Greenspan recently suggested it would take ""two to four months"" for the Fed to have enough confidence about the economy's direction to make a pre-emptive policy change and, presumably, reverse course. Futures markets have registered expectations the Fed will end its anti-recession campaign and begin returning short-term rates to ""normal"" levels no sooner than September. A surge in inflation risks could wreck this timetable. To the Fed's relief, inflation appears under control despite last year's dramatic monetary easing. According to the consumer price index, the 12-month trailing rate of inflation has slowed sharply in the past year from 3.5 per cent to just above 1 per cent. The implicit GDP deflator and deflator on personal consumption expenditures - considered better measures by Mr Greenspan - suggest inflation has slid below 1 per cent. While some prices - mainly for oil, gasoline and services such as housing, medical care and education - have surged and prices overall have stabilised, inflation appears generally subdued. However, economic indicators are backward-looking. The issue for the Fed is where inflation is heading from here and where markets expect it to go. A key determinant is the nation's productivity miracle. Figures released yesterday suggest it remains intact as companies continue to cut costs and the economy keeps producing more with less. But the persistence of the slump in stock prices and in investment in labour-saving technologies, and the pick-up in government spending, have raised doubts about how long the productivity surge will last. Mr Greenspan said last month he did not expect high figures indefinitely: ""The world just doesn't work that well."" One measure closely watched by the Fed, the difference between yields on Treasury and inflation-indexed Treasury bonds (Tips), has grown to a two-year high. Gold dollar prices have jumped and the dollar itself has slid recently - possible preliminary signs of weakening foreign demand for, and an inflationary oversupply of, US currency. Two prominent economic watchdogs have sent warnings. In its latest quarterly industry survey, the National Association of Business Economics, the largest group of corporate economists, said inflation pressures ""were developing"", evinced by ""widely reported"" price increases in services and raw materials. The Institute for Supply Management said purchasing managers were reporting strong growth in costs, with service-sector executives reporting that their costs ""had increased at the fastest rate in 11 months"". A sign of the emerging confusion and policy tensions was an extraordinarily public confrontation last month between a current and a former member of the FOMC at the April 25 annual economic conference of the Levy Economic Institute. Gary Stern, president of the Minneapolis Federal Reserve, said that amid the unusual uncertainty, Fed policy action ""should be modest and infrequent"" to ""avoid destabilising the economy"". That prompted a stern warning from Laurence Meyer, an economist and former FOMC member, about the danger of being ""reactive"" and complacent on inflation - a possible omen of future divisions that are likely to widen if the ""productivity miracle"" falters and the economy does not recover quickly.

942,448.0,2002-05-08,"US government bonds remained lower yesterday after the Federal Reserve kept interest rates unchanged, with investors instead focused on selling securities ahead of $22bn in new supply. The FOMC meeting had been expected to be a ""non-event"", with no change in policy or bias. The recent fall in stocks and a weak April employment report had reinforced expectations that the Fed would keep the funds rate at 1.75 per cent. The Fed said yesterday that risks remained ""balanced"" between price stability and economic growth. Helping the Fed to keep rates unchanged yesterday were data on non-farm productivity growth. Although growth was stronger than expected, rising 8.6 per cent in the first quarter, unit labour costs fell - indicating that inflation remains benign. The market focused yesterday on the afternoon's quarterly refunding sale of five-year notes, which will be followed by a fresh $11bn in 10-year notes today. The two-year note was unchanged after the decision at 100 13/32, to yield 3.149 per cent, while the 10-year note was down 3/32 to 98 3/8 with a yield of 5.083 per cent. The 30-year bond had fallen 5/32 to 97 13/32 to yield 5.554 per cent. Eurozone government bond prices were flat in a choppy session as weak figures on the health of the German economy were offset by stronger equity markets. The number of jobless people in the eurozone's largest economy rose an unexpected 6,000 in April. In addition, German industrial orders fell by 0.1 per cent in March, pushing investors back into government bonds after many analysts had predicted a positive number.

943,449.0,2002-05-08,"The equitymarket's two-day rally, which was mostly triggered by strong performances from the oil majors and bank stocks, was damaged by London's catch-up after the bank holiday weekend. Monday's trading session in the US saw Wall Street under renewed and heavy downside pressure, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average plunging back through the 10,000 level and the Nasdaq Composite on the slide to its lowest level since October last year. Both were damaged by worries about further casualties in the technology and telecom areas, and concerns about the extent of earnings recovery in the US. And although New York markets staged a rally yesterday afternoon, boosted by strong productivity data, the damage wrought on Monday was too much to repair in one London session. Dealers said the institutions had backed off from the market yesterday, preferring to wait for the outcome of the two interest rate decisions, from the US Federal Reserve's open market committee last night, and the Bank of England's monetary policy committee, expected at midday tomorrow. ""The overwhelming view is that we'll get no change here and no change in the US, but there could well be accompanying comments and the minutes of the last FOMC meeting will come out later this week as well,"" said one trader. At its worst of the day the FTSE 100 dropped below the 5,100 level, hitting a low of 5,082.7, down 120.4, before stabilising and staging a rally to finish the day a net 83.2 off at 5,119.9, its lowest closing level since February 28. The fall-out from the 100 index affected all areas of the market, with the Techmark 100 index, already on its knees because of the latest sell-off in the TMT sectors, sliding a further 14.01 to a record closing low of 1,047.77. The index remains well clear of its record intraday low which saw the measure only just escape falling below the 1,000 level. The FTSE 250 took plenty of punishment too, closing 44 lower at 6,126.2, after 6,119.2, while the FTSE SmallCap dipped 15.9 to 2,567.4. Both indices suffered from marked weakness in tech and related stocks. Leading London fallers yesterday were the heavyweight sectors that provided such stalwart support for the market recently - the oils, banks and pharmaceuticals. Oils were buffeted by selling sparked by the decline in crude oil prices as Iraq said it would resume crude oil sales after its month-long freeze. Weakness in BP and Shell accounted for about 23 points of downside in the FTSE 100, while bearish broker comments drove many of the banks lower. And the gloom surrounding the telecoms arena saw Vodafone shares drift back to their lowest level since January 1998 at one stage. despite support from a handful of brokers.

President Bush will announce soon his intention to pick Fed economist Donald Kohn and Princeton University professor Ben Bernanke to fill two vacancies on the board. If they are approved by the Senate, Bush will have directly selected a third of the Fed's 12-seat, policy-making Open Market Committee. All board members sit on the FOMC. Bush won approval for the appointments of Susan Schmidt-Bies and Mark Olson last year. Not since the days of Franklin Delano Roosevelt, who built a reformed Federal Reserve board from scratch after the 1935 Banking Act, has any president had so much influence over the Fed's make-up in so short a time. ""It's unprecedented especially if Greenspan retires under Bush,"" said Tom Schlesinger, an expert on Fed history at the Financial Markets Centre. ""No president in the first two years of his term ever had as many board of governor openings."" Kohn, 59, is an official adviser to the Fed's board. He has worked closely with Greenspan, helping to devise monetary policy strategy. He was previously head of the Fed's Division of Monetary Affairs. Bernanke, 48, is an expert on monetary economics and chairman of the Princeton University economics department. He also sits on the recession-dating committee of the non-partisan National Bureau of Economic Research, which officially declared in November that the economy has slipped into a recession in March. If approved by the Senate, Kohn and Bernanke will fill seats left vacant by the departure of Laurence Meyer and Edward Kelley. Both would serve automatically as non-rotating members of the FOMC which, at full strength, is made up of seven board members selected by the President and five rotating regional Fed presidents elected by their regional boards.

945,451.0,2002-05-08,"The Federal Reserve's policymaking Open Market Committee on Tuesday voted to keep short-term interest rates at a 40-year low of 1.75 per cent, signalling its continuing concern about the growth of the US economy. A statement following the vote said the decision was unanimous. The FOMC said that ""the strengthening of final demand"" over the next few months was ""still uncertain"", employing language identical to that in its March 19 statement. The interest rate announcement came a day before a likely White House announcement concerning the FOMC's membership. Analysts expect President George W. Bush to nominate Ben Bernanke and Donald Kohn to the two vacancies on the FOMC on Wednesday. Mr Bernanke is an economist at Princeton University, and Mr Kohn is a Federal Reserve economist and adviser to Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve. Before Tuesday's rate decision, there had been some speculation the Fed might signal a shift toward raising rates. Instead, the FOMC sent a signal about its concerns over low growth, maintaining its assertion that the ""balance of risks"" facing the US remained evenly divided between economic weakness and higher inflation. The decision shows the US central bank finds it necessary to sustain aid to an economy still struggling to recuperate from last year's recession and the investment decline of the past two years. It also comes amid renewed doubts about America's economic recovery. Recent economic data have been inconclusive while financial reports, particularly among technology companies, have remained generally dismal, dragging down stock prices to six-month lows. The Nasdaq Composite over the past month has sunk to levels not seen since right after the September 11 terrorist attacks. The consensus is that monetary policy remains ""accommodative"", acting as adrenaline for a weakened economy. The question remains as to how long monetary policy can be used as a stimulus before the Fed risks an inflation problem.

Futures markets have registered expectations for the Fed to end its anti-recession campaign and begin returning short-term rates to ""normal"" levels no sooner than September. A surge in inflation risks could disrupt this timetable. The Fed's hope is that it will not face such a possibility before the economy is back on a solid growth path. Inflation appears under control in spite of last year's dramatic monetary easing. Inflation has generally slowed, according to most measures, from around 3.5 per cent to roughly 1 per cent. A key influence will be the staying power of the nation's ""productivity miracle"". Figures released on Tuesday suggest it remains intact as companies continue to cut costs and the economy continues to produce more with less. The US labour department on Tuesday said output per work-hour, outside of agriculture, rose at its fastest pace in nearly two decades through the first quarter. Higher productivity growth blunts the effect of rising costs on prices. The first-quarter productivity surge led to the biggest drop in labour costs per unit of output in 18 years. However, the persistence of the slump in investment in labour-saving technologies and the pickup in government spending have raised doubts about how long the spurt in productivity will last.

947,453.0,2002-06-27,"Beset by economic uncertainty and financial turmoil, the US Federal Reserve decided yesterday for the fourth time this year to keep short-term interest rates pegged at 40-year lows. Futures markets, meanwhile, explicitly priced in a slight possibility of Fed rate cuts. That speculation gained a boost from mounting evidence that the US central bank is focusing on the risk of Japan-style deflation. The Fed's policymaking open market committee (FOMC) voted unanimously to keep its target for the fed funds rate - which regulates overnight lending between banks - at 1.75 per cent. Officials have consistently voiced mild optimism about a moderate recovery, but have avoided returning short-term rates to pre-recession levels, thinking the US still needs easy credit to recover from last year's downturn. The recovery is clearly reflected in economic data. Yesterday, the Commerce Department reported that orders for non-military capital goods rose in May at the fastest pace since December 2001 and sales of new homes surged to a record. But the surprisingly good news only moderated growing investor distrust of corporate America and anxiety about threats to the recovery posed by the decline of stock prices, faltering consumer sentiment and still-depressed levels of business confidence, profits, capital spending and hiring. Signalling its concern, the US central bank said, in a prepared statement, that the risks facing the Fed remained ""equally balanced"" between economic weakness and higher inflation, the shift towards stockpile building and growth in demand for goods and services ""appear to have moderated"", leaving the course of future strengthening ""uncertain"". A shift in expectations, under way since March, got more support from growing evidence of the Fed's focus on the risk of deflation, as short-term interest rates and measured inflation in the US linger near zero. Last week the US central bank published a study* of how Japan might have avoided its decade-long struggle with deflation. It involved discussion of ""unconventional"" measures in case interest rate cuts failed to arrest a recession. The discussion appeared to reflect concerns the US could have faced - and might face in the future - a dilemma in which interest rates were so low as to be rendered ineffective as a monetary policy tool. The latest study insists ""that when inflation and interest rates have fallen close to zero, and the risk of deflation is high, stimulus, both monetary and fiscal, should go beyond (convention)."" *Preventing Deflation: Lessons from Japan's Experience in the 1990s (Federal Reserve working paper, June 2002) London Edition 3.

The Federal Reserve, as expected, left the Federal funds rate unchanged at 1.75 per cent and kept a ""neutral bias"", saying the risks were still balanced between inflation and economic growth. However, expectations have begun to mount that the Fed may cut interest rates further to prop up stock markets and the US economy. Lehman yesterday said it expected the Fed to cut rates by 25 basis points in the third quarter. ""There's a loss of faith in corporate America,"" said Gary Pollack, director of fixed income at Deutsche Bank Private Banking, adding that investors had now become even more worried about the prospect of a ""double-dip"" recession.

The 10-year September bund future rose 0.52 to 107.79. Bond prices were also supported by the strength of the euro against the dollar but most investors in Europe were focused on the Fed's decision about interest rates. In emerging markets Brazilian bond prices fell further as risk appetite was hit by the WorldCom scandal. Japanese government bond futures prices rose yesterday, after the steepest fall in the Nikkei 225 Average since last September and another major accounting scandal rocked Wall Street. The buying came as the Japanese government tried unsuccessfully to halt a resurgent yen for the second time this week. The technology-sensitive Nikkei 225 Average lost 4 per cent to 10,074.56, while the broader-based Topix index closed below the 1,000 support level for the first time in four months. JGBs provided a safe haven for investors, who were also fleeing export shares hit by a yen that rose to its highest level against the dollar in eight months, in the wake of WorldCom's discovery of $3.8bn in accounting irregularities that inflated the group's profits.

949,455.0,2002-06-27,"COMMENT &ANALYSIS - A calm Fed watches the correction - Gerard Baker on why the central bank does not see pressing reasons in US economic conditions to raise or lower. As the world's investors took cover yesterday from the latest accounting bombshell to hit Wall Street, Federal Reserve policymakers put on a familiar display of phlegmatic order amid the turmoil. The US central bank, as expected, prosaically left its main monetary policy instrument, its target for the federal funds rate, unchanged for the fourth straight meeting of its policymaking open market committee (FOMC). But with US equity markets plunging through the low point they reached in the weeks after September 11, it must have been a troubling thought for policymakers that the combination of Kenneth Lay and Bernie Ebbers had done more damage to Americans' wealth than Osama bin Laden and Mohammed Atta. Last autumn, the Fed cut interest rates aggressively to shield the economy from terrorist-related blows to confidence. So far, and with not much further room for cuts, it has sat tight as markets have steadily crumbled in the past four months. Fed officials are concerned about equity weakness - and indeed about the steep slide in the dollar that has accompanied it. But, going into this week's FOMC meeting, policymakers remained cautiously optimistic that recovery would not be derailed. The biggest source of comfort is that, despite the big declines in equity values so far this year, the real economy continues to show encouraging signs of life. Overall, output growth in the second quarter of the year, which ends this weekend, will be a little more disappointing than looked likely two months ago but should still be in the range of 2.5 per cent at an annual rate. That is well below the inventory-adjustment-driven 5.6 per cent pace of the first quarter but still consistent with steady recovery. Especially encouraging has been the manufacturing sector, which is several months into a recovery from a two-year slide. Yesterday, the Commerce Department reported that durable goods orders rose by 0.6 per cent in May, the fifth increase in the past six months. Signs of strength in the capital goods markets are what the Fed has been hoping to see, since they should signal the start of a gradual revival in business investment - the collapse of which was the main factor that drove the economy into recession last year. And for all the concern in markets about the dollar's decline, Fed economists like to point out that the stimulative effect on exports will at least counterbalance the deflationary impact on US financial assets. Consumers hold the key. Fed policymakers have looked with awe on American consumers' resilience in the past few years. But they also know that part of Americans' capacity to keep spending has been provided by the Fed itself. In late 1998, when markets swooned after the Russian debt default and Asian financial crisis, and again after the September 11 attacks last year, Alan Greenspan and colleagues moved aggressively to cut short-term interest rates. This time, with the Fed running out of ammunition, falling stock prices could be more problematic for consumer spending. Consumers remain stretched, with heavy debt burdens and historically low savings rates. And this week the Conference Board, an independent research group, reported that June had seen the steepest fall in consumer confidence since last autumn, as Americans seemed to take fright at the events on Wall Street. Yet consumers may receive a shot of adrenaline from the same forces that have been sending stocks lower. As equities have declined in the past few months, bond prices have shot higher, sending interest rates lower. As a result, the housing market - where big gains have, for most Americans, more than offset the impact of falling stock prices - remains as strong as ever. Yesterday, the Commerce Department reported that new home sales in May rose by 8.1 per cent from a month earlier. Consumers seem to be in the early stages of another round of mortgage refinancing, which should put hundreds of billions of dollars back into their pockets. This may represent a belated adjustment in longer-term interest rates to the Fed's aggressive easing of last year. Or it may simply show that the market is once again ahead of the central bank in rebalancing financial conditions in the economy. The critical factor is that, as long as inflation stays low, the stimulus from lower interest rates need not be reversed any time soon. That is again the source of cautious Fed optimism. In spite of increases in energy prices this year, consumer prices remain flat - indeed some measures of inflation are showing the lowest rate of price increases in more than 40 years. Though the dollar's decline will push up import prices and some domestic prices, the US is still a relatively closed economy and is not likely to see a generalised and sustained increase in prices as a result of events on currency markets. Against that backdrop the Fed is under little pressure to raise interest rates. This same low inflation is, Fed officials believe, part of the reason for the weakness in equity markets. Policymakers do not appear to share some of the more alarmist views of inter-national investors that the accounting issues at World-Com and elsewhere mean US corporate reports are fundamentally untrustworthy, although clearly there are many significant problems. And it is hard to attribute the entire decline in US equity prices in the past six months, or even the bulk of it, to the corporate governance issue. A large part of it may be the result of the weakness of nominal demand in the economy. Inflation is low or even negative, so the relatively small increases in real demand of the past six months are reflected in very small gains in nominal demand - and in corporate sales and profits. Put another way, companies face a situation, unprecedented in the recent past, in which they have virtually no pricing power, even as real demand starts to recover. Of course, further steep falls in equity prices would complicate the Fed's task, especially if accompanied by a dive in the dollar. But for the moment, a benign inflationary environment and declines in market interest rates are keeping alive hopes at the central bank that a navigable path can be found through the unravelling of 1990s excess.

951,457.0,2001-06-28,"The Federal Reserve fretted over ""rising"" inflation risks during its interest rate-setting meeting in May, even while appearing to dismiss them publicly. Minutes of the May 15 meeting of the Fed's policymaking Open Market Committee, released on Thursday, say members believed the slowdown ""would hold down inflation"" but ""nonetheless, there were some risks of rising inflation"". At that meeting, one member, Thomas Hoenig, refused to vote with the majority decision to cut rates a half-point, urging a more modest quarter-point cut. Alan Greenspan, Fed chairman, strives to achieve consensus and is largely successful. Dissent on the FOMC is rare. The minutes raise the likelihood that Mr Greenspan faced disagreement at this week's FOMC meeting. It means Wednesday's decision to cut rates by a quarter-point might have marked the beginning of the end (if not the end) of the Fed's most dramatic monetary easing in at least 14 years. The May minutes show concern that - with US labour markets ""still tight by historical standards"" and falling productivity failing to suppress unit labour costs - an economic recovery might ""put added upward pressure on prices"". This echoes concerns expressed recently by Fed officials Laurence Meyer and Robert McTeer, concerns appearing to contradict Mr Greenspan. He has repeatedly played down inflation risks this year, suggesting the Fed, as a body, was not worried about it. In a recent speech in Singapore, he said ""inflation is not a significant problem"", but added, ""at the moment"". In later comments to the Senate Banking Committee, he said: ""We have to be very careful about any evidence of emerging inflationary instability."" To some, tensions were evident in the brevity of the FOMC's statement on Wednesday announcing its latest move.""It was very general, short and less forward-looking, suggesting serious disagreement on the outlook and risks,"" said Peter Hooper, chief US economist at Deutsche Bank. ""When you do have considerable disagreement, it's easier to agree on fewer words."" The Fed may have less reason to worry. Gauges of inflation expectations, such as the gold price and one of the Fed's internal measures of market inflation expectations (the difference between yields on Treasury bonds and inflation-indexed Treasury bonds, adjusting for differences in duration and liquidity) surged to 12-month highs in May. But both have fallen in the past month. The Treasuries market appeared to have a strong reaction to the FOMC minutes acknowledging inflation risks. The yield for the inflation-sensitive 10-year bond yield was up 5 basis points and ended the session up 10 basis points.

952,458.0,2001-06-28,"The US Federal Reserve on Wednesday cut short-term interest rates by a quarter of a percentage point, extending its six-month campaign to head off the threat of recession to a US economy it has called 'unacceptably weak'. The central bank's policymaking open market committee voted to cut its target for the federal funds rate from 4 per cent to 3.75 per cent, its lowest level since April 1994. It also cut by a 1/4 point its largely symbolic discount rate, to 3.25 per cent. Hopes for a half-point cut had been weakened by recent positive economic data but it still extended what many consider to be the central bank's most aggressive easing of money and credit in 14 years. The Fed has now reduced its interest rate target by 23/4 percentage points in six months to revive an economy it has called ""unacceptably weak"". Explaining its latest move, the Fed said weakness in profits and investment, slowing growth overseas and emerging weakness in consumer spending were weighing on the economy. It asserted, as it has all year, that long-term economic trends remained favourable. But for now, ""the risks are weighted mainly toward conditions that may generate economic weakness in the foreseeable future"", it said, affirming the possibility of more rate cuts. But - unlike in recent statements - the Fed left out specific language that had signalled rate cuts between scheduled meetings in the past. The FOMC meets again on August 21. Economists are hopeful that the Fed's campaign, which began in January, will eventually have a big impact after the typical six-to-eight month lag. There are also high hopes for added stimulus from recent federal income tax cuts. But Fed officials have privately expressed concern that their work had been undermined by a strong dollar, which has hurt US exports, the recent upward drift in long-term interest rates and weak equity prices. Some investment strategists contend weak corporate profits and profit forecasts - which continue to tumble, threatening, the US with another round of cuts in production, investment and employment - may overwhelm the Fed's efforts. Some economists also fear heavy and rising debt levels among US consumers endanger the continued growth in consumer spending. Another potential worry for the Fed remains the risk that its actions will fuel imbalances that undermine the economy's long-term health. Several top Fed officials - including Laurence Meyer and Robert McTeer - have wondered aloud about the possibility of an inflation surge. These concerns may have provoked dissent within the FOMC, possibly playing a role in its decision to reduce rates a quarter-, instead of a half-, point. The Fed might have one less thing to worry about: Several market measures of inflation concerns have subsided. The Fed's internal measure of market inflation expectations - the gap between yields on Treasury bonds and inflation-indexed Treasury bonds - has dropped to its lowest level since early April after jumping to 12-month highs in May.

But, despite these, ""the risks are weighted mainly toward conditions that may generate economic weakness in the foreseeable future"". The Fed also said easing pressures in the labour and product markets were expected to keep inflation contained. But, unlike recent statements, the Fed left out language indicating readiness to make a further rate cut before the next scheduled meeting of the committee on August 21.

957,463.0,1990-10-03,"CURRENCIES TRADED in narrow ranges yesterday, lacking fresh factors. The dollar held comfortably above technical support levels of DM1.5520 against the D-Mark and Y136.60 in terms of the yen, while showing no sign of attacking resistance at DM1.5650 and Y137.50. The Federal Open Market Committee met yesterday, amid speculation about an easing of monetary policy if agreement to cut the US budget deficit is ratified by Congress. Minutes of the meeting will not be released until next month, but dealers will be looking for monetary signals from the Fed's money market management. Funds were added to the New York banking system yesterday via overnight system repurchases. This was more aggressive than expected, but analysts doubted whether it was more than a technical move to bring Federal funds down from 8 3/16 per cent. Shortly after the action Fed funds fell to 8 1/8 per cent, nearer to the assumed target rate of 8 per cent. Expectations of lower interest rates pushed the dollar down sharply on Monday, but steadier trading yesterday reflected hopes that a cut in the budget deficit would also indicate determination by the US to improve its overall economic performance. At the London close the dollar was unchanged Y136.90, but had advanced to DM1.5550 from DM1.5515; to SFr1.2920 from SFr1.2890; and to FFr5.2100 from FFr5.2000. Its index rose to 62.5 from 62.4. Sterling was little changed overall, recovering from a slight dip caused by a bigger than forecast fall of Dollars 344m in September UK official reserves. The market expected a drop of about Dollars 80m, but the figure appeared to suggest that Bank of England support for the pound had been larger than previously believed when the currency was defended on September 21. After a brief decline on the news, the pound rallied in fairly thin trading. It finished 10 points lower against the dollar at Dollars 1.8885 and eased to Y258.50 from Y258.75, but improved to DM2.9375 from DM2.9325; to SFr2.4400 from SFr2.4350; and to FFr9.8400 from FFr9.8250. Sterling's index was generally steady, closing unchanged at 93.5. A sharp rise in Japanese share prices failed to have much impact on the yen. Dealers said they were surprised at the lack of reaction, but the currency did improve slightly against most European currencies. The D-Mark fell to Y88.05 from Y88.25. Trading among members of the European Monetary System was subdued. High interest rates kept the Spanish peseta at the top of the exchange rate mechanism and interest rate factors also supported the French franc. The Italian lira steadied after its recent fall, helped by firmer money market rates after Monday's action by the Bank of Italy to drain liquidity.

958,464.0,1990-03-28,"AFTER TRADING in a tight range for most of yesterday's session, programme buying pushed leading US stock indices sharply higher in the last hour of business, writes Janet Bush in New York. The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed 29.28 points higher at 2,736.94 following Monday's tiny gain of 3.38 points. With no dramatics overnight on Japanese markets and with the first quarter coming to an end, nobody had expected any large fluctuations and, despite the size of yesterday's rally, it came in thin volume of only 131m shares. The dominance of futures-related arbitrage as stock index futures rose to large premiums over their underlying cash stocks - so prompting selling of the futures and buying of cash stocks - makes it difficult to tell how much actual demand there was. The background to yesterday's session did not look auspicious. On Monday, the Dow had jumped 20 points in reaction to the second largest rally ever in Tokyo only to fall back to close with a very modest gain in the second slowest day of trading since the start of the year. The inability to draw much sustenance from more stable conditions in Japan reflected some concerns about the next round of quarterly earnings results as well as the fact that any end-quarter buying by institutional portfolio managers has probably now been completed. There is a dearth of economic news this week which is also keeping trading volume low. The only economic figures of any note are today's revisions for fourth quarter GNP which are not likely to inspire much interest. The financial markets are much more concerned about the performance of the economy this month, given that the outlook for monetary policy appears to be finely balanced. The Federal Open Market Committee, which sets a target for the Federal Funds rate, started its regular meeting yesterday to review its monetary stance. There appears to be consensus that the Fed will leave monetary policy unchanged until it has seen the economic evidence for March. Trading was dull in the Treasury bond market. In late trading, the Treasury's benchmark long bond was quoted 1/8 point lower for a yield of 8.47 per cent. Among featured stocks yesterday was American Express which dropped Dollars 3/8 to Dollars 26 1/2 . The company said yesterday that it had signed a definitive merger agreement to purchase Shearson Lehman Hutton. JP Industries gained Dollars 7/8 to Dollars 16 7/8 . T&N of Britain identified itself as the bidder for the company, which said that it had agreed in principle to be acquired for Dollars 17.30 a share. Bally Manufacturing added Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 13 3/4 on a US press report that Mr Arthur Goldberg, the investor, had bought about Dollars 13m worth of shares, or 4.5 per cent. Canada TORONTO closed mixed in light trading. The composite index closed up 11.00 at 3,678.46 but declines edged advances 297 to 289. Volume was just 20.2m shares, down from just under 23m. Golds closed up 1.28 per cent after losing more than 6 per cent, as the price of gold rebounded somewhat from Monday's sharp fall.

959,465.0,2005-12-14,"The Federal Reserve yesterday signalled a final phase in its monetary tightening campaign, as it stopped describing policy as stimulating the economy. The Federal Open Market Committee raised the federal funds rate by a quarter point to 4.25 per cent, the 13th consecutive increase since June of last year. But the committee removed from its statement the language used on each previous occasion which had said that ""policy accommodation"" would continue to be removed at a ""measured"" pace. The new statement suggested that the committee would continue tightening policy, even though the federal funds rate may no longer be accommodative - a reference to the notion of a neutral rate at which policy neither stimulates nor restricts growth. Alan Greenspan, Fed chairman, has suggested the notion of interest rate neutrality is too vague and too difficult to measure to provide a precise guide for policymakers. The Fed's looser formulation on the future path of rate increases suggested uncertainty among policymakers about how much further rates will have to rise and hinted that the central bank is close to the end of its tightening cycle. The statement said: ""The committee judges that some further measured policy firming is likely to be needed to keep the risks to the attainment of both sustainable economic growth and price stability roughly in balance. In any event, the committee will respond to changes in economic prospects as needed to foster these objectives."" The new forward-looking language suggested interest rates will rise again in January, at the last meeting chaired by Mr Greenspan - and probably after that - but handed a cleaner slate to Ben Bernanke, who will take over in February and chair his first FOMC meeting in March. Futures markets continued to price in another rate increase in January, bringing the Federal funds rate to 4.5 per cent, and a still good but slightly reduced chance of another rise after that to 4.75 per cent. Ethan Harris, chief US economist at Lehman Brothers, said: ""It is a gradual step towards a little more flexibility. Inflation, the economy and the markets will dictate how much further they go. They say the economy is strong and that inflation risks are tilted a little to the upside. There is nothing yet in the data that will stop the Fed."" The Fed said economic expansion remained solid in spite of high energy prices and disruptions related to the Gulf coast hurricanes - a more confident note than in November - following a string of encouraging data releases. It said inflation had stayed relatively low and longer-term inflation expectations remain contained. But it warned: ""Possible increases in resource utilisation as well as elevated energy prices have the potential to add to inflation pressures."" The minutes of the Fed's last meeting and public comments from policymakers have indicated a concern about characterising monetary policy as accommodative now that is no longer obviously the case.

But the Fed still raised rates by a quarter point, as expected, to 4.25 per cent, and said ""further measured policy firming"" was likely to be needed to counter inflationary pressures. The FOMC changed the two most market-sensitive parts of its statement.The reference to existingpolicy ""accommodation"" was removed, suggesting rates may not go much higher. Meanwhile, the reference to ""measured"" future rate rises was retained, but in a changed context. ""The FOMC indicated another rate hike is likelyon January 31, but left the door open for March 28,"" said analysts at Action Economics. ""If inflation pressures remain contained in early 2006, as we suspect, the Fed may be able to moveto the sidelines in March.""

Ten-year yields were down 2.6bp at 4.527 per cent.

962,468.0,2005-12-14,"The yen rallied sharply, chalking up its biggest one-day rise against the dollar since March 2000 as speculators scrambled to close short-yen positions. The move was sparked by a barrage of dollar-negative news, from a softer monetary policy statement to yet another record US trade deficit, which prompted traders to cash in their lucrative long-dollar positions The yen jumped to Y116.84 against the dollar, 2.7 per cent stronger than its level immediately prior to Tuesday's Federal Reserve statement, as well as leaping 2 per cent to Y140.56 against the euro, 2.5 per cent to Y88.33 against the Australian dollar, 2.9 per cent to Y101.27 to the Canadian dollar and 2.4 per cent to Y207.12 versus sterling. The rally came in spite of poor conditions reported by the quarterly Tankan survey of Japanese business, although it was ""consistent with GDP growth of over 3 per cent by the end of this year"", said Keith Gyles at Capital Economics. The prevailing view was that the yen, which had tumbled 10.4 per cent against the dollar since early September, was benefiting from a liquidation of the swarm of short-yen positions that had built up in the market. ""There are short-yen positions against a whole range of currencies as it has been used as a funding currency,"" said Tony Norfield, global head of forex strategy at ABN Amro. ""At the end of the year, people are closing down their book and this could led to a much bigger snapback in the yen."" Michael Woolfolk, senior currency strategist at Bank of New York, also saw hedge funds and speculators locking-in profits from their short-yen trades to guarantee their year-end bonuses. However, few thought that the move was the start of a trend recovery for the yen. Chris Towner, consultant at risk manager HIFX, said technical factors pointed to a target of Y115 in dollar/yen. He saw the catalyst for the move as profit-taking by foreign investors in Japanese equities, which forced them to buy back the yen they had sold to hedge their currency exposure. Others saw the initial driver for the correction as Wednesday's Fed statement. As expected, the Fed raised rates to 4.25 per cent, its 13th straight hike. However, it softened the language of the accompanying statement to suggest that rates were now reaching neutral levels, although ""some further measured policy firming is likely to be needed"". Steven Saywell, chief currencies strategist at Citigroup, said ""cyclical support for the dollar has peaked"", and while most analysts still expect the FOMC to raise rates again in January (and probably March), this opinion is no longer universal. Ashraf Laidi, chief currency analyst at MG Financial, pencilled in a 40 per cent chance of a January pause. The news worsened yesterday as the October US trade deficit ballooned to a record of $68.9bn, confounding forecasts for a narrowing of September's $66.1bn gap. Capital Economics raised the possibility that fourth-quarter US GDP growth could actually turn negative as a result. The burgeoning deficit may have held little power over the dollar this year, but James Knightley, economist at ING Financial Markets, said: ""There is a risk that concerns about imbalances could start to exert greater influence on the dollar now that the Fed appears closer to the peak in rates."" Mr Woolfolk saw capital inflows into the US continuing to fund the current account deficit for now, but added: ""The risk of a dislocation upsetting this balance is growing larger with time. If and when the wheels come flying off, the dollar will have quite a way to fall."" The dollar fell 0.8 per cent to a six-week low of $1.2038 against the euro but was little changed at $1.7739 to sterling, which was unsettled by soft UK labour market data; unemployment rose for a 10th straight month and earnings growth weakened.

963,469.0,2005-12-14,"The under-fire yen surged higher in European morning trade on Wednesday, becoming the main beneficiary of a dollar sell-off in the wake of Wednesday's Federal Reserve statement. As expected, the Federal Open Market Committee raised US rates for the 13th straight meeting, taking short-term rates to 4.25 per cent. However the FOMC also softened the language of the accompanying statement to suggest that rates were now reaching neutral levels. The regular mantra that ""policy accommodation"" would continue to be removed at a ""measured"" pace was missing from the statement, although the committee did say that ""some further measured policy firming is likely to be needed"". Some softening of language had been expected, but the overall statement was probably more dovish than many had expected, with Treasury yields trending lower. And while most analysts still expect the FOMC to raise rates once again in January, this opinion is no longer universal. Ashraf Laidi, chief currency analyst at MG Financial, said the Fed had opened the door for a January pause. ""We deem a 60 per cent chance for a January 25-basis point rate hike to 4.5 per cent, which is to be followed by a rate cut in Q4, bringing down the Fed funds rate back to 4.25 per cent by end of 2006,"" said Mr Laidi. Against this backdrop the dollar fell to $1.2026 against the euro, 1c weaker than its level immediately prior to the statement, 0.7c to C$1.1445 against the Canadian dollar, a 14-year low, and Y1.6 to Y118.53 against the yen. The yen was the major beneficiary, jumping Y0.6 to Y142.49 against the euro, Y0.95 to Y89.60 against the Australian dollar and Y2.2 to Y209.96 versus sterling, despite the quarterly Tankan survey of Japanese business conditions coming in below forecasts. The reading for large manufacturers came in at +21, better than the +19 recorded in the third quarter but below forecasts for a rise to +23. However the large non-manufacturers index did rise to its highest level since 1992, and the overall report was ""consistent with GDP growth of over 3 per cent by the end of this year,"" in the words of Keith Gyles, economist at Capital Economics. News that Tokyo department store sales growth jumped to 4.3 per cent year-on-year in November, from 1.5 per cent in October, was a clear yen plus. However the general view was that the yen's sharp rally may have been largely fuelled by speculators cutting long dollar/yen positions in the wake of the FOMC statement. ""Speculative positioning data has for some time indicated significant short-yen positions and these positions are now being pared,"" said Derek Halpenny, senior currency economist at Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi. In contrast sterling was weaker, sitting little changed at $1.7717 against the dollar and falling 0.7p to GBP0.6784 against the euro. The pound was unsettled by soft UK labour market data, with unemployment rising for a tenth straight month and headline earnings growth falling to 3.6 per cent year-on-on-year in October, from 4.1 per cent in September. The data helped strengthen talk of a further UK rate cut, with ING Financial Markets looking for 50 basis points of cuts in the first half of 2006.

964,470.0,2005-09-21,"Fed-watchers yesterday played down the importance of a dissenting vote on the Federal Open Market Committee, as the US central bank indicated that it has more work to do in raising interest rates. The FOMC raised interest rates, as expected, and acknowledged the increased uncertainty in the economic outlook following Hurricane Katrina. But there was no hint of a pause to come, as the committee said that following yesterday's increase policy remained accommodative and that it expected to continue raising rates at a measured pace. Mark Olson, a Fed governor better known as a banking expert than as an economist, went against Alan Greenspan, Fed chairman, voting to leave interest rates on hold. And only seven of the 12 regional Fed branches asked for an increase in the Fed's discount rate, a largely symbolic gesture, though one that has been made with only rare exception as the Fed had increased rates consecutively at the last 10 meetings before yesterday. ""The dissent by Olson is probably not evidence of a split and some of the regional banks might have found it hard to ask for an increase right after the hurricane but I assume they will quickly fall into line behind the next one,"" said Richard Berner, chief US economist at Morgan Stanley. ""They gave no hint of a pause although of course they could do that in the future."" Ethan Harris, chief US economist at Lehman Brothers, referring to Mr Olson's dissent and the regional Fed requests, said: ""We do not believe these actions are significant and continue to expect the Fed to raise rates at a measured 25 basis points per meeting through the January meeting, bringing the Fed funds target rate to 4.5 per cent."" If anything, the FOMC statement was a little more hawkish than expected. The committee acknowledged the disruption following Katrina and the potential for energy price volatility. The committee said that while Katrina had increased uncertainty about ""near-term economic performance, it is the Committee's view that they do not pose a more persistent threat"". By raising rates another quarter point to 3.75 per cent, signalling more to come and focusing on inflation risks than growth risks, the FOMC left little doubt about its greatest concern. In a slight tweak in its language, rather than saying inflation expectations were ""well contained"" it merely said they were ""contained"". Last week's Michigan survey of consumer sentiment showed the expected drop - following Katrina - but also showed a rise in inflation expectations. ""The statement represents a real skilful exercise in risk management by the Fed. They acknowledged the increased uncertainty but in their view the risk of higher inflation outweighs the risk to growth,"" Mr Berner said. The last time a Fed governor dissented was in September 2002, when the FOMC left rates on hold, but a former governor, Edward Gramlich favoured easing monetary policy.

965,471.0,2005-09-21,"The US dollar edged higher yesterday as the Federal Reserve, as expected, raised interest rates by 25 basis points for the eleventhsuccessive meeting. Shortly after the decision the greenback was trading at Dollars 1.2130 against the euro, from Dollars 1.2163 prior to the decision, as well as firming up by a similar margin to Dollars 1.8000 against sterling, Y111.89 versus the yen and SFr1.2808 against the Swiss franc. The dollar index strengthened to 88.59, from 88.32 before the announcement. Although a minority of economists had expected the Fed to pause its rate-hiking cycle in the wake of Hurricane Katrina, the decision to push rates to 3.75 per cent had largely been priced in to the currency market. The accompanying statement was on the hawkish side with the Federal Open Market Committee saying monetary policy was still ""accommodative"", that rates could be raised at a ""measured pace"" and that Katrina would only set back the US economy in the ""near term"". The FOMC warned that rising energy prices could push inflation higher, rather than fretting about the potential hit to economic growth. ""Higher energy and other costs have the potential to add to inflation pressures,'' the FOMC said. However, dollar bears were able to take comfort from the fact that, unusually, the FOMC's decision was not unanimous, with one committee member, Mark Olson, dissenting from the 9-1 majority vote. Alan Greenspan, Fed chairman, has already commented on ""froth"" in the US housing market and there was little indication of any slowdown in figures released yesterday showing US housing starts remained strong at 2.009m (annualised) in August, a fifth consecutive month above the 2m mark. The recent push in the gold price to a 17-year high is seen as a sign that the market is becoming more concerned about inflation. The widening spread between 10-year Treasury yields and inflation protected TIPS suggests investors are concerned over how successful the Fed will be in fighting inflation with higher interest rates. The Canadian central bank is due to hold its interest rate setting meeting shortly. Comments from its US counterpart on inflation expectations could have some impact on the outlook for Canadian rates. The Canadian dollar moved in a narrow range against the dollar yesterday, trading at CDollars 1.1700 after the loonie reached a 14-year high against the greenback on Monday. ""The Canadian dollar has been one of our most favoured currencies for some time now, given the mix of rising energy costs, strengthening economic momentum, fiscal and current account surpluses and a central bank in the foothills of monetary tightening,"" said Simon Derrick at the Bank of New York. ""Such is the momentum of late, that further progress towards the all-time high (CDollars 1.1198 set in November 1991) now looks a distinct possibility."" In Germany, the ZEW survey of economic sentiment fell more sharply than expected in September with the decline blamed on uncertainty over the general election. Selling pressure on the euro appeared to be easing amid emerging optimism about the possibility of a agreement between the main political parties. Prior to the Federal Reserve decision the euro had been up 0.3 per cent at Dollars 1.2175 from Dollars 1.2134 overnight. Against sterling, the euro strengthened 0.1 per cent to Pounds 0.6749. In the UK, the housing market showed signs of stabilising, according to a survey by the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors. Concerns over the outlook for consumer spending and economic growth meant sterling remained under pressure against the dollar, trading at Dollars 1.8043 prior to the Fed decision, down fractionally on the day.

The US central bank's Federal Open Market Committee acknowledged the ""widespread devastation"" inflicted upon the southern US by Hurricane Katrina but said ""these unfortunate events . . . do not pose a more persistent threat"" to long-term economic performance. Shortly after the Fed's announcement, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was 0.1 per cent lower at 10,544.34, the S&P 500 lost 0.2 per cent to 1,229.05, while the Nasdaq Composite put on 0.2 per cent to 2,150.36. Away from the Fed's decision, a handful of corporate stories provided an impetus for trading. Delphi tumbled 18.3 per cent to an all-time low of Dollars 2.755 but recovered slightly and was down 11.9 per cent at Dollars 2.97. The company is in ongoing discussions with General Motors, its biggest customer, in an attempt to stave off bankruptcy. Circuit City Stores rose 6.6 per cent to Dollars 16.54 after its third quarter profits beat expectations. The performance followed disappointing results last week by Best Buy, a rival. But Estee Lauder, the cosmetics retailer, fell 11 per cent to Dollars 36.03. After the close on Monday, the company cut its sales forecasts for the second half of 2005, blaming the effect of Hurricane Katrina on the southern US, lower-than-expected sales from promotions and the impact of rising energy prices on consumers. JPMorgan downgraded the stock from ""overweight"" to ""neutral"". Coca-Cola Enterprises was 1.8 per cent lower at Dollars 19.10, Pepsi Bottling Group fell 2.9 per cent to Dollars 27.23 and PepsiAmericas fell 3.9 per cent to Dollars 23.30 as Lehman Brothers downgraded the trio, citing rising costs due to energy inflation and the likelihood of sluggish volume growth as price rises are raised to cover these costs. Higher energy costs also took their toll on US Steel, which fell 4.2 per cent to Dollars 43.33 in the wake of a profits warning. Alongside a rising energy bill, US Steel also cited lower shipments and prices for its warning on third quarter earnings. Logistics company Swift Transportation fell 7.5 per cent to Dollars 17.04 as it said higher fuel costs and weaker demand for freight would cause it to miss third quarter earnings' expectations. Maytag fell 2.7 per cent to Dollars 18.04 after it said earnings would fall short of expectations this year. The company is the subject of a takeover approach from Whirlpool, a rival appliance group, which fell 2.9 per cent to Dollars 74.03.

967,473.0,2005-09-21,"Increasing concerns about disruption from Hurricane Rita led to weakness in the dollar yesterday as the greenback failed to sustain the modest gains that followed the rise in US interest rates by the Federal Reserve on Tuesday. The latest spike in crude and oil product prices contributed to dollar weakness after the Federal Open Markets Committee warned that rising energy prices could push inflation higher. ""The message from the FOMC was clear,"" said Derek Halpenny, senior currency economist at Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi: ""Increasingly inflationary pressures are a greater concern within the FOMC than the slowdown in economic growth post-Katrina."" Traders said the reaction of the major currencies to the hawkish tone of the FOMC statement had been surprisingly muted. The dollar weakened by 1 per cent against the Swiss Franc to reach a low of SFr1.2684 before recovering slightly to trade at SFr1.2711. In spite of the rise in US rates, the dollar failed to breach the key support level of $1.21 against the euro. This encouraged the single currency to rally to $1.2230. A modest late rally in the dollar brought the euro back to $1.2211. Dealers said once Rita had passed, the dollar could find support from the widening spread between US and eurozone 10-year bond yields, which has reached the highest level since 1999. European bond yields have sunk to an all-time low amid concerns over the outlook for growth which were underlined by the IMF yesterday. The Canadian dollar continued its strong rally, reaching a new 14-year high of C$1.1644 against the dollar before easing to trade at C$1.1690. Sentiment was boosted by better-than-expected retail sales figures, which reinforced the view that gross domestic product was continuing to gain momentum. Support for the currency has also come from a pick-up in foreign demand for Canadian equities as its stock market is heavily weighted with resources companies. In the UK, the minutes of the September meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee were much as expected, showing the MPC voted unanimously to keep interest rates unchanged. ""We still judge the MPC's growth forecasts are too optimistic,"" said Philip Shaw of Investec Securities: ""However, while the committee frets over inflation, it is unlikely to cut rates and we see policy remaining on hold for the remainder of this year."" Sterling traded 0.6 per cent stronger against the dollar at $1.8090 but 0.2 per cent weaker against the euro at GBP0.6747. High oil prices are boosting the Norwegian krone, which is trading at a 30-month high against the euro. The Norwegian central bank kept interest rates unchanged at 2 per cent but signalled an increase was likely at the next meeting. The krone initially firmed to NKr7.7805 before easing back to trade at NKr7.7951. In Japan, although the Nikkei recently broke through the 13,000 level, stronger economic conditions appear to be translating into higher capital outflows by Japanese investors, offsetting the currency impact from the increase in foreign equity inflows. ""For the yen to gain more decisively, we need to see a more active rotation in favour of the Nikkei by Japanese investors and not just by foreign investors,"" said analysts at UBS. The dollar fell 0.9 per cent against the yen to a low of Y110.98 before recovering to trade at Y111.36. The euro traded 0.2 per cent stronger against the yen at Y135.91.

The latest spike in crude and oil product prices in response to the threat from Hurricane Rita was one factor contributing to dollar weakness on Wednesday after the FOMC warned that rising energy prices could push inflation higher. Trading against the Swiss Franc followed a similar pattern with the dollar weakening 1 per cent to reach a low of SFr1.2684 before recovering slightly to trade at SFr1.2712. The Candian dollar remains the strongest performer among the major currencies reaching a near 14 year high against the dollar recently. The currency has received support as Canada is a major supplier of natural gas to the US and has benefitted from higher gas prices following the recent hurricane-induced disruptions. Also foreign demand for Canadian equities appears to have picked up as the Canadian market is resource rich, again providing support for the currency. Against the Canadian dollar, the greenback traded at C$1.1672. More generally, traders said the reaction in the major currencies to the hawkish tone of the FOMC statement was surprisingly muted.

In the UK, the minutes of the September meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee were much as expected showing the MPC voted unanimously to keep interest rates unchanged. The MPC identified two broad areas of risk. Firstly, that weaker demand could result in lower GDP growth which in turn would put downward pressure on inflation. Second there were upside risks to projections for inflation as energy prices could rise further. ""We still judge the MPC's growth forecasts are too optimistic,"" said Philip Shaw of Investec Securities: ""However, while the committee frets over inflation, it is unlikely to cut rates and we see policy remaining on hold for the remainder of this year."" Sterling traded fractionally stronger against the dollar at $1.8079. The Norwegian central bank meets today with a quarter point increase in interest rates to 2.25 per cent expected by some analysts.

The Norwegian Krone traded slightly weaker against the euro at NKr7.7810 ahead of the announcement. In Japan, although the Nikkei recently broke through the 13,000 level, stronger economic conditions in Japan appear to be translting into higher capital outflows by Japanese investors which are more than offsetting the currency impact from the increase in foreign equity inflows.

As it became apparent that the Fed's assessment of the economy was similar to the previous time, the indices came down to this week's comfort zone on Wall Street: the flat line. The Dow Jones Industrial Average ended barely changed at 10,385.48, while the broader S&P 500 index was 0.1 per cent lower at 1,162.90. The technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite index edged off 0.4 per cent at 2,034.56, under pressure from a disappointing quarterly earnings report from Cisco Systems. The Fed reiterated its view that even after yesterday's rate increase, ""the stance of monetary policy remains accommodative"". Its policy- making Federal Open Market Committee also reaffirmed its commitment to tightening monetary policy at a ""measured"" pace, barring any changes in the economy that could jeopardise price stability. However, it described inflationary risks as ""well-contained"" in both the long and the short term. While yesterday's rate increase was expected, economists are now debating whether the Fed will repeat it in December, or pause its current cycle of tightening. Rory Robertson, interest rates strategist at Macquarie, said last week's blockbuster job creation data ""have made the need for the pause in December less obvious"". Francois Trahan, chief investment strategist at Bear Stearns, agreed that ""a tighter labour market only increases the likelihood of more Fed tightenings"" and pushed the thesis further, noting that ""future hikes can only compound the problem for stocks in 2005"". Mr Trahan sees the monetary policy outlook as one of several challenges faced by the US equity market. Another is technical resistance for the S&P 500 index at the 1,160 level. The mix of factors causes him to conclude: ""We expect the equity market rally of the past few weeks to go the way of previous ones and run out of steam shortly."" Meanwhile William Livesey, the chief technical analyst at CyberTrader, cautioned that recent intraday trading moves point to the end of a trend for stocks. ""If the market doesn't show some life soon the recent rally may be in trouble,"" he said. Crude oil futures rose after weekly data on petroleum inventories showed a rise in crude oil inventories but a decline in distillate products such as heating oil.

The policymaking Federal Open Market Committee reiterated that policy stance ""remains accommodative"" and that it expected to raise rates ""at a pace that is likely to be measured"". The Fed's rate increase and the limited changes to its statement were widely expected, and financial markets were little changed. Italy's government last night appeared to raise the prospect of co-ordinated central bank intervention to stabilise the euro, highlighting European nervousness about the impact of its rise against the dollar on the eurozone's fragile recovery. Domenico Siniscalco, economy minister, was quoted by several news agencies as saying ""a co-ordinated intervention is being talked about again, not a unilateral intervention."" Mr Siniscalco later sought to clarify his remarks, telling the Financial Times he had merely been talking about the need to co-ordinate policy on the euro at the level of the Group of Seven industrial nations. He said he meant simply that ""unilateral action makes no sense"" and made clear he had no knowledge of any intervention plans. Rob Nichols, US Treasury spokesman, said: ""I can affirm there has been absolutely no change in US policy in this area. We believe that currency values should be set in open and competitive markets."" In its statement, the Fed said ""output appears to be growing at a moderate pace despite the rise in energy prices, and labour market conditions have improved"". At its last meeting, the committee had indicated that the economy had ""regained some traction"" following the energy price rise and that labour market conditions had improved modestly. Some economists took that as a more positive statement on growth and the labour market. Others noted the Fed's characterisation of output growth as moderate. The Fed in effect left its options open. It provided no hint of an upcoming pause or a change in its strategy, but committee members have made clear that the measured pace language is not a commitment to raise rates at each meeting. ""The most important message is that the committee said that policy remains accommodative,"" said Dean Maki, economist at JPMorgan Chase in New York. There has been widespread speculation that the Fed will leave rates on hold at its December meeting, although following the strong October payroll report released on Friday the futures markets have priced in the probability of another rate in increase at the meeting. Ten regional Federal Reserve Banks requested a quarter-point increase in the discount rate to 3 per cent, but the San Francisco and Dallas Feds did not. This is not necessarily any indication of a dissenting view, although Janet Yellen, president of the San Francisco Fed and non-voting member of the FOMC, stressed the downside risks to the growth outlook in a recent speech. The federal funds rate, at 2 per cent, is still seen as well below the level seen as consistent with price stability over time. The central bank is likely to press ahead with rate increases while there is no sign that tighter monetary policy risks destabilising the economy.

He said he meant simply that ""unilateral action makes no sense"" and made clear he had no knowledge of any intervention plans. But his comments followed the unexpected change in tone earlier this week by Jean-Claude Trichet, president of the European Central Bank, when he drew attention to the suddenness of the rise of the euro. Last night the ECB said it had ""no comment"" on Mr Siniscalco's remarks. But Ken Wattret, economist at BNP Paribas, said the Italian government ""had let the cat out of the bag"" and that it was probable that the ECB had discussed the possibility of intervention. Mr Siniscalco's remarks came as the US Federal Reserve yesterday raised its target interest rate by a quarter point to 2 per cent, the fourth consecutive increase since the Fed's June meeting. The policymaking Federal Open Market Committee left its accompanying statement largely unchanged from September's meeting. It said that following yesterday's rate increase its policy stance ""remains accommodative"" and that the committee expected to be able to raise rates ""at a pace that is likely to be measured"".

Mervyn King, governor of the Bank of England, said the existence of half the world with semi-fixed exchange rates against the dollar and others with floating rates was causing big conceptual problems in the management of the world economy. Presenting the Bank's latest Inflation Report yesterday, he said: ""The difficulty is that any adjustment of the dollar is likely to fall against the currencies which float against the dollar, and the biggest is the euro, and this burden of adjustment should be spread more widely.""

973,479.0,2009-03-19,"Traders struggle to make sense of plan Thirty-year Treasury bond yields gyrated wildly yesterday as traders struggled to make sense of the Federal Reserve's plans for buying government debt. The yield on the 30-year bond plunged as much as 42 basis points to 3.38 per cent after the Federal Open Market Committee said it had ""decided to purchase up to $300bn of longer-term Treasury securities over the next six months"". But the yield subsequently rose sharply in response to a statement issued 25 minutes later by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York that was meant to clarify the central bank's buying plans. The New York Fed said its open market desk - which trades bonds with dealers - ""will concentrate purchases in the two- to 10-year sector of the nominal Treasury curve, although purchases will occur across the nominal Treasury and TIPS yield curves."" Traders dumped 30-year bonds in response, sending the yield back to 3.70 per cent. By contrast, yields for the five-, seven- and 10-year notes did not experience a similar rise. ""A lot of people got twisted up in the curve,"" said Rick Klingman, managing director at BNP Paribas. ""Long-term Treasuries, to dealers, implies securities between 10 and 30 years."" By late yesterday, the yield on the 30-year bond had fallen back to 3.52 per cent. That was down 28bp for the day. In contrast, the 10-year note was down 51bp to 2.49 per cent, near its low for the day late in New York, while the seven-year note was down 54bp at 2.08 per cent. ""There is a slight bit of confusion at this point about exactly what part of the curve the Fed will be targeting,"" said Ted Wieseman, economist at Morgan Stanley. In general, the Fed move to buy Treasuries was a major shock for dealers, as Fed officials had downplayed such an action in recent speeches. Moreover, many traders had expected pressure on the Fed to buy Treasuries would only emerge should 10-year yields rise towards 3.5 per cent. John Spinello, strategist at Jefferies & Co said: ""The market had expected the Fed would focus on buying more mortgages and not target the purchase of Treasuries at their current yield levels.""

975,481.0,2009-03-19,"The following is an edited transcript of an interview between Chris Giles and Norma Cohen of the Financial Times and Spencer Dale, chief economist of the Bank of England, held on March 19 2009 FT: I suppose we should start with the economy. We're now a month on from the inflation report. What do you think has changed? How bad is it? SD: In absolute terms, it's bad. Output fell by 1.5% in Q4 and it looks like it's going to fall by a similar amount in Q1. So in the absolute sense, it's bad. I don't think the data since the February inflation report has changed the picture that much, and in some sense, I think are consistent with the broad story which was told in the inflation report, which was, first of all, the gradual easing in the rate of contraction during the middle of this year, so it's continuing falls in Q1 and starting to see some sort of easing in the rate of contraction, and with the possibility of some signs of recovery by the turn of the year. And that was the central view in February. And I think the data, since then, has been largely consistent with that. Now, it's one month's data and who knows, but it's been largely consistent with that. FT: The estimates in the February inflation report suggest that at the end of Q1, we are three quarters of the way through the contraction, as far as my estimate of your quarterly path goes. Do you think we are three quarters of the way through the recession? SD: It's very hard to say so I'm not going to, it's difficult to know. A story, in the central view, which is there's contraction coming through and a gradual recovery by the turn of the year as a significant stimulus that plays out would suggest that we've seen a substantial amount of the total contraction we're going to see has come through. But, A, there is a clear downside risk to that and, B, I think your question was framed in terms of recession. And I always get worried about recessions because statisticians can have one view of recessions and if people are losing their jobs or houses, they can have a very different view of recessions. And so I worry about being too particular and too technical about contractions about, but I think in a central view, we would have seen a substantial amount of the contraction that we expect to see by the time we get through the first half of this year. FT: And the IMF forecasts, although this is obviously unofficial at the moment, are worse than the central view, and I think actually worse than the mean of your forecasts. So they had in mind 3.8 and a very small negative number for 2010 which suggests a fall in output, through the whole of this year. Do you feel that's then a slightly too negative view? SD: I don't want to comment on the IMF data because I haven't seen the IMF data. It's one of those worlds where, I think the press think they've seen the IMF data but we certainly haven't because I don't think they're finalised yet. They certainly haven't been published yet so I can't comment on their data. I guess there are two stories here. The fundamental story is that we have a significant amount of stimulus feeding through this economy, partly related to the b monetary and fiscal stimulus we've seen and the support provided by the banking package. And then on top of that, the reduction we've seen in sterling and the reduction that we've seen in energy commodity prices. You add all those up; the scale of that stimulus is significant and significantly greater than that seen in comparable points in previous recessions. So that's why, in some sense, all forecasters are going to have a view of recovery at some point. And then we're asking, how quickly does it come through? And I guess point number one of that is, it's hugely uncertain and there are risks. I think one reason why I think my view is the data, thus far, has come in consistent with the view that we will start to see this easing in the pace of contraction through this year, and there are gradual signs of recovery, are the data since February report have been consistent with that. They saw the basic components of that. One is, we do see, we've seen a substantial de-stocking in the Q4 data, so a significant part of the falling out in Q4, which related to stock building. We know that, for stock building to continue to make that sort of contribution to growth, we need firms to keep running down their stocks at ever increasing rates - we know that can't happen. So just arithmetically, at some point, we would expect that stock cycle to come to an end as stocks get back to more normal levels. I don't know how much thought or what the IMF's view is, or other people's views are on that stock cycle. So that's one aspect. I think some other bits, you can point to some of the indicators which do seem to have started to stabilise and the key output stabilises; CIPS services indicators, they've stopped falling for three months. One can talk about the retail sales data that has held up a little bit better. You know, there are a number of pieces of data which are weak, in any absolute sense, but they're not continuing to get weaker and weaker, which is what you would expect to see. Who knows about the precise pattern? And I think I feel more confident about the fact that we will see a gradual recovery. There's no precise timing, but I think some of these components you can point to. The other thing in the Q4 data which is encouraging was the contribution from net trade, where particularly on the import side, there are signs, when you look at what's happening to the pattern of expenditure and relative to imports, it appears that you start to see some signs of expenditure switching from foreign produced output to domestic output. It's exactly the role we'd expect the exchange rate to play both in terms of imports and exports, and there were signs of that in the data as well. FT: I suppose if you were to play devil's advocate, you would point to other bits of data like the manufacturing or the industrial production data which was very weak at the start of Q1. And the downward revisions to other countries, so we would expect that exports, even if imports are falling very fast, exports are also going to be falling pretty fast. And so our international contribution to growth is probably worse than we thought a little while ago. How do you see the downside risks at the moment? SD: I think there are two or three downside risks. One downside risk clearly is what's happening in the world, and I wouldn't disagree with you that, on balance, the data about the world, the global outlook since February has been to the downside. The somewhat encouraging aspect of that is my impression from going to international meetings, and this was consistent with the governor's read from the G20 which he mentioned in his speech the other day, was when you sit around a table with other policy makers from other countries, you do get the impression that there's a very clear understanding of the need for policy makers to respond boldly and decisively to what's going on. So I think the world economy is a risk but that risk is mitigated somewhat by the determination of policy makers, and I think that was, a good example of that is in terms of the FOMC's decision yesterday. That's one risk. The second risk, which is another global risk, but it's both here and abroad, is in terms of the speed with which we manage to stabilise the banking system and get normal levels of bank lending happening again, and the financial markets stabilised. If we end up with a more sluggish recovery, that could be one strong candidate. If we were at a year's time and it was lower, and you say well, where did you go wrong? That would be one. And I think the third thing where it could go wrong is just the confidence effects. I think a key part of understanding the dynamic of the slowdown thus far is that we've seen a fall off in confidence. And the ability of policy makers, I think at the moment, part of what policy makers do is, they need to do the fundamental policies in the right way to stimulate demand, but also they need to make sure that they communicate those policies in such a way so as to provide reassurance to households and corporates about the future. FT: Was the trans-Atlantic spat between Finance Ministers over whether they were doing sufficient fiscal stimulus and other stimulus last week helpful in terms of communication? SD: I wasn't involved in the G20 thing at all so I can't comment on whether there was a spat or anything about that. FT: What can policy makers do to create confidence? What is the right strategy? You've done a lot of work on communications. What is the right thing to do? SD: One aspect of what to do is to go out and communicate more clearly and more urgently about your view of the economy. I think you have to tell it straight. Things are bad at the moment. Output is falling. Unemployment is rising. I think you have to tell that straight. But then you also have to say this is what we are doing about it and this is why we think we will gradually start to see signs of recovery towards the end of this year. And explain that outlook and explain the policy actions you're doing to that. I think there's also a potential role, and this is more a potential fiscal policy role than a monetary policy role, but you can think about designing policies which help to provide safety nets in the case of bad events. So for example, in a world where confidence is low and uncertainty is high, it makes sense for, households and corporates may start to behave quite cautiously - financial pull back in investments, households increase their cautionary savings, and for some households and corporates, that's a very sensible and prudent thing to do. They should do that. But the risk is, in a world where confidence is low, far more people behave in that way than actually are likely to be affected by the economy, and that acts to exacerbate the downturn. And so one role for policy makers is to find that safety net. An example of that would be the mortgage holiday that the government announced where if you go through a period of temporary hit to income, that you have ability to defer mortgage interest payments for a couple of years. That may end up providing reassurance to far more households than will actually ever use the policy, so it can provide that sort of reassurance aspect. I think the primary thing is for policy makers to do their jobs properly, which is to be clear, set the right policies and be clear and transparent in explaining why they think they will work. But then we also want to think about the design of some policies to help act as a safety net. FT: Can you think that, your characterisation of what some households might be doing, that it's right for some to be cautious but for others, they may actually be exacerbating the downturn. Is that a sense of what is happening at the moment? SD: I'm not sure that you can see, that you would point to many things at the moment to suggest it's happening at the moment. I think, compared with many commentators, and compared to my own priors, retail sales data over December, January period have held up stronger than you would have thought. If you look at consumer confidence measures, they've tended to pick up. And it's striking that the components of the consumer confidence measures, which have picked up most, are the forward looking components. That may help people feel more confident about their own personal situation I don't think I'm seeing it (the detrimental effects of excessive savings) yet, but I think it's a risk. FT: And is there excessive saving among companies, because investments have fallen? SD: Investment has fallen. Investment retention remains very low. Now, in a world where you expect output to be pretty sluggish, your capacity within your firm is pretty comfortable at the moment and credit conditions are tight. It would be odd if investment retentions were bullish. It's not obvious that they seemed to have moved by and extreme amount. And again, you can point to some of the most recent surveys where business confidence has come off its real low levels. All these measures remain absolutely low but they don't seem to be showing continual falls. You're not seeing that in some of those indicators. FT: Both you and the Governor have now said that you're doing more in terms of stimulus than in any time in the bank's history. Do you have a rule of thumb or something that gives us a sense of, in normal times, how much of a boost to both growth and inflation all the bits of stimulus would deliver? These range from monetary, fiscal and everything that's going on, low energy prices - there are a lot of things - how big is that and what would we think about that? And then how have our thoughts changed given the financial crisis? SD: No, is the answer. I don't. And it's hard because a lot of these stimuli are themselves in response to the shocks that we are facing. Therefore, the mechanisms by which they're responding are different. So I don't think it's simple to say that demand shock is doing this, the stimulus is doing that, and you add them up and you get to a number. I'm not sure I can think of a way of doing that. FT: Okay. But in normal times, it is large. And you go around saying it's a largest in 300 years, so you must have a sense… SD: I think the Governor has talked about the actions. It is up to the Governor to say what he says. But the point I made was the stimulus, as a whole, in terms of monetary, fiscal, exchange rate, the falls in commodity prices - we had a nice little table in the last inflation report - when compared with previous recessions and it's just very large. Now, the impact of a bank rate cut when spreads are rising and firms aren't lending is somewhat less. So you have to offset the effect of that stimulus. But in some sense, that's a shock to which you're responding, and that's why I'm reluctant to try and give any rule of thumb because I'm not sure I meaningfully can. FT: Does this mean that it's actually very hard for us and you to have any faith in your monetary [?] output and your inflation and growth forecasts because really, we don't know either the demand side or the stimulus side? Are we pretty much in the dark?. SD: No. All economic forecasts are uncertain. Are you telling me I'm certain about my forecast? No. I'm completely uncertain and if anything, we're more uncertain at the moment than in normal times. And I think the Bank has consistently bored you and many others explaining the importance of thinking about forecasts of distributions and the importance of stressing risks and so on. That remains even more the case now than before. All I'm saying is I think if you ever ask me to tell, at any point, in any forecast, can you separate out, into a forecast where you're taking all the different components together, can you parcel out each of those effects and would you have confidence? I don't think I would. FT: But you are thinking of different interest rates paths, so you do have…? SD: Yes, so I can do that one experiment, yes. FT: If you can't do that, you must have vague rules of thumb in your mind. We know the stimulus is big, and I don't want to belabour the point. But if you're trying to raise confidence and make sure that people don't become depressed about how badly the economy and you want to do it at a time when it does look very difficult, it is important to have some sense of how big it is. And I've been trying to ask a lot of policy makers… SD: Have they already given you an answer yet? FT: They've tried. SD: What I could do, and I don't have the numbers to hand; I could run experiments where I could say suppose, just holding everything else constant, commodity and oil prices fell, that increases purchasing power of families, what would that do to consumption? Hold that. And then I could do the next bit. I could add all that up. I must admit, for a household who is concerned about unemployment and worried about their job, they may find that a bit of an odd thing. They may think it odd to hear that they are better off and that their consumption should rise when they may be completely different in a world where they're thinking about the fact that their house has lost value and the guy down the road has lost his job. FT: I'm not going to continue asking the same question you won't answer. Saving on households, you've said that you've been rather surprised that retail sales have been holding up. Do we trust the ONS retail numbers now? Are we more confident in those relative to the retailers? And is it the time to expect a big rise in savings in more households now? SD: The ONS data, I think the values data for the ONS, the discrepancy between that and the surveys in recent months has lessened, and so I think all data, we tend to place weight on both. But the discrepancy between those two has lessened in terms of the values data. The reason why I'm stressing this value volumes thing is we know that the deflator used by the ONS is, the weights are out of date and they will be revised, and that when they are revised, it is very likely that the volumes data will be revised down. And so in some sense, I know that now and I'm taking that into account, but it's important, so I'm not going to be surprised with the volumes data… FT: It goes down backwards as well [?], will they? SD:Yes. FT: But even though some of the retail sales data and industry surveys were not as bad as expected, it is clear that demand for durable goods and even intermediate goods is still very weak, if not still falling. Does that concern you, the fact that big ticket items are not going on sale? Big ticket items don't appear to be to be moving in this economy.. SD: In some sense, I had expected part of the contraction output I expect to see, and have seen, I think is a function of consumption falling. And relative to that benchmark, the surprising thing is that retail sales haven't come off more. The durables consumption in some sense was part of the story, just as I was expecting to see. And I think what we need to see further ahead is what is going to happen to the savings ratio? Are we just seeing different parts of the consumption basket adjusting in different ways or, as is sometimes the case, that the durables consumption is reacting more quickly to shocks, and you're going to see this permeate into other types of consumption? And I think that's a key risk and that's exactly the key risk I was talking about earlier. If we see a substantial rise in the savings ratio - and we do expect the savings ratio to pick up - or put another way, if we see households reacting to the increasing uncertainty by increasing the levels of savings, they want to save for, buffer stops and save for rainy days, that will cause the recovery to be delayed and postponed. FT: Is there a level of savings rates that you would regard as troubling, say a pattern that emerged similar to that of the 1990s, post the 1990s recession? SD: No, because again, and I know I'm not very helpful here but it all depends on the context in what it's doing, so I don't think there's any one variable. But if we saw it shooting up and up, and nothing else is filling its place, then clearly that's going to mean that demand growth is less than you would otherwise have. And that's, in terms of our desire to stimulate normal demand, that's going to be problematic. FT: You set QE according to your sense of the outlook, and presumably some sense of the most likely outlook? What will you do if things get worse despite QE? SD: We do more. The purpose of QE is just like the purpose of setting interest rates more generally, or the monetary policy more generally. We do whatever it takes in order to hit the inflation target. If the economy does not respond enough, the thought experiment is exactly the same with interest rates. If you learn that the demand shock is greater than you think it is, then you will act on that policy and take the actions accordingly, in order to achieve the objective. FT: What's your sense of how QE is most likely to work to boost nominal spending? There are many channels that you have, which are the important ones? SD: Right. Again, my primary answer to that question is, 'I'm not sure'. I will give you a more helpful answer as well, but my general philosophy going into this is to be incredibly pragmatic and eclectic. We don't know the pace and the relative size of these different channels, and we're going to learn about that. We should enter this as an approach, rather than saying, 'This one is going to work and this one doesn't work and we're going to push on this rather than that.' In my view, we should go in saying, 'We'll see and we'll learn, and we'll adjust accordingly.' Now, let me help you out a little bit more, by saying what sort of different channels am I hoping to see, and I guess mine are a bit hard, because they're not completely distinct. I think that there are three different channels through which this can operate. First, we're buying gilts on the curve, and that's caused yield already on the curve to fall quite significantly. Over time, that's going to lead to a reallocation of investors' portfolios into other types of assets, such as corporate bonds. That will then, in principle lead to a lowering in the yields on those other types of borrowing, and a corresponding increase in the price of assets. That has a story where borrowing rates available to household and corporates should come down in line. The second channel is we've increased significantly the degree of liquidity in the economy. That liquidity by itself may help to stimulate borrowing and lending, so banks' deposits are likely to increase substantially as a result, as a first line of these asset purchases. They now have a ready source of funding to finance additional borrowing, if they wish. As this liquidity permeates out to the corporate sector, companies may feel less hindered by the need to haul liquidity and make them feel more comfortable undertaking certain types of spending, investment decisions. Liquidity is improved, so that's the second channel. And, the third channel is the purchases we're making of private sector assets, to improve the functioning of corporate markets. If they're successful, then you have proven that liquidity in those corporate markets should enable firms to be able to (improve). The availability of credit to corporates will improved, and allows firms to more easily raise finance via those capital markets at lower spending costs. That again has a cost channel effect, and also it helps to take some of the pressure off the banks as well. So, they're my three channels for which…now, I think many people would have other variants, but they're the three that I can fit various other things in. FT: And, in those, how do you think it's going in those three areas so far? SD: I'm afraid we can't say very much. It's a bit like saying when we change bank rates and after a week, we say, how is it going? FT: We've seen corporate bonds [overtalking]. SD: But, there's encouraging bits of news. We can't say much but there are some encouraging signs. I guess I would say there were three encouraging signs. Let me just…the first one isn't quite a price thing, but it relates to some of the communication things we were saying earlier. The reception, the reaction to the announcement, both by the financial markets and the public more generally, I think, has been pretty measured. People seem to understand what we're trying to do and why we're trying to do it, and that, I think, is an encouraging thing. I think it's an encouraging development. Some people have criticised the policy, of course. Some say we do too much, some say we're not doing enough and that's only right and proper. But I think I'm encouraged by the general measured and informed reaction. Secondly, we have seen gilt yields respond to the announcement at our initial purchases. Gilt yields are down, depending on where you look at the curve, by about 60 to 80 basis points, and if you look at non-financial corporate bond yields, they're down 30 to 50 basis points. You've already got some of the impacts feeding through into lower funding costs. The third thing is in terms of our operations within specific credit markets, we announced today our corporate bond scheme, and we put a market notice out today, explaining the operations, and those operations start next week. Within the commercial paper market, it seems to be having the sort of effects we want, in the market intelligence and the analysis we're doing shows people are able to issue commercial paper at tighter spreads than was the case before. We've had companies coming up to us, saying,' I wasn't sure whether to issue my commercial paper directly to you, or into the market, so I've actually decided to do it into the market, because I can actually get the paper away at the same price at which you were offering, which a month ago would have been impossible,'. I think we are starting to see some of those dividends. FT: Are you hearing from businesses in some of the really hard pressed sectors that they are able to finance more easily? SD: The people we're speaking to are those who are registered with our scheme to issue commercial… FT: Those are existing commercial paper issuers, right? SD: They don't have to be existing, because they can join the scheme. They don't have to be. There is no rule here, which I think may have been the rule in some other countries that you'd have to have an existing programme. You have to have a rating, so there's a process you have to go through, but there's nothing stopping a new firm going through that process. FT: There has been some speculation that the Bank might be uncomfortable with certain aspects of the asset purchase facility, because in effect it required you to take on credit risk. I realise that you're talking about high quality bonds, but I've been picking up that there was some discomfort about relying solely on credit ratings, or heavily on credit ratings in making your judgement. To what extent is this weighing on your considerations? SD: There are two issues here. One is, in terms of the credit risk, we have a government indemnity for all the risk associated with these operations, so in that sense, that's only right and proper and so it's not affecting, it won't have any risk to our balance sheet. I think more generally, the general point is many people's interpretation of what are the contributory factors to the general crisis we're going through at the moment is that rating agencies are fallible and that we need to find other ways. We shouldn't rely 100% on ratings. In that world, it would seem a bit odd if we set up new schemes and said,'All we're going to look at is the rating agency and they're perfect.' I think our response is just we know ratings aren't perfect, and we're going to use them, but we use other things as well as cross checks. I hope everybody will get to the point where they all think hard about ratings agencies and stop relying 100% on them. FT: I didn't think of that as one of your natural tasks. Are you going to outsource that in some way, or how are you going to do the analysis? I don't think there are corporate bond analysts at the Bank. SD: No, that's perfectly true. I think we developed some of those skills when we were doing the SLS, and I think we are buying in some of those skills as well. FT: Mm-hmm, from existing investment advisers? SD: Or via hiring people as well. FT: I see. SD: In terms of managing credit risk, you first of all work out the riskiness of the asset. That is the point you're making about the process we're going to use to do that. Then you then go out and you set the appropriate haircuts to cover you for that risk,. There's always clearly uncertainty in these things, so there's always a risk that you may suffer losses. But in principle, those haircuts over a period of time should provide sufficient compensation to cover for any individual losses. FT: Is it possible that the haircut that now exists in the market is exactly what is needed, and that you won't be able to offer spreads any better? SD: Okay, so this is a key point. What we're trying to do here is not affect credit spreads. What we're trying to do here is the over and above credit spreads, liquidity premia look high. For a plausible level of credit spreads, the overall spread just looks too big and what we're trying to do is not directly affect credit spreads, because that would seem an odd thing for us to try and second guess other people. What we're saying is for plausible estimates at credit spreads, the overall credit spread we're seeing is significantly greater than that and that reflects liquidity problems. What we're trying to do in each of these markets is not manage our credit spreads, but reduce the liquidity premium. FT: Can you decompose the spread into credit liquidity effectively, do you think? SD: You can do a whole range of different models. You can use things like Credit Default Swaps (CDSs) as one way of doing it. You can do fundamental analysis about the likelihood of default. You can do historical analysis of defaults in previous recessions and you can do a whole range and then you can cross, and you can get your best estimate. You can't perfectly do it, but there's a range of techniques which you can use to produce different estimates. FT: There have been suggestions, and in fact it said so in the minutes, that actually this asset purchase facility would be a very small part of the sum, and there was some suggestion that small meant 10 to 15 billion perhaps, but not much more than that. Are we right in thinking that? SD: So I think there's a danger of comparing apples and oranges when we're comparing the operation to increase the supply of money in the economy by buying assets and what we're trying to do in terms of the credit markets. What we're trying to do in terms of the credit market is improve liquidity. Now, in lovely textbook models, if a person comes along with huge pockets and said, 'I'm all trading this market and increasing liquidity,', they end up never having to actually buy anything, because just the knowledge that they stand ready means everybody starts trading with each other and its success. FT: And, what do you think you can do? SD: I'm not suggesting that we have unlimited, deep pockets and so on, but part of what we're doing here is, if we're successful, an element of success could correspond to us actually purchasing very few assets over a period of time. If the market has improved, liquidity has improved and (markets) can start to differ again, in that world that would be a definition of success,. It is not a definition of somehow the programme is not pulling it's weight or being important,. The amount of assets we're going to have to purchase to generate that, we don't know that yet. But it shouldn't be seen as an indicator of its relative importance. FT: Now, from your perspective, thinking about QE generally speaking, it's most ideal if the people who tender their bonds to you are not banks, ultimately, they're investors. Do you have measures in place to figure out who the ultimate tenders are? SD: We have a whole range of different indicators. As you well know, via the auctions, we buy it via the gilt-edged market makers so we don't observe (end sellers) that directly. We have a whole range of indicators, including market intelligence, where we're going out and just speaking to people, and finding it out, so over a period of time, I think we will learn who these sellers are. FT: Yes, I had talked to some of the institutional holders of bonds who said that their bids weren't being taken up. They thought that your initial auctions may have consisted of quite a bit of loose stock, and I just wondered whether you had some measures in place to either tilt your auction to ensure that you get it from those who are not the depositors. In other words, to put it into the hands of those who are likely to recycle it in some way? SD: No, so I don't think we're going to tilt the auctions in one way or another, because I think the nature of the auction is it's impossible to know who those investors are, if they're dealing via an intermediary. I guess I'd make two points. My understanding is that bank holdings of gilts are pretty minimal compared to the amounts we're doing. Therefore the risk that we're going to buy a substantial amount of gilts from banks, I don't think is likely. Secondly, to the extent that banks do hold gilts, they will tend to hold shorter maturity gilts. We're not buying gilts with a maturity of less than five years. Part of the reason why we chose the maturity ranges was to ensure that there was less chance of us buying gilts from banks. I think those two reasons mean I am reassured that this is not a first order issue. FT: And, the reason you don't want to buy from banks, is that just because of the money market channel, or the channel that they will buy another asset? SD: Well… FT: Because it's going to end up in a bank anyway? SD: Yes, one way of characterising this is by not purchasing from the banks you know almost certainly you're going to get an increase in bought [?] money and so you can then start with those types of channels, and start to offer that. FT: Yeah, but you get an increase in M4 anyway, if you bought from a bank? SD: No, I don't think you do. But, more generally, by going to non-bank investors, there's less chance that if banks are catching the strain at the moment and aren't keen to lend out, there's clearly some risk that the banks won't actually lend out those funds. If we are able, and if we start dealing with non-banks, that mitigates that issue. We start to see this reallocation of the rest of the portfolio, which we were talking about. FT: One of the things that you were just talking about, brings up the whole issue of exit strategy. If you could just be the guy with deep pockets and you don't actually have to do anything, just the announcement effect solves everything. In terms of exit strategies, how quickly can you roll back QE, do you think? SD: As quickly as we put it in, and I think that's really important. So, the inflation target is symmetric, therefore our behaviours have to be symmetric. We will need to be equally as bold and decisive when we're withdrawing this thing as it is when we put it in. The key point of what we're doing here is trying to hit the inflation objective, the inflation target objective. That's the whole raison d'etre of QE and therefore the amount of QE we've been doing and the automatic purchases we carry out initially will be a function of our view of the medium term outlet of inflation, and how it relates to the inflation target. Likewise, the time at which we start taking the stimulus out, by combination of both reversing the assets with purchases and also by raising bank rates will be a function of the outlook relative to the inflation targets. The good news is as an exit strategy, that's very open, it's transparent and it's open to public scrutiny by people such as yourself. You can hold us to account, to make sure that we are behaving exactly the way we say we are. FT: But you're sort of talking about auctions of five or six billion a week? SD: Yes, but my view is that just because you (used) bank rates at some sort of effective way around and then started QE doesn't mean, I think, you have to go back in the same way. If the market sees ordering reasons, there's a limit on the pace of which you sell back gilts. Then you can raise bank rates at the same time. FT: How will you know when it's time to roll back? What will you look for, to tell you that QE has worked and now is the time to roll back? SD: Our forecast for inflation will be sustained, that if we don't roll back, we'll overshoot the inflation target, so I'm sorry, I know it's a bit of a banal answer to your question, but ultimately all of this will be judged by the outlook for inflation targets, just like all other monetary policy actions. FT: Would you expect, for instance, would you be looking at things like M4 stripped out for interbank transactions? Is it guidelines like that to tell you this is working? SD: I don't think our approach to analysing the economy is going to be substantially different to before, so if you had come to me a year ago and asked what key factors are you going to look at, to decide when you're going to cut rates, I would have said, I can't tell you, because I'm going to look at the whole economy. I am going to look at it in that context, and we'll see what that says about the medium term outlook for inflation and we'll make that judgement. That is true when we're reversing this policy as well. I think there's potential for misunderstanding. That is because particular variables, like nominal demands, having increased in importance and somehow that now becomes a key indicators of what we're trying to do. I don't think that's right. I think at any one point in time in the economy, when you're looking at particular shocks you must try to understand the nature of that shock. You focus on a particular variable. That doesn't mean that variable has suddenly risen in status and has become some sort of intermediate target or some key indicator. Rather it's when you're trying to understand the nature of that shock, you focus on it at the moment. The nature of the monetary and credit contraction we're seeing at the moment means the growth brought of credit, the growth of nominal demand are key features in understanding the nature of the shock. That is why we're going to look at those, but the general approach to policy is exactly the same as always. We look at all the variables and take a view about the medium term outlook. FT: Can you envisage a world…is this impossible, that you could have QE to be very effective on nominal demand and very ineffective on real demand? So, that we get real demand being extremely sluggish, maybe even contracting, but we get a lot of inflation and not much growth? So, the nominal demand doesn't actually have any real effect? SD: I think that what a Central Bank can do is stimulate nominal demand. What it's harder for it to do is control in a dynamic sense, and in a transitional sense the price volume split of that. We can help make sure that the inflation component comes out right by having a credible policy. That means that people's inflationary expectations are anchored around 2%. I think the likelihood of the sort of outcomes you're describing will depend in part on your view about the nature of the shocks affecting the economy at the moment. They depend to what extent are some of the adjustments we're seeing real adjustments. There's an adjustment in household balance sheet, which is the real thing, and monetary policy can make sure that adjustment is a smooth process, but it can't avoid that process. It that is a necessary adjustment in real spending? Will it give you a different path that is more likely than the split here.. FT: If, let's say, in a year or two's time we've had 2% inflation, so the inflation target has been hit perfectly but no growth at all, how would that make you as policy makers feel? SD: We'd be very uncomfortable. If you said to me now, would that be an acceptable outcome, if we hit the inflation target, I think the answer would be no. But then what we'd then have to understand is why that is. What is going on, and what factors are causing the real economy to be so weak, and is there a role for monetary policy to play there. If not, what other policies should we be doing? FT: Well, I just wanted to ask about something else about counter cyclical capital requirements. I don't know of anyone in the world who actually disagrees with the idea of it as the great new hope of banking regulation for the future. I guess it's for regulators to decide who has their fingers on the levers. But in another situation like we've just been in, where monetary policy is control and demand, and let's say everything works as we liked. Wouldn't the body controlling those counter cyclical requirements be in effect setting monetary policy because it would have the ability to control interest rates paid by households and businesses. That is because banks are profit maximising institutions and would price their loans to take account of higher capital requirements. SD: So, I am not sure about the separability proposition. I won't surprise you by being the first person in the world who disagrees with counter cyclical regulation. My view is that in terms of macro policy at the moment, there's a strong literature in understanding about the need for fiscal monetary coordination. I think what will go hand in hand with this developments is that we will bank regulators become more aware of the need for monetary regulatory coordination. I think the appropriate setting of bank rate will be a function of what is going on in terms of the regulatory authorities. If the regulatory authorities are behaving in such a way as to affect the volume and price at which credit is being offered, that will clearly have implications for monetary policy. That is why we need to have coordination. I think that argument is distinct from the idea which I also agree with, that bank rates alone are not a very good instrument to tackle these things with. The fact that it's not a very good instrument or a very effective instrument to try and tackle some of these problems doesn't mean it's entirely independent of it. Does that make sense? FT: So, on the first of those, are you saying that on monetary policy - and tell me if this is wrong - that you would want to lean against the wind, if the regulatory authorities were too lax? That you would want to set the bank rate to move accordingly? SD: What I was saying was in an ideal world, when the regulatory authorities were doing what you wanted them to do, that would have implications, just like the degree of fiscal stimulus has implications for bank rates. Likewise the nature of the regulatory authority and the extent to which that was being changed in response to risks would affect bank rates as well. FT: But, is that really a change from the past? Surely it's always been that way? SD: No, it's not a change from the past but if you move to a world where some aspects of the regulatory regime are designed explicitly in a classical way, that will be a different nature. The nature of the interaction will not fundamentally changed. It's just going to be heightened in importance. FT: So, you're saying that no, you wouldn't particularly see (monetary policy) leaning against the winds if the regulatory authorities fail? Or as we now believe they failed in the recent upswing, then you wouldn't now be thinking of setting tighter policy because bank rates are not the right tool? Do you hope that they would have had some tighter capital requirements or provision or whatever? SD: I'm saying that (monetary policy) remains our tool with contingency at bank rate to hit the inflation target. I remain of the view that bank rate is a pretty poor instrument to try and tackle some of these issues, and I hope as we go forward we learn from the errors we've made in the past that we get to a world where we have a regulatory regime better suited to avoid these sort of problems again. In the future, and all I was saying is, a corollary, an aspect of that will be a need for monetary and regulatory coordination. FT: Just to think through, so if the regulators or the authorities do set banking regulations such that it's tighter in the next upswing, how do you think that will affect interest rates, as faced by companies and households? Do you think that will affect those, if the spread over bank rates rise? SD: So, to an extent it does, to an extent that those regulatory regimes prevent banks or private pricing centres (from aggressive pricing) and that leads to an effective tightening, then yes. In that world, the appropriate start of bank rate would be different to a world where they won't be behaving that way. That is purely the point I was making. FT: Do you think that the channel through which monetary policy has worked in the past is going to be the same after this? SD: Yes, the fundamental structures of the economy can't change. The key channels through which the monetary policy operates won't change, but the appropriate setting of policy will be a function of other types of policies in existence. It is a function of fiscal policy and it's always been a function of the regulatory regime, but if the regulatory regime is being used in a more counter cyclical way, then that will have more direct feedback back onto the other bank rates.",FT interview: Spencer Dale,2009-03-18,The Financial Times
976,482.0,1996-05-22,"US equities hovered near to Monday's closing levels in midsession trade as investors awaited the conclusion of the Federal Reserve's Open Market Committee meeting, writes Lisa Bransten in New York. At 1pm, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was 8.13 stronger at 5,756.95, the Standard &Poor's 500 was up 2.16 at 675.31 and the American Stock Exchange composite gained 3.16 at 612.52. The technology-rich Nasdaq composite added 3.09 at 1,251.20. NYSE volume was 230m shares. Few on Wall Street expected the Fed to change interest rates at yesterday's FOMC meeting, but economists remained divided about the direction of interest rates through to the end of the year. Therefore, many were hopeful that the Fed would release some indication of its view of the economy at the conclusion of the meeting. Stocks derived little direction from the bond market, which was also relatively flat. Among individual shares, oil companies in the Dow gave up some of the strong gains made on Monday after the conclusion of the United Nations deal to allow Iraq to sell oil to raise money for humanitarian aid. Chevron retreated $1 1/4 to $60 3/4, Exxon shed $1 1/2 to $86 and Texaco receded $1 5/8 to $85 1/4. Wellpoint Health Networks, a California health maintenance organisation (HMO), soared $12 1/2 or 48% to $38 5/8 as the HMO's parent, Blue Cross of California, completed its conversion to a for-profit company. Wellpoint retains use of the Blue Cross name for marketing purposes and Blue Cross donated $3bn to two healthcare foundations in order to repay the citizens of California for tax benefits it received while it was a non-profit company. ValuJet shares climbed $1 5/8 or 14% to $12 7/8, regaining some of the ground lost in the days since one of the airline's DC-9s crashed in the Florida Everglades, in spite of news that one of the company's founders had sold 1.5m shares on Monday. The company said the shares were sold to satisfy margin debt. For a second consecutive day, shares in Iomega jumped amid optimism about a two-for-one stock split that took effect yesterday. Shares in the company, which makes computer disk drives, added $6 or 15% at $47 3/8. Dayton Hudson rose $3 or 3% to $105 after the retailer reported stronger than expected first-quarter earnings of 49 cents a share. The mean estimate from analysts was for closer to 43 cents a share.

977,483.0,1996-05-22,"The dollar yesterday rallied to a 16 month high against the D-Mark following verbal support for a stronger dollar from a senior Bundesbank official. Mr Olaf Sievert, a Bundesbank council member, provided the market with a signal to buy dollars when he told an audience in Leipzig that 'a rise of a few pfennigs in the dollar would be good for the German economy.' This took the dollar to an intra-day high of DM 1.5435 in Europe. It later closed in London at DM 1.5415, from DM 1.5347 on Monday. Against the yen it finished at Y 107.06, from Y 107.115. Earlier the dollar had been under some pressure following sceptical comments about European monetary union, which supported the D-Mark, from Mr Wilhelm Nolling, a former Bundesbank official. Sterling was a beneficiary of the firmer dollar, with the trade-weighted index finishing at 84.8, the highest level in the rally since hitting a historic low of 82.2 on November 20. Against the D-Mark it closed at DM 2.3331, from DM 2.3207. Against the dollar it finished at $1.5136 from $1.5122. Analysts pointed out that the three per cent rally in sterling effectively offset the 75 basis point cut in UK interest rates since last December. In Sweden, the central bank trimmed the repo rate to 6.5% from 6.7%. Activity was generally fairly subdued ahead of the meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee in the US, although there was little expectation of any shift in US interest rates. * The dollar's rally off historic lows last year against the yen and D-Mark has been so dogged that it has at times been possible to lose sight of the overall trend. But as recently as last October, the dollar was trading around DM 1.38, and in late February it was still down at DM 1.45. The dollar's rally looks more impressive when put into context. Mr Nick Parsons, currency strategist at Paribas Capital Markets, notes that for the first time in ten years the dollar has risen against the D-Mark for four quarters in succession. Against the yen, it has risen for three successive quarters, something not achieved since the dollar's great bull run ahead of the Plaza Accord in 1985. Economists at Merrill Lynch, meanwhile, note that from trough to peak, the dollar rallies of 1988-89, 1991 and 1992-93 each climbed by 20-25%. If the current dollar rally matches these gains, it will reach DM 1.65-70. Mr Brian Martin, economist at Barclays in London, said that while the trend towards 'gradual dollar appreciation' was clearly in place, it was in neither Germany or the US's interest to have the dollar appreciate faster. From the US perspective, there was the danger that it could hit export performance. Germany, meanwhile, depended on foreign bond purchases to finance its budget deficit, and hence 'had to be careful not to show that they favour longer term (inflationary) depreciation of the currency.' * While the market remains in favour of a stronger dollar, Mr Richard Koo, senior economist at the Nomura Research Institute in Tokyo, advances a speculative thesis as to why the US government might favour a weaker currency. Mr Koo's premise is that the priority of Mr Robert Rubin, the US treasury secretary, is to achieve the re-election of President Clinton. He speculates that this might best be achieved through a 'stable and weak dollar' which would be advantageous to Wall st - 'a weak dollar would encourage Japanese investment in the USA and low long term interest rates' - and to Main st (by making US exports more competitive). A key part of Mr Koo's argument is that unlike in the Eighties, when Japanese investors 'pursued rising values', they now buy when prices are low. Mr Koo presumes Mr Rubin will have noticed this fact, and hence will favour a weaker dollar. 'US investment will not become particularly popular amongst Japanese investors if the dollar merely breaks through the Y 105 level. A fully fledged interest in US investment will only rise amongst domestic (Japanese) investors once the dollar has broken through (below) Y 100.' 'A level between Y 90-100 is the most suitable in terms of its impact both on structural reform and the economy,' says Mr Koo. (c) The Financial Times Limited 1996.

Perceptions of a deteriorating global economy, increasing fears of a US-led strike against Iraq and worries about the grim outlook for corporate profitability dragged the main UK indices lower again, writes Steve Thompson, UK Stock Market Editor.

He said the prospect of a war in Iraq had increased significantly after the UK government provided evidence yesterday of Iraq's capacity to launch attacks with chemical and other weapons. Adding to the widespread pain being felt across the stock market was another confidence-sapping slide by Wall Street. The Dow Jones followed up Monday evening's 113 points retreat - having been down almost 200 points at one stage - with a further slide at the opening yesterday. The Dow lost a further 132 points before edging off its worst as London closed for the day, as the outcome of the latest meeting of the US Federal Reserve's open market committee meeting loomed up. Traders expected the FOMC to leave US interest rates on hold again. The US consumer confidence index for September was no worse than the market had been expecting and was said to have helped in slowing Wall Street's slide. The latter has been hit hard in recent sessions by an ever-growing list of profit warnings and disappointing results and news from leading US companies, the most recent of which came from Novellus Systems. The financial sectors of the market continued to take the worst pain, with the banks once again being sold aggressively on the view that a worsening global economy will bring with it corporate casualties and increasing bad debts. Insurance stocks, meanwhile, were hit again by fears that the almost relentless slide in equity markets will leave the insurance groups at the mercy of regulators and trigger forced selling. Confirmation of the rumoured £200m rights issue from British Insurance reminded the market of the need for more fundraising in the sector. Royal &Sun Alliance is expected to tap its shareholders for about £1bn in the very near future. Turnover in equities was 2.7bn shares. Bargain hunters descend Bargain hunters moved in to mop up shares in the UK's life insurers on Tuesday, after sector stocks had sunk to multi-year lows amid fresh fears that plunging equity markets will herald forced selling and more rights issues. But the mood lifted in late trade and Mikir Shah of Fox-Pitt, Kelton said: ""Investors have realised that these companies aren't insolvent, they are continuing to write new business and that valuations look attractive"". As aresult Prudential closed 6 higher at 339p, having sunk to its lowest level since April 1995 earlier in the day. Aviva firmed 4 to 345p, rebounding from levels last seen in January 1989. But composite insurer Royal &Sun Alliance still dipped 1 1/2 to 94p, its lowest since September 1984. Despite the mild fightback, the UK life insurance sector has fallen 53 per cent since January 1. Earlier there had been market speculation that insurers may be forced to sell equities if the FTSE 100 falls to 3,500. ""It is no accident that people are starting to think that 3,500 is going to be magic figure,"" said Chris Rathbone of Williams de Broe. The resilience test set by the Financial Services Authority may force insurers' hands. The FSA relaxed the test in June. Rather than having to be able to remain solvent even if equity markets fall 25 per cent from their current level, insurers now merely have to be able to cope with a 25 per cent fall from the three-month moving average. This gave insurers a temporary respite, but with the three-month moving average on the FTSE 100 now 4,211, compared to 5,066 when the FSA made its ruling on June 28, that respite is over. ""The relaxation gives some leeway in the short-term, but doesn't help in the long-term,"" said Richard Schreuder of Barclays Private Clients. Elsewhere banks suffered again, amid concerns over a rising tide of bad debts if the faltering global economic recovery brings more companies to their knees. Sentiment was further weakened by Lehman Brothers of the US chalking up third-quarter net earnings of just 70 cents a share, compared to consensus expectations of 85 cents. Major fallers included Barclays, off 11 1/4 at 355p, HBOS, down 17 at 624 1/2p, and Royal Bank of Scotland, which slipped 37 to £11.95. Perennial contrarian stock Man Group firmed 47 at £10.18, on expectations that its hedge funds will continue to sell well in the current environment. Asset managers Amvescap and Schroders attracted bargain-hunters after recent steep falls. Amvescap added 3 at 305p and Schroders firmed 19 at 453p. In the telecoms sector, incumbent operator BT fell 9 3/4 to 162 1/2p following a downgrade by Credit Suisse First Boston. The bank said that the weak economic environment and the consequent curtailing of corporate spending mean BT will struggle to meet its internal growth forecasts. CSFB slapped an ""underperform"" rating on the stock and cut its revenue forecasts for 2004, 2005 and 2006 by 3 per cent, 6 per cent and 9 per cent respectively.

980,486.0,2002-09-25,"Alan Greenspan, chairman of the US Federal Reserve, has hailed the success of London in staying ""at the top of the world's financial pyramid"" despite the creation of the euro. Speaking at the opening of the new UK Treasury building, Mr Greenspan said London had continued to thrive as a financial centre despite loss of empire, the revolution in telecommunications and the emergence of the European single currency. ""London has stayed on top in the provision of financial services despite the emergence of the euro, which some expected would divert a significant share of foreign exchange trading to a single centre on the continent,"" he said. ""Although financial sector activity in Frankfurt has increased substantially in the past few years, largely reflecting the growing importance of the euro, trading volumes there are still well below those of London and New York."" He cited as evidence of London's strength its world-leading positions in over-the-counter derivatives and foreign exchange trading. London conducts twice as much business as New York even though the dollar is by far the most heavily-traded currency. The resilience of Britain's financial services industry to staying outside the euro has been widely recognised, but eurosceptics were heartened to hear the points made by such an eminent authority. Gordon Brown, chancellor of the exchequer (finance minister), was unstinting in his praise for Mr Greenspan and the Fed, stressing the influence of the US model in shaping his plans to make the Bank of England independent. ""You have been a great force for the advancement of the world economy and a great friend of the United Kingdom,"" said Mr Brown. ""The world owes you a debt of gratitude for your stewardship of the world's greatest economy."" George Eustice of the anti-euro group, which will campaign for a ""No"" vote on any referendum on Britain joining the single currency, said London was thriving because of its favourable tax and regulatory framework. Locking into the euro would threaten some of those advantages. But Robert Guy, chair of the City in Europe ""Yes"" campaign and a director of NM Rothschild, said joining the euro would strengthen London's position as Europ e's pre-eminent financial centre and protect against threats such as the loss of exchange-traded derivatives business to Frankfurt. ""Current success is no excuse for lack of concern for the future,"" he said. The visit comes at a time of pronounced uncertainty for Mr Greenspan, the Federal Reserve and the US economy. The Fed decided on Tuesday to keep short-term interest rates unchanged for the sixth time this year, declaring credit conditions sufficiently stimulative to help the troubled economy along. But for the first time in a year, there was publicly declared internal dissent with its decision, highlighting growing disagreement within the Fed over the economy's prospects. Two members of the Fed's policy-making Open Market Committee - Bob McTeer, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas, and Edward Gramlich, a member of the Fed's board of governors - argued for a rate cut and publicly registered their disagreement.

On asecond consecutive day of paltry issuance, the likely deliberations of the Fed, ahead of similar meetings by interest-rate setting bodies in the UK and the euro-zone later this week, dominated attention. The Marseilles issue was for EUR40m, small even in terms of yesterday's modest activity, but Warburg Dillon Read - joint lead with Dexia Capital Markets - said the aim was to establish the city's name in the market. The 10-year bond was pre-placed and attracted most investor attention from funds in the Benelux countries, followed by buyers in Germany. The borrower's 20 per cent risk weighting, which means it has to set aside less regulatory capital, was one attraction. Another was its triple-A rating, which was enhanced by a guarantee from MBIA, the US insurer. ""This was an opportunity for the city to speak to investors,"" said a banker at WDR. The proceeds will go towards the city's Euromed programme, a project to spruce up the city, one of France's most run-down. The bond is the second offering from French municipalities in recent weeks. Region Ile de France, which includes Paris and is one of the richest regions in the country, launched an eight-year EUR100m bond priced to yield 32 basis points over the OAT curve. The Marseilles offering was priced a little wider, at 36 basis points over the OAT, and traded unchanged in quiet secondary activity. In contrast to German states, French local authorities are relative newcomers to the public debt market, preferring traditional bank financing. The Inter-American Development Bank reopened its 10-year Y100bn bond with a Y50bn add-on. Since its first offering others, such as KfW, have tapped the yen market. The soaring yen has encouraged euro-based investors to buy Japanese assets. They have benefited from the rising currency, though Japanese investors with foreign bond holdings have been hit badly. However, the yen market has been held back because issuers have recoiled at the prohibitive cost of swapping out of yen into another currency. Despite that, bankers say the outlook for yen issuance should improve as anxieties over the millennium subside in the new year. ""We think this basis swap should contract next year after the Y2K problem has eased and that should enable better arbitrage and more issuance in yen,"" said Denis Kelleher at Tokyo-Mitsubishi International, joint lead on the IDB bond with Morgan Stanley Dean Witter.

982,488.0,1999-10-06,"US ECONOMY FEDERAL RESERVE KEEPS RATES UNCHANGED BUT SHIFTS - POLICY BIAS TO SUGGEST NEXT MOVE MAY BE UPWARDS. The US Federal Reserve's policy-setting committee shifted its policy bias yesterday to suggest its next interest rate move would be upwards. But it decided against an immediate change in rates, saying the strengthening productivity growth that had so far damped inflationary pressures had apparently been sustained. In a statement, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) said members emphasised the tightening bias ""did not signify a commitment to near-term action"". The committee left its federal funds rate - the rate on overnight lending between banks - unchanged at 5.25 per cent and held its largely symbolic discount rate at 4.75 per cent. The statement said that although productivity trends were favourable, ""growth of demand has continued to outpace that of supply, as evidenced by a decreasing pool of available workers willing to take jobs"". ""In these circumstances, the Federal Open Market Committee will need to be especially alert in the months ahead to the potential for costs to increase significantly in excess of productivity in a manner that could contribute to inflation pressures and undermine the impressive performance of the economy,"" it said. Though this explained its bias towards a tighter future policy, it said it would still need to ""evaluate additional information on the balance of aggregate supply and demand and conditions in financial markets"" before deciding future interest rate moves. The committee raised interest rates by a quarter point at each of its previous two meetings in June and August but maintained its ""neutral bias"" in both cases. Most private sector analysts had not expected the Fed to change interest rates, although they were more evenly divided on whether it would make the shift to a tightening bias. Some economists said that despite indications of a tightening economy, the Fed had reason to be cautious because of factors associated with the impact of the millennium date change on computers. This could lead to a protective build-up in inventories by manufacturers and consumers that could distort the figures. However, some were still expecting the Fed to claw back by the end of the year every one of the three quarter-point interest rate cuts made last year. The focus will now shift to the next meeting, on November 16, as the most likely date for any rate increase. Lex, Page 24 Copyright Financial Times Limited 1999. All Rights Reserved.

985,491.0,1999-10-06,"London stocks enjoyed another reasonably good session yesterday, mostly based on the premise that the US Federal Reserve's open market committee would leave rates alone, and retain its neutral policy bias at yesterday's meeting. The FOMC's decision was due well after the London market closed last night. The assumption of unchanged rates, with the promise of more takeover action, had already helped drive Wall Street sharply higher on Monday. The Dow Jones Industrial Average raced up 128 points, taking it 400 points clear of the 10,000 mark in the wake of the merger news involving Sprint, the US telecoms carrier. Wall Street gave additional support to London from the start of US trading yesterday when the Dow rose sharply, posting a 80-point gain in the first hour of action on Wall Street, following a batch of economic data in line with expectations including the US purchasing managers survey for the services sector which, although a strong figure, was in line with forecasts. London had its own fair share of takeover inspiration as well, with the bank sector accelerating throughout the session on news of the appointment of Warburg Dillon Read and Lehman Brothers as financial advisers to Abbey National. That was interpreted as signalling that bank's intention of becoming involved in the expected consolidation in the banking arena following the initial shot fired by Bank of Scotland at National Westminster. And dealers were quick to point out that United Biscuits' admission on Monday that it was involved in discussions with potential bidders, confirmed long-held expectations that other deals could be in the pipeline. ""There was a view that the new millennium would bring a spate of bids and mergers; it now looks as if the agenda has been brought forward,"" said one marketmaker. By the end of the trading session, the FTSE 100 index had successfully negotiated a handful of awkward passages, which saw it perilously close to slipping into negative territory. Footsie closed 31.6 higher at 6,084.5. At its best, in the middle of the morning, Footsie just managed to penetrate the 6,100 level, before dribbling back over lunchtime. The FTSE 250 also finished well off its best, suffering from a severe setback in a handful of stocks, including two of the UK's leading food manufacturers, Northern Foods and Tate &Lyle. And Morgan Crucible, another leading 250 stock, retreated after Dresdner Kleinwort Benson executed a neat bought deal, buying and selling a 2 per cent-plus stake in the company, netting a cool #250,000 in the process.

986,492.0,1999-10-06,"US stocks sold off in the minutes after the Federal open market committee decided, as expected, to leave interest rates on hold, writes John Labate in New York. The committee moved to a tightening bias and shortly after the decision, the Dow Jones Industrial Average slipped and was up just 6.64 on the day at 10,407.87. The broader Standard &Poor's 500 index was down nearly 2 points at 1,302.62 while the tech-weighted Nasdaq composite was up 21.77 at 2,817.74. Fed policy aside, investors had plenty to occupy their minds. Leading the way was the proposed merger between MCI/Worldcom and number three long-distance company Sprint. The deal would rank as the largest corporate combination ever, but enthusiasm was dimmed by comments by an official at the Federal Communications Commission who cast some doubt on its chances of approval. Shares of both companies traded lower with MCI/ Worldcom down more than 5 per cent at $67 15/16 while Sprint fell back $1/8 to $59 7/8. Investors also saw fit to unload shares in Sprint PCS Group, the company's tracking stock, which tumbled more than 7 per cent to $73 1/8. BellSouth, the group that launched a late bid for Sprint over the weekend, was down as well, falling $11/16 to $41 3/4. In another merger, shares of TV Guide, which on Monday said it would merge with interactive television technology developer Gemstar International, fell $1 3/16 to $44 3/4 after PaineWebber cut its rating to ""attractive"" from ""buy"". Among Dow stocks, financial services company American Express gained $4 3/8 to $141 15/16 after the company said it would redevelop its online brokerage operation. AT&T was also strong, gaining $1 1/8 to $44 3/4. Shares of toy producer Mattel rallied, adding 10 per cent to $12 15/16, recovering some of the ground lost after a near 30 per cent fall on Monday. Semiconductor-related shares also rallied. Micron Technology soared more than 6 per cent to $78 after analysts at Deutsche Banc Alex Brown and Gruntal raised their earnings estimates.

987,493.0,2002-03-20,"Yesterday's statement by the Federal Reserve announcing its decision to keep interest rates unchanged while adopting a more neutral stance on future action was pretty typical as far as these statements go, except for a strange new addition: a roll call listing who voted for and against the decision. It might have marked a small step toward greater transparency, a move by Alan Greenspan to amass more power as Fed chairman, neither or both. The Fed usually waits until the second day after the subsequent FOMC meeting before releasing the vote tally from its latest meeting. But in a break with tradition the Fed immediately announced yesterday how all 10 members of its policy-making Federal Open Market Committee voted, instead of waiting until May 9, two days after the next scheduled meeting. The measure is seen as the latest in a succession in recent years to improve the transparency of central bank decision-making. Economists were generally pleased. ""The Fed has become more transparent since the early 1990s - they didn't used to make public pronouncements, they used to release FOMC minutes much later and they never released full transcripts, and now we get them with a five-year delay - so this represents another move in that direction,"" said Joseph Lavorgna, senior economist with Deutsche Banc Alex. Brown. An internal analysis published last year by the Fed does suggest the central bank has become more open during Mr Greenspan's tenure - or at least easier to decipher. It cites statistical evidence showing financial markets had become much better at anticipating policy changes from 1994-2000 compared with 1989-1994. But Alan Greenspan, the Fed chairman, has said the central bank faces trade-offs in becoming ever-more transparent. In a speech last October to central bankers and economists in St. Louis, the Fed chairman sought to address occasional criticism that the Fed is too secretive. That secrecy is said to exacerbate financial market volatility and inefficiency and put the central bank's inflation-fighting credibility at unnecessary long-term risk. Mr Greenspan said that duty to become more transparent, and thus more accountable, sometimes conflicted with the Fed's other responsibility: to make good decisions. He said deliberations would be less free-flowing and fruitful if members knew remarks would immediately be made public. Mr Greenspan's past hesitation helped spawn some conspiracy theories about the release of the roll call yesterday. One former senior Fed official, who asked not to be named, called it a power grab by Mr Greenspan intended to stifle dissent from members wishing to avoid media scrutiny. ""The announcement effectively gives more power to the chairman because you don't want to look like a dissenter,"" said one observer.

988,494.0,2002-03-20,"The Federal Reserve left interest rates unchanged yesterday but said for the first time in more than a year it no longer saw US economic risks as skewed towards further weakness. The US central bank's policymaking open market committee left its key overnight interest rate - the target for the federal funds rate - unchanged at 1.75 per cent. But for the first time since November 2000, the FOMC shifted its ""tilt"" of monetary policy - the assessment of the balance of risks between inflation and recession. It said policymakers now believed the risks were evenly balanced. The committee said: ""The information that has become available since the last meeting indicates that the economy, bolstered by a marked swing in inventory investment, is expanding at a significant pace. Nonetheless, the degree of the strengthening in final demand over coming quarters, an essential element in sustained economic expansion, is still uncertain."" Financial market attention immediately shifted to the question of when the Fed will start raising interest rates. Recent statistics suggest the economy is in the early stages of what looks increasingly like a robust recovery from the most fleeting of recessions last year. Futures markets expect the Fed funds rate to rise by at least 100 basis points in the course of this year, with the first increase coming perhaps as soon as the Fed's next meeting in May. Consumer spending rose in January and in the same month businesses ended the rundown in inventories that was a key factor in the downturn. In February, the economy recorded the first increase in industrial production in nearly two years and the first rise in employment since last summer. But the Fed faces a tricky task of steering monetary policy back to normality after it cut interest rates throughout last year more aggressively than at any time in the last 20 years. If a firm recovery is indeed under way, short-term interest rates will need to rise from the current emergency levels. Most economists estimate that a neutral level for the federal funds rate - meaning one that is neither stimulative nor restrictive - is around 3 to 4 per cent at current rates of inflation. Alan Greenspan, the Fed chairman, and his colleagues have expressed concern about the likely tempo of the recovery. Few economists inside or outside the Fed believe growth in the current quarter, which could turn out as high as 5 per cent at an annualised rate, will be sustained through the rest of the year. * The US trade gap widened in January at the fastest pace in nearly three years as the US rapidly emerged from recession with a renewed appetite for imports, Peronet Despeignes adds. The Commerce Department said yesterday the monthly trade deficit grew by 15.4 per cent in January - the biggest increase since February 1999 - to $28.5bn ( #20bn). Exports dipped slightly, but imports jumped at the second fastest pace since the economic slowdown began in March 2000. The apparent resumption of the import binge is good news for a number of countries, particularly in Asia, which are heavily reliant on exports to the US, but it has revived concerns about the threat the deficit poses to the US economy and trade relations.

Previously the Fed had said risks were titled towards weakness. The Fed said that the economy is expanding ""at a significant pace"" although it warned that the degree of strengthening in final demand ""is still uncertain."" Treasuries fell early yesterday but after the FOMC meeting the 10-year note was up 1/32 to 96 3/4 with a yield of 5.296 per cent and the 30-year bond had risen 3/16 to 95 1/16 to yield 5.718 per cent. The two-year note was unchanged at 98 29/32 with a yield of 3.585 per cent. Eurozone government bond prices were flat as investors showed little reaction to another rise in the ZEW index, a measure of German economic sentiment, which improved for the fifth consecutive month in February. Instead, bond investors were waiting for the outcome of yesterday's FOMC meeting to provide further confirmation of the strength of the US economic recovery. The two-year German schatz yield was down half a basis point to 4.249 per cent, while the yield on the 10-year German bund yield was also slightly lower at 5.199 per cent. The 10-year German bund futures price was up 0.05 to 105.22. Nervous trading ahead of the FOMC meeting sent UK gilts down, with the 10-year note yielding 5.252 per cent, just short of one basis point higher than Monday. Japanese government bonds were little changed as traders were reluctant to send the yield down too low ahead of today's 10-year cash JGB auction.

Bonds may be supported by fresh money after the new financial year begins on April 1.

991,497.0,1999-11-17,"The Federal Reserve's decision to raise interest rates yesterday underlined the difficulty the central bank faces in operating monetary policy in the highly unusual conditions that characterise the US economy in the late 1990s. The traditional rules that governed the economy for much of the past 25 years seem to have broken down, complicating the Fed's task of setting a properly pre-emptive policy to guard against the risks of inflation. The problem is that, as Fed officials, led by Alan Greenspan, the chairman, have repeatedly acknowledged, the old ""speed limit"", the maximum growth rate consistent with stable inflation, seems to have been raised in the past few years. Significant productivity improvements stemming from substantial investments in information technology have raised the productivity of US workers in the past four years. Underlining the importance of these changes, Larry Summers, Treasury secretary, said the Clinton administration shared the Fed's goals of maintaining healthy growth with low inflation. ""Supported by sound economic policies, including budget discipline, the economy continues to grow, with strong investment and higher productivity, creating good jobs and improved living standards for all Americans."" But while almost everyone now agrees that the old sustainable growth rate of 2.5 per cent per year no longer obtains, few have a very good idea of what the new speed limit might be. The US economy will grow by about 4 per cent this year - and, if one thing seems to be clear, it is that the Fed thinks this pace is too fast. In the statement accompanying the quarter-point increase in both the Fed funds target rate and the discount rate, the Federal Open Market Committee said the action was taken to reduce that pace. ""Despite tentative evidence of a slowing in certain interest-sensitive sectors of the economy and of accelerating productivity, the expansion of activity continues in excess of the economy's growth potential."" That, together with Fed economic forecasts published earlier this year, suggests the central bank's policymakers believe the new sustainable growth rate is somewhere between 3 and 4 per cent. But that provides a wide margin of potential error. If growth cannot in fact be sustained above 3 per cent, inflation will take off. If, by any chance, it can be sustained at 4 per cent, then the Fed may be pressing too hard on the monetary brake. The real difficulty arises from the fact that, even at the current 4 per cent rate, there are no signs of inflationary pressure. Though most Fed economists and officials believe this is probably the result of some benign short-term factors temporarily restraining inflation, no-one can be sure. And, as Mr Greenspan himself acknowledged in a speech last month, it is possible that the improvements in productivity in the past few years may be substantially better even than economists currently think. He raised the possibility that productivity growth could be rising so rapidly that the economy's sustainable growth rate might be even higher than 4 per cent. Few but the most wild-eyed optimists believe the current rate of growth is in fact sustainable. Most are prepared to bet that the Fed's general hunch that the new sustainable rate of between 3 and 4 per cent per year is broadly right. Further, most economists accept that the central bank's three rate increases of a combined 0.75 percentage points should slow the economy by the desired amount in the coming months. That explains why financial markets reacted so positively to the Fed's move yesterday. But the usual statistical fog is especially murky when the economy is undergoing significant change. And until that fog starts to clear, it remains unclear what the Fed will need to do to keep the economy on track. OECD urges higher rates, Page 18. Copyright Financial Times Limited 1999.

General sentiment was firm, however, with swap spreads little changed and underlying government bond prices remaining strong. In one of few significant deals, International Business Machines launched a $300m five-year bond via Japan's Daiwa Securities. The offer was targeted at Japanese retail investors and aimed at capturing a flood of cash from redemptions falling due in November and December. Many corporate borrowers have chosen to fulfil most of their funding requirements earlier in the year due to the potential impact of the millennium bug on prices in December. According to Lehman Brothers, there will be unusually large volumes of redemptions in sterling-denominated bonds - about #3.6bn of eurobonds will be redeemed in December alone, compared with an average monthly total of about #1.5bn. Coupled with the increasing scarcity of gilt supply, as the UK government keeps a cap on issuance amid a budget surplus, corporate sterling-denominated paper should become increasingly popular towards the end of the year.

996,502.0,1999-11-17,"US Treasuries fell yesterday after the Federal Reserve raised its Federal Fund rate 25 basis points and returned its bias to neutral. In midday trade on Wall Street, the benchmark 30-year Treasury was down 1/8 to 101 3/16, pushing its yield up to 6.038 per cent. Similarly, the 10-year note fell 5/32 to yield 5.943 per cent, while the two-year note lost 1/8 to yield 5.839 per cent. No further adjustments are expected until the Open Market Committee February meeting at the earliest. However, analysts warned that the central bank would remain vigilant about the US economy's continued growth. ""The Fed's going to focus on growth,"" said Jeffrey Palma, economist at Warburg Dillon Read. ""If the economy continues to charge ahead, they're going to be willing to knock it down."" The market had closely debated Fed policy since the FOMC left rates unchanged but adopted a tightening bias at its October 5 meeting. The US economy has continued to grow robustly since then, leaving unemployment at its lowest levels in nearly 30 years. However, tight labour markets have yet to generate much inflation. While Gross Domestic Product increased at a 4.8 per cent annual pace in the third quarter, for example, recent data show hourly wages have barely budged. The 25 basis point increase effectively reverses the three incremental rate cuts the Fed enacted last year to limit the drag on the US economy from the financial crises in Asia and Russia. Most had expected Treasuries to turn in a modest rally on the increase, viewing it as a pre-emptive strike. ""If they don't tighten now they will have to tighten early next year,"" said William Quan, senior economist at Aubrey G. Lanston before the decision, citing the tightness of the labour market and falling Treasury yields. The FOMC next meets in December, although no action is expected then because of concerns about the millennium changeover. European government bond prices were higher but the moves were exaggerated by the thin trading volumes. The German bund future close 0.62 higher at 108.20. Market observers said the activity was extremely subdued as most large investors waited for the decision from the FOMC. The European bond markets were also supported by the Germany's council of economic advisers cutting its forecast for German economic growth from 2 per cent to 1.4 per cent for 1999. In the UK, gilts were also higher, despite signs of higher inflation. The underlying rate of inflation which excludes mortgage interest payments rose by 2.2 per cent in the twelve months to the end of October, compared to 2.1 per cent in the previous month. Observers said this could spark new fears of the Bank of England raising interest rates, but would not alter the generally benign inflation outlook, highlighted yesterday by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. The 10-year gilts future rose 0.5 to 111.04. In late trading the gilt future rose further to 111.30. Copyright Financial Times Limited 1999. All Rights Reserved.

997,503.0,1999-05-19,"For years the ""policy bias"" of the Federal Reserve's open market committee has been one of those arcana of monetary policy-making that fail to break out of the more rarefied corners of public debate. Everybody knows that every six weeks or so the members of the policy-making body of the world's most powerful central bank decide at their meeting whether to raise or lower short-term interest rates. But until yesterday few people had heard much of the other policy decision the members routinely vote on - deciding the ""bias"" in the directive they give to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York in conducting its market operations. That was because the decision was not announced publicly until the release of the minutes of the meeting - a day or two after the subsequent FOMC gathering, by which time it was stale news. Yesterday, however, the Fed's policy bias took its bold bow on the world's international economic stage, and with it the central bank inaugurated a new character in the drama of monetary policy-making. Announcing that the FOMC had decided not to raise interest rates, the Fed said for the first time that it had, however, decided to shift from a neutral to a ""tightening"" stance in its policy directive. In recent years the bias has had little or no practical significance. According to Fed insiders its primary purpose has been to maintain a solid consensus among the committee's 12 voting members. If, for example, a significant minority wanted to raise interest rates, while the rest wanted no change, the minority could usually be bought off by a change in the bias - towards tightening, in this case - maintaining the impressive near-unanimity of the committee. But by announcing the decision straight away the Fed has changed the function of the policy stance. And with a lengthy explanation of its move yesterday it made that function clear; it has become the latest weapon in the Fed's policy arsenal - less decisive than an interest rate change, but more emphatic than the often Delphic public ruminations of Alan Greenspan, the chairman. Yesterday's announcement was a warning to financial markets that, after months of tolerance of rapid growth and low unemployment, the Fed has not taken its eye off the inflation ball. It was the first change in the direction of the stance since autumn, when the central bank cut interest rates three times in rapid response to the crisis in international financial markets. The statement accompanying the announcement of the bias change was clear about the risks to the economy. ""Against the background of already-tight domestic labour markets and ongoing strength in demand in excess of productivity gains, the committee recognises the need to be alert to developments over coming months that might indicate that financial conditions may no longer be consistent with containing inflation."" The explanation seemed to be that the shift in the bias marked a return to something approaching normality in policy-making. In any usual circumstances, a prolonged period of truly extraordinary growth and record low unemployment would have the Fed on full alert for inflation. But because of the global crisis of the last year, these have not been normal times. The reason the Fed had not already been on tightening alert was that global conditions were still volatile. With the shift back to near normality, for the central bank not to return to a cautious stance would have seemed almost reckless. As the statement put it, ""domestic financial markets have recovered and foreign economic prospects have improved since the easing of monetary policy last fall"". But, as some economists pointed out, the Fed's move did not necessarily mean an interest rate increase was imminent. ""There have been many occasions in the past when the Fed has adopted a tightening stance and not tightened. It doesn't mean they will tighten this time,"" said Mickey Levy, chief economist at Bank of America. In fact, in the last three years the Fed has moved from a neutral to a tightening bias three times before yesterday. The first time interest rates were eventually raised, but not until a year after the adoption of the bias. The second time there was no increase and the bias returned to neutral a few months later. The third time the bias quickly reverted to neutral and rates were cut - three times - soon afterwards. This time few economists expect the Fed actually to increase rates until it has evidence of wage or price pressures. And the beauty of it is that if the central bank's new early warning system works, that may not be necessary. By more clearly signalling its mood to the markets, it may scare investors enough to achieve a de facto monetary tightening though higher bond yields and lower stock prices - a virtual monetary policy for the cyber age.

998,504.0,1999-05-19,"FRONT PAGE - FIRST SECTION - Fed signals concern over inflation - Central bank keeps US interest rates unchanged but hints at tighter policy. The Federal Reserve yesterday signalled its concern over rising inflationary pressures in the US economy by announcing a shift in its policy stance towards a greater readiness to raise interest rates. The US central bank's policymaking open market committee left short-term interest rates unchanged at its meeting yesterday but said its members had agreed to move to a ""bias"" towards tightening monetary policy. The move does not necessarily prefigure an increase in interest rates but indicates where the Fed's policymakers see the overall direction of the economy and the policy response that might be needed. ""While the FOMC did not take action today to alter the stance of monetary policy, the committee was concerned about the potential for a build-up of inflationary imbalances that could undermine the favourable performance of the economy, and therefore adopted a directive that is tilted toward the possibility of a firming in the stance of monetary policy,"" the Fed said. The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed little changed at 10,836, down 16.52, on the news. Bond prices held mostly steady, following some sharp falls in recent weeks in anticipation of the change, although the price of the benchmark 30-year US Treasury bond fell. It was the first time the Fed had chosen to make its policy bias public immediately after the committee meeting. In the past the stance had not been known until publication of the committee minutes, at least six weeks after the meeting. In a move aimed at improving transparency, the Fed said earlier this year it would begin announcing immediately changes in policy stance when it deemed it important for markets to know of the shift. The announcement came against a background of continuing strong growth in the US economy. Gross domestic product grew at an annual rate of more than 5 per cent in the six months to the end of March, and unemployment has fallen to 4.3 per cent, close to its lowest level in 30 years. Until yesterday's meeting, the Fed had not seemed unduly concerned about the inflationary risks of such rapid growth and tight labour markets. The central bank cut interest rates by 0.75 percentage points last autumn in response to international financial turmoil, and since then the open market committee has maintained a neutral policy stance, indicating it felt the risks to the economy were evenly balanced between inflation and recession. But last week, in what some economists saw as an ominous sign that the long-feared inflationary upturn had arrived, the Commerce Department said consumer prices rose 0.7 per cent in April, the largest monthly leap in nine years. In some ways that figure was an aberration, apparently distorted by exceptional factors. There have been no other firm indications of meaningful inflationary pressures. But yesterday's decision indicates that Alan Greenspan, the Fed chairman, and most of his colleagues believe the balance of risks has shifted and inflation has become a significant threat again.

999,505.0,1999-05-19,"A confidence-boosting opening performance by Wall Street - ahead of the crucial meeting of the US Federal Reserve's open market committee resurrected what looked like being another poor performance by London's equity market yesterday. Wall's Street's Dow Jones Industrial Average was up around 50 points as London closed. At the finish of an erratic trading session, the FTSE 100 was finally 40.6 ahead at 6,206.4, having swung in a 70-point arc that saw the index up almost 60 points at best before retreating equally quickly to post an 18.2 decline. Similarly, the broader FTSE All-Share index gave up good early gains and posted a minor fall over the lunchtime period, only to rally strongly later in the day to close a net 15.24 firmer at 2,887.91. The FTSE 250 index managed a minor 5.5 gain at 5,706.7, but the FTSE SmallCap was never able to shake off the effects of persistent selling pressure and ended 6.4 down at 2,556.9. ""Everything hinges on the outcome of the FOMC meeting. It's as simple as that,"" said one marketmaker, adding that a rate rise or an indication that the next move in US rates would be upwards, could open the way for more pressure to be put on Wall Street and global markets. Earlier, the market had kicked off in good heart, responding to Wall Street's late rally, which saw the Dow finish only 59 points off, having been down more than 150 points at worst, plus some encouraging domestic corporate and economic news. On the economic front, there was a warm welcome for the April consumer price index data, which showed headline inflation at 1.6 per cent year on year and core inflation dipping back below the government's 2.5 per cent target to show a 2.4 per cent increase year on year. Adding some spice to the day's events was the revelation that Allied Domecq has been the target of Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway, which has accumulated a 2.2 per cent stake in the drinks group. Allied shares spiralled upwards, topping the FTSE 100 performance table with the market adopting the view that Mr Buffett would substantially increase his stake. And there was considerable relief with the news that Marks and Spencer's preliminary results revealed no unexpected horrors. Profits were down 42 per cent, but were no worse than expected. There was more good news for the sector from Next, the fashion group, which reported a big jump in sales. The news invigorated the rest of the stores area of the market and boosted the FTSE 250, which contains many retail companies such as Arcadia, Storehouse and Debenhams. A couple of takeover bids produced some spectacular gains in smaller companies.

1000,506.0,1999-05-19,"The US dollar was initially unchanged yesterday after the Federal Reserve decided to leave interest rates unchanged, but warned it was moving to a tightening bias. Following the announcement the dollar shot up against the yen but then surrendered its gains after a sell-off in US asset markets. ""The market has been slow to decide whether the prospect of higher interest rates will be dollar positive or not,"" said David Bloom, currency economist at HSBC. ""Ultimately the argument will turn on the response of the asset markets, where the initial reaction has been negative."" During the London session the dollar paced within a narrow range against other major currencies as the market awaited the decision. * The Israeli shekel firmed yesterday after the Labour party's electoral victory kindled hopes of progress in the middle east peace process. The shekel initially strengthened by just under one per cent against the dollar to Shk4.07. Analysts said the market's relatively guarded response reflected uncertainty ahead of the US rate decision. ""Part of the news had been priced in over the past few days,"" said Mike Wallace, manager of currency analysis at Standard and Poor's MMS. ""Caution about the prospect of a right-wing backlash and the difficulty of forging a coalition able to negotiate a deal with the Palestinians and Syria may have also played a part,"" he added. But most analysts believed the peace dividend expected under Ehud Barak, the new prime minister, would boost regional trade and re-start delayed investment projects. * A rating upgrade from Standard &Poors yesterday gave the Australian dollar a fresh turn of speed. David Beers, managing director of sovereign debt at the US credit rating agency, added to the optimism by saying that the upgrade of Australia's foreign currency rating from AA to AA+ did not preclude another step up. The Aussie burst up to $0.6720 on the news, recouping loses last week when uncertainty over the passing of the government's tax reforms cast the currency under a cloud. Analysts said the Aussie could meet resistence as it approached $0.6750, where some investors were said to be protecting positions. ""If this level is breached then technical factors could lift it up to $0.6820,"" said James McKay, global markets strategist at Commonwealth Bank of Australia. He added that the continuing sale of state assets, including the remaining stake in the telecom group Telstra, could further strengthen the ratings outlook for Australia. Merger and acquisition activity gave added impetus to the currency, with Telecom New Zealand emerging as a bidder for AAPT, the Australian telecom group. ""Telecom New Zealand have already bought close to 10 per cent of the Australian group and a successful bid should further stoke demand for the Aussie,"" said Chris Furness, head of currency analysis at economic consultancy 4Cast. * Malaysia moved yesterday to quash suggestions that it should revalue the ringgit. Daim Zainuddin, finance minster, said that although some analysts had argued for a M$3 per dollar level, the government was comfortable with the M$3.80 peg. Recent initiatives replacing some capital controls with a 10 per cent ""outflow tax"" raised expectations that Malaysia would take a more flexible approach to foreign exchange. But speaking to a group of fund managers, Mr Daim also dampened hopes of a further relaxation of capital controls in the near future. Analysts said the recent rally in the region's currencies left considerable scope for a rise in the ringgit. ""The currency is still about 52 per cent below its pre-crisis levels compared to 21 per cent below for the Singapore dollar,"" said Mr Wallace. However, Gene Frieda of economic consultancy 4Cast, argued that with the yen looking fragile the authorities were unlikely to judge this an ideal time to revalue.

1001,507.0,1999-05-19,"The Federal Reserve's decision to change it bias towards interest rates, while keeping rates unchanged for now, led US bond prices to lose early gains. US Treasury prices were higher leading up to the announcement, but sold off quickly soon after, especially at the short-end. Morning prices had been helped by a new round of overseas buying, especially from Japan. In the hours prior to the announcement investors were less concerned about the threat of higher inflation and interest rates than in previous sessions, helped by the latest report on the US housing market. As a result the long bond yield dipped below 5.9 per cent. In the minutes after the Fed decision, the benchmark 30-year bond was just 1/32 higher at 91 3/32, yielding 5.887 per cent.

The 10-year gilt future fell 0.14 to 114.14 and the 10-year yield spread between German bunds and UK gilts widened three basis points to 91 basis points. Copyright Financial Times Limited 1999.

1002,508.0,2000-05-17,"The US Federal Reserve yesterday signalled a new urgency in its attempts to damp the blazing American economy, raising short-term interest rates by half a percentage point to their highest level since the US emerged from recession in 1991. The Fed's policy-making open market committee lifted its key interest rate, the target for the fed funds rate at which it lends to the banking system, to 6.5 per cent. The central bank also raised its largely symbolic discount rate by half a point to 6 per cent. The move marked the abandonment of the gradualist approach to monetary policy that has been the Fed's hallmark for the past five years. It was the first time since early 1995 that interest rates have moved by other than a quarter of a percentage point. Explaining its decision, the FOMC repeated its now familiar concern that the rapid pace of demand growth was outstripping supply, and hinted that there might be more rate rises to come. ""Against the background of its long-term goals of price stability and sustainable economic growth and of the information already available, the Committee believes the risks are weighted mainly toward conditions that may generate heightened inflation pressures in the foreseeable future."" Financial markets had anticipated the more aggressive tightening after a string of reports indicated the US economy was continuing to grow at breakneck speed and that long-subdued inflationary pressure may be on the rise. Bond and stock prices slipped a little after the announcement, but the Dow Jones Industrial Average still closed 126.79 points higher at 10,934.57. Attention now shifts to the next Fed meeting at the end of June and to whether there will be any evidence to prevent another rate rise. The Fed has lifted short-term rates by 1.75 percentage points in the past year in an attempt to slow growth. In the last six months of last year, the economy grew at an annual rate of more than 6 per cent. That barely slowed in the first three months of 2000 to 5.4 per cent. In recent months there have been signs of inflationary pressures - notably a 4.3 per cent increase in employment costs in the year to March, and a 0.4 per cent leap in consumer prices excluding food and energy costs in March, one of the largest increases in the past five years. Some analysts think Alan Greenspan, the Fed chairman, and his colleagues will wait a while to see if their actions have been sufficient to slow growth. The lags associated with monetary policy changes mean clear evidence of a deceleration may not emerge until the second half of the year. In the past week some reports have suggested the inflation risk is less than previously thought. Yesterday, the Labor Department reported that seasonally adjusted consumer prices were unchanged in April. Excluding food and energy, prices rose by just 0.2 per cent. But the tone of yesterday's announcement suggests the Fed thinks it may need to do more. Editorial Comment, Page 22 Lex, Page 24 Bonds, Page 38 Currencies, Page 39.

1003,509.0,2000-05-17,"Primary activity in the international bond market was light yesterday, as issuers and investors waited for the verdict on interest rates from the FOMC meeting. Bank issuers favouring floating rate deals were propelled to the fore. Portuguese state savings bank Caixa Geral de Depositos launched a five-year FRN deal worth $750m, and is expected to use the proceeds to refinance its acquisition of insurer Mundial Confianca. Euro-denominated issuance was confined to two floating-rate deals, from Germany's DG Hypothekenbank and Comptoir des Entrepreneurs of France. Proctor &Gamble priced a two-tranche Y65bn deal yesterday, launched on Monday, and its success illustrated the relative health of the yen market. A Y50bn 10-year tranche carries a 2 per cent coupon, and was priced at the tight end of the initial range to yield 30 basis points over JGBs. A Y15bn five-year tranche, an increase of a Y40bn deal from November last year, was priced to yield 26 basis points over JGBs. ""Compared to the dollar and the euro markets, the yen market still has pretty good conditions,"" said Denis Kelleher, a syndicate member at Tokyo-Mitsubishi International. ""There is plenty of demand for paper in Japan, but domestic issuance is low because companies are in the middle of the reporting season,"" he added. ""It is a good time to bring foreign issuers into the yen market, and will continue to be so into next week."" Argentina is poised to take advantage of the low cost of borrowing in the Japanese market, and has announced plans to launch several samurai issues. Officials in the Argentine ministry of finance have said that the sovereign will try to develop a larger retail and institutional investor base in Japan. Merrill Lynch and Nomura have been appointed joint lead managers for a yen issue, possibly later this month. While European corporate issues are scarce because of interest rate worries and volatile credit spreads, the number of companies preparing deals is mounting. The roadshow circuit is as busy as ever, but borrowers are waiting for signs of more benign market conditions before deciding to launch. Bankers predict a very busy period during June and July, as issuers try to get deals out of the way before the summer vacation season. Iberdrola, the Spanish utility, Rhodia, the French speciality chemicals company, and French property company Unibail are a few of the corporate borrowers putting the finishing touches to bond deals. The European high yield market is also very active, although the efforts of bankers and borrowers has yet to push through into a high volume of deals. UK bingo operator Gala Group is carrying out a roadshow across Europe, hoping to launch a #100m 10-year issue next week with lead manager CSFB. Gala is raising funds to partly refinance its leveraged buy-out by CSFB Private Equity. Weigh-tronix, a Dutch company that makes industrial and household scales, is marketing a Euros 135m 10-year issue with Lehman Brothers as lead manager. The funds will finance part of the company's acquisition of Avery Berkel from Marconi. Copyright Financial Times Limited 2000. All Rights Reserved.

The Federal Open Market Committee kept its benchmark rate unchanged at5.25 per cent. It said inflation was likely to moderate over time, adding only that ""some inflation risks remain"". The committee also said the economy ""seems likely to expand at a moderate pace"". ""The dovish statement reflects the recent correction in energy prices and investors are now focusing on confirmation of weak third quarter growth later this week,"" said Kevin Cronin, head of investmentsat Putnam Investments. Earlier, weak housing data threw support behind the view that growth is slowing. Existing homes sales in the US last month were weaker than expected.

A stronger US market helped stem falls in the eurozone government bond market. However, Bunds remained weaker in late trading, following strong regional economic news. A key indicator of German business sentiment, as measured by the Ifo research institute, was unexpectedly strong, and it fuelled concerns that interest rates in the eurozone would continue to rise.

1006,512.0,2006-10-26,"The dollar extended its losses on Thursday after the Federal Reserve's decision to keep US interest rates on hold. The US central bank's decision to keep the main Fed funds rate at 5.25 per cent was not a surprise, but it was the accompanying statement that triggered the dollar sell-off. Michael Woolfolk, senior currency strategist at the Bank of New York, said investors led into long dollar positions by hawkish rhetoric from Federal Open Market Committee members in the run-up to its decision were disappointed that the statement merely echoed its previous policy stance and did not ratchet up inflationary fears. ""The dollar bulls have really thrown in the towel,"" said Mr Woolfolk. ""We are at a stage now when the market is trying to decide whether to turn negative on the dollar."" By mid-afternoon in New York, the dollar was 0.5 per cent lower against the euro at $1.2665, off 0.3 per cent against the yen at Y118.70 and 0.5 per cent weaker against the pound at $1.8870. Ashraf Laidi, chief FX analyst at CMC Markets, said that with the dollar falling against the euro for a third successive day - a pattern not seen since August - the question was whether the dollar was at a turning point. ""The current turnaround in the dollar is symptomatic of a major reassessment of monetary policy expectations, reinstating probabilities that the next rate move will be a cut, not a hike,"" he said. Mr Laidi said he expected the Fed to cut US rates either at its meeting in January or in March, and that experience showed the dollar would fall between 4 to 5 per cent in the run up to the move. He argued the Australian dollar and the Canadian dollar were the currencies with the greatest potential to benefit, due to expectations of at least one more rate rise in Australia and his belief that oil prices would sustain their recent rally. ""Although the Bank of Canada has signalled the end of its tightening cycle, steady growth and a likely modest bounce in oil prices should help support the loonie,"" he said. The Australian dollar rose 0.2 per cent to a six-week high of $0.7620 against the dollar. However, the Canadian dollar dropped 0.4 per cent to C$1.1280 against the dollar after a business conditions survey showed Canadian industrial orders were at their lowest level since mid-2003. Meanwhile, the euro received support from a number of directions. Jean-Claude Trichet, president of the European Central Bank, sounded a hawkish tone on eurozone interest rates, saying inflation risks for 2007 remained on the upside and the ECB should remain vigilant for price pressures. Elsewhere, the GfK market research group said its German consumer sentiment index was set to hit its highest level in five years in November. Even Alan Greenspan, former chairman of the Federal Reserve, got in on the act, telling a conference in Washington that not only the private sector, but also central banks, were starting to switch from the dollar into the euro. The euro gained 0.2 per cent to Y150.26 against the yen and put on 0.1 per cent against sterling to GBP0.6715. The New Zealand dollar tumbled 1.1 per cent to $0.6545 against the dollar after the Reserve Bank of New Zealand left interest rates unchanged at 7.25 per cent after a policy meeting. Nick Bennenbroek, senior currency strategist at Brown Brothers Harriman, said the fall was hardly a shock even if the RBNZ did not rule out further rises since the market was evenly divided as to whether it would raise rates or keep them on hold.""You would have got a sharp reaction whatever happened,"" he said. ""The central bank was bound to surprise half the market."" The Swedish krona fell after the country's central bank raised interest rates by a quarter of a percentage point to 2.75 per cent, but signalled any further tightening would be gradual. Traders had expected the Riksbank to signal a more cautious stance on inflation, given strength in the country's housing and labour markets. The krona fell 0.2 per cent against the euro to SKr9.2335.

Airline stocks were also higher after JPMorgan upgraded six airlines and said valuations were low given the outlook for consolidation in 2008.  KB Home After the Federal Open Market Committee statement was released, stocks rallied further and reached new highs for the day.

""A Fed that describes the economy and inflation in friendlier terms than before is generally treated bullishly in the markets, particularly the stock market,"" saidTony Crescenzi, strategistat Miller Tabak &Co.  At mid-afternoon, the S&P was up 0.5 per cent at 1,513.47 points. While oil prices had risen above Dollars 70 a barrel yesterday, their highest level in 10 months, the energy sector was lagging behind broad market gains.  At mid-afternoon, theNasdaq Composite was leading the broad benchmarks with a rise of 0.7 per centto 2,623.40. Brokerage upgrades for Intel, up 1.5 per cent at Dollars 24.14, and Cisco Systems, up 3.4 per cent at Dollars 28.19, boosted technology stocks.

1008,514.0,2007-06-29,"Oil prices rose to their highest in 10 months yesterday while global stocks were mainly firmer and bonds came under pressure as the Federal Reserve signalled a continued focus on inflation.  In the currency markets, the yen went into reverse after three days of gains as a rally in global equity markets eased investor concerns over risky assets and triggered renewed appetite for carry trades.  Investors were largely on the sidelines early yesterday as they awaited the Federal Open Market Committee meeting's decision.  As expected, the FOMC left the overnight interest rate of 5.25 per cent unchanged, marking a full year of steady Fed policy.  Economists had expected the FOMC to remain vigilant about inflation risk, a stance that would keep the chances of a rate cut later this year below 50 per cent.  The FOMC delivered on that forecast when policy makers said: ""A sustained moderation in inflation pressures has yet to be convincingly demonstrated.""  TJ Marta, fixed income strategist at RBS Capital Markets, said: ""The Fed noted the improvement in core inflation, but remained unconvinced that inflation pressures would moderate on a sustained basis.""  As concerns over how troubles in the US mortgage market would ultimately play out across structured credit markets lingered, investors were reminded yesterday that inflation potentially remained an issue.  Money supply in Germany rose more than expected yesterday, while revised first quarter growth in the US was accompanied by an upward revision in core inflation measures.  In commodities, US crude oil futures moved above Dollars 70 a barrel for the first time since the start of September amid supply concerns. High energy prices raise the risk that consumer spending could slow down over the summer, and could also feed into higher core inflation later this year.  Although US first quarter growth in gross domestic product was revised up to0.7 per from a previously reported 0.6 per cent, the main talking point was the price index for personal consumption. The core PCE, excluding food and energy, rose an annualised 2.4 per cent, above a previous estimate of a 2.2 per cent gain for the quarter.  The rise increases the likelihood that the May core PCE reading for the past year, due today, will remain above the Fed's preferred ceiling of 2 per cent.  Economists at Bear Stearns said the revision could entail a significant reduction in ""the chances that May's core PCE inflation rate slips to 1.9 per cent"".  At mid-afternoon, stocks on Wall Street had rallied further. The S&P 500 index was up 0.5 per cent, while the Nasdaq Composite was 0.7 per cent higher amid upgrades for bellwether stocks such as Amazon and Cisco. European stocks were broadly higher before Wall Street opened and largely held those gains. In London the FTSE 100 index closed up 0.7 per cent at 6,571.30 points. The Eurofirst 300 index ended the day 1.03 per cent higher at 1,595.82.  In Asia, stocks mainly rallied, with Hong Kong rising 1.1 per cent to 21,938.22, just shy of its recent record close.  Singapore was up 0.9 per cent, while Japan's Nikkei 225 gained 0.4 per cent. The volatile Shanghai Composite fell 4 per cent.  Global bond yields were generally higher yesterday, with the yield on the 10-year Japanese government bond up 5 basis points at 1.91per cent.  The yield on the German 10-year Bund was up 2bp at 4.56 per cent. The yield on the 10-year US Treasury bond was 2bp higher at 5.10 per cent, and the market weakened after the FOMC statement was released. The policy-sensitive two-year note fell sharply in price, with its yield rising 6bp to 4.94 per cent. While traders said the US bond market stayed in a range, the risk of renewed haven buying could no be ruled out.  ""We remain worried that credit perceptions may race ahead of reality and force a longer term pendulum swing away from risk-seeking and toward risk conservatism,"" said William O'Donnell, strategist at UBS. In the currency markets, the dollar was little changed. The yen was more volatile.

But it warned that ""a sustained moderation in inflation pressures has yet to be convincingly demonstrated.""  Gary Bigg, economist at Bank of America, said of the Federal open market committee: ""The FOMC should be quite pleased with recent inflation developments.""  Ethan Harris, chief economist at Lehman Brothers, said the economy was ""evolving as the Fed expected"" with inflation easing and growth projections also being reined in.  The report from the commerce department on Friday also showed consumer spending and income lower than expected in May.  Personal income increased 0.4 per cent. Consumption spending increased 0.5 per cent for the second consecutive month.  ""The slender gain in income will restrain consumption spending,"" said Gary Bigg, economist at Bank of America. ""Income and spending gains were weaker than expected, suggesting that spending for the quarter will be soft.""  Economists said higher fuel prices explained much of the spending increase.  Nigel Gault, US economist at Global Insight, said: ""Although consumer spending rose by what looks like a robust 0.5 per cent in May, more than half of the increase in spending went into gasoline tanks as consumers were hit by higher gasoline prices.""  ""Spending should improve in the second half of the year, with gasoline prices easing back, but not back to the runaway first-quarter pace, as the downturn in the housing market will weigh on consumers,"" he said.

1012,518.0,2007-06-29,"US stocks were in rally mode at midmorning on Friday, after a closely watched measure of inflation fell back into the Federal Reserve's comfort zone.  The inflation data boosted bond prices, and lower yields provided some comfort for interest rate sensitive stocks. Meanwhile, a surge in earnings at Research In Motion was boosting technology stocks.  Less than an hour after the opening bell, the S&P 500 index was 0.7 per cent higher at 1,517.02.  The Nasdaq Composite was in 0.6 per cent at 2,624.86. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was 0.7 per cent at 13,515.11.  At this juncture, the S&P and Dow are on course for a negative performance in June, and that would mark, after February, the second down month so far this year for the benchmarks.  Both the Dow and the S&P reached record closes early in June, and sentiment has been dented on a number of fronts.  ""Through June equity investor worries have ranged from inflation angst to an unwinding of expectations that the Fed will ease in 2007 to outright fear that the LBO [leveraged buyout] spigot will dry up, among many others,"" said Tobias Levkovich, chief US equity strategist at Citigroup. ""But it all began with a spike in the 10-year bond yield, which continues to be symbolic of investor fears if not a cause of them.""  In June, the yield on the 10-year bond has risen from 4.90 per cent to a peak of 5.33 per cent. The yield was at 5.06 per cent at midmorning on Friday.  Despite fears that higher rates could dampen deal activity, buyout announcements have continued to arrive in the past week.  In deal news on Friday, shares in Komag jumped 7.5 per cent to $31.79, on the news that it is being bought for $1bn, or $32.25 a share , by Western Digital, a hard disk drive maker. Western was up 0.8 per cent at $19.68.  In earnings news, Research in Motion said fiscal first quarter earnings rose 73 per cent amid strong sales of its BlackBerry wireless e-mail devices late on Thursday. The company also announced a three-for-one stock split and shares were up 16.8 per cent at $193.32. A number of analyst upgraded the stock as RIM also issued upside second quarter profit guidance.  In contrast, Palm reported a 44 per cent slide in fiscal fourth quarter profit in spite of record sales of its Treo smartphones as higher costs and increased competition hurt he bottom line. The stock was 4 per cent lower at $15.90.  Shares in Apple will be in focus on Friday as the company starts selling its iPhone to customers. The product goes on sale in the US at Apple and AT&T stores at 6pm in each time zone. Apple was up 1.3 per cent at $122.17.  Shares in Commerce Bancorp rose 8.3 per cent to $36.63, after the bank said Vernon W. Hill, chairman and chief executive of Commerce Bank, was steeping down from those positions.  Micron Technology rose 1.9 per cent to $12.65, after the memory chip maker announced job cuts in the wake of a third quarter loss of $225m.  In economic news, personal income rose 0.4 per cent in May, while personal spending increased 0.5 per cent. Both measures were expected to rise 0.7 per cent last month.  ""The picture for the consumer is softening, and we do fully expect that personal consumption will moderate significantly in the second quarter,"" said TJ Marta, fixed income strategist at RBC Capital Markets. Still, there was good news on the inflation front within the report.  The personal consumption expenditure index, excluding food and energy, rose 0.1 per cent and for the year to May was up 1.9 per cent. Traders had expected a 1.9 per cent annual rise in core PCE, down from April's gain of 2 per cent. The Fed is assumed to prefer core PCE in a range of between 1 and 2 per cent.  In other data, the June Chicago purchasing managers' index was 60.2, down from a reading of 61.7 in May. Construction spending for May and the revised Michigan consumer sentiment report for June beckon later on Friday.  Wall Street closed mixed on Thursday, and choppy trade ensued after the Fed left interest rates unchanged and warned that inflation remains a source of concern.  In its policy meeting on Thursday, the Federal Open Market Committee said the economy grew at a moderate rate during the first half of this year, despite ""the ongoing adjustment in the housing sector."" In terms of inflation risk, policy makers said core inflation was no longer ""somewhat elevated"" but that ""a sustained moderation in inflation pressures has yet to be convincingly demonstrated.""  Drew Matus, economist at Lehman Brothers said the FOMC statement suggests ""that the Fed is looking at inflation through more than one lens."" Despite the good news on the core PCE data, Mr Matus said ""the Fed will continue to keep one eye on possible inflation channels.""  As the final day of the month beckons, the end of June also marks the end of the second quarter. At this juncture, both the S&P and the Dow are on course to record their second negative monthly performance for this year after a weak February. The S&P has lost 1 per cent so far in June, and the Dow has fallen 0.9 per cent.  In contrast, the Nasdaq is up 0.8 per cent in June, and has gained 8.4 per cent in the second quarter. Over the past three months, the S&P is up 6.7 per cent and the Dow has gained 9.3 per cent.  For the year to date, the Nasdaq is up 8.7 per cent, with the Nasdaq 100 higher by 10.7 per cent. The Dow has risen 8.4 per cent in 2007, while the S&P is up 7 per cent.  The month and quarter end dates also mean that investors will mark their portfolios of subprime mortgages. The ABX index, a credit derivative benchmark that tracks US subprime mortgage bonds fell to a new low on Thursday  ""The recent regulatory pressures have made accurate markets in the subprime/credit markets of significance, so we expect focus to return to the ABX/credit space as the week winds down,"" said David Ader, bond strategist at RBS Greenwich Capital.  Among the major sectors in the S&P, the energy sector has risen 15.5 per cent in the second quarter and is up 2.8 per cent in June.  Information technology gained ground in the second quarter with a rally of 11.2 per cent, and has gained 1.6 per cent in June.  As bond yields rose in recent months, the utility sector, which is sensitive to interest rates, fell 4.7 per cent during June. It is also the only S&P sector to record a negative return, down 0.5 per cent, for the three months since the start of April.  For the year so far, financials are the only major sector to be in negative territory, down 0.8 per cent. During the second quarter, financials are up 2.9 per cent, but lost 2.9 per cent in June.  Consumer discretionary and staples sectors are both under 5 per cent higher for the year to date. Analysts say the sectors have been hurt by higher interest rates, and oil prices, and the rise in non core inflation.  On Thursday, the S&P closed 0.4 per cent lower at 1,505.71 points, having risen to a high of 1,514.84 after the FOMC statement was released. Financials, utility and energy sectors closed lower.

1014,520.0,2009-09-24,"global overview US interest rates are left on hold Oil prices tumble by nearly 4% US stocks and the dollar were volatile yesterday after the Federal Reserve's latest policy meeting, with a big drop in oil prices hitting equity market sentiment. The dollar, briefly dropped to its lowest level on a trade-weighted index after the FOMC meeting, only to claw back those losses as oil prices tumbled nearly 4 per cent and sank equities. The US central bank left interest rates on hold and pledged to keep them at record lows for an ""extended period"". The Fed also said that it would slow the pace of its purchases of mortgage-backed securities, ending the $1,500bn programme three months later than scheduled. It added that the economy was recovering after a ""severe downturn"", although it warned that household spending, while apparently stabilising, remained constrained by, among other factors, continuing job losses and sluggish income growth. Late in New York, the S&P 500 closed 1 per cent lower, after rising 0.8 per cent in the wake of the FOMC statement. Meanwhile, the yield on the 10-year Treasury was 4 basis points lower at 3.41 per cent. Yields had earlier risen after a disappointing auction of five-year paper. Central bank exit strategies were in focus elsewhere after the release of the minutes from the Bank of England's meeting this month . The Bank of England's monetary policy committee noted the recent improvements in economic and financial data as it voted unanimously to keep the asset purchase programme at £175bn in September. However, the door was left open for further easing, with the minutes also saying that for ""those members who had preferred a larger stimulus at the August meeting, a larger asset purchase programme could still be justified"". Richard McGuire, fixed income strategist at RBC Capital Markets, said the minutes had validated the view that an increase in the quantitative easing limit was still possible. ""With two [MPC] members [Mervyn King, governor, and David Miles] continuing to see a case for more aggressive action, a further 'upping of the QE ante' come November remains a clear possibility,"" he said. Mr McGuire added: ""Notable by its absence, meanwhile, was any discussion on a possible reduction of the deposit rate. One might surmise that such action will remain on the back burner until the Bank is satisfied it has done as much as is necessary in terms of pumping liquidity into the system."" On the currency markets , news of the unanimous vote pushed sterling higher against both the euro and the dollar. The Norwegian krone enjoyed even bigger gains after Norges Bank left its main interest rate unchanged at a record low of 1.25 per cent. ""A rate hike in October looks very likely,"" said Arne Lohmann Rasmussen, chief analyst at Danske Bank. The euro rose to a fresh one-year peak of $1.4844, only to slip below $1.48 late in New York. European government bonds were mixed. The 10-year Bund yield rose 1bp to 3.38 per cent after an issue of five-year German debt attracted reasonable demand. UK Gilts rose after the release of the Bank minutes, with the two-year yield down 2bp at 0.85 per cent. European equities edged higher, with the pan-European FTSE Eurofirst 300 rising 0.2 per cent. The mood in Asia was subdued as Japanese markets were closed for a third day. Hong Kong fell 0.5 per cent while Shanghai fell to three-week closing low. In commodities , the oil price fell below $69 a barrel after US data showed an unexpectedly large rise in domestic crude and refined product inventories last week. Nymex November WTI was down $2.79 at $68.97. Copper also fell on news of rising inventories and faltering demand from China. The Baltic Dry index, a gauge of shipping costs for commodities, fell for a ninth session. Analysts said the slide partly reflected an increase in shipping capacity, but also signalled that demand for commodities was starting to wane.

1015,521.0,2009-09-24,"The Federal Reserve is looking to team up with the moneymarket mutual fund industry as part of its strategy to ensure that its unconventional policies to stimulate the economy do not produce a bout of post-crisis inflation. The central bank envisages eventually draining liquidity from the financial system by engaging in trades called ""reverse repos"" with the deep-pocketed money-market funds. In these, the Fed would pledge mortgage-backed securities and Treasuries acquired during the crisis as collateral for short-term loans from the funds. The discussions about the strategy form part of a Fed effort to ensure it will be in a position to raise interest rates when it decides the moment is right - even though most officials believe it is still many months away from having to do so. The US central bank yesterday said it would complete its planned $1,450bn purchases of securities and debt issued by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac at a reduced pace, allowing it to stretch out the buying to March 2010. In its policy statement, issued after a two-day meeting, the Federal Open Market Committee indicated it is slowly retiring some of the tools used to fight the crisis. The Fed said it would ""continue to employ a wide range of tools to promote recovery"" rather than ""all available tools"" in past months. However, the central bank reiterated it expects to keep interest rates near zero for an ""extended period"". The Fed said activity has ""picked up"" and noted signs of a rebound in activity in the housing market. But policymakers still appeared very unsure about the prospects for household spending - which they said ""seems to be stabilising, but remains constrained"". Nonetheless, the Fed signalled it does not expect a double-dip recession, looking instead to a ""strengthening of economic growth"". Most policymakers presently ancitipate that the first rate hike will not come before the second half of 2010. However, the Fed wants to establish the mechanisms for doing this well in advance, which is why it is exploring the idea of transactions with money funds now. In the course of the crisis, the Fed created roughly $800bn of additional bank reserves to finance asset purchases and loans. This total is likely to rise in the coming months as the central bank completes its asset purchases and the Treasury unwinds financing it provided to the Fed. Fed officials think they could raise interest rates even with this excess supply of reserves by offering to pay banks to deposit their surplus funds with it rather than lend them out. However, they also want to use reverse repos in tandem to soak up some of the excess reserves - policymakers call this a ""belt and braces approach"". The obvious counterparties for reverse repo deals are the Wall Street primary dealers. However, the Fed thinks they would only have balance sheet capacity to refinance about $100bn of assets. Hence the interest in dealing with money funds as well. The sector has $2,500bn in assets, which means it could plausibly refinance as much as $500bn in Fed assets. Officials think there would be appetite on the part of the funds, which are under pressure from regulators and investors to stick to low-risk liquid investments.",Fed eyes money market fund link to beat inflation,2009-09-23,The Financial Times
1016,522.0,2009-09-24,"""Stop, children, what's that sound, everybody look what's going down"". The Kinks knew what was what back in 1966, and Ben Bernanke knows what is going down now. On Wednesday, the Federal Open Market Committee left the target interest rate near zero and told investors to expect it to remain low for some time yet. What is the Fed so worried about? What's going down are broader measures of money supply. Notes and coins, as well as deposit, savings and money market accounts, or M2, has been falling since the end of June, for example. That fall hardly seems possible given that the so-called monetary base (currency in circulation plus bank reserves) has more than doubled in the last year, almost entirely due to the Fed's emergency lending programmes. Bank reserves have exploded from $50bn to almost $850bn in 12 months. But the frightening reality is that bank lending is now contracting faster than the Fed is buying assets from the non-bank private sector, as part of its efforts to lower yields and revive failed markets. No matter how much the Fed seems to do, banks are not extending loans. US consumer credit, for example, fell at an annualised 10 per cent in July. Total debt outstanding is where it was a year ago. Some wonder about the wisdom of attempting to mend the wreckage of a debt-bubble with yet more debt. Even so, the economic consequences of shrivelling broad money do not bear thinking about - the long-term growth rate of M2, for example, is normally about 10 per cent per year. So forget about inflation. Goldman Sachs notes that inflation has the highest correlation to broader measures of money supply. Best ask for that pay rise now.",The Fed,2009-09-23,The Financial Times

This was down 65 on the previous close and 17 points below cash, with fair value estimated at a premium of about 31 points. But the bears were still not happy with this and December was knocked down to touch the low of the day, 4,700 at 10.35am. But this psychologically important support level was not breached despite the strong downward trend and December rallied slightly, only to test this area again at 1.30pm when it reached 4,705 as nervousness on the direction of the US market came to the fore.

Other networking stocks fell as the industry leader, Cisco Systems, lost $1 1/4 to $79 3/8.

1020,526.0,1997-11-13,"Frayed nerves ahead of yesterday's meeting of the US Federal Reserve's Open Market Committee sent bond markets into a tail-spin in late European trade after US Treasuries opened weaker. Though the Fed was thought unlikely to raise interest rates - for reasons including stock market volatility - some analysts said a rise would be timely because of domestic US factors. ""Everything says they should go for it,"" said Kevin Adams, bond strategist at Barclays Capital Group in London. ""The lack of a rise would suggest the Fed was behind, or about to get behind, the curve."" Putting off any rise would require a higher increase in interest rates next time, he added. In the event the FOMC left rates unchanged and, having moved lower in early trading, US TREASURIES began to firm on the news. Soon after the announcement the 30-year Treasury had risen 3/16 to 99 7/8, yielding 6.130%. Among shorter-term issues the 10-year note rose 1/8 to 101 11/16, yielding 5.885% while the two-year note gained 1/32 to 99 27/32, yielding 5.692%. The Federal Funds rate was 5 9/16%. Trading was active on the market's first day back after the Veteran's Day holiday and turmoil in Asian markets had affected prices earlier in the day. ""Bond prices were up overnight as overseas equity markets declined, but that ...reversed as US equities came back from earlier lows,"" said David Ging, market strategist at Donaldson, Lufkin &Jenrette. ""The main talk is about Japanese repatriation,"" said Tom O'Connell, senior government trader at First Chicago Capital Markets. The belief is that money is being moved out of US Treasury securities to be invested in Japan in order to raise capital, and putting downward pressure on bond prices. UK GILTS took a hammering in late trading, with the December future dropping nearly a full point from its overnight close. Analysts said the fall was prompted by stop-loss selling and by one big trade. The gilt contract settled at 116 21/32, down, in heavy volume of nearly 130,000 contracts, while the yield spread over bunds widened to 124 basis points. Earlier the market had reacted well to another fall in unemployment and in earnings growth - the future at one point touched 118 1/16. However, the Bank of England's warning that inflation had not been tamed implied more interest rate rises on the horizon and gilts began to fall. Nevertheless, was no heavy cash selling, despite evidence of a switch from longer-dated securities into the five-year range. ""It was a general nervousness, a marking down of prices across the board,"" Mr Adams said. GERMAN BUNDS also retreated in late trading, dragging down other European markets. The December bund future settled in London at 102.20, a drop of 0.36, in good volume, with most activity in the five-year range because of a Bobl auction, said Heinz Gunasekera, bund specialist at UBS. The market had moved ahead earlier but was unsettled by both the FOMC meeting and a potential clash between the government and the Bundesbank over interest rate swaps. The German parliament yesterday gave the government the green light to use interest rate swaps to cut the cost of servicing the federal debt. But Johann Wilhelm Gaddum, Bundesbank vice-president, warned the move would increase reliance on short-term financing and create more volatility in interest rate movements. However, parliament limited the amount of debt that can be swapped to DM 95bn, half what the finance ministry wanted. The move will allow the fixed-rate debt to be swapped for floating-rate debt, saving up to DM 1bn on interest payments. ITALIAN BTPs weakened but outperformed bunds as volumes picked up from previous sessions, with the December future settling 0.27 lower at 111.26. The 10-year spread over bunds narrowed to 61 basis points, with the market waiting for domestic data due tomorrow that is expected to show no disruption to the country's generally good economic outlook. SPANISH BONOS also outperformed bunds, with the 10-year spread falling to 41 points as the December future settled 0.25 lower at 103.00.

1021,527.0,1997-11-13,"Nervousness after falls in Asian markets overnight, coupled with tension ahead of decisions from the FOMC meeting in the US, led to a bearish tinge to trading the FTSE 100 December future yesterday. In pre-trading December was indicating a level of about 4,780 but in the event it opened below this, at 4,757. This was down 65 on the previous close and 17 points below cash, with fair value estimated at a premium of about 31 points. But the bears were still not happy with this and December was knocked down to touch the low of the day, 4,700 at 10.35am. But this psychologically important support level was not breached despite the strong downward trend and December rallied slightly, only to test this area again at 1.30pm when it reached 4,705 as nervousness on the direction of the US market came to the fore. But in the event, Wall Street was not in such poor shape and December found a spring in its step in afternoon trading, and it outperformed the cash market. The contract managed to get its head above water and settlement was at 4,751, a slight premium to fair value. This less bearish stance continued into after-hours trading as December moved on about 14 points. Volume at 14,400 lots was more than double the 6,500 seen on Tuesday, while in Footsie options the 20,000 was 3,000 up. Puts at 21,400 outnumbered calls at 11,500 as investors continued to seek downside protection, a sentiment highlighted recently by SocGen research. Copyright Financial Times Limited 1997.

1023,529.0,1997-11-13,"Volatility returned to Wall Street as the Dow Jones Industrial Average lost more than 80 points in the first 10 minutes of trading before rallying, writes John Labate in New York. Weakness in Asian and European markets added to the stress on US equities, especially in the financial and technology sectors, in early trade. The Federal open market committee's decision not to change interest rates had little immediate effect on the Dow and it was down 63.60 at 7,495.13 shortly after the announcement. The broader Standard &Poor's 500 index slipped 9.03 to 914.75. ""We had a fairly decent rebound, and the selling never got very intense,"" said Bill Meehan, chief market analyst at Cantor Fitzgerald in Connecticut, referring to the early falls. ""It's encouraging that some of the technology stocks that have been weak have begun to firm a bit."" The technology-weighted Nasdaq composite index was down 23.32 to 1,561.54 by early afternoon. 3Com, the networking firm, plunged more than 7% or $2 9/16 to $32 9/16 on concerns over competition from Intel. Other networking stocks fell as the industry leader, Cisco Systems, lost $1 1/4 to $79 3/8. US Treasury bonds were higher due to turmoil in Asian equity markets and while US stocks plunged, but then changed direction as Wall Street recovered from morning lows. By early afternoon, the 30-year Treasury bond had fallen 1/16 at 99 5/8, sending the yield up to 6.148%. The banking sector was hit by a swift sell-off after an analyst downgraded his ratings of Chase Manhattan, J.P. Morgan and BankAmerica due to Asian weakness. Chase shares fell $2 15/16 to $109 5/16 while J.P. Morgan lost $1 7/16 to $112 5/8. As ITT shareholders met in New York to vote on takeover plans from Hilton Hotels and Starwood Lodging, all three stocks rose. Hilton's shares gained $11/16 to $31 11/16 and Starwood $1 5/16 to $56 9/16. ITT rose $3/8 to $76 1/2.

1024,530.0,1997-11-13,"Frayed nerves ahead of yesterday's meeting of the US Federal Reserve's Open Market Committee sent bond markets into a tail-spin in late European trade after US Treasuries opened weaker. Though the Fed was thought unlikely to raise interest rates - for reasons including stock market volatility - some analysts said a rise would be timely because of domestic US factors. ""Everything says they should go for it,"" said Kevin Adams, bond strategist at Barclays Capital Group in London. ""The lack of a rise would suggest the Fed was behind, or about to get behind, the curve."" Putting off any rise would require a higher increase in interest rates next time, he added. In the event the FOMC left rates unchanged and, having moved lower in early trading, US TREASURIES began to firm on the news. Soon after the announcement the 30-year Treasury had risen 3/16 to 99 7/8, yielding 6.130%. Among shorter-term issues the 10-year note rose 1/8 to 101 11/16, yielding 5.885% while the two-year note gained 1/32 to 99 27/32, yielding 5.692%. The Federal Funds rate was 5 9/16%. Trading was active on the market's first day back after the Veteran's Day holiday and turmoil in Asian markets had affected prices earlier in the day. ""Bond prices were up overnight as overseas equity markets declined, but that ...reversed as US equities came back from earlier lows,"" said David Ging, market strategist at Donaldson, Lufkin &Jenrette. ""The main talk is about Japanese repatriation,"" said Tom O'Connell, senior government trader at First Chicago Capital Markets. The belief is that money is being moved out of US Treasury securities to be invested in Japan in order to raise capital, and putting downward pressure on bond prices. UK GILTS took a hammering in late trading, with the December future dropping nearly a full point from its overnight close. Analysts said the fall was prompted by stop-loss selling and by one big trade. The gilt contract settled at 116 21/32, down, in heavy volume of nearly 130,000 contracts, while the yield spread over bunds widened to 124 basis points. Earlier the market had reacted well to another fall in unemployment and in earnings growth - the future at one point touched 118 1/16. However, the Bank of England's warning that inflation had not been tamed implied more interest rate rises on the horizon and gilts began to fall. Nevertheless, was no heavy cash selling, despite evidence of a switch from longer-dated securities into the five-year range. ""It was a general nervousness, a marking down of prices across the board,"" Mr Adams said. GERMAN BUNDS also retreated in late trading, dragging down other European markets. The December bund future settled in London at 102.20, a drop of 0.36, in good volume, with most activity in the five-year range because of a Bobl auction, said Heinz Gunasekera, bund specialist at UBS.

1025,531.0,2008-08-06,"GLOBAL OVERVIEW Fed opts to keep rates unchanged US services sector data improves US and European equities rallied strongly yesterday, as investors took their lead from weaker commodities prices and strong economic data, largely ignoring the decision by the Federal Open Market Committee to keep interest rates unchanged. The widely expected decision to keep the target for the federal funds rate at 2 per cent came as the Fed reiterated that the financial markets remain under ""considerable stress"". It also said that the outlook for inflation remained highly uncertain. ""Although downside risks to growth remain, the upside risks to inflation are also of significant concern to the Committee,"" the Fed said. Jason Brady, a portfolio manager at Thornburg Investment Management, said: ""They pretty much issued the same statement [as last month],"" ""If I had to guess the direction of the Treasury curve, you probably get it steepening. You probably get risk assets, like stocks, moving higher because any hint of a move higher in rates would have been bad for stocks and two-year Treasuries and that didn't happen."" Further support for equity bulls came from better-than-expected data on the US services sector - which accounts for about 90 per cent of the economy. Oil led a broad sell-off across the commodities spectrum, helping to soothe concerns about inflation in spite of the Fed's statement. Nymex September West Texas Intermediate, the benchmark US crude price, settled at $119.17 a barrel, down $2.24, having earlier touched a three-month low of $118 - nearly 20 per cent below the all-time high of $147.27. Gold retreated below the $900 an ounce mark to touch its lowest for six weeks, copper and zinc hit multi-month lows and agricultural commodities remained under pressure. Arne Lohmann Rasmussen, senior analyst at Danske Bank, said there was a clear possibility that in-creased pessimism on global growth in the next couple of months could drive commodity prices even lower. ""However, we very much believe that the commodity bull run has been fuelled by fundamentals,"" he said. ""And while the June peak in oil price might have been an exaggeration, we have to remember that non-Opec oil supply problems, Opec's hawkish stance and strong oil demand in Asia and the Middle East remain intact. Supply problems are also growing in base metals, and the costs push in agricultural is evident."" Meanwhile, the US Institute for Supply Management's non-manufacturing index edged up to 49.5 in July from 48.2 in June - still below the 50 level which indicates contraction but a higher reading than expected. The prices-paid component fell from June's record high of 84.5 to 80.8. ""The ISM non-manufacturing measure has held within two points on either side of 50 for six consecutive months, which neatly captures the sluggish nature of the economy,"" Omair Sharif, strategist at RBS Greenwich Capital, said. But ""the concern is always about future trajectory, and on that point, July's data were not necessarily reassuring."" Meanwhile, Eurozone service sector activity fell to a five-year low in July while retail sales in the region suffered their biggest-ever drop in June. Howard Archer, at Global Insight, said yesterday's data added to the mounting evidence the eurozone economic downturn was deepening. ""Nevertheless, stillelevated price pressures mean that the ECB will not be cutting interest rates any time soon to support economic activity and could yet raise them further."" In the UK, the services purchasing managers' index inched up to 47.4 in July from 47.1, a better-thanexpected reading. Equity markets , however, were in an uncompromisingly bullish mood on both sides of the Atlantic. At the close, the S&P 500 was up 2.9 per cent, while the pan-European FTSE Eurofirst 300 index rose 2.6 per cent. In Tokyo, the Nikkei 225 Average slipped 0.1 per cent, while Hong Kong tumbled 2.6 per cent. In government bonds, the yield on the 10-year Treasury rose 6 basis point to 4.02 per cent, while in Europe, the 10-year Bund yield was 2bp lower at 4.31 per cent.

1026,532.0,2008-08-06,"The dollar was mixed on Wednesday, hitting a seven-month peak against the yen but easing slightly from a seven-week high against the euro and sterling as traders digested the Federal Reserve's decision on US interest rates. On Tuesday, the US central bank, as expected, kept its main Fed funds interest rates on hold at 2 per cent. Analysts said the accompanying statement was clearly designed not to rock the boat, with no clear bias between the assessment of upside US inflation risks and downside growth risks. However, it was the vote that moved markets, revealing only one member of the Federal Open Market Committee wanted to raise interest rates, against expectations for two, or possibly three, dissenters. This saw investors marginally pare back expectations that the Fed would raise interest rates by the end of the year, halting the dollar's recent rally against european currencies and boosting equities. The dollar eased 0.2 per cent to $1.5479 against the euro, lost 0.1 per cent to $1.9540 against the pound and edged 0.1 per cent lower to Sfr1.0528 against the Swiss franc. The greenback advanced against the yen, however, rising 0.3 per cent to a six-month high of Y108.60 as a solid performance from global equities boosted risk appetite and drove investors away from the safe haven of the low-yielding Japanese currency. John Normand at JPMorgan said the Fed had left little doubt that US monetary tightening was some way off. However, he said this stance still stood in stark contrast to other major global central banks which were either easing, such as the Reserve Bank of New Zealand, about to ease, such as the Reserve Bank of Australia, suspected of easing next year, like the European Central Bank, or permanently on hold, like the Bank of Japan. ""With the US the only major economy that is not sliding into recession, the expected direction of Fed policy should sustain the dollar's gains versus the euro and commodity currencies,"" said Mr Normand. Analysts said the euro was receiving support, however, ahead of the European Central Bank's interest rate decision on Thursday, at which the central bank was widely expected to reiterate its concerns over inflation and hawkish monetary policy bias. Stuart Bennet at Calyon said with the ECB 's focus on above-target inflation, the FX market had been surprisingly indifferent to recent weak activity data from the eurozone. But he said that might change next week if growth figures showed an expected marked slowdown. Indeed, he said the EU Commission sentiment indicator was signalling a strong chance that the region's economy contracted in the second quarter. ""If correct, the spectre of a eurozone recession should finally force the FX market to sit up and listen, pushing the euro lower."" Nevertheless, the euro rose 0.1 per cent to £0.7921 against the pound and gained 0.1 per cent to SFr1.6285 against the Swiss franc. Elsewhere the New Zealand dollar fell 0.6 per cent to $0.7219 against the US dollar and lost 0.3 per cent to Y78.41 against the yen as traders awaited the New Zealand second quarter employment report. Sue Trinh at RBC Capital Markets said the figures would crucial in judging whether the country's economy was already in recession and whether market had underestimated the pace of monetary easing from the RBNZ, which was expected to cut rates by 25 basis points at its September meeting. ""A greater than expected jump in the unemployment rate would increase the risk of a 50 basis-point cut, and hence weigh on the New Zealand dollar,"" she said.",Dollar hits 7-month high against yen,2008-08-05,The Financial Times

Goldman Sachs' fourth-quarter loss of $2.1bn was the investment bank's first shortfall since going public in 1999, but was not as bad as some in the markets had feared. Meanwhile, the federal open market committee was widely expected to cut interest rates by at least 50 basis points from 1 per cent. Analysts said the key to the market's response would lie more in comments from the central bank on quantitative easing - a policy where the banking system is flooded with money to promote lending. US economic releases yesterday did little to undermine the view that interest rates were heading further towards zero. US consumer prices tumbled by 1.7 per cent last month - the largest drop since records began in 1947 - taking the annual rate of inflation down to 1.1 per cent, as commodity prices continued to plunge. ""With gasoline prices still falling, there is now a real chance that deflation could be a reality by the end of the year,"" said Paul Ashworth at Capital Economics. ""By the middle of next year inflation could be at minus 2 per cent."" Meanwhile, housing construction collapsed to a record level in November, heightening concerns about the potential depth of the US recession. The figures helped drive US government bond yields to fresh historic lows. The yield on the 30-year bond touched 2.91 per cent, the lowest for five decades, while the 10-year yield briefly fell to 2.47 per cent. A narrowing gap between the two and 10-year yields underscored investors' concerns about a protracted recession and a deflationary spiral. European government bonds also maintained a firmer tone, with the 10-year Bund yield down 7bp at 3.14 per cent and the 10-year UK gilt yield 6bp lower at 3.40 per cent. UK consumer price inflation fell by less than expected last month, but the markets paid little heed to the figures. ""This is very much yesterday's news regarding the problems facing the UK economy,"" said Howard Archer, chief UK and European economist at IHS Global Insight. ""Indeed, inflation seems set to plunge over the coming months."" On the currency markets , sterling steadied following its recent slide against the euro as the focus remained firmly on the dollar ahead of the FOMC decision. The US currency set a fresh two-month low against the single currency and hovered near a 13-year trough against the yen. The euro was helped by ECB president Jean-Claude Trichet's comment that eurozone interest rates could not be cut forever. ""President Trichet app-eared very marginally to restate the view that the ECB was not preparing for a further policy rate cut at its January 15 meeting,"" said Julian Callow, chief European economist at Barclays Capital. Goldman's earnings helped buoy financial stocks on both sides of the Atlantic, driving equity markets higher. By midday in New York, the S&P 500 was up 1.9 per cent, while the pan-European FTSE Eurofirst 300 index ended 0.9 per cent higher. But Asian bank stocks put in much less positive performances ahead of the Goldman results. In Tokyo, the Nikkei 225 average fell 1.1 per cent, while Australian shares shed 1 per cent. The better tone in equities allowed US and European cred it spreads to tighten. The iTraxx Europe index - a gauge of the cost of insuring against investment-grade companies defaulting on debt - dropped 9bp to 198bp while its US counterpart, the CDX North America index, fell 9.5bp to 254.5bp.

1032,538.0,1995-02-02,"The London market closed firmly yesterday, still awaiting news on interest rate policies from the meeting of the US Federal Reserve's Open Market Committee. Wall Street was 10 Dow points up as the UK market ended trading for the day, and the FT-SE 100-share Index showed a final gain of 25.7 at 3,017.3. Setting aside the uncertainty surrounding the FOMC meeting, the UK stock market looked confident, showing a gain of 32 points at the day's best. After opening firmly behind the generally good reception from world markets for President Clinton's new support plan for Mexico, UK equities received further encouragement from British government bonds. Bonds welcomed news of a fall in the January manufacturing index of the UK Purchasing Managers Association, which seemed to indicate slower economic growth and thus reduced pressure for higher base rates. Today, the UK chancellor of the exchequer and the governor of the Bank of England hold their regular discussions on interest rate policy. Corporate developments took a back seat in the early part of the trading session. Glaxo, with its trading statement now due, moved forward as investors looked for the next development in its #9bn plus bid for Wellcome, which also gained ground. Sandoz, the Swiss group, appeared to rule itself out as a possible white knight for Wellcome, strengthening the view that a new contender will prove hard to find. Utilities turned down, against the market trend, reacting sharply to reports that the electricity regulator would call for Trafalgar House to refloat 25% of Northern Electric's equity, should its bid succeed, in order to maintain regulatory influence. Such a move would have implications across the utility sectors, which are regarded as bid targets, but turnover in these stocks was not heavy yesterday. Bid speculation also returned to the merchant bank stocks, with investors not put off by recent bid denials. SG Warburg, regarded as in play since the collapse of its merger talks with Morgan Stanley, advanced, as did Kleinwort Benson, the merchant bank thought likely to attract interest. But the highlight of the day came when Vodafone, the cellular phone group which is one of the market's favourite growth stocks, said profits will fall short of market expectations. Heavy trading in Vodafone saw the shares lose ground sharply before rallying. Seaq trading volume, swollen by the late spurt in corporate activity, jumped to 616.4m shares from under 500m in the previous session. Tuesday's retail business was worth #1.15bn but recent trends in the marketplace suggest that good retail business overall has not spread across the full range of City firms. Turnover has been regularly swollen by large portfolio trades which tend to be handled by a select few of the larger houses. Hints of further staff cutbacks among London-based securities firms have begun to circulate once more. Yesterday, Nomura, the Japanese securities house, made severe cutbacks among its UK stock market staff. (c) The Financial Times Limited 1995.

1033,539.0,1995-02-02,"Tokyo Buying of dredging companies helped to sustain trade, and the Nikkei 225 average closed higher after moving in a narrow range, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. The index was ahead 89.65 at 18,739.47 after a low of 18,609.90 and high of 18,868.93. Share prices advanced in the morning on purchasing of construction related stocks and arbitrage buying. However, profit-taking by companies and individuals later eroded some of the gains. Volume came to 731m shares, against 838m. The Topix index of all first section stocks put on 0.30 at 1,464.14 and the Nikkei 300 edged up 0.04 to 268.85. Gainers led losers by 555 to 487, with 148 issues unchanged. In London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index was up 0.61 at 1,196.70. Arbitrage buying helped high-technology issues, which saw profit-taking by foreign investors on Tuesday. But expectations that export-orientated companies would be hit by a slowdown in the US economy prompted profit-taking later in the sector. Dredging shares fluctuated heavily on speculative activity: Penta-Ocean Construction, the day's most active issue, rose Y 13 to Y 946. The Tokyo stock exchange temporarily suspended trading in the stock in the afternoon following its climb above Y 1,000 for the first time since June 1992. Traders said the bulk of activity came from individual investors. Construction stocks headed the list of most actively traded issues. Aoki, however, ended unchanged at Y 695, while Toyo Construction gained Y 20 at Y 795. General contractors retreated on profit-taking, with Obayashi slipping Y 20 to Y 785. Some truck makers advanced on hopes of higher demand linked to the rebuilding of Kobe, the city damaged by last month's earthquake. Tokyu Car added Y 24 at Y 609 and Nippon Sharyo moved up Y 20 to Y 1,000. Banks, which had posted strong gains earlier in the week on reports of Sumitomo Bank's bad loan write-off, lost ground on profit-taking. Industrial Bank of Japan fell Y 40 to Y 2,630 and Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank Y 50 to Y 1,810. Electronic stocks rebounded. Hitachi gained Y 4 at Y 858 and Fujitsu Y 22 at Y 879. Consumer electronic maker Sony advanced Y 110 to Y 4,700 and Matsushita Electric Industrial rose Y 50 to Y 1,430. In Osaka, the OSE average put on 54.83 at 20,610.70 in volume of 123.9m shares. Roundup The region offered varying responses to US President Bill Clinton's new initiative on aid for Mexico. Hong Kong, Seoul, Taiwan, Singapore and Kuala Lumpur remained closed for the lunar new year holidays. MANILA welcomed the Clinton package with a 2.3% gain, the composite index climbing 56.76 to 2,476.88. Philippine Long Distance Telephone rose 50 pesos or 3.9% to 1,325 pesos, while Petron appreciated 1 peso or 5.7% to 18.50 pesos in the heaviest volume of the day.

B shares in another blue chip, Manila Electric (Meralco), rallied 10 pesos to 278 pesos after being badly hit by foreign selling over the previous week. BANGKOK rose on the prospect of a US interest rate increase at yesterday's FOMC meeting in Washington. The finance sector gained 2.4%, energy stocks 5.1% and banks 1.6% as the SET index put on 20.79 or 1.7% at 1,238.53 in 50.1m shares traded valued at Bt3.3bn, up from Bt1.7bn. KARACHI advanced 1.3% on short-covering, the KSE 100 index rising 23.82 to 1,810.75. Dealers also saw some buying in telecoms and synthetic fibre shares. BOMBAY reversed early gains on rumours that exchange officials had ordered some traders with large outstanding positions to reduce them. The BSE 30-share index finished 48.88 or 1.35% off at 3,569.66. COLOMBO's all-share index dropped 14.47 or 1.5% to 945.51 as turnover nearly doubled, from Rs 17.74m to Rs 33.3m.

1034,540.0,1995-02-02,"Eurobond issuance slowed to a trickle yesterday as investors waited for the expected rise in dollar interest rates from the meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee. Borrowers' attention has switched to minor currencies, which are less affected by changes in dollar rates. For instance, the European Investment Bank is believed to be entering the drachma sector with a floating-rate five-year bond. Yesterday saw developments in the peseta, Ecu and D-Mark sectors. The European Investment Bank brought a Pta25bn, three-year deal carrying an 11.2% coupon through book-runner Banco Santander de Negocios and joint lead UBS. The banks worked together on the EIB's Pta20bn offering last October and its increase in November. Yesterday's issue was sold in Switzerland and the Benelux region to retail investors. Commerzbank Overseas Finance used Commerzbank to bring a floating-rate issue in two tranches of DM 250m, over five and 10 years. The market-maker will be Commerzbank Financial Products (CFP), the bank's derivatives arm, which started operating in October. The coupon is reset each year and linked to an index of 10-year bonds. Mr Paul Mizrahi, head of interest rate derivatives at CFP, said this allowed investors to diversify portfolios while reducing volatility. He said the bonds were sold to retail and institutional investors in Germany, Austria and France. Commerzbank said this was the first DM bond with a coupon reset annually and linked to an index. There has been a market since 1986 in such bonds in France, where FFr 130bn worth have been issued. (c) The Financial Times Limited 1995.

1035,541.0,2005-03-23,"GLOBAL OVERVIEW By Dave Shellock The US Federal Reserve gave global financial markets exact ly what they wanted yesterday, raising the Fed funds rate by 25 basis points to 2.75 per cent and, more crucially, retaining its vow to keep its ""measured"" approach. The central bank also referred to more robust growth while hinting at greater concern about inflation risks. ""These discreet changes by the FOMC reflect the Fed's increasing concern over disrupting the liquidity of the US economy by pressing too hard on the brakes - at a time when the US engine risks facing obstacles from rising oil and from spillover effect from a GM downgrade,"" said Laidi Ashraf, chief currency analyst at MG Financial in New York. The rate rise - the seventh consecutive tightening - was widely expected and had been factored into share prices. Investors took the view that the wording of the accompanying statement implied a continuation of the Fed's modest quarter-point rate increases. However, Wall Street wobbled in the immediate aftermath of the announcement. The Dow Jones Industrial Average, up 0.4 per cent shortly before the news, fell briefly into negative territory before recovering to stand 0.1 per cent higher at 10,578. The S&P 500 was 0.2 per cent higher while the technology-heavy Nasdaq was up 0.3 per cent. European stock markets - which closed before the Fed delivered its statement - made modest progress, with the FTSE Eurofirst 300 index rising 0.2 per cent to 1,081.66.

1037,543.0,2005-03-23,"* Inflation fears prompt rise to 2.75 per cent * Further quarter-point moves expected * 10-year Treasury yield hits 8-month high The US Federal Reserve yesterday signalled increased concern about inflation, as it again raised interest rates by a quarter point to 2.75 per cent. The rise was widely expected, and the policymaking Federal Open Market Committee repeated in its statement that it expected to continue raising rates at a ""measured"" pace, generally interpreted to mean quarter point increases. But the central bank held out the possibility that it might have to move more aggressively to curb inflationary pressures, or at least to continue with quarter-point increases for longer than investors had been expecting. ""Though longer-term inflation expectations remain well contained, pressures on inflation have picked up in recent months and pricing power is more evident,"" the statement said. The FOMC said it saw the risks to growth and inflation as roughly equal. But, in contrast to its statement in January, it made clear that this judgment was based on ""appropriate monetary policy action"". The Fed also said output was expanding at a ""solid"" pace, a more upbeat assessment than its previous view of ""moderate"" growth, despite rising energy prices. Peter Hooper, chief US economist at Deutsche Bank, said: ""They got about as hawkish as they could without changing the key policy language. They are inclined to continue with 25 basis point increases, but wanted to reassure the market they would do more if necessary."" Bonds and stocks sold off on the announcement, with the yield on the 10- year Treasury note rising above 4.6 per cent, an eight-month high. The dollar strengthened against the euro and yen. Yesterday's rise was the seventh consecutive quarter-point move since the Fed started tightening policy in June. Each time, the Fed said it expected to continue raising rates ""at a pace that is likely to be measured"". Some Fed policymakers say the forward-looking guidance should be dropped altogether because it constrains their room for manoeuvre. While some regional Fed presidents have become increasingly concerned about inflation risks, others fear structural drags on growth from the trade deficit and the low savings rate might dampen the economy. Yesterday's statement made it clear that a shift to 50 basis point increases was more likely at this stage than a pause in tightening. The FOMC also repeated that after yesterday's move, the stance of monetary policy remained ""accommodative"". The so-called neutral or equilibrium federal funds rate - where monetary policy neither stimulates nor restricts the economy and is consistent with price stability - is typically described by policymakers in a range centred about 4 1/4 per cent over time. Data released since the February meeting have confirmed the Fed's bank consensus forecast of robust, above-trend growth this year. As confidence in the economy's strength has increased, Fed policymakers have turned their attention to inflation risks. While policymakers are confident continued rate increases will prevent inflation rising, at a time when strong growth is using up spare capacity and labour market slack there is greater sensitivity to inflation risks. The core producer price index, excluding food and energy, rose by 0.1 per cent last month, data out yesterday showed. It was below January's 0.8 per cent rise, but in the year to February, the core PPI was up by 2.7 per cent.

1040,546.0,2005-03-23,"The dollar rallied to a one-month high against the euro in European morning trade on Wednesday as the Federal Reserve made hawkish noises about monetary tightening and a key measure of the state of the German economy disappointed. As expected, the Federal Open Market Committee raised the Federal funds rate by 25 basis points to 2.75 per cent overnight, and reiterated its view that policy accommodation can be removed at a ""measured"" pace. But the FOMC warned that ""pressures on inflation have picked up in recent months and pricing power is more evident"", and said output was expanding at a ""solid"" pace, a more upbeat assessment than its previous view of ""moderate"" growth. The comments led to renewed speculation that the Fed, which has raised rates by 25 basis points at each of its last seven meetings, may decide to slip in a 50-point hike at some point - boosting yield support for the dollar by pushing Treasury yields higher, and potentially making dollar-funded carry trades more expensive. ""Although the measured reference was left intact, the Fed's increased inflationary vigilance coupled with a discreet upgrade in its growth assessment promise the cusp of further interest rate hikes along with the possibility of faster rate hikes,"" said Ashraf Laidi chief currency analyst at MG Financial. Monica Fan, global head of forex strategy at RBC Capital Markets, said the tightening cycle could now extend beyond January, with rates potentially exceeding RBC's forecast of 4 per cent by the year-end, although an acceleration in inflation would be needed to produce a 50-point rate hike. ""The risk to our year-end Fed fund forecast of 3.75 per cent is now clearly to the upside,"" added James Knightley, economist at ING Financial Markets. This sentiment allowed the dollar to strengthen to $1.3037 to the euro, 1.6c better than before the Fed statement, Y105.68 against the yen, Y0.6 better, $1.8794 against sterling, 1.85c better, and $0.7768 versus the Australian dollar, 1.4c better. The New Zealand dollar was particularly badly hit, falling 1.4c to $0.7255 as New Zealand's current account deficit widened to NZ$3.1bn in the fourth quarter, against expectations for NZ$2.4bn. The deficit equalled 6.4 per cent of GDP in 2004 as a whole. The euro's cause was not helped by the Ifo index of German business sentiment, which fell to 94 in March, from 95.4 in February, with the retail and manufacturing sectors both gloomier. The euro drifted Y0.3 to Y137.75 against the yen, although it held firm at GBP0.6933 against sterling. The pound was little affected by the release of the March monetary policy committee minutes, which showed the MPC voted by a 7-2 majority to keep interest rate on hold at 4.75 per cent. Despite the vote being narrower than of late, the consensus was that the minutes were broadly dovish. ""The minutes noted that for most members, the evidence on the two pivotal issues of consumer demand and inflation had not changed substantially since the February meeting. On balance, and given the slightly softer run of the data since this meeting, it is not clear that the next move from the MPC will necessarily be up, even if this is the direction that some committee members have been moving,"" said Rob Carnell, economist at ING Financial Markets. ""To judge by the largely dovish tone of these minutes, the doves are going to take considerable convincing if they are to flip and vote for a hike. 'Wait and see' remains the order of the day. Thus, the market will have to revisit their expectations for a hike, and the current sell-off in sterling has further to run,"" added Daragh Maher, senior forex strategist at Calyon.

1041,547.0,2005-03-23,"The Federal Reserve on Tuesday left the key policy language unchanged in its statement accompanying the latest quarter point increase in interest rates. But the policymaking Federal Open Market Committee sent the signal that it was alive to growing inflation risks and would act, as needed, to prevent accelerating inflation. ""This may be the beginning of the less friendly Federal Reserve,"" said Ethan Harris, chief US economist at Lehman Brothers. Speculation before the meeting had centred on whether the Fed would drop its forward-looking guidance that it expects to continue raising rates at a ""measured"" pace. Instead the committee maintained that assurance, generally seen as pointing to quarter point increases, while changing the rest of the statement, including more upbeat language on growth. The statement, which spoke of a pick-up in inflation pressures in recent months and more evident pricing power, echoed the Fed's recent Beige Book report that manufacturers were finding it easier to pass on higher commodity prices. While accelerating inflation is not an immediate danger, commodity price increases continue to feed into higher producer prices, compounded by pressure from a weaker dollar. The high oil price is seen as an inflation risk, in contrast to last year's concerns that it would sap growth. Modest increases in unit labour costs are not a reason to worry but the prospect that wages may pick up over the next year is a cause for vigilance. The wild-card is productivity growth, which is helping to keep a lid on inflation but may not continue to do so. While the Fed on Tuesday stuck with its judgment that the risks to the inflation and growth outlook remained balanced, it placed a new stress on the fact that this depended on ""appropriate monetary action"". For now the appropriate response is seen as continuing quarter point rises. The committee may have maintained the ""measured"" language so as not to signal a 50 basis point increase when it meets next in May. But it can be seen as a warning to investors to expect a longer tightening cycle. Some committee members have also expressed concerns about structural drags on growth, though Tuesday's statement confirmed that those worries have diminished. At some point, attention may also turn from removing what is seen as unnecessary policy ""accommodation"" from a still low 2.75 per cent federal funds rate to seeking to dampen growth at a time when spare capacity and labour market slack is being used up. ""If you are going to worry at all about inflation then you have to start restraining growth,"" Mr Harris said. When Alan Greenspan, Fed chairman, gave testimony on behalf of the committee last month, he expressed surprise that the yield on the 10-year Treasury bond was only 4 per cent, in spite of the Fed rate increases since last June. Since then the 10-year yield has risen to 4.5 per cent still low based on past experience, economists say. Tuesday's signal of a less friendly Fed was enough to push it above 4.6 per cent.

1042,548.0,1995-12-20,"US Treasury bonds rallied sharply yesterday after the Federal Reserve announced that it had cut the target short-term interest rate by 25 basis points, to 5 1/2%. Short term notes soared on news of the rate cut, while longer term bonds were not able to regain all the ground lost in Monday's sell-off. Late in the session, the benchmark 30-year Treasury was 1 1/4 higher at 110 11/32 to yield 6.110%, still below its levels of late Friday. At the short end of the market, however, two-year notes added 1/4 to 100 3/32, yielding 5.305%, well below the 5.356% they were yielding on Friday. Bonds began rising in the early afternoon before the Fed announcement, amid growing optimism that the Fed would move and that President Bill Clinton and Congress were making progress toward passage of a balanced budget agreement. The yield curve that maps the spread between two-year and 30-year bonds steepened by more than 4 basis points from its level of late Monday, as the short end of the market rallied. Initial reaction to the Fed's move was muted as some investors used the initial rise to take profits, according to Mr John Spinello, a government bonds strategist at Merrill Lynch. Bonds had seen a sharp sell-off on Monday as growing acrimony over the budget worried many investors that the Fed would not cut rates this month. Investors were still looking to Washington for indications of progress on a budget package. Mr Clinton and Congressional leaders began a negotiating session yesterday afternoon. European government bond markets were generally softer yesterday as dealers awaited news from the FOMC meeting in the US. There was no sign that the Fed funds rate would be lowered. Trading remained thin across the board as markets wound down for the long holiday break over Christmas and the new year. UK government bonds saw their spread over Germany widen slightly to 157 basis points from just under 150 basis points on Monday as several support levels were breached, causing technical selling in the futures market. Analysts said profit-taking was inevitable after the market's strong performance over past weeks. On Liffe, the March contract of the long gilt future fell 9/16 to 109 13/16 in modest volume of just over 50,000 lots. Some data scheduled for today are unlikely to provide the market with fresh direction. The market is expecting non-EU trade figures for November, which should show a deficit of #800m, provisional M4 data for November, expected to show a rise of 0.8% on the month and 8.7% on the year, and November net new commitments by building societies, forecast at #3.1bn. German government bonds recouped some of Monday's losses but still ended the day lower. On Liffe, the March bund future traded between a low of 98.14 and a high of 98.75 before settling down 0.19 points at 98.60 in volume of 141,000 contracts. (c) The Financial Times Limited 1995.

The index lost 170.59 at 19,140.49 after moving between 19,077.12 and 19,242.03. Worries over US shares prompted a fall in futures prices, triggering arbitrage unwinding. The delay over the solution for jusen, or housing loan companies, also eroded investor confidence. Volume was 370m shares, against 340.7m. Overseas investors sold high-technology shares, while investment trusts also unloaded holdings. However, domestic institutions were seen bargain hunting at lower levels, preventing a large sell-off. The Topix index of all first section stocks fell 11.54 to 1,520.12, while the Nikkei 300 shed 2.01 to 285.79. Declines outnumbered advances by 820 to 246, with 155 issues remaining unchanged. In London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index gained 5.02 at 1,320.38. High-technology issues were heavily sold: Hitachi dropped Y 22 to Y 968 and Toshiba Y 6 to Y 761. NEC declined Y 20 to Y 1,200 on rising fears of a slowdown of personal computer sales in the US, as well as a fall in semiconductor prices. Selling by foreigners also prompted profit-taking by domestic investors, who had actively bought the sector earlier in the year. Banks were mixed as negotiations over the jusen solution continued. Industrial Bank of Japan dipped Y 20 to Y 3,100, but Bank of Tokyo gained Y 10 at Y 1,750. Analysts do not expect shares to rise on an eventual solution, since the use of public funds in dealing with the housing loan companies' bad loans are already factored into share prices. Brokers, which had been bought on the rise in trading volume on the Tokyo stock market, were lower. Nomura Securities retreated Y 30 to Y 7,430 and Yamaichi Securities lost Y 20 to Y 700. In Osaka, the OSE average fell 170.43 to 20,588.80 in volume of 133.2m shares. Nintendo, the video game maker, gave up Y 170 to Y 7,770 and Rohm, the semiconductor maker, shed Y 260 to Y 5,530.

LG Semicon, an unlisted affiliate of the LG Group, bought 1.3m shares of Dacom from Korea Long-Term Credit Bank at Won280,100 per share. This sent LG shares up strongly. LG Electronics climbed Won1,500 to Won26,600 and LG climbed Won600 to Won11,300, both up the day's limit. Dacom closed limit down, falling Won7,500 to Won120,500. Korea Long-Term rose Won500 to Won23,300. HONG KONG finished 1% lower, but analysts suggested that the day's fall had purged the market of inflated expectations of a US rate cut following the FOMC meeting.

1044,550.0,2000-06-29,"The US Federal Reserve left interest rates unchanged yesterday but suggested further rate rises might be needed to curb inflation. In a statement accompanying the widely expected decision that followed a two-day meeting of the policy-setting Federal Open Market Committee, the Fed pointed to data suggesting economic growth was moderating towards a more sustainable pace. While underlying inflation had risen slightly, it said gains in productivity were continuing to contain price pressures. But it said these signs of slowing growth were ""still tentative and preliminary"". Referring to the continued tightness in the jobs market, the Fed said the committee believed ""the risks continue to be weighted mainly toward conditions that may generate heightened inflation pressures in the foreseeable future"". The Fed has raised rates by 1 3/4 percentage points since it began its current monetary tightening last year to put the benchmark federal funds rate at 6.5 per cent, its highest level in nine years. In May the Fed lifted the funds rate - the interest rate at which prime banks lend to each other overnight in the New York money market - by a half percentage point, the first time it had made a move of that magnitude in more than five years. However, the decision to leave rates unchanged yesterday does pose some risks for the Fed. The FOMC's next regular meeting is not until eight weeks' time. By then, the US presidential election campaign will be well under way and interest rate increases then could see the Fed becoming embroiled in the campaign.

1045,551.0,2000-06-29,"The dollar showed little reaction to the widely expected decision by the US Federal Reserve to leave interest rates unchanged yesterday. The decision follows a series of figures suggesting that the US economy is slowing. Durable goods orders from the US, however, released prior to the rate decision, cast some doubt on the notion of a rapid cooling of the US economy. But there was little reaction in the foreign exchange markets to the news. With activity minimal ahead of the FOMC decision, many analysts were focusing on the potential impact of Deutsche Telekom's bumper bond issue. Since the lion's share of the $15bn has been in US dollars, there has been speculation that some of the proceeds will be swapped back into euros - providing welcome support for the currency. But Ray Attrill, director of research at economic consultancy 4Cast, said the effect was far from certain. ""It is also quite possible that Deutsche Telekom will wish to keep the bulk of the money in dollars to provide for forays into the US market,"" he said. * Economists who charged the European Central Bank with being too aggressive several weeks ago in its 0.5 percentage point rate rise are now being forced to eat a little humble pie. Inflation data out of Europe provided ample retrospective justification for the move and may even warrant further action in the short term, analysts said yesterday. Most alarming was the rise in German import prices, which leaped into double figures. But the 2.7 per cent rise in Italian consumer prices for June also topped analysts' expectations. The figures had only a marginal effect on the euribor strip, the market's best guess of future interest rate movements. However many economists suspect that ECB claims that it had cleared the horizon for some time may have proved premature. ""The several month rate pause that many had expected after the last rise may end up being shorter than anticipated,"" said Ray Attrill, director of research at economic consultancy 4Cast. This could bode well for the euro, analysts said. Interest rates are back in the driving seat in the foreign exchange markets, said Avinash Persaud, global head of research at State Street, the Boston-based investment bank. ""As risk appetites recovered in May, the focus has changed in the foreign exchange markets from looking for safety to looking for value and yield,"" said Mr Persaud. ""Interest rate differentials have increased in importance as a determinant of foreign exchange movements."" He added that the differential between US and European rates now looked likely to narrow still further. * While the market is becoming ever more convinced of the cyclical arguments for a euro revival, yesterday's current account figures from the euro-zone offered a reminder of the structural barriers which remain. The net outflow of direct investment funds from the euro-zone, which hit Euros 149bn in 1999, has been cited as one of the main weights on the euro. For the first three months of the year, this trend appeared to have abated with a series of positive figures. But with the massive inflow arising Vodafone's takeover of Mannesmann now removed from the figures, the euro-zone once again has a direct investment deficit. According to yesterday's figures Euros 6.2bn of direct investment left the zone in April. The basic balance - a measure of the balance of payments which excludes short term flows - still looks negative for the euro, said Tony Norfield, global head of foreign exchange research at ABN Amro in London. ""In the first 4 months of the year the euro-zone ran a basic balance deficit of Euros 17.3bn, which may help explain why the recovery in the euro has not yet fully taken hold,"" he said.

The Fed's decision to leave rates unchanged came at 7.15pm, long after London closed for the day. ""The market has been spooked by worries over what the statement with the interest rate news will say,"" said one marketmaker. He insisted that there had once again been no really heavy selling pressure in the market, and that the institutions had simply shut up shop until the US decision was out of the way. The end of the second quarter on Friday was another factor inhibiting market operators. Already suffering from the long-standing interest rate jitters, London dipped further in the afternoon as the latest US economic data showed that durable goods orders rose 6 per cent in May, compared with a consensus forecast of 3 per cent. The market's super stocks, which carry enormous impact because of their weightings, were given a rough ride, driving the index sharply lower. Vodafone AirTouch, the UK's biggest stock by market capitalisation, accounted for more than 30 Footsie points. BP Amoco wiped another 13 points off the index, while Shell was similarly depressed as was BT and Cable &Wireless. By the end of the session the FTSE 100 was looking extremely weary, down 61.8 at 6,313.5, after 6,310.8. But the weakness in the heavyweight stocks did not extend across the board. There remained plenty of winners in the top 100 stocks, including many of the recently weak banks, and Freeserve, the internet service provider which was so badly damaged by the withdrawal of T-Online from bid negotiations. Dealers pointed out, however, that Schroder Salomon Smith Barney, which forecast the steep decline in Freeserve shares, had cut its price target again, down to 280p. The rest of the stock market was much better behaved. The FTSE 250 nudged up 5.3 to 6,578.4. The FTSE SmallCap eased 3.5 to 3,364.5 despite the emergence of a couple of bids.

The value of customer activity in London on Monday came out at #1.61bn, the lowest figure for six trading session, but still well ahead of average value figures in recent weeks. Trading volume was 623.3m shares. The impressive showing by the Dow Industrial Average on Monday - it rallied from being around 20 points lower at the opening to stand some 5 points up on balance by the close - gave initial encouragement to UK equities, prompting marketmakers to open prices moderately higher. The FT-SE 100 kicked off some 8 points firmer and maintained its good form for the rest of the morning session, sustained by a modest but constant stream of buying orders. The afternoon brought more good news from the US with the Dow Jones Industrial Average putting on more than 25 points shortly after the opening, and bonds moving in the right direction ahead of the auction of two-year Treasury bonds. Economic data from the US showing a lower than expected consumer confidence index had little impact on markets. There were no great surprises in the day's corporate news, although Brent International, the chemicals group, was a serious casualty, after announcing a steep decline in interim profits and a dividend cut. Utilities stocks staged a strong rally, shrugging off the threat of a one-off windfall profits tax to be imposed by the Labour party if they win the next general election, and instead responding to the ever present chances of more bids from home and abroad. Swalec, East Midlands and Seeboard were all put forward as takeover targets, while Manweb continued to reflect the probability that a bid for the company from PacifiCorp is just around the corner. Another suggestion in the market yesterday was that Harrisons &Crosfield, the diversified group, could be about to bid for building products group Meyer International.

1052,558.0,1995-09-27,"Hit futures prices. Tokyo Activity remained slack on the first trading day for October settlements, but share prices closed higher for the first time in five trading days on last minute technical buying, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. The Nikkei 225 average gained 355.55 or 2% at 17,921.98 after extremes of 17,595.32 and 17,921.98. Brokers, who had refrained from trading over the past week, resumed buying on the first trading day of settlements in the second half of the fiscal year. A rise in the futures market prompted arbitrage buying, and a last minute incursion by an overseas broker also helped the index. Volume totalled 220m shares, against 268m. The Topix index of all first section stocks rose 12.48 to 1,420.48 and the Nikkei 300 gained 2.88 or 1.1% at 266.29. Advances outscored declines by 648 to 349, with 176 issues unchanged. In London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index put on 4.72 at 1,218.02. In spite of the rise, traders expressed concern over large arbitrage positions. 'There are about 2.2bn shares in long arbitrage positions, and people are concerned about arbitrage unwinding,' said Mr Yasuo Ueki at Nikko Securities. Futures prices were hit briefly in the afternoon by an announcement by Daiwa Bank of its large losses stemming from bond trades. Trading of Daiwa Bank shares was suspended due to reports about its Y 110bn loss. Bank stocks were mixed. Industrial Bank of Japan rose Y 20 to Y 2,920 and Fuji Bank gained Y 30 at Y 2,140, but Sumitomo Bank fell Y 30 to Y 1,870. A rally in drugs shares in overnight trading on Wall Street triggered buying in the sector. Takeda Chemical rose Y 10 to Y 1,380 and Yamanouchi Pharmaceutical added Y 30 at Y 2,110. Brokers were higher on active buying, the sector rising 2.7%. Nomura Securities climbed Y 60 to Y 1,930 and Nikko Securities Y 69 to Y 1,030. High-technology stocks gained ground on buybacks. Semiconductor shares saw Advantest up Y 460 to Y 5,790 and Tokyo Electron Y 260 better at Y 4,300. Electronics makers advanced, with Sharp ahead Y 10 at Y 1,370 and Matsushita Electric Industrial appreciating Y 20 to Y 1,480. In Osaka, the OSE average moved up 89.58 to 19,165.42 in volume of 78.7m shares. Roundup Profit-taking left TAIPEI 1.3% down after Monday's 3.4% rally, but many brokers still saw a gradual uptrend developing. The weighted index receded 65.74 to 5,094.42. Turnover amounted to TDollars 44.2bn. Constructions and financials, which had impressive gains on Monday, were among the heaviest losers as profits were booked. Chang Ku Building, for instance, lost the daily maximum of 7% to TDollars 15.7 and Chinatrust suffered a drop of 90 cents to TDollars 40.7. HONG KONG decided that the market already reflected the consensus that the FOMC was unlikely to cut US rates later in the day and investors bought stocks selectively. The Hang Seng index picked up 85.46 to close at the day's high of 9,583.34 in turnover that improved to HKDollars 2.40bn. Brokers said the Hong Kong government's decision to put the brakes on its interest rate deregulation programme, after removing the cap on seven-day time deposits, was positive for banks. Hang Seng Bank moved ahead HKDollars 1.25 to HKDollars 64, Bank of East Asia gained 25 cents at HKDollars 24.70 and HSBC Holdings rose 50 cents to HKDollars 107. BOMBAY was again driven higher by widespread speculative buying triggered by expectations that carry-forward trading would be revived shortly. The BSE 30-share index ended 29.51 stronger at 3,518.11. Takeover activity brought a surge in Ahmedabad Electricity, up Rs 23 to Rs 140, after Bombay Dyeing and Manufacturing said that it would petition the central government against the Securities and Exchange Board of India's decision last week rejecting its bid for AEC. A rival bid by the Torrent group was given the go-ahead. Bajaj Auto jumped Rs 30 to Rs 836 on speculative and foreign fund buying, on expectations of sharply higher first-half profits. SEOUL paid minimal attention to news that the government had passed its 1996 budget plan and shares finished easier as the consolidation in blue chips outweighed a late rebound focused on large asset shares. The composite index ended 1.35 lower at 983.85. KUALA LUMPUR was softer as activity continued to be led by second-liners, and the composite index closed 1.26 down at 1,011.67. Promet picked up 2 cents to M$3.16 on speculation that a prominent corporate buyer was accumulating the shares. Dealers noted that the rumours had been reinforced by the sale of large blocks of 3m to 5m shares in off-market transactions recently. Shares in the Renong group, including Faber and United Engineers, were down on talk that a proposal for a rise in tolls for its north-south expressway had not been approved. Renong fell 18 cents to M$4.50, United Engineers lost 50 cents at M$16.50 and Faber shed 7 cents to M$2.32. SYDNEY closed slightly lower ahead of the US FOMC meeting. The All Ordinaries index was off 2.1 at 2,128.60 after trading in a narrow range throughout the session. Turnover came to A$427.8m. BHP again led the actives, in turnover of A$62.24m, as it declined 6 cents to A$18.14. MANILA remained nervous about the possibility that inflation was increasing, while a fall in a number of blue chip stocks left the composite index below the 2,700 support level, down 35.04 or 1.3% at 2,683.55. The index hit an intra-day low of 2,667.43 before recouping some of its loss. WELLINGTON was supported by some bargain hunting which lifted the market off the session's lows by the close. The NZSE-40 Capital index shed 5.48 to 2,092.46 as turnover nearly doubled, although most brokers forecast that the current consolidation phase would continue. (c) The Financial Times Limited 1995.

1053,559.0,1995-09-27,"Wall Street Blue chip shares slipped slightly and technology issues fell victim to a bigger sell-off in afternoon trading yesterday after the Federal Reserve's Open Market Committee concluded its meeting without lowering interest rates or issuing any statement, writes Lisa Bransten in New York. At the close the Dow Jones Industrial Average was 4.33 easier at 4,765.60, the more broadly based Standard &Poor's 500 lost 0.40 at 581.41 and the American Stock Exchange composite was down 1.85 at 542.53. New York SE volume came to 363.6m shares. Bonds moved higher in early trading after the Conference Board, a private economic think tank, said that its index of consumer confidence levels had fallen to 97.4 in September from 102. But in late trading, bonds were also mostly lower in the wake of the Fed's decision not to change monetary policy. Few economists believed that the Fed would lower interest rates at yesterday's FOMC meeting, but some expressed hope that the weak consumer confidence figures might spark the central bank to lower rates again in the near term. The technology-rich Nasdaq composite shed 8.10 to 1,038.05 and the Pacific Stock Exchange technology index slid more than 1% amid losses from some bellwether issues. Microsoft fell $2 to $88 1/4 and Dell Computers dropped $4 3/4 to $82 1/4. The Brooke Group gave up 18% or $2 1/8 to $9 1/4 to reverse most of the gain made yesterday and on Friday. The shares have more than doubled since late August, when New Valley, controlled by the Brooke Group, won permission from the Securities and Exchange Commission to acquire up to 15% of RJR Nabisco. Late last week, the shares rose again on speculation that RJR might try to take over the Brooke Group or offer to buy back its shares at a premium in order to prevent a takeover attempt. Norand plunged more than 50% or $17 3/8 to $17 1/4 after reporting that it had lost $6.8m in the fourth quarter, primarily because of irregularities in its Italian subsidiary. AMR, the parent company of American Airlines, fell $1 1/2 to $68 after the airline's baggage handling union voted against accepting a six-year contract. Biogen added $4 1/2 or 8% at $59 3/4 in the wake of news that a panel from the US Food and Drug Administration would meet to review a drug that the company was developing to treat multiple sclerosis. Canada Toronto stock prices closed flat for the second straight day, giving back early gains as the US Federal Reserve held its ground on interest rates. The TSE 300 composite index slipped 1.40 points to 4,519.90, while declining issues outnumbered advances by 425 to 366. Volume increased to 71.8m shares from Monday's 49.5m, while trading value was up to C$954m from C$678m. Stocks in both Canada and the US were up earlier in the session in quiet trading, as dealers stuck to the sidelines due to the Jewish Rosh Hashanah holiday and ahead of word from the Federal Open Market Committee meeting.

1054,560.0,1995-09-27,"Foreign exchanges yesterday enjoyed a further day of relative calm following the frenetic activity seen last week. Trading was clearly inhibited by the meeting of the policy making open market committee of the US Federal Reserve. Although there was little expectation of a rate change, the risk was sufficient to encourage caution on the part of traders. The central banks were again absent from the market, perhaps in part due to the outside chance of a cut in US interest rates. The dollar continued its rally off recent lows, finishing at DM 1.4413, from DM 1.4278, and Y 101.1, from Y 99.65. In New York it ended at DM 1.4377 and Y 100.87. In Europe the policy discussion about monetary union continued, with a steady stream of bankers and politicians entering the fray. Speaking in Berlin, Mr Helmut Kohl, the German chancellor, rejected any discussion of a delay in Emu, saying that the date and number of participants would be decided after a Maastricht-2 treaty had been agreed, probably in the first half of next year. The D-Mark continued to rally against the Swiss franc, but declined against other European currencies such as the French franc, Italian lira and Swedish krona. It finished at L1,115, from L1,133, against the lira, and at SKr4.865, from SKr4.920. The Swedish central bank was seen in the market supporting the krona. Sterling lost ground against the dollar, closing at $1.5689, from $1.5716, but was firmer against the D-Mark, finishing at DM 2.2612, from DM 2.2439. The message that emerges from the markets is that while last week's volatility is over for now, sentiment remains nervous, with the possibility of further turbulence not ruled out. Mr Jeremy Hawkins, chief economist at Bank of America in London, said: 'Sufficient damage has been done to Emu credibility that investors will be more cautious.' He said he suspected the equilibrium level of some European currencies had now changed, with investors likely to raise the risk premium required to hold them, and money market rates in these countries likely to rise. Mr Hawkins said that whereas the lira had looked like settling around L1,085 against the D-Mark, before last week's ructions, it now looked more likely to settle around L1,100 to L1,110. This view is endorsed by the economics team at Goldman Sachs in their latest Forex commentary, with the three and six-month forecasts for the lira adjusted to L1,100, from L1,080 and L1,090 previously. This view is not shared by Mr Lamberto Dini, the Italian prime minister, who said he thought the lira could 'return before long to the levels that it had before last week'. Mr Hawkins said that while a semblance of calm had returned to the markets, 'a sufficient chink in the Emu armour has been exposed that we probably will not return to the sort of quiet we had a few weeks ago'. A symptom of the easing currency tensions is the recovery of the D-Mark against the Swiss franc, assisted by comments from Mr Markus Lusser, president of the Swiss National Bank, that the franc was overvalued. Some analysts believe fair value is 85 to 90 centimes, compared to 81 now. With reasoning that is fairly typical of current market thinking, Goldman said it was now only 'modestly bullish' about the dollar over the next month or two. 'The lack of trade improvement, and of significant undervaluation, as well as a bumpy road for the efforts to reduce the budget deficit, suggest that the upside from here is limited.' It added: 'We do not view last week's sell-off as foreshadowing a renewed period of dollar weakness. Much has changed since the dollar's plunge in March. The US has indicated a renewed resolve to protect the value of the dollar; Japanese authorities have taken significant steps to break the yen bubble through massive intervention, monetary easing, and more fiscal stimulus in last week's supplementary budget; and interest rate surprises over the past few months have generally been in the dollar's favour.' The Bank of England provided #750m assistance towards clearing an #800m daily money market shortage. Three-month LIBOR eased to 6 25/32% from 6 13/16%. (c) The Financial Times Limited 1995.
